1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,500
He cut me open

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,500
and rewired my circuitry.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,270
Dean, we don't

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,270
medicate patients

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,270
to get the answers we want.

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,070
At the end of the day,

7
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,070
it's my word versus Neil's.

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,080
The guy who thinks

9
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,080
this whole thing

10
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,080
is a game of Tetris!

11
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,110
Enough. Dean, take a walk.

12
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,410
If I told Vanessa the truth,

13
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,410
that I'm her mother...

14
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,680
I don't know, Maggie,

15
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,680
once you take that step...

16
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,980
I know.

17
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,990
I got my interview

18
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,990
for Med's Nurse

19
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,990
Practitioner program today.

20
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,130
You forced me

21
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,130
into a procedure that

22
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,130
I am not supposed to do.

23
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,020
As a nurse practitioner,

24
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,020
I thought you'd welcome

25
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,020
the challenge.

26
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,600
How'd your

27
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,600
interview go?

28
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,600
Oh, my God!

29
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,030
Who gave

30
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,030
an unauthorized patient

31
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,030
our trial drug?

32
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,670
Me.

33
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,670
You realize you've

34
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,670
compromised the trial,

35
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,270
not to mention your career.

36
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,170
I stole meds

37
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,170
from Will's trial, and now,

38
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,170
my mom is dying in there,

39
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,640
and she needs

40
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,640
a new heart.

41
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,760
Hey, Nat...

42
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,050
Hey.

43
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,060
We found a donor heart

44
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,060
for your mom.

45
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,330
It's on the way.

46
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,590
Really?

47
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,590
Yeah.

48
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,370
But it's not perfect.

49
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,370
Come on, I'll explain.

50
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,370
So, the donor's a 50-year-old

51
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,370
woman, type AB like your mom,

52
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,450
and her thoracic cavity

53
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,450
was very similar in size.

54
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,570
Good.

55
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,680
There are issues.

56
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,310
The heart has already

57
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,310
been refused

58
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,580
for several recipients

59
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,580
by their physicians.

60
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,710
Why?

61
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,690
The organ has an intracardiac

62
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,690
tumor in the left ventricle.

63
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,160
Sarcoma?

64
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,160
No. Myxoma.

65
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,460
Benign. Okay, then,

66
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,460
you can remove the myxoma

67
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,300
before Dr. Latham implants

68
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,300
the heart. That's doable.

69
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,390
Yes, but there's

70
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,390
another issue.

71
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,630
The heart was harvested

72
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,630
in Los Angeles.

73
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,140
Now,

74
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,140
under normal circumstances,

75
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,140
by the time it arrived,

76
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,310
it would be outside

77
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,310
the window of viability.

78
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,140
Then why are we even

79
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,140
suggesting this?

80
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,310
Because of how

81
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,310
it's being transported.

82
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,470
Warm perfusion.

83
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,640
An experimental procedure,

84
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,640
still in its trial phase.

85
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,810
A machine

86
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,810
perfuses the donor heart

87
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,810
with warm blood.

88
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,110
Ergo the name.

89
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,520
Should prevent

90
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,520
tissue damage,

91
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,520
keep it functional.

92
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,620
"Should"?

93
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,670
You're already suggesting

94
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,670
a dicey heart that could

95
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,670
turn out to be useless.

96
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,760
We will apprise your mother

97
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,760
of all the risks.

98
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,730
But her blood type

99
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,730
is rare, Nat.

100
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,830
Even though

101
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,830
she's high on the list,

102
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,730
it'd be unlikely to find

103
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,730
a heart that matches.

104
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,860
Highly unlikely.

105
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,100
Okay.

106
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,180
Yeah, 70-year-old male,

107
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,180
Pavel Zorin,

108
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,310
came in last night,

109
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,610
minor injuries after

110
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,610
assaulting his landlord.

111
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,250
Claimed there were rats

112
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,250
in his apartment.

113
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,650
Agitated, combative,

114
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,650
probably delusional.

115
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,650
"Probably"?

116
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,790
Most of the time,

117
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,790
he was babbling in Russian,

118
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,120
no one around to translate.

119
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,390
When he came in,

120
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,390
he was clutching these.

121
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,190
Psych resident sedated him,

122
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,190
put him on a 72-hour hold,

123
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,670
now, they're just

124
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,670
taking him upstairs.

125
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,800
Lease, naturalization papers.

126
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,900
Bunch of old documents

127
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,900
in Russian.

128
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,330
Unfortunately,

129
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,330
my Cyrillic's a little rusty.

130
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm sure I can find

131
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,840
a translator for you.

132
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,880
I was actually thinking

133
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,880
about Mischa Lenkov.

134
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,170
Didn't he retire?

135
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,310
He's in the process of.

136
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,350
But something tells me

137
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,350
he'd wanna help out

138
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,350
a fellow countryman.

139
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,360
Let me give him a call.

140
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,360
All right.

141
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,520
On our way home,

142
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,520
we pass by that

143
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,520
Jamaican place.

144
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,290
Could pick up

145
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,290
some jerk chicken.

146
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,290
Sure.

147
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,870
Today's her last day here.

148
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,770
You're doing

149
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,770
the right thing, Mags.

150
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,370
You can't tell her.

151
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,410
I know.

152
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,210
I gotta go to work.

153
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,520
I will see you later.

154
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,520
Okay.

155
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,280
Hi.

156
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,500
Just one second, okay?

157
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,500
One second.

158
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,500
Are you ready, Mom?

159
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,430
Oh. This was my mother's.

160
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,540
And I want you to have it.

161
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,980
You're gonna be okay, Mom.

162
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,980
How about this?

163
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,580
I will keep it for you.

164
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,580
Okay.

165
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,710
Okay. Let's go.

166
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,460
I'm right here

167
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,460
with you, Mom.

168
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,460
Okay.

169
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,680
Thanks, guys.

170
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,680
All right. Thank you.

171
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,850
You okay?

172
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,880
Just one second.

173
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,880
I love you, Mom.

174
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,750
I love you.

175
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,420
Mmm.

176
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,300
There it is.

177
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,710
Nat. It's gonna

178
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,710
work out. Okay?

179
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,580
Okay.

180
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,650
Dr. Marcel,

181
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,650
Mrs. Conte is prepped.

182
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,750
Please start

183
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,750
on the myxoma.

184
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,750
Okay.

185
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,510
I'm so sorry for missing

186
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,510
yesterday's appointment.

187
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,080
I got caught up with a case.

188
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,080
I really appreciate you

189
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,080
seeing me today.

190
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,830
April, you're

191
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,830
a very good candidate

192
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,660
for our

193
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,660
Nurse Practitioner program.

194
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,330
And most of your

195
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,330
recommendations are excellent.

196
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,490
"Most"?

197
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,870
There was one...

198
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,870
What was the issue?

199
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,530
An ED doc had some concerns

200
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,530
about your judgment.

201
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,770
Look. Miss Scott,

202
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,770
I think I know who that is,

203
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,570
and I just want to say...

204
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,570
No need to explain, April.

205
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Trauma surgeons

206
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,440
can be a prickly bunch.

207
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,850
So, it was a trauma surgeon?

208
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,440
Let's put that aside.

209
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,550
I see that we've received

210
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,550
all of your transcripts,

211
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,920
so, I think I have

212
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,920
everything I need.

213
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,690
Apparently, the episode

214
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,690
was triggered when he saw

215
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,690
a rat in his apartment.

216
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,530
Yeah, Mr. Zorin

217
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,530
in September of 1980,

218
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,130
was committed to the Leningrad

219
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,130
Special Psychiatric Hospital.

220
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,960
"Special"?

221
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,960
So, what's that for?

222
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,910
For bigwigs?

223
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,910
For party members?

224
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,410
No, it's more likely

225
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,410
for a particular type

226
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,610
of mental illness.

227
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,850
It says here, he suffered

228
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,850
from... How would I say it?

229
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,850
Sluggish schizophrenia.

230
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,050
"Sluggish"?

231
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm not familiar with that

232
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,960
particular diagnosis. You?

233
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,050
Not really.

234
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,530
I've heard the term

235
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,530
back then, when I was

236
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,530
a psych resident in Moscow,

237
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,430
but sorry, I wish I could've

238
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,430
been more help.

239
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,770
Wait, Mischa, could you just

240
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,770
give me a few more minutes?

241
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,430
Help me talk to the patient?

242
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,640
Uh, Daniel, I...

243
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,640
Five minutes tops.

244
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,770
I just... I might

245
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,770
need a translator.

246
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,010
Mr. Zorin, I'm Dr. Charles.

247
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,010
And this is Dr. Lenkov.

248
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,110
How are you feeling?

249
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,780
Mr. Zorin, do you

250
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,780
understand me?

251
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,780
Do you speak English?

252
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,600
Mr. Zorin,

253
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,600
you're safe here.

254
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,010
You are absolutely

255
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,010
safe here.

256
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,200
Mischa!

257
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,770
Five of Haldol, please.

258
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,770
Got it.

259
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,460
Mischa, you all right?

260
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,740
Hey. Morning.

261
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,740
Morning.

262
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,880
Look, Dean,

263
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,880
we need to talk.

264
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,590
Uh-oh. Am I that late?

265
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,990
This is really tough,

266
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,990
but I've got serious concerns

267
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,990
about our working together.

268
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,590
Really? Why?

269
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,560
It's a lot of things.

270
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,260
Look, I know

271
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,260
we got off to a rocky start.

272
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,000
I take full responsibility

273
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,000
for that.

274
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,270
But I don't know,

275
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,010
I thought you and I

276
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,010
were in a good place, now.

277
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,240
Take yesterday,

278
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,240
for example.

279
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,040
The way you lied

280
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,040
to the patient.

281
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,750
Oh, come on, man.

282
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,750
I was just...

283
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,040
I was just trying

284
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,040
to establish a rapport,

285
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,040
so I could treat her.

286
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,520
There's nothing

287
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,520
in the Hippocratic Oath

288
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,520
says I can't do that.

289
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,610
That's just the latest.

290
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,150
Tell me something.

291
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,150
Is there something

292
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,150
going on with you, Ethan,

293
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,960
that I don't know about?

294
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,960
This is all

295
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,960
so out of the blue.

296
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,830
Don't do that.

297
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,830
Don't make this about me.

298
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,830
No.

299
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,660
'Cause you ambush me

300
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,660
right here, and you lay

301
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,660
this whole thing on me.

302
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,130
We were gonna have this

303
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,130
conversation somewhere.

304
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,000
I thought it'd be

305
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,000
better out here.

306
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,970
All right. I gotta be honest

307
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,970
with you, Ethan.

308
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,270
I'm getting a feeling here,

309
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,270
and I hope I'm wrong.

310
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,840
But maybe, you just

311
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,840
hired your old CO,

312
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,910
so you could knock him down

313
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,910
a few pegs, maybe?

314
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,640
That's not true,

315
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,640
and you know it.

316
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,640
Is it?

317
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,180
Tell me

318
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,180
it's not a game.

319
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,950
Here you are. Here I am.

320
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,950
You think that just happened?

321
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,250
Uh, you remember

322
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,250
Mr. Dietrich?

323
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,920
He's my patient

324
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,920
with appendicitis.

325
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,020
I do.

326
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,020
No, I wasn't sick.

327
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,230
I was about to wake up. I was

328
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,230
about to see the real world.

329
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,170
But then you NPCs

330
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,170
took the red pill out!

331
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,330
All we did was remove

332
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,330
your ruptured appendix.

333
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,830
Yeah. To save your life.

334
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,960
Yeah. More lies!

335
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,700
Hey, hey.

336
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,700
Take it easy, okay?

337
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,670
Let's talk about this.

338
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,670
Yeah, what's the point?

339
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,110
Everything that you say

340
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,110
is programmed.

341
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,910
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

342
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,910
Over here! I'm the one

343
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,910
who took out the red pill.

344
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,890
No, no, no, no, no.

345
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,890
But I'm the chief

346
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,890
of the ED, okay?

347
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm responsible

348
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,720
for everything

349
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,720
that happens there.

350
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,850
It doesn't matter, okay?

351
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,850
You're both the same!

352
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,250
But guess what?

353
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,250
I'm not ones and zeroes.

354
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,250
I'm real!

355
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,930
Okay.

356
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,930
And you're deleted.

357
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,610
Ethan! Ethan?

358
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,180
Maggie, I got a GSW

359
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,180
in staff parking. And another

360
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,180
person with head trauma.

361
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,380
I need two stretchers

362
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,380
and the rapid response team,

363
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,380
stat.

364
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,950
There's no exit wound.

365
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,950
The bullet's still in you.

366
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,170
How're you doing, Ethan?

367
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,170
Talk to me.

368
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm okay.

369
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,890
No, Ethan!

370
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,170
Dr. Archer,

371
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,170
Baghdad's ready.

372
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,170
Dr. Halstead!

373
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,770
I'm on it.

374
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,770
Hey, I'm right here. Okay?

375
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,070
I'm right here.

376
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,410
Ethan?

377
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,050
So, um...

378
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,720
what happened down there?

379
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,260
It's a hiatal hernia.

380
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,130
Acts up sometimes.

381
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,360
Oh. Really?

382
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,130
You know, I thought

383
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,130
maybe it had something

384
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,130
to do with something

385
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,370
that Mr. Zorin said.

386
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:59,180
Sometimes the stress

387
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:59,180
of dealing with a patient

388
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:59,180
can set it off.

389
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,810
What was that word

390
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,810
that he kept on repeating?

391
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,090
It's Russian slang for

392
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,090
a psychiatric hospital.

393
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,830
Huh.

394
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,830
And I'm guessing

395
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,830
that's where he developed

396
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,830
his phobia to rats.

397
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,970
So, rats in a hospital?

398
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,900
You have something stronger?

399
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,980
You sure that's a good idea?

400
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,980
I mean, for a hiatal hernia?

401
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,440
No. Of course not.

402
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,340
Oh, boy. You know what?

403
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,340
There's an emergency

404
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,340
down in the ER.

405
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,790
Sure.

406
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,790
Are you gonna be

407
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,790
all right?

408
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

409
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,990
You mind just waiting

410
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,990
a few more minutes

411
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,990
till I get back?

412
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,990
I just had a couple more

413
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,990
questions about the patient.

414
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,190
You know what?

415
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,790
I'll get you

416
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,790
some lansoprazole,

417
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,790
make you feel better.

418
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,800
All right?

419
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,800
Be right back.

420
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,730
Hang a unit of O blood

421
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,730
and trigger the MTP.

422
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,900
Satting at 85.

423
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,470
He's not protecting

424
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,470
his airway.

425
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,780
Start bagging. I'll intubate.

426
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,780
Twenty of etomidate,

427
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,780
100 of sux.

428
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,900
X-ray!

429
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,900
Coming.

430
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,040
Ethan, you're

431
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,040
gonna be all right.

432
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,050
Okay, I'm in.

433
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,990
BP 90/55. Heart rate 118.

434
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,990
Blood's going in.

435
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,250
Clear!

436
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,020
We have a left-side

437
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,020
hemothorax.

438
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,020
I'll put in a tube.

439
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,530
No, I'll do it.

440
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,540
Okay. Hang two more units

441
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,540
on the rapid transfuser.

442
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,480
BP 100/70. Heart rate 110.

443
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,050
Better.

444
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,050
Let's take him to CT.

445
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,090
Oh, my... What happened?

446
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,030
He got shot.

447
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,030
By this guy.

448
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,130
All right.

449
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,130
With me. Trauma 2.

450
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,470
Neil Dietrich, 25. GCS 13.

451
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,470
Suspected concussion.

452
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,270
They took

453
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,270
the red pill away!

454
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,570
You know he was here

455
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,570
a couple weeks ago, right?

456
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,030
Patient of Dr. Archer's.

457
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,030
I consulted on the case.

458
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,120
Completely delusional.

459
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,120
Thinks he's living in some

460
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,120
kinda computer simulation.

461
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,840
They took

462
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,840
the red pill away!

463
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,520
Image is lousy.

464
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,520
There's too much scatter

465
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,520
from the bullet.

466
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,820
We need an MRI.

467
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,320
No. Can't. The bullet is

468
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,320
pseudo-ferrous, it'll heat up.

469
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,360
We can assume

470
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,360
he's got a cord hematoma.

471
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,360
He needs surgery.

472
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,560
Hold on. A hematoma

473
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,560
may or may not

474
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,560
be a problem.

475
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,270
All right, look.

476
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,270
The bullet is near the cord.

477
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,430
This could be more than

478
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,430
just spinal shock.

479
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,070
Early decompression

480
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,070
is the right course

481
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,070
of action here.

482
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,200
What if you injure

483
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,200
the cord?

484
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,570
Create a CSF leak?

485
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,570
Then he's paralyzed.

486
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,470
Perfusion precautions

487
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,470
in the ICU,

488
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,480
hematoma could very well

489
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,480
resolve on its own.

490
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,110
Yeah. Unlikely. All right?

491
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,150
And I've spent a career

492
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,150
treating gunshot wounds.

493
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,950
I think my tenure in the ED

494
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,950
in Chicago gives me

495
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,950
some insight into GSWs.

496
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,290
Your animosity towards

497
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,290
Dr. Choi is well known.

498
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,560
You've resented his authority

499
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,560
ever since he was made chief.

500
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,860
I don't think you're

501
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,860
capable of making an impartial

502
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,860
clinical assessment.

503
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,940
Whatever my issues

504
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,940
with Ethan might be...

505
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,530
They aren't affecting

506
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,530
his clinical judgment.

507
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,230
As if you're in a position

508
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,230
to judge. I am taking him

509
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,230
into surgery!

510
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,310
Hey. Surgery is Neurosurg's

511
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,310
decision, not yours.

512
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,400
That's right.

513
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,040
Okay. Okay, fine.

514
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,990
Call Neurosurg.

515
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,990
But know this,

516
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,990
both of you,

517
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,320
that every minute

518
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,320
we delay surgery

519
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,320
puts Dr. Choi at greater risk.

520
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,530
Mischa, I am so sorry.

521
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,260
Dr. Marcel, I have a patient

522
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,260
on bypass, her chest is open.

523
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,260
Where is my heart?

524
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,220
Dr. Latham,

525
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,220
I thought I mentioned

526
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,060
the myxoma invaded

527
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,060
the anterior mitral leaflet.

528
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,990
Yes, but the clock

529
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,990
is ticking.

530
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,990
How much longer?

531
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,120
Hold on.

532
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,310
Dr. Marcel?

533
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,310
I'm still repairing

534
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,310
the leaflet.

535
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,580
Okay, here we go.

536
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,710
It's all yours.

537
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,010
Let's proceed.

538
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,010
Okay. Thank you.

539
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,050
Where would you

540
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,050
like to begin?

541
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,110
Well, on... Okay.

542
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,180
All right.

543
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,180
Lighten his sedation.

544
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,460
Ethan, can you hear me?

545
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,180
Ethan?

546
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,170
Ethan, this is Sam.

547
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,170
Can you blink your eyes?

548
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,130
Ethan, can you blink?

549
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,100
Okay, good.

550
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,310
Can you wiggle

551
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,310
your toes?

552
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,780
Ethan. Come on.

553
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,780
Try to wiggle your toes.

554
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,210
Okay.

555
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,200
Ah, it's clear

556
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,200
there's weakness

557
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,200
in his lower extremities.

558
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,100
Perhaps my input's

559
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,100
not needed.

560
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,220
Sam, what do you suggest?

561
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,570
If we don't take him

562
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,570
to be operated on

563
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,570
as soon as possible,

564
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,230
then it'll only get worse.

565
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,770
Why don't I just go home?

566
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,510
Laminectomy, right?

567
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,710
Yes. Laminectomy.

568
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,610
Maggie, would you please

569
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,610
open the Hybrid OR?

570
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,480
Unless you want

571
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,480
to take him upstairs.

572
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,380
It's better for the patient

573
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,380
to avoid the trip.

574
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,380
Hybrid OR will do.

575
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,590
Where is he?

576
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,590
Treatment 5.

577
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,460
Mischa!

578
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,470
He was found in the parking

579
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,470
garage, seems to have fallen

580
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,470
down the stairs.

581
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,510
Respiration's ten.

582
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,510
Smells of alcohol.

583
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,410
He lose consciousness?

584
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,410
Can't say, but you see

585
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,410
the head injury.

586
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,310
Mischa, can you tell me

587
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,310
what happened?

588
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,780
Mischa, can you hear me?

589
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,780
Do you know where you are?

590
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,370
We need to clear

591
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,370
his C-Spine.

592
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,450
Leave the collar on.

593
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,450
Send him up for a head

594
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,450
and neck CT.

595
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,680
Hang in there, buddy.

596
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,680
We're gonna get you

597
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,680
all fixed up, okay?

598
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,350
Bullet's accessible.

599
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,220
I just heard about Ethan.

600
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,220
How's he doing?

601
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,350
Yeah, they got the bullet.

602
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,130
Hematoma's minimal.

603
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,130
You can close.

604
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,430
Oh. Hold on.

605
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,430
There are retropulsed

606
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,430
bone fragments.

607
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,690
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

608
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,530
But we need to extract them.

609
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
Spine's decompressed,

610
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
that's all we need to do.

611
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,860
Any damage from the fragments

612
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,860
has already been done,

613
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,570
and we'll only make

614
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,570
things worse

615
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,570
going after them.

616
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,240
No, no. Listen.

617
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,240
We're here, we're open.

618
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,840
Let's find

619
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,840
the fragments and then

620
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,840
we'll fuse the spine.

621
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,620
That's a longer, riskier,

622
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,620
more invasive surgery.

623
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
But it will allow Ethan

624
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
to begin the recovery

625
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
process immediately.

626
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,550
Yeah, if he isn't paralyzed.

627
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,720
Chasing bone fragments

628
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,720
is more dangerous

629
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,720
than it's worth.

630
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,660
Dr. Abrams

631
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,660
makes a good point.

632
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,890
That is so distracting.

633
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,890
Would you turn

634
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,890
that off, please?

635
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,720
You should close

636
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,720
him and start...

637
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,260
Damn it.

638
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,340
Maybe Ethan needs

639
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,340
a neurosurgeon who's more

640
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,340
confident in his abilities.

641
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,690
That person doesn't exist.

642
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,630
Well, then...

643
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,540
What do we know

644
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,540
about Dr. Choi?

645
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,310
He's still in surgery.

646
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,480
Okay. Listen, um,

647
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,480
he emailed me last night

648
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,820
and said from among

649
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,820
the med students

650
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,820
auditioning,

651
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,590
he decided to go with

652
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,590
Vanessa Taylor to come back

653
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,590
and rotate in the ED.

654
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,920
Oh.

655
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,920
At first, I thought

656
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,920
about quashing it,

657
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,220
but then that wouldn't

658
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,220
be fair to Miss Taylor.

659
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,390
No.

660
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,900
I take it, you haven't

661
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,900
told her who you are?

662
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,170
Good. I'm counting on your

663
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,170
professionalism to treat her

664
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,170
like any other med student.

665
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,400
Absolutely.

666
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,400
I mean it, Maggie.

667
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,240
No favoritism.

668
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,240
No special treatment.

669
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,280
Dr. Virani, a word please?

670
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,380
Of course.

671
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,320
How are you feeling?

672
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,320
Terrible.

673
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,730
Well, I mean,

674
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,400
you did drink almost

675
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,400
800 milliliters

676
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,400
of 90-proof whiskey.

677
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,860
I'm so sorry about

678
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,860
the whiskey. I normally

679
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,860
don't drink that much.

680
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,970
Look, I'm sorry, again,

681
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,970
for dashing out

682
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,970
on you like that.

683
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,440
Leave you hanging

684
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,440
for so long.

685
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,520
But it turns out

686
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,520
that a member of

687
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,520
our staff was shot

688
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,250
by a delusional patient.

689
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,850
Yeah, he's in surgery now.

690
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,880
Oh, my God.

691
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,590
Mischa. Here's what you

692
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,590
can do for me. All right?

693
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,260
You can tell an old friend.

694
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,260
What's really going on here?

695
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:18,600
Your Mr. Zorin

696
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:18,600
was never psychotic.

697
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,610
And the worst thing you can do

698
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,610
for him is confine him

699
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,610
to the psychiatric ward.

700
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,710
Do you know him?

701
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,710
No, not personally.

702
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,910
But I have known

703
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,910
others like him.

704
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:38,020
The sluggish

705
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:38,020
schizophrenia

706
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:38,020
is a phony diagnosis,

707
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,420
which was given

708
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,420
to political dissidents

709
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,500
in order to incarcerate them.

710
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,770
And special psychiatric

711
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,770
hospitals were nothing

712
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,770
more than prisons.

713
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,440
Awful places.

714
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,770
And that's why Mr. Zorin

715
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,770
reacted so violently

716
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,940
when he woke up

717
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,940
and realized where he was.

718
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,810
His worst nightmare.

719
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,380
In the Soviet Union,

720
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,380
psychiatry was weaponized.

721
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,010
It was used to punish.

722
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,390
So, Mischa, were you

723
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,390
already practicing

724
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,390
at this point?

725
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,300
You're asking,

726
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,300
did I participate?

727
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,060
You can't understand...

728
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,890
That we were trained

729
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,910
that Soviet Union was the most

730
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,910
perfect form of government.

731
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,610
And if someone was against it,

732
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,610
they had to be insane.

733
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,780
Political deviance was

734
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,780
a failure to grasp reality.

735
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,080
Oh.

736
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,750
I mean, still, though.

737
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,750
That must have been

738
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,750
very difficult.

739
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,390
It was a different world.

740
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,390
And...

741
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,460
It's like this man

742
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,460
who shot your colleague.

743
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,690
We were all delusional.

744
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,370
The heart is in place.

745
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,880
Okay. Steroid.

746
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,070
Dosing...

747
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,750
Remove the cross clamp.

748
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,110
Okay.

749
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,420
It's not beating.

750
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,860
Give it a moment.

751
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,800
I need to step out.

752
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,480
Come on.

753
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,850
Hey. She's good.

754
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,930
We were able

755
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,930
to pace the heart.

756
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,630
And once we got

757
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,630
it jumpstarted,

758
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,630
it continued on its own.

759
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh, my God.

760
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,570
Yeah,

761
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,570
contractions were good.

762
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,470
The repaired mitral valve

763
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,470
is working well.

764
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,470
She's gonna be okay.

765
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,940
They're closing up now.

766
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,710
Crockett, thank you.

767
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,710
Thank you.

768
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,710
Yeah.

769
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,470
Oh, God.

770
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,580
I wasn't fair to you.

771
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,430
I wasn't fair

772
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,430
and I wasn't honest.

773
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,630
Look, I understand

774
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,630
why you kept me out.

775
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,800
I just wish you felt

776
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,800
you could've trusted me.

777
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,200
How's that for irony?

778
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,110
I was always talking to you

779
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,110
about commitment,

780
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,110
that you needed to trust.

781
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,840
Yeah.

782
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,850
Look, Natalie,

783
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,850
I want you to know,

784
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,120
regardless of everything,

785
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,060
I'll always be

786
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,060
grateful to you.

787
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,790
Why?

788
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,460
Well, my life

789
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,460
was pretty empty

790
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,460
till I met you.

791
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,730
It was closed off.

792
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,730
Lot of fears.

793
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,910
You showed me

794
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,910
what could be.

795
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,980
How to take a chance.

796
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,690
Any news?

797
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,860
Still too soon.

798
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,760
Everything all right?

799
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,760
With Goodwin?

800
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,860
BP 90/48.

801
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,570
Heart rate 50.

802
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,240
Eighty-five over 42.

803
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,240
Heart rate 45.

804
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,240
He's in shock.

805
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,130
Betty, what's going on?

806
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,130
We haven't lost any blood.

807
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,940
Oh, God.

808
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,940
I didn't give him

809
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,940
anything different.

810
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,710
It's not a reaction

811
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,710
to the meds.

812
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,840
Volume status?

813
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,840
Good. And he was

814
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,840
ventilating fine.

815
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,580
It's not cardiac

816
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,580
or pulmonary.

817
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,080
Ventral and lateral cord

818
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,080
is well-decompressed.

819
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,080
No active bleeding.

820
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,250
It's neurogenic shock.

821
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,250
Something must be pushing

822
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,250
on the cord ventrally.

823
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,530
Eighty-one over 40.

824
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,530
Heart rate 39.

825
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,790
Betty, up his

826
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,790
meds and pressors.

827
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,890
On it.

828
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,890
Get the paddles ready,

829
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,890
in case he codes.

830
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,170
Heart rate's

831
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,170
down to 35.

832
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,170
Ah. He's bradycardic.

833
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,030
Dean's brilliant idea

834
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,030
is gonna kill Ethan.

835
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,600
Dopamine drip.

836
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,600
Riluzole 50 milligrams

837
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,600
down the NG tube,

838
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,760
and start

839
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,760
the Solu-Medrol protocol.

840
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,860
Yeah, you need to decompress

841
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,860
the other side of the spine.

842
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,200
I know what I need to do.

843
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,900
Still falling.

844
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,150
Seventy-three over 39.

845
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,150
Heart rate 33.

846
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,240
Damn it.

847
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,980
Rod distractor

848
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,980
and set screwdriver.

849
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,180
Distracting the spine now.

850
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,660
He's gonna code any second.

851
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,920
Done.

852
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,760
Vitals improving.

853
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,000
Ninety over 55,

854
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,000
heart rate 43.

855
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,010
Now 110/65. Heart rate 60.

856
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,010
Drill.

857
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,010
Get the second rod in

858
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,010
and then you can close.

859
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,580
I'll need O-Maxons

860
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,580
and a large needle driver.

861
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,180
There. It all worked out.

862
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,150
They did it.

863
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,920
And?

864
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,920
He pulled through.

865
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,620
Thank God.

866
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,620
Yeah.

867
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,030
This day.

868
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,140
I gotta see Ms. Goodwin.

869
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,140
I'll be right back.

870
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,380
It's my understanding that

871
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,380
you took drugs from the trial

872
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,940
and gave them

873
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,940
to Dr. Manning's mother

874
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,940
without authorization.

875
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,850
That's correct.

876
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,850
As a result, Dr. Halstead,

877
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,690
Kender has pulled the trial

878
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,690
from this hospital,

879
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,950
which you know has major

880
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,950
financial implications.

881
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,990
There's the immediate

882
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,990
loss of revenue, of course,

883
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,000
but it's also safe

884
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,000
to assume that Kender

885
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,000
will be reluctant

886
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,000
to run trials

887
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,000
here in the future.

888
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,640
You have anything to say?

889
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,340
Ms. Goodwin, I was

890
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,340
trying to help a patient

891
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,340
in desperate need.

892
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,650
At the expense

893
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,650
of the trial

894
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,410
and all the other patients

895
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,410
that might benefit from it.

896
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,020
You know, you asked me

897
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,020
last summer why I didn't

898
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,020
name you as chief of the ED.

899
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,290
And it's precisely

900
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,290
this kind of

901
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,290
reckless behavior

902
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,730
that at this point,

903
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,730
I have no choice

904
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,730
but to address.

905
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
You're fired, Dr. Halstead.

906
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,060
Heard you're gonna be

907
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,060
joining us. Congratulations.

908
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,230
Thank you.

909
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,860
Believe me, you're

910
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,860
gonna get an education.

911
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,960
Congratulations,

912
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,960
Vanessa.

913
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,960
I know. Thank you.

914
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,140
I heard. Congratulations.

915
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,140
Thank you.

916
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,180
Um, we need to talk.

917
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,280
After work?

918
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,280
Okay.

919
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,020
Ethan.

920
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,990
Hi.

921
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,990
April.

922
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,860
How you doing?

923
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,860
Okay.

924
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,340
You would

925
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,340
say that if you were lying

926
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,340
on a bed of nails.

927
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,440
The bullet

928
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,440
was lodged at T6.

929
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,420
You had a laminectomy.

930
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,920
Dr. Archer insisted

931
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,920
on a corpectomy

932
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,920
to remove bone fragments,

933
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,250
and it was

934
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,250
the right call.

935
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,290
They say you'll need PT,

936
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,760
but that eventually,

937
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,760
you'll have a very

938
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,760
good outcome.

939
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,840
Ethan,

940
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,010
ever since

941
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,010
you and I broke up,

942
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,850
I've tried really,

943
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,850
really hard

944
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,850
to move on from us.

945
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,160
But seeing you brought in

946
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,160
this morning on that gurney,

947
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,360
everything just

948
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,360
came back to me.

949
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,140
Just how much I love you.

950
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,850
Come in.

951
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,850
Ms. Goodwin?

952
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,850
Dr. Archer,

953
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,190
I understand

954
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,190
you did yeoman's work,

955
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,190
treating Dr. Choi today.

956
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,300
Oh, I just did what

957
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,300
I thought he'd want.

958
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,440
I assume he'll have

959
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,440
a protracted convalescence.

960
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,470
When Dr. Choi hired you,

961
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,470
he sang your praises.

962
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,570
He had great faith

963
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,570
in your abilities.

964
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,180
And everything

965
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,180
that I've seen lately

966
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,180
only supports that.

967
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,370
So, if you're willing,

968
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,560
I'd like to name you

969
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,560
Interim Chief of the ED,

970
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,060
until Dr. Choi

971
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,060
can resume his duties.

972
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,000
Uh, well,

973
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,060
I'd be honored

974
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,060
and, uh, I'll do my best to

975
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,900
maintain the standards

976
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,900
he's set.

977
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,970
Good.

978
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,970
I think he'd be pleased.

979
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,440
Yeah. Thank you. Thanks.

980
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,310
It doesn't matter what

981
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,310
happens or where you take me.

982
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,310
Okay? It's all fake.

983
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,580
My real body is floating

984
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,580
in a tank, drugged,

985
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,920
interfacing with

986
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,920
the master computer.

987
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,120
Are you listening to me?

988
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,120
How did we get here?

989
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,490
There's just so many

990
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,490
troubled, lost souls.

991
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,910
Mischa, you remember

992
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,910
the delusional patient

993
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,910
I was telling you about?

994
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,210
You know, the one

995
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,210
who shot my colleague?

996
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,210
Yes?

997
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,280
You compared yourself

998
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,280
to him,

999
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,080
saying that living in

1000
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,080
the Soviet Union was like

1001
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,080
living in a different reality.

1002
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,210
Mmm-hmm.

1003
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,210
Right? And I was thinking,

1004
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,690
the difference is,

1005
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,690
is that this guy,

1006
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,390
I mean, he's insane.

1007
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,390
He's clinically delusional.

1008
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,960
Whereas,

1009
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,960
you and your colleagues...

1010
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,990
Daniel, why do you

1011
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,990
torture me with this?

1012
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,290
Mischa, I'm so sorry.

1013
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,290
That's not at all

1014
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,290
my intention.

1015
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,330
I'm actually trying to

1016
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,330
figure out a way that

1017
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,330
we might help Mr. Zorin.

1018
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,000
"We"? How can I possibly

1019
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,000
help this poor man?

1020
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,100
You know what?

1021
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,580
I think that you might be

1022
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,580
ideally suited to the task.

1023
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,270
I think

1024
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,270
these were a mistake.

1025
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,270
Let's get them off.

1026
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,270
April, this just

1027
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,270
came in for you.

1028
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,710
From the NP

1029
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,710
Admissions Department.

1030
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,710
Yeah.

1031
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,250
Oh, boy. Okay.

1032
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,260
I got accepted. Yes!

1033
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,260
Of course you did.

1034
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,550
How about that?

1035
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,770
Hey.

1036
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,380
Listen, I love my parents.

1037
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,510
They're caring,

1038
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,510
wonderful people.

1039
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,320
They adopted me

1040
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,320
when I was an infant.

1041
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,780
But you know that.

1042
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,350
Yeah,

1043
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,720
I kept wondering

1044
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,720
why you were

1045
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,720
so interested in me,

1046
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,700
why you would look

1047
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,700
at me the way

1048
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,700
that you do.

1049
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,470
You know, my parents,

1050
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,270
they always said to me

1051
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,270
that they would help me

1052
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,270
find my birth mother,

1053
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,280
but I wasn't interested.

1054
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
I was happy. What would

1055
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
have been the point?

1056
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,750
Anyways, it, um...

1057
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,790
It wasn't difficult for me

1058
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,790
to find out who you were.

1059
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,150
Oh, Vanessa, I was just...

1060
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,700
I've worked my whole life

1061
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,700
to get where I am.

1062
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,360
If anybody thought I was

1063
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,360
accepted here just because

1064
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,360
I'm your daughter...

1065
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,490
I... No.

1066
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,870
That was entirely on

1067
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,870
your own merit. Honestly.

1068
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,800
I had nothing

1069
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,800
to do with it.

1070
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,800
I hope so.

1071
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,780
Because I'm not going

1072
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,780
to give up this opportunity.

1073
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,910
You shouldn't.

1074
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,910
There's no reason to.

1075
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,850
I don't want anyone

1076
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,850
to know about us.

1077
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,650
Of course, and...

1078
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,860
They won't.

1079
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,440
What did you want, Maggie?

1080
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,640
I just...

1081
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,640
I wanted to meet you.

1082
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,610
It wasn't right.

1083
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,910
You coming

1084
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,910
into my life like this.

1085
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,880
It just wasn't right.

1086
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,880
I know. I...

1087
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,690
Mom.

1088
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,690
Oh, Natalie.

1089
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,200
Hi.

1090
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,630
Am I alive?

1091
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,370
Yes.

1092
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,370
You are alive.

1093
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,670
And you are gonna live

1094
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,670
for a long, long time.

1095
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,340
Thank you.

1096
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,320
Who was that?

1097
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,950
He is the best CT surgeon

1098
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,950
in Chicago.

1099
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,960
Wow.

1100
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,960
Mmm.

1101
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,390
Hey, Carol. You did great.

1102
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,390
Nat, can I see you a sec?

1103
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,940
Sure. Mom, I'll be

1104
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,940
right back, okay?

1105
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,940
Yeah.

1106
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,400
Okay.

1107
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,670
It's about Will.

1108
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,340
What about him?

1109
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,880
Goodwin fired you?

1110
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,450
Just let it go, Nat.

1111
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,450
Because of my mom's pills?

1112
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,550
Will, did you tell her

1113
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,550
you took them?

1114
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,260
Answer me!

1115
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,260
I had to.

1116
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,690
Why?

1117
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,300
It's everything.

1118
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,300
Everything we've been through.

1119
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,430
Everything we've been

1120
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,430
to each other.

1121
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,430
What else could I do?

1122
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,980
Tell the truth!

1123
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,550
No, I think a change

1124
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,550
will do me good.

1125
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,410
No, Will. I'm sorry.

1126
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,410
I cannot let you do this.

1127
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,460
Nat, I'm okay. Really.

1128
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,580
Will, please, don't do this.

1129
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,660
It's done, Nat. So...

1130
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,430
It's done.

1131
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,460
Hey.

1132
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,710
You up for

1133
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,710
a little visit?

1134
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,350
Yes, ma'am.

1135
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,080
No. Please don't.

1136
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,990
You know,

1137
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,990
when I saw you

1138
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,990
get shot this morning,

1139
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,960
I immediately thought,

1140
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,960
"hate crime."

1141
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,790
And I've since learned

1142
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,790
that wasn't the case.

1143
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,590
No.

1144
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,490
But that's exactly

1145
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,490
where my mind went.

1146
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,400
This has been

1147
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,400
a difficult year.

1148
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,040
The madness,

1149
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,040
the heartache.

1150
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,480
I have to admit, Dr. Choi,

1151
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,620
I'm a little bit

1152
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,620
shell-shocked.

1153
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,350
I know.

1154
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,460
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

1155
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,570
Well, I'll let you rest.

1156
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,760
You need to heal.

1157
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,700
We all do.

1158
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,500
Ms. Goodwin?

1159
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,470
Mmm-hmm?

1160
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,980
I may be down,

1161
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,980
but I'm gonna get back up.

1162
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,890
I'm counting on that,

1163
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,890
Dr. Choi.

1164
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,090
I'm counting on that.

1165
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,510
Ms. Goodwin?

1166
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,510
Yeah?

1167
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,140
You have got to

1168
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,140
reinstate Dr. Halstead.

1169
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,580
Dr. Manning, I realize

1170
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,580
that you two are close...

1171
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,420
No, you don't understand.

1172
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,990
I was the one

1173
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,990
who stole the trial meds

1174
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,990
for my mom.

1175
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,960
I am the reason the trial

1176
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,960
was canceled. Not Will.

1177
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,860
He said that to protect me.
