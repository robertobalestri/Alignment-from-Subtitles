1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,400
Auggie has a brother

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,400
in California.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,230
We can't tell you what

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,230
this means to Keshawn.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,310
We can fly out,

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,310
so the boys can meet.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,140
A chemical pregnancy?

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,670
Does your mom know?

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,970
God, no. And please

10
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,970
don't tell her.

11
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,050
He's had surgery.

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,250
I realize I shouldn't

13
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,250
have come back so soon.

14
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,340
Why do you think

15
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,340
you did that?

16
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,010
I'm the chief

17
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,010
of the ED. I have

18
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,010
a greater responsibility.

19
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,150
It's often the people

20
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,150
who are the very best,

21
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,730
who feel

22
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,730
the most inadequate.

23
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,760
Wouldn't do that

24
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,760
if I were you.

25
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,000
Dr. Choi.

26
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,540
Just had to warn you.

28
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,540
You're leaving

29
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,540
your rook exposed.

30
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,740
I know. I'm attempting

31
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,740
a gambit.

32
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,100
Once he takes my rook...

33
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,770
Knight F six!

34
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,010
Then you've got mate

35
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,010
in three. Well done.

36
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,240
I promise, I don't spend

37
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,240
all day playing games.

38
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,380
Hey, as far as vices go,

39
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,380
online Chess isn't so bad.

40
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,460
Good morning, Dr. Virani.

41
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,460
Hello.

42
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,250
Dr. Choi, a word?

43
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,250
Sure. Excuse us.

44
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,790
You know, you still haven't

45
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,790
sent me your top candidates

46
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,390
for the new ED position.

47
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,490
Right.

48
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,690
After your collapse

49
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,690
last week,

50
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,200
we both agreed

51
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,200
you needed to

52
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,200
lighten your load.

53
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,570
And I'm gonna hire someone.

54
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,200
I just haven't found

55
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,200
the perfect fit yet.

56
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,110
Since you're still searching,

57
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,110
a list of ED docs let go,

58
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,640
through no fault

59
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,640
of their own,

60
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,470
from a nearby

61
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,470
rural hospital.

62
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,410
Gaffney acquired

63
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,410
the institution

64
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,410
when it went bankrupt.

65
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,410
Whoa.

66
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,490
Someone you know?

67
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,490
Yeah, Dean Archer.

68
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,420
He was my senior medical

69
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,420
officer in the Navy.

70
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,460
Outstanding physician.

71
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,460
Taught me most of what I know.

72
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,790
See if you can schedule

73
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,790
an interview today.

74
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,360
And if not Dr. Archer,

75
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,490
I want that position filled

76
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,490
by the end of the week.

77
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,430
Yes, ma'am.

78
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,370
Dad? Dad.

79
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,840
What are you doing here?

80
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,840
Aren't you gonna be late

81
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,840
for your pod?

82
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,240
I've got an Uber

83
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,240
waiting outside.

84
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,210
Can you just sign this

85
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,210
chemistry test for me, please?

86
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,720
Just right there's fine.

87
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,510
Whoa. A "D"?

88
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,180
Plus.

89
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,320
Why are you bringing

90
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,320
this to me?

91
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,320
Isn't it your mom's week?

92
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,550
Dad, you know how she is.

93
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,150
She would take my phone,

94
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,150
or my iPad and just anything

95
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,150
that I say to her,

96
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,390
she'd say it's an excuse.

97
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,330
And what do you have

98
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,330
to say for yourself?

99
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,560
When we talked about this

100
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,560
a few weeks ago,

101
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,190
you really seemed

102
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,190
like you wanted

103
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,190
to step it up.

104
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,170
I know.

105
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,170
It's just with the...

106
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,480
With the pregnancy scare,

107
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,480
and the potential of moving.

108
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,810
I don't even know

109
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,810
if we're staying

110
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,810
or going, so...

111
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,480
Listen, I gotta go.

112
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,480
So, can you just...

113
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,320
Um, I know this has been

114
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,320
a stressful time, okay?

115
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,290
But, at least,

116
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,290
we got the final

117
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,290
custody hearing today,

118
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,790
so, one way or the other,

119
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,790
we are gonna have closure.

120
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,330
No more limbo.

121
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,330
Yep.

122
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,760
Owen! One more video,

123
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,760
and then we're taking Nana

124
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,760
to the airport, okay?

125
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,240
Hello?

126
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,240
Okay!

127
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,330
Ugh. Hey, Mom!

128
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,330
If we don't leave in five,

129
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,330
we're gonna hit traffic.

130
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,300
Mom?

131
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,170
I want you to take two bites

132
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,170
before we leave, okay?

133
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,580
What is it with everyone

134
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,580
in this house today? Mom?

135
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,920
Are you still in the shower?

136
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,550
Hello?

137
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,820
Mom?

138
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,160
Mom?

139
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,770
Mom! Can you hear me?

140
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,700
Mom, I can't get

141
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,700
my video to play.

142
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,240
Owen, one second!

143
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,410
Mom, can you fix it?

144
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,410
Owen, do not come in here!

145
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,740
Stay in the living room!

146
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,410
Hi, yes, I found my mom

147
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,410
unresponsive on the floor.

148
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,820
I need an ambulance, now.

149
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,940
Mom!

150
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,180
Owen!

151
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,740
Coming through!

152
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,740
Oh.

153
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,740
Sounds like them!

154
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,830
Slow down,

155
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,830
slow down!

156
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,830
Slow down!

157
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,500
Did you spend the whole $10

158
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,500
that I gave you?

159
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,740
At least they got

160
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,740
some healthy options.

161
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,740
That's true.

162
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,840
Let's back this up.

163
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,970
I'll help him.

164
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,940
Okay, then. He's got it.

165
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,690
It's been so great

166
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,690
to spend the week with y'all.

167
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,980
We really appreciate

168
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,980
you making the trip.

169
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,280
Oh, please.

170
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,820
No problem.

171
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,820
It was our pleasure.

172
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,720
Keshawn, why don't you

173
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,720
give your brother

174
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,920
his goodbye present?

175
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,260
A present?

176
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,260
Yeah.

177
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,700
Swamp Tales. Nice.

178
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,700
Can we play right now?

179
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,670
Come on, fellas,

180
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,670
it's your last day together.

181
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,000
You really want to spend it

182
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,000
playing video games?

183
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,600
Yeah.

184
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,370
Have fun, guys.

185
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,370
You like it?

186
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,710
Yeah, thanks!

187
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,710
And I can

188
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,710
show you how to catch...

189
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,580
Dream come true for Keshawn.

190
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,980
He's always wanted

191
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,980
to find his little brother.

192
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,620
Yeah. When we learned

193
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,620
that Auggie was sick,

194
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,850
we just prayed that

195
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,850
he would be okay.

196
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,860
You both have done so much

197
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,860
for him, you saved his life.

198
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,260
We're just happy

199
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,260
he finally got a liver.

200
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,350
Yeah.

201
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,930
We love Auggie to pieces.

202
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,430
That's clear.

203
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,330
Probably why my heart

204
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,330
is going a mile a minute.

205
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,770
What?

206
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,870
Um, look, we don't know

207
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,870
how to put this.

208
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,640
Um. We understand

209
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,640
that your adoption

210
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,640
isn't finalized yet.

211
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,410
You want Auggie.

212
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,280
We were thinking,

213
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,280
wouldn't it be great if the

214
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,280
boys could grow up together?

215
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,860
I know it's an impossible

216
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,860
thing to ask,

217
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,430
but if there's any way

218
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,430
that you could...

219
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,430
No.

220
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,430
Maggie.

221
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,430
There isn't.

222
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,370
No. We're adopting Auggie.

223
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,990
And I can't believe

224
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,990
that you would come here

225
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,990
and suggest this.

226
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,570
No. You're right.

227
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,000
We're sorry.

228
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,510
We're grateful the boys

229
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,510
got a chance to meet.

230
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,640
Yeah. Us, too.

231
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,050
Natalie?

232
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,050
Will.

233
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,420
I heard your mom

234
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,420
was brought in.

235
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,420
Are you okay?

236
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,390
Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

237
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,050
They think she had

238
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,050
a heart attack.

239
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,060
Her troponin levels

240
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,060
were a bit elevated,

241
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,600
but they're not sure.

242
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,400
She's in the cath lab now.

243
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,870
Crockett will let me know

244
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,870
something soon.

245
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,070
And Owen? He's...

246
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,070
At the neighbor's house.

247
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,540
Good.

248
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,540
When I found my mom,

249
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,740
I tried to keep him away,

250
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,740
but he saw her...

251
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,350
Come here.

252
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,420
It's okay.

253
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,420
It's gonna be okay.

254
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,890
Crockett, hey.

255
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,020
Hey.

256
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,020
Morning, Will.

257
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,120
Your mom's coronary

258
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,120
arteries are clear.

259
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,120
No evidence of infarction.

260
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,560
There you go, Nat,

261
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,560
that's great news.

262
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,500
But, um,

263
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,500
there is global dyskinesis

264
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,660
and a significantly

265
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,660
depressed ejection fraction.

266
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,840
Her heart's

267
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,840
not pumping properly.

268
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,000
I just don't understand.

269
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,000
What's causing this?

270
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,100
Myocarditis?

271
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,140
That'd be my first guess.

272
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,140
Did you send cultures?

273
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,640
Bacterial and viral, yes.

274
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,380
It could also be

275
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,380
medication induced.

276
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,140
I sent a tox, too.

277
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,420
What about a thyroid panel

278
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,420
and cortisol?

279
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,720
Two steps ahead of you.

280
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,720
Look, I appreciate

281
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,720
the backup, Will, I do.

282
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,090
But I think

283
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,090
I got this covered.

284
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,090
Thank you.

285
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,850
Have you

286
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,850
had anything to eat?

287
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,550
Um, I don't think

288
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,550
I could eat right now.

289
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,660
Still, I think we should

290
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,660
get you something.

291
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,860
You're gonna need

292
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,860
your energy.

293
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,900
Right.

294
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,900
Yeah.

295
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,870
Um. Thanks, Will.

296
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,870
Of course.

297
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,110
Safe travels home tonight.

298
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,110
Thank you.

299
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,420
Can you believe the nerve

300
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,420
of those people?

301
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,780
Their hearts

302
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,780
were in the right place.

303
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,650
Wanting their son

304
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,650
to grow up with his sibling.

305
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,980
So, what are you saying?

306
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,490
You think we should just

307
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,490
let them take Auggie?

308
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,660
No. I'm saying we should

309
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,660
have a conversation about it.

310
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,500
I get that we decided that

311
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,500
we weren't gonna have

312
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,500
any kids, but this...

313
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

314
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,610
That has nothing to do

315
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,610
with what I'm saying.

316
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,700
No?

317
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,810
'Cause it feels like

318
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,810
you're looking for an out.

319
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,450
That's low, Maggie.

320
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,480
You know, I couldn't

321
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,480
love Auggie more

322
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,480
if he was my own blood.

323
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm not gonna do this

324
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,920
with you right now.

325
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,000
Thanks for coming in

326
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,000
on short notice.

327
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,000
Sure.

328
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,090
Driving over here,

329
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,940
I was thinking about

330
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,940
the first time I saw you.

331
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,770
You were just a kid.

332
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,870
And scrawny.

333
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,740
Not anymore.

334
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,870
Missed you the last

335
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,870
couple reunions.

336
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,970
Sorry you weren't there.

337
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,620
I wanted to be,

338
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,620
but, you know, work.

339
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,110
Your qualifications

340
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,110
are excellent, obviously.

341
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,750
This was really

342
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,750
just a formality

343
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,750
more than anything.

344
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,120
Job's yours if you want it.

345
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,020
I appreciate that.

346
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,020
More than you know.

347
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,060
And, uh, I accept.

348
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,960
Matter of fact,

349
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,960
how about if I start today?

350
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,060
Today?

351
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,500
I figured since I'm already

352
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,500
credentialed in the system

353
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,500
and I'm here.

354
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,640
Yeah. Why don't you

355
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,640
shadow me for today?

356
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,910
Just to get the lay

357
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,910
of the land.

358
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,140
It's an ED.

359
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,140
I think I know the lay.

360
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,620
Oh.

361
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,810
But, hey, I welcome

362
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,810
the opportunity

363
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,810
to watch you in action.

364
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,890
Happy to have you

365
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,890
on board, sir.

366
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,920
It's Dean.

367
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,060
Right. Dean.

368
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,130
Gonna take me a minute

369
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,130
to get used to that.

370
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,220
Come on.

371
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,930
My baby needs help!

372
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,930
Someone, please!

373
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,670
Okay, I got it.

374
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,670
Miss, tell me what happened?

375
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,180
I tripped going down

376
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,180
the stairs and I

377
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,180
dropped her. She's...

378
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,940
All right. We're gonna

379
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,940
help your baby, okay?

380
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,940
Okay.

381
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,280
Just follow me right here.

382
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,020
Jim! Meet me in Two.

383
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,820
Why don't you put your baby

384
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,820
down right here, okay?

385
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,020
What's your baby's name?

386
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,020
Sarah.

387
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,890
She's only three months.

388
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,890
I need you to put

389
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,890
Sarah down right here.

390
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,330
Okay?

391
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,330
Maggie. What do we got?

392
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,930
Three-month-old,

393
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,930
fell out of her mother's arms,

394
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,930
won't wake up.

395
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,800
There you go,

396
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,800
there you go.

397
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,800
I got her, I got her.

398
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,960
Okay, okay.

399
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,160
Please tell me

400
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,160
she's gonna be okay.

401
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,570
This is a doll!

402
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,570
What?

403
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,930
Is this some kind of joke?

404
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,140
No, my baby needs help!

405
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,010
You have to help her! Please.

406
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,850
Yeah.

407
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,660
Hey!

408
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,730
We've got a situation

409
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,730
down in the ED.

410
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,900
The nurses tried to page you,

411
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,900
and you haven't responded.

412
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,130
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

413
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,940
I will head down there now.

414
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,780
Daniel, what's wrong?

415
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,150
The judge

416
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,150
just made his ruling.

417
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,690
Susan will be taking

418
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,690
my daughter out to Arizona.

419
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,150
Court decided

420
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,150
it was in her best interest.

421
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,060
What? Why?

422
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,690
I guess with my work hours,

423
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,860
they said that Susan,

424
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,860
technically,

425
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,860
would be home more.

426
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,160
They also noted that

427
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,330
she'd been her primary

428
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,330
caregiver for the majority

429
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,330
of her childhood.

430
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,040
I'm so sorry, Daniel.

431
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,050
Look, I know it's nothing

432
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,050
like her being here,

433
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,240
but with FaceTime and Zoom,

434
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,410
and your visits, you will

435
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,410
be a part of Anna's life.

436
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,990
Oh, yeah.

437
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,990
Definitely. Yep.

438
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,660
Take some time.

439
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,660
I'll get someone else

440
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,660
to see the patient.

441
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:50,670
No, no. I gotta go to work.

442
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:50,670
Take my mind off this stuff.

443
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,730
So, we have six

444
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,730
treatment rooms

445
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,730
and two trauma bays,

446
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,140
and over there, is our

447
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,140
state-of-the-art Hybrid OR.

448
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,970
Ah. I always dreamed

449
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,970
of putting an OR in my ED,

450
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,710
never could raise

451
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,710
the funding, though.

452
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,120
April. I want to introduce you

453
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,120
to the newest member

454
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,120
of our team,

455
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,240
Dr. Dean Archer.

456
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,290
This is April Sexton,

457
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,290
one of our star nurses.

458
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,150
Whoa. The famous

459
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,150
Captain Archer, in the flesh.

460
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,450
It's so nice to meet you.

461
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,390
My reputation

462
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,390
precedes me, huh?

463
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,830
It is because of you,

464
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,830
Ethan insists on making

465
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,830
the bed every morning.

466
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,700
Hmm. Why is he

467
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,700
making your bed?

468
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,700
No, he's not...

469
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,100
Uh... We used to...

470
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,100
It's fine, I get it.

471
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,430
If you'll excuse me.

472
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,010
Hold on, April, when you

473
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,010
get a chance, can you

474
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,010
set up for an I&D in 4?

475
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,010
Doris, I&D in 4.

476
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,470
On it.

477
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,910
But we're 2-0 this month.

478
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,910
Next delousing is yours.

479
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,140
Okay.

480
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,810
I hate pus, she hates bugs,

481
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,810
so we switch.

482
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,810
Oh, I see.

483
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,020
I remember when nurses

484
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,020
did both bugs and pus.

485
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,920
Nice of you to let 'em

486
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,920
pick and choose.

487
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,500
I don't want you to worry.

488
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,270
We're gonna take excellent

489
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,270
care of your baby, okay?

490
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,130
I'll be back shortly.

491
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,840
She's definitely

492
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,840
not pretending.

493
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,810
She's convinced

494
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,810
that that is her baby.

495
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,940
And maintains that

496
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,320
they fell down the stairs

497
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,320
earlier today,

498
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,320
while she was holding her.

499
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,910
But I didn't see any signs

500
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,910
of injury or bruising

501
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,910
on Miss Sanders.

502
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,990
Not at all sure that

503
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,990
that actually happened.

504
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,320
What is this,

505
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,320
some kind of delusion, then?

506
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,930
My first guess is something

507
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,930
called delusional companion

508
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,930
syndrome.

509
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,800
The affected believe

510
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,800
that inanimate objects

511
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,800
possess consciousness.

512
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,370
You know, the cause

513
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,370
is usually medical.

514
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,510
Stroke, Alzheimer's.

515
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,510
In this case,

516
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,510
have to be early onset.

517
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,210
Ideally, we'd get a CT,

518
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,210
without tipping her off

519
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,210
to what we're looking for.

520
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,180
Well, we could tell her

521
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,180
that we're gonna check

522
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,180
for injuries

523
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,510
since she said she fell.

524
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,950
Good thinking.

525
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,250
Maggie, can you call

526
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,250
the PICU, tell them

527
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,250
to prepare a crib for Sarah.

528
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,950
Wait, for the doll?

529
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,220
Now, Miss Sanders

530
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,220
believes that that's

531
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,220
her baby and she's hurt.

532
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,100
We challenge her with

533
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,100
reality right now, we risk

534
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,100
shutting her down completely.

535
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,230
Did she mention any family?

536
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,800
Her husband's a truck driver,

537
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,930
but he's on a cross-country

538
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,930
trip right now.

539
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,170
Okay. Maggie, why don't you

540
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,170
give him a call?

541
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,170
And then keep me updated.

542
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,270
All right.

543
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,310
Heart failure?

544
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,910
Uh...

545
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,890
I don't understand. I've never

546
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,890
had any heart issues.

547
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,090
Is this something

548
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,090
that could just pop up?

549
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,430
For some patients,

550
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,430
it's a slow build.

551
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,330
Usually,

552
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,330
due to high blood pressure,

553
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,330
faulty valves.

554
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,960
But, in others,

555
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,960
it can be sudden.

556
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,030
So, then, what? I just

557
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,030
take a bunch of pills?

558
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,170
We're gonna start you

559
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,170
on an intravenous

560
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,170
infusion of medication.

561
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,400
Try to get your heart

562
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,400
to pump more effectively.

563
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,350
Um, but given your

564
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,350
current stage

565
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,350
of heart failure,

566
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,540
the recommended course

567
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,540
of treatment is a left

568
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,540
ventricular assist device.

569
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,020
An LVAD. Mmm-hmm.

570
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,020
LVAD?

571
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,480
That's what,

572
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,480
like Uncle Joe had?

573
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,580
Yeah.

574
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,450
I remember him lugging

575
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,450
around that machine.

576
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:05,900
So, if I do this,

577
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:05,900
will it fix my heart?

578
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,470
There's a

579
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,470
small percentage of patients

580
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,470
who fully recover, but...

581
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,870
But it will improve

582
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,870
your quality of life, Mom.

583
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,410
So, then, it won't fix things.

584
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,950
Will?

585
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,950
Hey, Carol.

586
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,520
Sorry to interrupt.

587
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm so glad to see you!

588
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:37,090
It's for you.

589
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:37,090
My favorite. That is

590
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:37,090
so sweet of you.

591
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,060
I have missed you so much.

592
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,060
Same.

593
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,590
How're you feeling?

594
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,930
Not great.

595
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,910
These two, they are telling me

596
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,910
that I need a LVAD.

597
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,070
Ah.

598
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,180
You know, Owen talks

599
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,180
about you all the time.

600
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,360
Hey, guys. Why don't we

601
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,360
give Mom some time to rest?

602
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,260
Sure. Carol. Mmm-hmm.

603
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,260
Thank you, Doctor.

604
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,090
I'll stop by later.

605
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,090
Good.

606
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,040
Hey, sorry about that.

607
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,040
Kinda awkward.

608
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,340
I'm assuming Carol

609
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,340
doesn't know?

610
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,340
What's that?

611
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,440
You and Natalie.

612
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,440
That you're, uh,

613
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,440
seeing each other.

614
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,410
Yeah. Guess not.

615
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,420
I'm glad she has

616
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,420
the support right now.

617
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,550
I want Natalie

618
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,550
to be happy.

619
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,550
Yeah, me, too.

620
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,660
Ow!

621
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,030
When did the vomiting start?

622
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,500
Just after 1:00 a.m.

623
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,500
Had my head

624
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,500
in the toilet all...

625
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,370
Oh!

626
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

627
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,340
April? Okay.

628
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,280
Given that the abdominal

629
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,280
pain has been on-and-off

630
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,280
for over a month,

631
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,680
combined with your

632
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,680
alcohol consumption...

633
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,280
I swear I'm gonna

634
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,280
cut back, Doc.

635
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,580
I think we're looking

636
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,580
at pancreatitis.

637
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,420
Pancreatitis?

638
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,260
One of the main things

639
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,260
the pancreas does

640
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,690
is release digestive enzymes

641
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,690
into your small intestine...

642
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,490
But with pancreatitis,

643
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,490
the enzymes become activated

644
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,490
before leaving the pancreas,

645
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,430
causing inflammation

646
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,430
and belly pain.

647
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,540
Couldn't have

648
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,540
said it better myself.

649
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,640
Miss Sanders' head

650
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,640
and c-spine CT readout.

651
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,280
There's no evidence of stroke,

652
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,280
Alzheimer's, anything like...

653
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,620
Oh, but look.

654
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,260
C-3. Evidence

655
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,260
of a fracture pattern.

656
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,260
It's very well healed, though.

657
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,790
So maybe she did fall.

658
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,160
Yeah, but a year ago.

659
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,240
Mom? Hey.

660
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,440
Great news.

661
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,780
Dr. Marcel was able

662
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,780
to pull some strings

663
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,650
and schedule

664
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,650
your LVAD surgery

665
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,650
for later today.

666
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,460
Will remembered

667
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,460
my favorite flower.

668
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,500
It was so nice of him

669
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,500
to come by, wasn't it?

670
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,290
It was.

671
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,390
Sometimes, I think about

672
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,390
that week we all rented

673
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,390
the house on the lake.

674
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,070
How crazy your dad was,

675
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,070
trying to outdo Will.

676
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,370
But Will won him over.

677
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,310
I know you two have had

678
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,310
your ups and downs.

679
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,610
Mom.

680
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,610
Will's a catch.

681
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,650
I know you love Will.

682
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,650
Yeah.

683
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,650
I care about him, too.

684
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,650
But we've both moved on.

685
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,190
Actually, um, I started

686
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,190
seeing someone new.

687
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,120
Yeah. Dr. Marcel.

688
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,560
Oh, God! I put

689
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,560
my foot in my mouth,

690
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,560
didn't I?

691
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,600
It's okay, I should

692
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,600
have given you a heads up.

693
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,540
It's just super early,

694
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,540
so, you know...

695
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,540
Mmm.

696
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,770
You haven't introduced him

697
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,770
to Owen yet, have you?

698
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,780
No, no. Not yet.

699
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,780
Good.

700
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,610
You don't want Owen

701
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,610
to get too attached, just...

702
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,840
Hey. I get it.

703
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,740
Yeah.

704
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,740
All right? I agree.

705
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,340
Anyway, where is

706
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,340
all this coming from?

707
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,710
I want what's best

708
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,710
for you, Natalie.

709
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,590
And now, that I don't know

710
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,590
how much longer I've got...

711
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,820
Mom, stop it.

712
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,820
I wanna see you...

713
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,870
Don't talk like that.

714
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,870
I just love you so much.

715
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,540
I wanna see you happy.

716
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,540
And I will be. Okay?

717
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,130
You're gonna be fine.

718
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,310
Mr. Becker's labs and scans.

719
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,310
Oh. What's the damage?

720
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,310
Elevated lipase and amylase.

721
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,610
Ah. Take a look at his CT.

722
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,240
Big pancreatic abscess

723
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,240
over the body and tail.

724
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,550
Let's start him

725
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,550
on broad spectrum

726
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,550
antibiotics and fluids.

727
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,590
550 milligrams, Imipenem.

728
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,330
No, no. Hold on.

729
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,330
Why not a percutaneous drain?

730
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,260
I prefer starting

731
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,260
with the least

732
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,260
invasive intervention,

733
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,590
and elevate care

734
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,590
as necessary.

735
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,190
Yeah, I understand,

736
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,190
but if it's SIRS,

737
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,190
and not sepsis,

738
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,290
we're gonna be

739
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,290
playing catch-up.

740
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,800
Fair point. But still, given

741
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,800
the chance of perforation,

742
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,800
leak, drain's higher risk.

743
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,400
Not if I do it.

744
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,400
I'm credentialed

745
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,400
in hybrid procedures.

746
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,580
Yeah, okay.

747
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,580
Let's go with the drain.

748
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,380
April, Dr. Archer will

749
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,380
perform the procedure.

750
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,390
Show him up to CT.

751
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,720
Hey.

752
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,730
How're you holding up?

753
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,730
I don't know, Will.

754
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,730
I'm not, really.

755
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,970
I mean, you know

756
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,970
what an LVAD means

757
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,970
for someone my mom's age.

758
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,570
And the chances of her

759
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,570
getting a heart are so slim.

760
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,510
It's a bridge to nowhere.

761
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,510
She'll have two years,

762
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,510
maybe.

763
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,700
I just...

764
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,580
I thought we had

765
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,580
all this time together.

766
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,720
I'm sorry. I shouldn't

767
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,720
unload on you again.

768
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,380
Don't apologize.

769
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,750
Listen, you might have

770
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,750
more time with your mom

771
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,750
than you think.

772
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,490
It's what I came

773
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,490
to talk to you about.

774
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,490
My clinical trial.

775
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,900
I reviewed Carol's charts,

776
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,900
she's an ideal candidate.

777
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,830
I know you've had

778
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,830
promising results,

779
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,830
but it's still experimental.

780
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,930
Nat, our results are

781
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,930
more than promising.

782
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,560
We're actually

783
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,560
seeing patients

784
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,560
reverse heart damage,

785
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,800
without the risk of surgery.

786
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,800
What if she doesn't

787
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,800
get the drug?

788
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,970
After a few months,

789
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,970
everyone gets it.

790
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,750
It may be

791
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,750
too late by then.

792
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,320
Time will have passed,

793
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,320
she'll have gotten worse.

794
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,480
And then she may be

795
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,480
too sick to get an LVAD.

796
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,490
There is a risk

797
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,490
with any treatment,

798
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,960
but if it's time you want,

799
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,960
the trial is the best option.

800
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,790
I don't know.

801
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,470
I think...

802
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,540
I think maybe you should

803
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,540
present it to my mom.

804
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,470
Let's see what

805
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,470
she wants to do.

806
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,670
Dad, I can't leave Chicago!

807
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,670
I just can't.

808
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,750
I know how tough

809
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,750
this must be.

810
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,440
Leaving in the middle

811
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,440
of the school year.

812
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,440
Leaving all your friends.

813
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,280
But you just gotta trust me.

814
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,280
Once you get out there...

815
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,410
Dad, I'm not worried

816
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,410
about losing my friends,

817
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,580
I'm worried about

818
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,580
leaving you.

819
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,060
Oh, honey.

820
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,390
I'm gonna miss you, too.

821
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,390
And we're gonna talk

822
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,390
all the time.

823
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,330
Yeah, but it's not

824
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,330
gonna be the same.

825
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,700
And like, yeah,

826
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,700
I have friends,

827
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,600
but you're the only one

828
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,600
who I know isn't gonna

829
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,600
judge me for anything.

830
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,310
Oh.

831
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,650
It's fine, I know

832
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,650
you have to work.

833
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,650
So I'm gonna go.

834
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,940
Honey, I'm gonna

835
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,940
call you back, okay...

836
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,490
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

837
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,350
But I tracked down

838
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,350
Tally's husband.

839
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,350
Well, ex-husband.

840
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,430
Ex?

841
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,430
Divorce. It sounded recent.

842
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,360
Anyway, he's on

843
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,360
his way here now.

844
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
I knew the doll

845
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
was a bad idea.

846
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,390
When I first saw it,

847
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,390
I was shocked.

848
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,840
Oh, my God.

849
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,500
Looks just like her.

850
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,440
I guess people see them

851
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,440
as some kind of tribute.

852
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,100
When did you lose

853
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,100
your daughter, if you

854
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,100
don't mind me asking?

855
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,520
About a year ago.

856
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,520
Tally tripped

857
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,520
coming down some stairs.

858
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,450
Sarah slipped out

859
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,450
of her arms.

860
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,650
Docs said the fall

861
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,650
caused, uh, mesenteric...

862
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,060
Ischemia?

863
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,060
Yeah.

864
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,460
Said they could

865
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,460
do some kind of

866
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,460
exploratory surgery,

867
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,120
but probably wouldn't work.

868
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,670
Sarah was so tiny, I just...

869
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,900
I didn't wanna

870
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,900
put her through that.

871
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,900
Did Tally feel the same way?

872
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,710
She couldn't make the call.

873
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,800
She suffered a real bad

874
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,800
neck injury when she fell.

875
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,380
She was out of it for days.

876
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,450
When she came to,

877
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,450
I had to tell her

878
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,450
Sarah was gone.

879
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,550
She thought

880
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,550
I made the wrong decision.

881
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,550
Gave up too soon.

882
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,820
It tore our marriage apart.

883
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,490
I'm so sorry.

884
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,760
You know what I'm thinking,

885
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,760
Mr. Sanders, is that...

886
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,100
Because Tally couldn't

887
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,100
participate in any of

888
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,560
Sarah's end-of-life

889
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,560
decision making,

890
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,560
she couldn't say goodbye.

891
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,700
She hasn't been able

892
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,700
to fully accept her loss.

893
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,040
And that in her despair,

894
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,910
that the doll

895
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,910
might have become

896
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,010
an opportunity for her

897
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,010
to rewrite the past.

898
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,810
That's why she's re-enacting

899
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,810
what happened?

900
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,650
I think she's trying

901
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,650
to change the outcome.

902
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,450
And I have an idea

903
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,450
about how we might be able

904
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,830
to help her begin

905
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,830
to break this delusion.

906
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,450
But we're gonna

907
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,450
need your help.

908
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,800
What happened?

909
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,800
His pressure just plummeted.

910
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,770
Belly's distended.

911
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,770
Hard as a rock.

912
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,770
Maybe it's the drain.

913
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,930
No. I placed it perfectly.

914
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,930
That's not it.

915
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,930
Call general surgery.

916
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,440
Ethan, a word?

917
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,740
All right. Start him on

918
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,740
Levophed and titrate

919
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,740
up to a MAP of 70.

920
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,010
Yeah.

921
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,480
He goes into open surgery

922
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,480
right now, he's a dead man.

923
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,180
Mortality risk is high,

924
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,180
I agree, but at this point,

925
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,180
we don't have a choice.

926
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,580
What if we did a VARD?

927
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,580
Right now, you and me.

928
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,090
It is minimally invasive,

929
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,090
but I'm not trained

930
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,090
in that procedure.

931
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,820
You still want me

932
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,820
to call Surgery, right?

933
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,090
Do you remember

934
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,090
on the Vinson

935
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,070
when we did that

936
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,070
emergency ex-lap with

937
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,070
just a laceration kit?

938
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,570
We got this.

939
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,570
I'll walk you through it.

940
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,930
April, open the Hybrid OR.

941
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,930
We'll need

942
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,930
a laparoscopic setup.

943
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,940
Are you sure about this?

944
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,940
I'm sure.

945
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,210
Hey, Halstead!

946
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,210
Yeah?

947
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:33,030
So, I finish operating and I

948
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:33,030
find out that you canceled

949
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:33,030
Carol's LVAD surgery?

950
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,260
That's right.

951
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,260
She wants to be evaluated

952
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,260
for my clinical trial.

953
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,930
Your clinical trial,

954
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,930
give me a break.

955
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,560
You're unbelievable, man.

956
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,560
Excuse me?

957
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,240
Now, let's be real

958
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,240
with each other, Will.

959
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,240
What are you after?

960
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,030
Hey. You're way out of line.

961
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,030
Am I?

962
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,740
Then why'd you present

963
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,740
the trial to Carol without

964
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,740
my input or approval?

965
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,580
I went to Natalie, 'cause hers

966
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,580
is the only approval I need.

967
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,810
Thought she'd keep you

968
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,810
in the loop,

969
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,810
but apparently not.

970
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,180
Look, I have a lot of history

971
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,180
with Carol and with Natalie.

972
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,660
I understand that makes

973
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,660
you uncomfortable,

974
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,660
but I won't apologize for it.

975
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:20,040
Wire and dilator in.

976
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:20,040
Okay. Making the incision.

977
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,870
Thank you.

978
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,010
Go gently, if he starts

979
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,010
to bleed, we won't

980
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,010
be able to stop it. Hmm?

981
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,590
Go, go, go.

982
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,050
All right. There we go.

983
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,050
Phew. Whoo.

984
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,120
That enough pus for you?

985
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,150
Ring forceps.

986
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,970
Mike.

987
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,970
I'm here, Tally.

988
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,610
She slipped through my arms.

989
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,610
I don't know what happened.

990
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,770
I just tripped and then...

991
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,770
Honey, it's okay.

992
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,770
It was an accident.

993
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,710
The doctor needs

994
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,710
to talk to us about Sarah.

995
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,880
Okay.

996
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,120
So, Sarah's fall

997
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,120
caused an injury known

998
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,120
as mesenteric ischemia.

999
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,030
It is an interruption

1000
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,030
of the blood supply

1001
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,030
to the small intestine.

1002
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,220
My God...

1003
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,100
Now, I've spoken to our

1004
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,100
surgical team, and they can

1005
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,100
perform exploratory surgery.

1006
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,630
Whatever she needs, do it.

1007
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,630
But it is a very

1008
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,630
long operation.

1009
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,730
And I have to be

1010
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,730
honest with you,

1011
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,810
it is very unlikely

1012
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,810
that Sarah would survive it.

1013
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,910
She'd be going through

1014
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,910
the operation,

1015
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,910
more suffering for nothing?

1016
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,650
Mike. What do we do?

1017
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,360
You're her mom. You decide.

1018
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,090
I mean, if they don't

1019
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,090
do the operation,

1020
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,330
how long before she...

1021
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm afraid it would be

1022
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,360
a matter of hours.

1023
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,660
No!

1024
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,000
No.

1025
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm so sorry.

1026
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,650
I don't want her to suffer.

1027
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,980
I know.

1028
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,320
Don't do the surgery.

1029
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,930
Can we be with her

1030
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,930
when she...

1031
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,330
Of course you can.

1032
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,180
Did you know Keshawn

1033
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,180
made it all the way to level

1034
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,180
100 in Minecraft Dungeons?

1035
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,280
I didn't. That's impressive.

1036
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,120
Yeah. And he's my brother.

1037
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,090
Yes, he is.

1038
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,430
Does he really have to

1039
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,430
go back tonight?

1040
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,900
I'm sorry, sweetie.

1041
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,740
I'm sure he's gonna

1042
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,740
miss you, too.

1043
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,040
Maybe someday soon,

1044
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,040
you can go visit him

1045
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,040
in California.

1046
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,980
Yeah.

1047
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,390
I'm sorry. I should

1048
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,390
have updated you.

1049
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:32,160
I've just been so overwhelmed.

1050
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:32,160
Yeah, of course.

1051
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:32,160
Look, I understand that.

1052
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,030
Thank you.

1053
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,030
It's just...

1054
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,770
Are you sure

1055
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,770
that's the only reason?

1056
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,200
I don't know.

1057
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,200
It just seems like,

1058
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,200
Will, he's been your rock.

1059
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,240
Crockett...

1060
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,240
I guess I just worry

1061
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,140
that your mom's

1062
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,140
history with Will,

1063
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,440
her affection for him,

1064
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,440
it's clouding her judgment.

1065
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,210
And possibly yours, too.

1066
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,280
I mean, look, Will is someone

1067
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,280
I shared a life with

1068
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,280
for a very long time and...

1069
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,520
Yeah, of course.

1070
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,760
But I would never let that

1071
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,760
cloud my judgment.

1072
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,090
Then why aren't you

1073
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,090
objecting to this?

1074
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,460
You know the risks of

1075
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,460
an experimental drug.

1076
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,460
LVAD is proven.

1077
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,890
If this were

1078
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,890
any other patient...

1079
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
But it's not

1080
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
any other patient.

1081
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,130
It's my mom!

1082
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,140
And if there is a chance

1083
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,140
she could recover,

1084
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,300
that things could go back

1085
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,300
to the way they were.

1086
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,110
I know it's

1087
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,110
a long shot, but...

1088
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,980
As a daughter,

1089
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,980
you want to believe.

1090
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,810
But, as a doctor,

1091
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,810
you have to see this

1092
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,810
for what it is.

1093
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,980
A gamble.

1094
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,790
This could buy you more time

1095
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,790
with your mom. Or less.

1096
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,560
Look.

1097
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,900
I just want you to be

1098
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,900
prepared for all the outcomes.

1099
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,560
Not just the one

1100
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,560
you're betting on.

1101
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,170
That was pretty

1102
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,170
incredible, huh?

1103
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,010
That's one way to put it.

1104
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,280
If Archer hadn't suggested

1105
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,280
going in with VARDs,

1106
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,010
Becker would have died

1107
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,010
in the OR.

1108
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,010
He saved the man's life.

1109
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,590
If Dr. Archer hadn't insisted

1110
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,590
on placing a drain,

1111
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,820
Mr. Becker never would've gone

1112
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,820
downhill in the first place!

1113
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,320
We don't know that, April.

1114
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,290
Look, I get that

1115
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,290
he was your mentor.

1116
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,020
Maybe that's why

1117
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,020
you trusted his instincts

1118
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,020
over your own today.

1119
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,230
But, Ethan, he is not

1120
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,230
your superior anymore.

1121
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,270
I know that.

1122
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,270
Does he?

1123
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,590
What's going on?

1124
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,260
She's, um...

1125
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,870
She's finally saying

1126
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,870
goodbye to her baby.

1127
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,460
Hey.

1128
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,890
The Carters.

1129
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,640
They want

1130
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,640
to adopt Auggie.

1131
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,180
Oh.

1132
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,440
I can't...

1133
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,080
I can't lose another child.

1134
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,580
Another? I don't...

1135
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,350
I never told you.

1136
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,290
I never told anyone, really.

1137
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,290
Only Ben.

1138
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,600
When I was 16...

1139
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,260
...I got pregnant.

1140
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,980
By the time I found out,

1141
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,980
I was four months along.

1142
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,940
I didn't know what to do.

1143
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,050
I agreed to put the baby

1144
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,050
up for adoption.

1145
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,430
After she was born,

1146
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,430
I held her.

1147
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,060
Then a nurse came in,

1148
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,060
and she took her

1149
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,060
out of my arms...

1150
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,270
When my friends started

1151
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,270
having kids, they'd say,

1152
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,610
"Mags, you'd make such

1153
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,610
a great mom. When are you

1154
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,610
gonna get pregnant?"

1155
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,350
I couldn't tell them,

1156
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,350
but I didn't think

1157
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,350
I deserved to be a mother.

1158
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,090
Then Auggie

1159
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,090
came into my life.

1160
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,230
And it felt like

1161
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,230
a second chance.

1162
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,110
But seeing how he was

1163
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,110
with his brother today,

1164
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,080
how happy he was...

1165
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,480
What do I do, Sharon?

1166
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,650
Maggie, you know

1167
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,650
I can't answer that.

1168
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,420
But what you did

1169
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,420
for your baby?

1170
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,150
Allowing her to have a life

1171
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,150
that you couldn't give her?

1172
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,490
That was love.

1173
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:33,260
So, no matter what

1174
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:33,260
decision you make,

1175
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:33,260
it will come from that place.

1176
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,160
And I'm sure of that.

1177
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,480
Hey.

1178
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,120
Listen, if this is about

1179
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,120
the judge's ruling...

1180
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,050
It's not. I just wanted

1181
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,050
to talk to you

1182
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,620
because I'm genuinely

1183
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,620
worried about Anna.

1184
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,090
Why? What's going on?

1185
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,660
She came to my house

1186
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,660
this morning, so that I could

1187
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,660
sign her chemistry exam.

1188
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,700
She got a D.

1189
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,670
Oh. Of course

1190
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,670
she comes to you

1191
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,240
'cause you're the good cop,

1192
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,240
and I get stuck

1193
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,240
being the bad cop.

1194
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,370
But I'm not sure

1195
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,370
it's quite that simple.

1196
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,640
No?

1197
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,640
No. Look.

1198
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,640
How do I put this?

1199
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,480
Anna really responds

1200
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,480
when she feels like

1201
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,480
she's being heard.

1202
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,810
Oh, my God!

1203
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,810
Here we go.

1204
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,280
And I don't listen

1205
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,280
to anything she says, right?

1206
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,690
Why else am I

1207
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,690
a monster, Dan?

1208
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,690
Tell me.

1209
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,420
Because I believe

1210
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,420
in consequences?

1211
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,420
A little discipline?

1212
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,590
It's not what I'm saying.

1213
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,590
It is.

1214
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,390
Look, she's

1215
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,390
a teenage girl. Okay?

1216
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,160
It's inevitable at some point,

1217
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,160
there's gonna be a clash.

1218
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,100
You know,

1219
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,100
like it's perfectly natural

1220
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,100
for her to be pulling away.

1221
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,600
She didn't tell me

1222
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,600
about one bad grade.

1223
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,400
You make it sound like we're

1224
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,400
living on different planets.

1225
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,130
It's not just

1226
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,130
about the grade.

1227
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,840
What? What else is there, Dan?

1228
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,840
What don't I know about?

1229
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,840
Her boyfriend?

1230
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,740
I know.

1231
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,740
The specifics

1232
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,740
aren't important.

1233
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,340
Because there

1234
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,340
are no specifics.

1235
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,470
You just love to play

1236
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,470
your little head games.

1237
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,380
Su...

1238
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,380
No, gotta get packing.

1239
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,850
She got pregnant!

1240
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,490
What?

1241
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,320
It was a chemical pregnancy.

1242
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,230
You thought she was pregnant

1243
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,230
and you didn't tell me?

1244
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,300
No, I didn't,

1245
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,300
'cause she begged me

1246
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,300
not to. All right?

1247
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,740
I'm only telling you now,

1248
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,740
'cause you don't wanna

1249
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,740
seem to acknowledge

1250
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,870
how disconnected you are

1251
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,870
from your daughter.

1252
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,340
You are a manipulative

1253
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,340
son of a bitch!

1254
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,710
You wonder why she doesn't

1255
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,710
talk to you? It might have

1256
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,710
something to do with you.

1257
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,480
For instance, the way

1258
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,480
you're behaving right now!

1259
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,490
Double checking

1260
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,490
my handiwork, huh?

1261
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,560
Making sure I put the drain

1262
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,560
in the right spot?

1263
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,200
So, how'd I do?

1264
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,430
Drain was placed perfectly.

1265
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,440
'Course it was.

1266
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,610
But there is one thing

1267
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,610
I need to be clear about.

1268
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,540
In this ED, I'm in charge.

1269
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,380
Yeah, of course. Uh...

1270
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,380
To be honest,

1271
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,380
I was just eager to make

1272
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,380
a good impression, that's all.

1273
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,390
This is

1274
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,390
gonna be a big adjustment

1275
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,390
for the both of us.

1276
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,930
Yeah. Hey, "Lead, follow,

1277
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,930
or get out of the way."

1278
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,420
And it's my turn to follow.

1279
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,560
Thanks.

1280
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,560
Yeah.

1281
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,740
You always have

1282
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,740
Auggie's best interest

1283
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,740
at heart, I know that.

1284
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,740
That's what allowed you

1285
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,740
to see what I couldn't.

1286
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,350
Auggie should be

1287
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,350
with his brother.

1288
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,820
You really believe that?

1289
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,920
Mmm-hmm.

1290
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:50,230
Growing up

1291
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:50,230
with a sibling to lean on

1292
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:50,230
was everything to me.

1293
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,700
If Keshawn is any indication,

1294
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,700
Maxine and Antoine are...

1295
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,370
They're pretty

1296
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,370
great parents.

1297
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,940
I was just having

1298
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,420
trouble getting past

1299
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,420
my own stuff.

1300
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,820
What happened when

1301
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,820
I was a teenager.

1302
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,030
Oh... honey.

1303
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,860
I think about her

1304
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,860
all the time.

1305
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,600
Wonder where she is,

1306
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,600
if she's okay, I...

1307
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,040
It's okay, baby.

1308
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,390
Let's go tell Auggie.

1309
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,570
Her surgery went well.

1310
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,070
She should be awake

1311
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,070
in an hour or so.

1312
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,070
Thank you.

1313
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,370
Yeah.

1314
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,440
I'm gonna

1315
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,440
stay here tonight.

1316
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,350
Sitter's with Owen.

1317
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,510
You want some company?

1318
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,420
Yeah, I'd like that.

1319
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,650
Okay.

1320
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,090
What's going on?

1321
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,090
Talk to Mom.

1322
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,100
It's clear

1323
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,100
that my way of parenting

1324
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,100
isn't working anymore.

1325
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,370
When Anna was

1326
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,370
a baby, we were so close.

1327
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:21,410
And somewhere along

1328
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:21,410
the way, we drifted apart.

1329
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,540
Yeah, but that's not

1330
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,540
gonna last forever.

1331
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,950
You know that, right?

1332
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,950
Maybe.

1333
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,910
But I feel like

1334
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,910
I don't know her anymore.

1335
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,490
And I certainly don't know

1336
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,490
how to connect to her.

1337
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,500
I think that she should

1338
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,500
stay in Chicago.

1339
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,470
With you.

1340
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,470
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1341
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,660
Su, are you sure?

1342
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,900
Look. We can assess at

1343
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,900
the end of the school year,

1344
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,910
but for now, yes.

1345
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,080
Su! No, no, no. Su?
