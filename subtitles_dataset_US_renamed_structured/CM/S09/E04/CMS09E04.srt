1
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:07,118
Colleagues date all the time.

2
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:08,352
It's not a big deal.

3
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:10,026
Yeah, but it is to me.

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,136
There's no rush.

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,513
It's fun sneaking around.

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,306
I didn't know you
were a Chicago boy.

7
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,017
Born and raised.

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,060
Just been away a lot of years.

9
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,729
Must be nice, being home.

10
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,358
Public shaming is a way to
get companies' attention

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,818
and move them to act.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,194
It's not our lane.

13
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,196
We don't get involved
with insurance.

14
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,073
I'm not sure that's
the kind of impact

15
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,783
I'm trying to make.

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,495
Whoa, heads up, coming through!

17
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,414
Good job, Haley,
you're doing great.

18
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,293
You're doing great, Haley!

19
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,128
Baby one is almost out!

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,047
Get ready to give me
everything you can,

21
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,631
and push as hard
as you can, okay?

22
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,735
- What do you need from me?
- Twins, four weeks early.

23
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,528
Neo's on their way down, but I
need eyes on baby number two.

24
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,262
- Got it.
- Okay, ready?

25
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,765
Here it comes. Give
me one big push.

26
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,225
There you go! There you go!

27
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,437
Almost out! He's out!

28
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,564
A quick breather.

29
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,875
Baby two is head
down on its way,

30
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,233
baby three right behind it.

31
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,069
- Baby three?
- Baby three?

32
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,404
No, no, no, no,
twins. Not triplets.

33
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:15,325
One down, definitely two to go.

34
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,844
Haley, when was your
last ultrasound?

35
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,746
Uh, I had one my
first trimester,

36
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,373
another in my second,

37
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,667
and I was on my way to
see my doctor next week.

38
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,877
Well, you would have
gotten a big surprise.

39
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,422
- Triplets? Twins.
- Two cribs, two car seats.

40
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,049
I have seven
brothers and sisters.

41
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,636
Trust me, the more the merrier.

42
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,096
Okay, you ready for round two?

43
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,180
- Come on, baby.
- Yeah.

44
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,182
Okay, deep inhale.

45
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,809
Exhale!

46
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,435
Push!

47
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,271
- Coming through.
- Whoops. Sheesh.

48
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,356
Home sweet home, huh?

49
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,816
There he is.

50
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,110
Welcome back, Dean.
We missed you.

51
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,277
Yeah.

52
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,696
I appreciate the
low-key welcome.

53
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,131
I was a little
worried people would

54
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,907
make a big deal about it.

55
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,450
What, like with a

56
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,119
"congrats on the
new kidney" banner?

57
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,247
No.

58
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,040
We just delivered
surprise triplets.

59
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,583
Kind of stole your thunder.

60
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,919
My lucky day.

61
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,631
So look, the whole
kidney thing, dialysis,

62
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,384
and the house calls
and the Sean stuff.

63
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,845
You were a saint,

64
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,390
even when I tried my hardest
to push you away, so thanks.

65
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,226
Wow, look at you,
practicing gratitude.

66
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,495
- Something wrong with that?
- No, I like it.

67
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,771
It's just not
normally your style.

68
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,691
Oh, really?

69
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,818
Mm-hmm.

70
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,321
That guy's scoping you
out at six o'clock.

71
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,741
Wyatt from pharma.

72
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,410
Talked a few times.
Seems like a nice guy.

73
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,430
Those weren't his babies
you delivered, were they?

74
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,538
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,457
There he is. Welcome back, Dean.

76
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,583
What do we got, LJ?

77
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,543
High-speed motor vehicle crash.

78
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,712
Car hit some black ice,
skidded off the road.

79
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,924
Victim's Mark May, GCS
8, and hypotensive.

80
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,360
Gave him a unit of whole
blood on the flight.

81
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,637
Okay. Here we go.

82
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,307
Thanks, guys. We
got it from here.

83
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,975
Got a rail coming down.

84
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,811
- You want to hop on the chest?
- Yeah, you got it.

85
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,688
Hello, hello.

86
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,524
BP 102/96.

87
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,652
Breath sounds bilaterally.

88
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,572
Crockett, it's almost showtime.

89
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,367
- Got to make a decision.
- Thought we made it.

90
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,785
You host, I handle the menu.

91
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,537
- Oh, Lord.
- Pelvis feels loose.

92
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,457
- Ultrasound coming in.
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,209
I'm thinking barbecue now.

94
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,380
Fast looks good.

95
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,923
He's not bleeding
into his belly.

96
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,717
- He's bleeding from somewhere.
- BP just dropped 95/60.

97
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,236
Hang another unit of
blood and trigger the MTP.

98
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,387
Jimmy, that's you.

99
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,572
Mike, let's get some X-rays.

100
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,431
- Chest and pelvis, please.
- Yep.

101
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,766
So, uh, 11th-hour menu change?

102
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,643
- Seriously now?
- It's the middle of winter.

103
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,396
T-bones and fillets just sound
better than catfish and cod.

104
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,898
Clear.

105
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,358
Good.

106
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,027
Resetting for pelvis.

107
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,737
Clear.

108
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,115
Chest is good, but
his pelvis is busted.

109
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,884
Open-book fracture,
probably bleeding into it.

110
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,493
All right, let's
put them in a binder

111
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,638
to close down the pelvis until
I can get in there and pack it.

112
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,330
- That's still you, Jimmy.
- Yep.

113
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,666
Nice and easy, guys.
I got his head.

114
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,919
Log roll on my count.
One, two, three.

115
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,754
Easy, easy, easy.

116
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,549
Maggie, what do you
think? Surf or turf?

117
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,592
Uh-uh. Don't put me
in the middle of this.

118
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,929
Easy on your end.

119
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,597
To me.

120
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,558
- I got his head. Go.
- You got it.

121
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,309
- Got it.
- Yep. Put him down.

122
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,954
I'll call the OR and let
them know that you're coming.

123
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,354
Yep.

124
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,106
I'm telling you.

125
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,941
Barbecue's the way to go.

126
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,485
Okay, well, we'll
figure it out later.

127
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,613
Dr. Archer, good morning.

128
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,283
I'm Zola Ahmad, your
new senior resident.

129
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,701
I'm not stalking you.

130
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,429
I just wanted to introduce
myself first thing.

131
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,787
Yeah?

132
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,122
You mean before I'm caught up

133
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,207
on your renegade antics
of the last few weeks?

134
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,751
Yeah, kind of. Too late?

135
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,544
Yeah, too late, too late.

136
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,963
Look, I may
have crossed a few lines

137
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,632
and stepped on a few toes, but

138
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,177
you know what? There is no but.

139
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,304
The renegade is
out of my system.

140
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,931
I am no longer going
to be a headache.

141
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,117
Well, you know what, Dr. Ahmad?

142
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,517
You caught me on a good day.

143
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,478
I'm gonna give you the
benefit of the doubt.

144
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,773
Tabula rasa. Clean slate.

145
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,941
- Mm.
- Don't dirty it up.

146
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,654
Look at this.

147
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,991
D-E-N-N-I-S. Dennis.

148
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,284
Okay, that's your name,

149
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,328
but I'm not sure where
you're going with this.

150
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,499
I've been Denny's, Dentist,
Ennis, everything but Dennis.

151
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,459
- Denny's?
- Until today.

152
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,854
Maybe 'cause everyone now knows

153
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,630
I'm the big boss's boyfriend.

154
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,131
You're ridiculous.

155
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,841
Ah, what you meant
to say is "charming."

156
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,426
- Mm.
- Or was it "handsome"?

157
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,844
Go with me here.

158
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,322
"Charmingly handsome."

159
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,931
I like that.

160
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,186
Sharon. What is it?

161
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,188
My grandson, Isaiah,

162
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,484
is being brought into
the ED by ambulance.

163
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,907
Lungs are clear.

164
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,160
BP's 110/76. Heart rate's 115.

165
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,205
- That's... that's good, right?
- He's... he's breathing okay?

166
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,540
His heart's fine?

167
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,375
Bert, let's step to the hallway.

168
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,043
Give the doctor
some space to work.

169
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,462
- It happened so fast.
- Yes, yes.

170
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,898
Well, we're gonna
straighten it all out.

171
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,592
Bert, what happened?

172
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,139
I fell on Isaiah.

173
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,285
He fell asleep.

174
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,120
Does that mean he's okay,

175
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,706
or did he just cry
himself into exhaustion?

176
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,541
Shh. I don't know, honey.

177
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,501
Let's wait and see
what the tests say.

178
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,504
Dr. Ripley has ordered
a skeleton survey

179
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,922
to check for fractures

180
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,843
and a rapid MRI in
case of a head injury.

181
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,267
And Dad just fell on him?

182
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,935
They were playing.

183
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:20,565
Your father's legs
got tangled up.

184
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,026
He couldn't really
explain the details.

185
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,694
How is he? Dad?

186
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,781
Dr. Ripley is examining him now.

187
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,950
Hey.

188
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,992
Yeah.

189
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,164
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

190
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,375
Mama's here.

191
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,877
It's okay.

192
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,173
This is the
bravest face I've got.

193
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,851
Yeah, I saw you checking
me out just now.

194
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,353
Earlier this morning too.

195
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,022
Hmm. Yeah, I think that
was you checking me out.

196
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,065
Huh.

197
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,858
Not the first time, I might add.

198
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,461
I guess we should get
dinner tonight then.

199
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,238
Right? Settle the whole
who's-been-checking-out-who

200
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,447
once and for all?

201
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,574
Hmm?

202
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,368
Yeah, that sounds fun.

203
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,870
I'll, um, give you my number.

204
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,251
Until later then.

205
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,752
Mm-hmm.

206
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,880
What was all that?

207
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,216
Wyatt just asked me out.

208
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,093
Wow, face-to-face.

209
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,512
That's confident.
Boyfriend material.

210
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,555
Mm.

211
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,889
- Or boy toy.
- Easy.

212
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,808
Let's not get carried away.

213
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,143
I don't know.

214
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,745
There's research that
shows your brain knows

215
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,038
the kind of
relationship it wants

216
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,982
as soon as you meet someone.

217
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,568
So what do we think
of the new resident?

218
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,569
- Who? Zola?
- Yeah.

219
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,821
I like her. She's fun.

220
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,239
You're not a fan?

221
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,534
Cautious optimism,
emphasis on cautious.

222
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,536
Mm. Shocker.

223
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,205
You didn't warm up to
me for a few months,

224
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,290
but look at us now.

225
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,916
- Bosom buddies.
- What's good, guys?

226
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,210
- Hey.
- Sean.

227
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,771
I thought you weren't supposed
to be at the valet stand

228
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,088
until next week.

229
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,674
Well, that was the plan
until this morning.

230
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,509
I came in to turn in my uniform.

231
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,802
What happened?

232
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,804
I got a new gig.

233
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,432
Recovery coach at
a rehab center.

234
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,516
- Oh.
- Wow.

235
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,744
Way to go. Proud of you, son.

236
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,771
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

237
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,105
It's been a long road,

238
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,733
but it's all beginning
to fall into place.

239
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,195
All right, well, I'm
gonna go give notice.

240
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,992
How about that?

241
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,706
No evidence he hit his
head or lost consciousness,

242
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,292
but his left knee is
swollen and loose.

243
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,378
X-ray's negative.
It's not a fracture.

244
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,963
- A ligament injury?
- That's my guess.

245
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,299
Ordered an MRI, techs will
be by in a bit to take him.

246
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,635
All right. Thank
you, Dr. Ripley.

247
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,345
Of course.

248
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,974
How's Isaiah?

249
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,769
Well, he's getting
X-rays and a rapid MRI.

250
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,521
Tara's with him.

251
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,149
The doctor said two-year-olds
fall all the time,

252
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,318
that they're built
for bumps and bruises.

253
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,405
But I fell on him, Sharon.
It's not the same thing.

254
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,115
It was an accident, Bert.

255
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,784
Doesn't change where
we are right now.

256
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,038
Any vomiting, Floyd? Diarrhea?

257
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,833
No, but I'm bloated
morning, noon, and night.

258
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,668
Nauseous most of the time too.

259
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,004
- Appetite?
- Zero.

260
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,255
I know it don't look like it,

261
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,590
but this spare tire's
lost a lot of tread.

262
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,556
How would you describe
this pain in your abdomen?

263
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,683
Dull, sharp?

264
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,185
Um, mushy?

265
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,437
Is that a thing?

266
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,689
In here, we call it
"diffuse tenderness,"

267
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,358
but I like your way much better.

268
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
So this mush, when did it start?

269
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,448
Uh, best recollection,
two, three weeks ago.

270
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,824
It was after visiting Memphis

271
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,492
but before rolling
into St. Louis.

272
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,745
- Oh, you're on the road.
- Where are you headed?

273
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,372
Eh, don't know. I'm wandering.

274
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,250
Uh, I lost my job
a few months ago,

275
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,754
and I'm just using my severance
to zigzag the US of A.

276
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,106
Where'd you get
this scar, Floyd?

277
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,550
- Prior surgery?
- A week after I was born.

278
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,737
It's been so long, I can barely
remember what it's called.

279
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,721
A misrotation?

280
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,889
Malrotation.

281
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,682
Bingo, that's it.

282
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,060
Yeah, came out my mama with
my insides all over the place.

283
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,104
Doctors had to put it
back in the right spot.

284
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,357
You think that's why
my gut's a mess now?

285
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,358
I don't think so,

286
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,817
but I also don't
have any theories,

287
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,070
so I wanna run some
tests and go from there.

288
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,906
CBC, CMP, LFTs, and a KUB.

289
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,157
Yes, Doctor.

290
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,576
Uh, that's a lot of initials.

291
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,370
And hospitals like to
charge by the letter.

292
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,080
Well, we'll get an
estimate on the cost

293
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,415
and see how much your
insurance will approve.

294
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,876
I'm already in my pocket
just visiting the ED.

295
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,586
If insurance ain't gonna pony up

296
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,004
for the rest of the tab,

297
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,982
I'm just gonna have to keep
grinning and bearing it.

298
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,591
Well, you came here
for help, Floyd.

299
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,510
That's what you're gonna get.

300
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,136
Thank you, Doctor.

301
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,061
Dr. Archer, incoming,
going to treatment six.

302
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,271
Jordan Moore III, 32,

303
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,816
got lightheaded and fell down a
flight of stairs at his office.

304
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,276
Initial GCS 13, now 15.

305
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,779
Witness said he was
out about 30 seconds.

306
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,989
Been lethargic
since we got here.

307
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,617
All right. On my count. Ready?

308
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,994
And one, two, three.

309
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,621
All right, got him.

310
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,791
- Take it easy with this guy.
- All right, Jordan.

311
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,669
I'm Dr. Archer.
This is Nurse Doris.

312
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,878
Do you know where you are?

313
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,965
Oh, man, I'm going.

314
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,675
All right. I'll
take that as a no.

315
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,553
All right.

316
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,471
Lungs are clear.

317
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:48,309
Okay, Jordan, you are
in the ED, Chicago Med.

318
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,478
You fell down some
stairs, buddy.

319
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,772
My dad. My dad.

320
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,274
We'll call him, hon.

321
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,776
- Okay, belly's good.
- Let's take a look at that arm.

322
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,194
Mm-hmm.

323
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,905
Jordan, I'm gonna
open your shirt, okay?

324
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,366
Well, damn.

325
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,535
Anterior dislocation
of the left shoulder,

326
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,620
CBC, CMP, cardiac labs.

327
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,872
Mike, give me the iPad.

328
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,332
Give me a 12-lead
EKG and a panscan.

329
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,044
All right, Jordan, we are
gonna start doing some...

330
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,671
What's happening to me now?

331
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,883
Please help. I don't wanna die.

332
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,054
All right, all right, all right.

333
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,160
Dr. Ahmad.

334
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:35,357
Floyd's HMO isn't gonna cover

335
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,277
the labs that you ordered,
so he's passing on the tests.

336
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,154
I expected as much.

337
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,298
I've never been
pleasantly surprised

338
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,698
by an insurance company.

339
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,242
Me neither, which
is why I reached out

340
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,120
to his primary care physician
to get him seen there.

341
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,915
- Oh, good call.
- His HMO should cover that 100%.

342
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,417
Yeah, but unfortunately,
his PCP's in Kentucky,

343
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,629
and their next available isn't
until the first of the month.

344
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,315
Insurance companies... the
only thing that they're good at

345
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,840
- is getting in the way.
- Amen.

346
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,135
But we have to work with them.

347
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,096
Do we, though?

348
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,182
Three weekends now, I've traded
drunk underage college kids

349
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,642
who have registered
under fake IDs,

350
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,477
made-up names,
made-up addresses.

351
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,521
Admin sends the
bills. What happens?

352
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,065
It bounces back, and the
hospital eats the cost.

353
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,400
Exactly.

354
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,486
So what if we register
Floyd under self-pay

355
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,697
with a different
name and a different

356
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,156
- no.
- No.

357
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,366
- We can't do that.
- Uh-uh.

358
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,535
- What am I saying?
- It's fraud.

359
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,370
It's called fraud.

360
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,163
I know. Yeah, I know.

361
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,265
Can you just forget I said that?

362
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,500
Mm-hmm. Sure.

363
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,086
It just sucks that all
we can do for Floyd

364
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,422
is make him an
appointment with his PCP.

365
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,674
All right. I'll sign
off on his discharge.

366
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,843
Hold on. Let me think
on it for a bit.

367
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,594
Maybe there's something
more that we can do

368
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,888
that won't cost Floyd
a small fortune.

369
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,181
Yeah, sure.

370
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,982
Jordan.

371
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,026
I'm Dr. Archer.

372
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,652
Yeah, I, um...

373
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,029
I remember.

374
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,322
Well, vaguely.

375
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,491
Thanks for bringing me back.

376
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,493
I thought that was the big one.

377
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,120
No, no, no. Your heart's fine.

378
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,289
Your cardiac tests were normal.

379
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,957
Your troponins were
a bit elevated,

380
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,435
so your heart was
under some stress,

381
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,294
but nowhere near the
level of a heart attack.

382
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,797
Yeah. Yeah, this time.

383
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,716
Next time, though.

384
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,011
Men in my family just
drop dead out of the blue.

385
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,888
Both my father and his father

386
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,391
died of heart attacks when they
were the same age I am now.

387
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,227
- No warning at all.
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

388
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,105
I certainly can
understand your concern.

389
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,816
But I assure you, it
was no heart attack.

390
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,318
Then why'd I collapse?

391
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,028
It's most likely from

392
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,238
a transient abnormal
heart rhythm.

393
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,823
It's not uncommon.

394
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,909
They're often harmless.
They're blips.

395
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,744
No.

396
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,287
This wasn't a blip.

397
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,247
I know what I felt.

398
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,750
It's the family curse,
and now it's my turn.

399
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,959
Damn it.

400
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,753
I eat
right. I don't smoke.

401
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,756
I don't drink. I
exercise like a maniac!

402
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,442
I
see a GP, a cardiologist!

403
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,301
I am on top of my health,
and yet here I am!

404
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,637
Okay, okay, okay. Breathe.

405
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,264
Breathe, Jordan.
Come on, breathe.

406
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,731
Hearts don't just skip a
beat at random in my family.

407
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,026
All right? They give out.

408
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,696
Well, on occasion, and I'm
not saying this is you,

409
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:31,366
but sometimes transient
abnormal rhythms

410
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,953
are caused by cardiac miswiring.

411
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,289
Yeah, so I can repeat
the EKG and get an echo,

412
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,917
and we can go from there.

413
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,169
I'll try anything.

414
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,256
I just want answers.

415
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,299
I'm terrified.

416
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,802
All right. All right.

417
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,058
- Hey, Marcel.
- Hey.

418
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,560
Hey, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

419
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,270
How'd surgery go for our MVC?

420
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,771
Smooth sailing.

421
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,499
Packed his pelvis, got the
bleeding under control,

422
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,358
embolized in angio.

423
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,485
Ortho has to go back
in to reduce and fixate

424
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,338
the pelvis, but a couple
of months, some rehab,

425
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,739
he'll be good to go.

426
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,240
Oh, that's great.

427
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,176
And knowing that he's on the
mend means we can settle up.

428
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,411
Barbecue versus Cajun fish fry.

429
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,555
Cajun fish feast.

430
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,788
I'm not an amateur.

431
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,582
And I'm not just a
helicopter pilot.

432
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,918
- Grill master extraordinaire.
- If you do say so yourself.

433
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,463
- So we dug in here?
- Yep. How you wanna handle it?

434
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,174
- Best of three?
- Uh, no.

435
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,176
- No, one and done.
- Let's go.

436
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,927
Rock paper, scissors, shoot.

437
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,138
And barbecue it is.

438
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,514
Lucky break.

439
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,308
Oh, please, dude,
I'm a surgeon too.

440
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,061
I know the first instinct
is to throw scissors.

441
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,479
Oh, hey, Maggie, you got a sec?

442
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,855
Only if you walk with me.

443
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,065
Look, I just received

444
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,751
my general surgery
credentials here at Med.

445
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,234
Mm-hmm.

446
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,712
Also applied for my trauma
surgery fellowship in July.

447
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,072
- Nice. Good luck.
- Thanks.

448
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,239
You know, in the meantime,

449
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,383
I'll be around
the ED more often,

450
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,910
so if I can ever
help out, hit me up.

451
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,871
Will do. Are you
flying anywhere today?

452
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,956
No, shift just ended.

453
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,460
- Treatment 7.
- Scrubs are in the locker room.

454
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,878
Welcome to the
team, Dr. Johnson.

455
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,507
Okay, no problem.

456
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,509
And that's scheduled
for tomorrow.

457
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,594
Ah, great. Caught you.

458
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,429
All of Isaiah's
tests were negative.

459
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,223
No fractures, no head injury.

460
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,474
Then he's not hurt?

461
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,268
- He's fine.
- Oh, thank goodness.

462
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,775
Whew.

463
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,570
Excuse me, Ms. Goodwin.

464
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,449
Dr. Washington. Thank you.

465
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:47,836
So, ladies, Wyatt
just texted me.

466
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,256
- Oh, no.
- Mm-mm.

467
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,299
Uh, that's, uh

468
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,260
- yeah, that's his...
- Oh!

469
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,803
- Penis?
- Yeah.

470
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,597
Yeah, no, I was expecting
"Made reservations for 7:00."

471
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,100
Instead, bam, full frontal.

472
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,351
Mm-mm.

473
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,395
- Your first D-pic?
- Uh, yeah.

474
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,521
Yeah.

475
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,606
Why, you've gotten one before?

476
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,817
- One? I'm to at least five.
- Oh, I've got...

477
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,943
What? Okay.

478
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,945
Well, then, so, what
was he thinking?

479
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,531
He sends this to me and
I'll just start swooning?

480
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,409
I think some men
are still cavemen.

481
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,244
Is that portrait mode?

482
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,996
Hmm.

483
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,084
Ooh. You see that?

484
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,378
Underneath the shaft,
next to the frenulum?

485
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,838
Some kind of lesion?

486
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,881
Syphilis?

487
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,133
It's hard to tell. It could be.

488
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,802
Disease is on the rise because
of penicillin shortages.

489
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,347
Flashing his junk like that?

490
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,866
Gotta assume that
he's sexually active.

491
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,308
Means he could be spreading it.

492
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,101
Oh, he's gotta get checked out.

493
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,603
Yeah.

494
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,955
That means that I actually
have to respond to this

495
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,981
and get him to
take it seriously.

496
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,483
What... what do I type?

497
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,318
Just keep it clinical.

498
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,652
I don't know.

499
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,880
I think you have to
speak his language,

500
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,340
make sure that he
really gets the message.

501
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,949
- May I?
- Mm, yeah.

502
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,911
Unfortunately, I'm
fluent in alpha male.

503
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,749
"Nice pic."

504
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,503
"Meet me in the ED. I want..."

505
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,505
"I want to see that
thing in person."

506
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,508
Oh. Good luck with that.

507
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,054
Hi. Dropping off
from Odyssey Labs.

508
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,055
Odyssey?

509
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,556
You sure you're in
the right place?

510
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,059
Doris, I got it.
Thank you very much.

511
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,769
Are you looking for
me, Maggie Lockwood?

512
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,354
Yes.

513
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,814
- Where do I sign?
- Right here.

514
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,357
Thank you.

515
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,026
Now, please get out
of here quickly.

516
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,654
Floyd's now got a
low-grade fever.

517
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,507
Says that his bloating and
nausea has gotten worse,

518
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,282
and there are no tests
this hospital can run

519
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,951
anywhere near his price range.

520
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,577
That's okay.

521
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,954
I took care of his blood work.

522
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,289
Lab results? How
did you get these?

523
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,041
I outsourced Floyd's tests

524
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,168
to the lab contracted to
his insurance company.

525
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,171
Everything's covered by his
HMO and nothing out of pocket,

526
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,232
leaving Med out of the loop.

527
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,549
Shady!

528
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,801
But no fraud or lying.

529
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,178
So?

530
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,347
His EOS is a little high.

531
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,976
- That's it? Elevated EOS?
- That could be from anything.

532
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,978
Simple allergy all
the way to cancer.

533
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,063
And the only way to narrow
it down is more tests.

534
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,398
A CT to start.

535
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,401
We're right back
where we started.

536
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,739
I just... I can't let him
just walk out of here.

537
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,199
I need to make
this right somehow.

538
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,869
Yeah.

539
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,456
You see something?

540
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,599
- Oh, it's bad, isn't it?
- No.

541
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,083
Try and keep still, Jordan.

542
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,461
Oh, God!

543
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,130
Oh, this is it.

544
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,923
Oh, this is it.

545
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,110
- My chest is getting tight.
- All right, come on, Jordan.

546
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,054
Just deep breaths.
Deep breaths, come on.

547
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,222
I can't breathe!

548
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,223
I can't breathe!

549
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,892
Two of Versed.

550
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,494
All right, we're gonna give
you something to calm you down.

551
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,580
In the meantime, I want you to
breathe with me, Jordan, okay?

552
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:53,980
Four seconds in, come on.

553
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:58,068
Okay, four seconds out.

554
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,738
Jordan? Ah, he's coding.

555
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,490
- Damn it, no pulse.
- Need a hand?

556
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,367
All right, yeah. Bag him, okay?

557
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:08,203
Crash cart! Yeah, yeah, a V-fib.

558
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,623
Start compressions.

559
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,000
All right, charge to 200.

560
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,004
All right, clear.

561
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,424
Still no pulse.

562
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,927
All right, again.
200. Milligram of epi.

563
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,011
Clear.

564
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,892
No.

565
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:34,312
All right, again.
200. Milligram of epi.

566
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,563
Clear.

567
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,193
Pulse is back. ROSC.

568
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,363
All right, let's replay.

569
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,577
Ultrasound's a little fuzzy.

570
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,013
He was clearly
moving around a lot.

571
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,331
But overall, heart looks good.

572
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,625
Yeah, wall motion is normal.

573
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,585
Then why the arrest?

574
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:01,631
I'm wondering
that myself.

575
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,108
He still tachycardic?

576
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,017
Yeah, heart rate's in the 130s.

577
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,269
Given it just hit
190, I'll take it.

578
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,687
Hey, I was thinking, uh,

579
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,939
your patient going from
panic attack to full arrest

580
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,208
in the blink of
an eye could mean

581
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,735
there's a heart signaling
or conduction issue.

582
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,254
Yeah, those are at
the top of my list.

583
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,738
I'll run some more tests.

584
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,408
Uh, appreciate the help.

585
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,909
Yeah.

586
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,704
Dr. Archer?

587
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,123
CT's waiting for
you on line three.

588
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,709
Got Floyd's CT.

589
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,336
Wait, how?

590
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,379
Tech ran it off
book. We cut a deal.

591
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,964
What kind of a deal?

592
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,301
The kind that gets things
done without red tape.

593
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:49,262
No fraud, no lying, promise.

594
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,973
Come on, fire it up.

595
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,560
Calcification and inflammation
on the abdominal wall.

596
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,145
Seriously, nothing else?

597
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,480
A normal scan is a good thing.

598
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:59,981
Yeah, of course.

599
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:03,068
But just doesn't explain
any of his symptoms is all.

600
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,652
We've been sneaking
around all day,

601
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:05,570
and we haven't gotten anywhere.

602
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,113
Well...

603
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,883
All right, uh, I just got
a call from radiology.

604
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,910
Seems a CT tech

605
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,788
didn't close down his
window when his shift ended,

606
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,539
and he left up
images of a patient

607
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,958
who's not listed on the log.

608
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,478
You can't go to CT
without bloodwork first,

609
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,713
and yet, not one test
run through our lab...

610
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,382
Well, actually, that was me.

611
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,676
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- So what she has is catching?

612
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,302
Dr. Archer, I can explain.

613
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:33,139
My patient, Floyd, he's
got a really crappy HMO.

614
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,600
His preventative care was
literally preventing his care.

615
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,061
I've seen that movie before.
It doesn't have a happy ending.

616
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,997
Yeah, well, at this rate,
neither does your career.

617
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,540
You've already flamed
out of two hospitals,

618
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,167
and you're doing your best
to flame out of a third.

619
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,484
I hear you. I overstepped.

620
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:47,028
Okay, and we get it.

621
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,823
We won't dig the hole
any deeper, okay?

622
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,743
Archer.

623
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,537
What was that about?

624
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,663
What was that about? Uh

625
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:57,848
it was about Dr. Ahmad trying

626
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,100
to make a good first impression.

627
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,309
You know, I missed
everything about this place

628
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,711
during my recovery
except idiot residents.

629
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,587
And there he goes.

630
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,589
Goodbye, Dr. Gratitude.

631
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:07,590
All right, can we get somebody

632
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,467
to take this thing down, please?

633
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,890
I know you're still
feeling crummy, Floyd.

634
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,559
But all your test
results were negative,

635
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,953
so it makes me think
you're just fighting a bug

636
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,186
you picked up on the road.

637
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,772
Gonna just let it
run its course then.

638
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,274
I wish I could have
been more help.

639
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,901
Oh, you tried.

640
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:29,029
Confirmation with your
primary care physician.

641
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,655
What's another
three weeks, right?

642
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,449
Thanks, Doctor.

643
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,458
Dr. Archer looking for me?

644
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,878
No.

645
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:45,837
I think he's going
out of his way

646
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,505
to avoid both of us for now.

647
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,427
Sorry about today.

648
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,513
I shouldn't have led off
by using an outside lab

649
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,057
for Floyd's bloodwork.

650
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,475
I set a bad precedent.

651
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:01,478
It was inspiring, but
I made my own choices.

652
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,982
Mind If I pry?

653
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,234
Oh, you're wondering
why, aren't you?

654
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,487
I'm actually wondering who.

655
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,905
From the start,

656
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,908
you were willing to commit
insurance fraud for Floyd.

657
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,576
A leap like that makes me think

658
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,079
treating him was really
about someone else.

659
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,039
Shirleen Watkins.

660
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,416
Hmm. Is she a relative?

661
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,586
Not blood, but
definitely family.

662
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,088
I was a surprise baby.

663
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,965
The next closest sibling
to me was nine years older.

664
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,259
I was in grade school.
They were adults.

665
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,596
My parents were great,
but they were just old.

666
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,932
You know, almost 60
and working full-time.

667
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,434
I was alone a lot.

668
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:45,605
Shirleen was our neighbor.
She was 24, super cool.

669
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,776
But my junior year
of high school,

670
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,445
- she came down with something.
- Mm.

671
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:56,533
We thought it was just a cold.

672
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:58,052
I was already
interested in medicine,

673
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,662
so I told her to see a doctor.

674
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,539
She had just started a new job.

675
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,168
Insurance hadn't kicked
in, so she put it off.

676
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,380
By the time her
insurance was active,

677
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,465
the runaround was so ridiculous.

678
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:13,550
Weeks were wasted before

679
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,986
she was able to
make an appointment,

680
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,429
- and by then, it was too late.
- What was it?

681
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,639
Lung cancer.

682
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,851
Oh.

683
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,228
She died six weeks later.

684
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,481
If not for the insurance BS,

685
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:31,443
then maybe she'd
still be around.

686
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,029
I'm sorry, Zola.

687
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,949
I was 16.

688
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,659
It still burns.

689
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,250
Oh, careful.

690
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,337
We don't want anybody else
to get any more X-rays today.

691
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,258
Oh, but the tickle monster
has been unleashed,

692
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:53,965
and he loves little
boys named Michael!

693
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,384
That's Isaiah, Dad.

694
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,805
- Knock, knock.
- Hope I'm not interrupting.

695
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,682
Hey, Isaiah. How
you doing, buddy?

696
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,105
Uh, so Bert, your MRI
shows a tear in your ACL.

697
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,858
We got two options for
you... rest and rehab,

698
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,777
or surgery to reconstruct it.

699
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,363
But you can't do that until
the swelling goes down,

700
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:19,699
so you don't have a
decision to make now.

701
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,034
Okay. Thanks, Doc.

702
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,911
Meantime, ortho will
be down in a few

703
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,829
to fit you with a
knee immobilizer,

704
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,873
just to give you
some added stability.

705
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,376
Immobilizer? Is it big?

706
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,628
I need to be able to drive.

707
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,048
It's bulky, but it's
your left leg, Bert.

708
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,800
You use your right
with the pedals.

709
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,093
You'll be able to drive.

710
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:41,012
Oh, yeah. My right
leg.

711
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,931
Your
father, without fail,

712
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:45,225
left is right, push is pull.

713
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,936
Thank goodness we
have revolving doors.

714
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,771
Well, I got to
imagine you had enough

715
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,398
of the ED for one day.

716
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,566
I'll get the discharge
paperwork going.

717
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,235
Nice meeting you all.

718
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,362
See you later, buddy.

719
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,072
- Thank you, Dr. Ripley.
- Yeah.

720
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,282
Now, now, where were we?

721
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:04,953
Oh, yes, I remember,
tickle monster!

722
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:10,083
Psst.

723
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,585
Well, here I am.

724
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:15,255
All of me.

725
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,757
This way.

726
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,799
Oh.

727
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,389
I can't believe it.

728
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,808
I get to play doctor
with a real doctor.

729
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,435
Oh, not so fast.

730
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,603
The doctor will be
with you in a moment.

731
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,730
What?

732
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,273
All right.

733
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,777
Hi.

734
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,613
I'm Dr. Ripley.

735
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,657
I hear you have a
lesion on your penis.

736
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,662
Floyd!

737
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,500
Here you go.

738
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,645
He went for deep dish pizza
right after being discharged.

739
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,297
Shortly after, he started
vomiting and couldn't stop.

740
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:00,383
Fever jumped to 102. Abdominal
pains also got worse.

741
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,386
Oh, it hurts so bad right here,

742
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,347
and the pain started
jumping up to my shoulder.

743
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:07,557
Don't press so hard!

744
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,518
Sorry, Floyd. I gotta
get a good look.

745
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,355
His gallbladder is inflamed
with pericystic fluid.

746
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:14,915
With the fever, it could
be acute cholecystitis.

747
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:18,068
- It needs to come out.
- I'll call surgery. Brandon!

748
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,652
No. Page Crockett.

749
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,964
Likely have to be open because
of his malrotation scarring

750
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,215
- from when he was a baby.
- All right.

751
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,824
You got it, Doctor.

752
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,494
- I can't afford an operation.
- It's an emergency now, Floyd.

753
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,371
Everything's
covered by your HMO.

754
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:36,044
So your father's gonna
be out of commission

755
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:37,925
for a while with his knee.

756
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,357
I know some nurses who might
want a part-time nanny.

757
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:41,399
Oh, that's okay.

758
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,546
I actually started putting
feelers out last week.

759
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:44,989
Really?

760
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:47,238
I think that Isaiah is getting
to be too much for Dad.

761
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,890
Last few weeks, he's been off.

762
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:52,060
He's forgetting things
and misplacing stuff.

763
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,813
The last few weeks? Or forever?

764
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:57,565
I know he's quirky,
but it's getting worse.

765
00:30:57,607 --> 00:31:00,568
He keeps repeating himself too.

766
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,155
Tara, your father has
always been a broken record.

767
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:06,741
I mean, how many times
has he told the story

768
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,744
about meeting Michael
Jordan in the DMV?

769
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:13,081
So you think it's
just Dad being Dad?

770
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:14,791
If the shoe fits.

771
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,671
You keep me in the loop
with that knee, okay?

772
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:20,964
You got it.

773
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:26,803
Love you.

774
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:30,265
Everything's fine.

775
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,476
Okay.

776
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,316
Is it syphilis?

777
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,277
No, actinic keratosis.

778
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,903
Oh, thank God.

779
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,613
Wait, is that still an STI?

780
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,490
No, it's a patch
of rough scaly skin

781
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,409
caused by UV exposure.

782
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,619
Based on the pic you sent me,

783
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,055
pretty clear you like
to bask in the sun.

784
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,165
Yeah, I guess I should
have worn sunscreen.

785
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:56,350
Should have left
it in your pants.

786
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,518
Well, then we wouldn't have

787
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:00,628
this great origin
story about how we met.

788
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,131
For real, you think that

789
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:04,466
we're gonna still date?

790
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:06,009
Yeah, it's a clean
bill of health.

791
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:07,677
Something to celebrate.

792
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:08,970
Hard pass.

793
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,597
I can't speak for all women,

794
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:14,100
but for me, getting blasted
with a closeup of your business

795
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,936
is a giant red flag.

796
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,980
- Oh.
- Bye, Wyatt.

797
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,066
Prepare for takeoff.

798
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,485
Seeing big brother and going in!

799
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:31,242
Difficulty in the air! Oh, no!

800
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,411
He's coming down
for a crash landing!

801
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,958
So I didn't have a heart attack.

802
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,752
I went into cardiac arrest.

803
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,712
- And they're different?
- Yes.

804
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:47,384
So a heart attack is when blood
flow to the heart is blocked

805
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,968
and is starved of oxygen.

806
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,222
Cardiac arrest is when the
heart suddenly stops beating.

807
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,640
Your arrest was caused by

808
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:57,519
a rare type of
arrhythmia called CPVT,

809
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,231
catecholaminergic polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia.

810
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:04,359
Heart starts beating so fast,
it essentially shorts out.

811
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,319
It's genetic.

812
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,113
- It's genetic?
- Yeah.

813
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,174
So that means my father
and grandfather had it too.

814
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:11,866
It's very likely.

815
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,719
It would have been easily
missed in your grandfather.

816
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:17,622
That era was the dark
ages for cardiac care.

817
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:21,459
So an autopsy, would have
looked like a heart attack.

818
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:22,895
As far as your
father is concerned,

819
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,546
your family history
now established...

820
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,464
So the family curse
is a strain of bad DNA

821
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:27,924
getting passed down?

822
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:31,845
Well, stress exacerbates
the condition,

823
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,739
and there's no shortage
of things to stress about

824
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,432
when you're in your 30s, right?

825
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:38,476
So it stands to reason
that CPVT presented itself

826
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,270
to you, your father,
and your grandfather

827
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,063
around the same age.

828
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,565
Is there a cure?

829
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,900
No, but it can be controlled

830
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:49,946
with beta blockers and an
internal defibrillator.

831
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,367
How long have internal
defibrillators been around?

832
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,703
Almost 45 years.

833
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,391
So if the doctors would
have figured this out,

834
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:03,001
my father could have had one.

835
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,587
And probably my grandfather.

836
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:09,674
Dr. Archer, if you hadn't
cared enough to keep digging,

837
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:14,512
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't
have been around much longer.

838
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,139
I'm very grateful.

839
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:25,124
Should have been thinking
gallbladder from the start,

840
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,734
especially when Floyd said that
he dropped a bunch of weight.

841
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:30,528
There was no vomiting, pain
was limited, no jaundice.

842
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,156
Plus, the CT didn't
see any gallstones.

843
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:34,949
Hey, hindsight's 20/20.

844
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,410
We're getting Floyd fixed
up. That's all that matters.

845
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:39,371
Well, if it's my
last case at Med,

846
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:41,039
at least I'll be
leaving on a high note.

847
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,540
Hey, Dean's no choirboy.

848
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:44,342
And he's definitely not
a fan of bureaucracy.

849
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:45,794
He gets it.

850
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,313
So you think all's
well that ends well?

851
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:48,630
I won't get fired?

852
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:51,508
Whatever happens,
you're a good doctor.

853
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:53,093
Appreciate that.

854
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,511
Gallbladder coming out.

855
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:00,058
Lat.

856
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,104
Abdominal wall feels
really inflamed.

857
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:06,981
Yeah, I saw that on CT,
a lot of calcification.

858
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:09,067
No, I don't think
that's the case.

859
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,777
Feels like something else.

860
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,380
Stomach is adhered to
the abdominal wall.

861
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:13,905
Scissors?

862
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,407
Thank you.

863
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:19,786
Ooh.

864
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:22,288
What are you seeing?

865
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,874
Not sure. Hemostat.

866
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:30,922
Ooh.

867
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:39,931
It looks like some
kind of bristle.

868
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,183
Oh, my God, I think I
know where that came from.

869
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:54,921
Nice going, distracting that
boy so he could get an IV.

870
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:56,924
The brother was a lot heavier
than you thought, though, huh?

871
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,479
Like an anvil.

872
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,285
I might have to learn
some magic tricks.

873
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,578
Easier on the upper body.

874
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,288
It's good thinking.

875
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,749
Check this out.

876
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,959
I have no clue what I'm
looking at here, man.

877
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:11,087
Oh, well, that is a nylon
bristle I just fished out

878
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:13,798
of the abdominal wall of
Zola and Maggie's patient,

879
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,261
Floyd, just like the
kind on barbecue brushes.

880
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:21,097
Oh, man, Floyd was in
Memphis a few weeks ago.

881
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,600
Shortly thereafter is
when his pain set in.

882
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,560
- A lot of barbecue in that town.
- Oh, yeah.

883
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,288
The bristle could have
fallen from a brush,

884
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:30,440
ended up in the meat, and
eroded through his stomach,

885
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,192
and migrated to
his abdominal wall.

886
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,526
Sounds about right.

887
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:35,695
Magic bristle theory? Really?

888
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:38,114
Oh, it's not as farfetched
as you would think.

889
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:40,200
Zola found a bunch
of documented cases.

890
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:41,493
One patient even died.

891
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:43,828
They found a bristle
during autopsy.

892
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,165
Okay. Guess we're
hosting a fish fry.

893
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:48,750
- Feast, Johnson.
- Feast.

894
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,627
- Feast.
- When is the shindig?

895
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,295
Saturday.

896
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:53,546
What, are you coming?

897
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:56,466
I don't know. I was
thinking about it.

898
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:00,595
Okay.

899
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,098
- What's up?
- Why wouldn't Maggie be there?

900
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:04,599
She's going through a divorce.

901
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,364
I heard everything
went well in the OR.

902
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,616
Your patient take a turn?

903
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,326
Nope.

904
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:27,288
Just hiding out, I guess.

905
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,166
Hmm.

906
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,043
The CT scan.

907
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:37,465
What'd you trade with the
tech to get him to run it?

908
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:39,050
My Ventra card.

909
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:42,262
His commute's on me for a while.

910
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:45,265
ICU lounge, 20 minutes.

911
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:52,272
I wish I could have
seen Wyatt's face

912
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:55,734
- when Mitch walked in.
- Oh, this is fascinating.

913
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:57,235
I just clicked a
link to an article

914
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,738
detailing how there's
still Neanderthal DNA

915
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,781
floating around the population.

916
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:04,200
Variants are associated
with a variety of traits:

917
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:07,037
Neurological, immunological,
and... get this

918
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,997
dermatological, where
they've been linked

919
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,708
to the development of
sun-induced keratosis.

920
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,209
Shut up.

921
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:16,046
- So Zola was right.
- Oh, my God.

922
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,714
Some guys really
are still cavemen.

923
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:19,257
That's hilarious.

924
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,676
And utterly depressing,

925
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:23,636
because now there's
actual science

926
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:26,389
that states that
dating is not for me.

927
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:29,559
Well, I bet the numbers are
still on your side, though.

928
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:31,478
Yeah, Google estimates

929
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,398
40,000 single men in
Chicago in your demographic.

930
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,251
So you've gotta click
with at least one of them.

931
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:38,943
Mm?

932
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,698
Yeah.

933
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,116
Maybe.

934
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,621
Get back to you.

935
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:53,249
- Hey.
- Hey, nice surprise.

936
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,091
So how was your grandson
and the ex-husband?

937
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:58,004
- Oh, they're both fine.
- Catastrophe averted.

938
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:01,341
And I'm sorry about that
deer-in-the-headlights stare

939
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,926
I gave you this afternoon.

940
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,886
It was just so much happening.

941
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:07,722
I didn't have the bandwidth
for worlds colliding.

942
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:08,932
Of course not.

943
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:11,059
It wasn't the time or the place.

944
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,937
And I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

945
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:16,398
Even though it's not a
shortcut to anywhere,

946
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:20,026
I sometimes cut through the
ED hoping to run into you.

947
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:22,445
And today, it was because
I wanted to be supportive,

948
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,823
but I really didn't know how.

949
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:29,035
You see, it's that
kind of honesty

950
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:33,123
that's gonna really
make me fall for you.

951
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,500
I'm done for the day.
You wanna grab dinner?

952
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,085
Wish I could.

953
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,254
I still got a few things
I gotta finish up with.

954
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:41,047
- Okay.
- But we still on for Friday?

955
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,008
- Oh, I can't wait.
- Aw.

956
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:46,136
Mwah.

957
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:52,684
- See you.
- All right.

958
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,898
Dr. Archer, I am so sorry...

959
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,775
I know, I know.
Yes, you're sorry.

960
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:02,110
You're sorry.

961
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:03,504
All right, you got
caught up in the moment.

962
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:05,071
It'll never happen again.

963
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,490
We're way past
apologies, Dr. Ahmad.

964
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,414
Primer for you for class.

965
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:16,374
- Class?
- Mm-hmm.

966
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,168
Medical ethics course.

967
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:21,338
Eight hours every
weekend for ten weeks.

968
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:23,923
I signed you up.
You start Saturday.

969
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:26,676
If I were you, I'd take notes.

970
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:29,262
So I'm not fired?

971
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:31,264
Not today.

972
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,683
That's something
to be grateful for.

973
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,859
Ma!

974
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:44,235
Tara, what are you doing here?

975
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:45,963
- Where is Isaiah?
- Michael's watching him.

976
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:47,906
I need to show
you something now.

977
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,866
I know you said
everything's fine with Dad,

978
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,802
but I was looking through
footage on the nanny cam

979
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:54,204
in Isaiah's room,
and I saw this.

980
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:56,289
Take a look.

981
00:40:56,331 --> 00:41:00,835
He goes to leave the room,
but he opens the closet door.

982
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:03,046
And he's just standing there.

983
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:05,340
He doesn't know where he is.

984
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,931
Something's wrong with Dad.

985
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:17,602
Damn.
