1
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:06,177
- You're gonna be okay,
I promise.

2
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:07,224
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:09,313
- Those lungs are shot.

4
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:12,142
- We're gonna find him a donor.

5
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:13,535
- Imagine the liability...

6
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:17,669
- If we declared this man dead
and taken his organs.

7
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:22,196
- Dr. Ahmad, you're suspended
pending an investigation.

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,024
- I appreciate
how much you've helped us.

9
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,026
- See ya around, Mags.

10
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:27,723
- Loren is a catch, Maggie.

11
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:28,724
Make your move.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,861
- Mr. Brenner, your liver is
going off to a father of three

13
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:37,385
in Milwaukee.

14
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:41,476
Pancreas to a librarian
in Indianapolis.

15
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:44,435
Kidneys to a social worker
in Cleveland

16
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,960
and to a new mom in Detroit.

17
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:51,355
But first, your heart is off

18
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,055
to a college student
in St. Louis.

19
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:02,062
Thank you for these gifts.

20
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,977
Okay, let's move on
to the lungs.

21
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,805
- We got you covered.

22
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,463
Doris, Dr. Johnson is about to
transport a heart to St. Louis,

23
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:14,074
and he just lost
his flight nurse.

24
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,379
He needs a replacement ASAP.

25
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:18,295
- Mm.
Sorry, Mags, I get airsick.

26
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:22,212
- The ED is not too busy,
so I'm gonna go.

27
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:23,996
Just giving you the brick.

28
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,216
- Well, all right.
I'm in charge.

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,218
- Easy. I'm coming back.

30
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,525
Hey.

31
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:34,137
So you're flying off
with Loren, literally.

32
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,139
Today the day you're gonna
let him know you're interested?

33
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:37,575
- It's work, Hannah.

34
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,490
- Absolutely.

35
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:48,151
- You asked for a nurse?

36
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,239
- Really?

37
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,719
You're filling in?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:52,286
- I thought you would have sent
Trini or Nancy.

39
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,853
- They're busy.

40
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:56,246
- Works for me.

41
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:00,511
- Europe.

42
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:05,821
- Uh, Navy station,
Rota, Spain.

43
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:07,127
- Asia.

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,477
- Naval hospital, Okinawa.

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,740
- Obviously, the U.S.

46
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:17,180
- Uh, Pearl Harbor,
Coronado, and Portsmouth.

47
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:19,182
- And yet you chose
to settle in Chicago?

48
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,358
- I like the unpredictability.

49
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,882
You're not gonna get
a near-freezing day in May

50
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:25,188
at those other places.

51
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:27,799
- I'll buy that,
but Honolulu, come on.

52
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,105
- Nah.

53
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,674
Hold on, hold on.

54
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,981
- Hey, hey, hey.
Watch out. You okay?

55
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,809
- Yeah, I think so.

56
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:39,724
The lady walked out in front
of me, and I totally lost it.

57
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,204
- All right,
I'm a doctor, all right?

58
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:44,555
Did you hit your head?
- No, my arm. I landed on it.

59
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,166
It's kind of tingly.
- All right, let's see here.

60
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,602
Let's see here.
Make a fist.

61
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:50,692
Extend and contract the elbow.

62
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:52,650
All right,
nothing's jumping out.

63
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,696
Yeah,
you didn't break anything.

64
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,438
Still tingly?
- No, it's gone.

65
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,396
Just an ego bruise now.

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,312
- Yeah, okay.
All right, you know what?

67
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:04,575
Arm starts swelling up,
just put some ice on it.

68
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,098
You'll be all right.
- Will do.

69
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,274
- All right.
- Thanks.

70
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,191
- Oof.

71
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,627
- Superman.

72
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,499
- Oh, it's just a--
just a bruised arm.

73
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,458
It's not a challenging case.

74
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,024
- Yeah, still,
you fixed him up.

75
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,504
You got him going.

76
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:22,245
You know, addiction medicine,
every case,

77
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:27,685
it's a deep dive into genetics,
life experience, environment.

78
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:29,470
Sometimes I wish
I could fix my patients

79
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,167
just as quickly as you did.

80
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,516
- I'm pretty sure
my patients feel

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,823
the less time with me,
the better.

82
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:38,130
- Come on.
You're a good guy, Dean.

83
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:40,916
- Let's keep that
between us, okay?

84
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:53,406
- Oh, I think that's Ashland.

85
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,452
And that's the apartment
I lived in

86
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:57,411
during nursing school.

87
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,543
- It's an entirely
different city from up here.

88
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:02,067
Every day is a walk down
memory lane.

89
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,766
That corner office
has got nothing on this.

90
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:09,423
- Oh, Dr. Marcel.
- Hey, Ms. Goodwin.

91
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:10,902
- Good morning.

92
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:13,296
Listen, I wanted you
to hear this from me.

93
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,472
I just met with
the emergency medicine

94
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,257
program director
as well as the board,

95
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:21,826
and Dr. Ahmad has been let go.

96
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:25,003
- That's too bad.

97
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,831
I'm sorry for Zola.

98
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,268
Well, thank you
for letting me know.

99
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:29,486
- Sure.

100
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:35,927
Mrs. Miller?

101
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,060
- There's a rumor
going around the ICU

102
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,105
that there's an organ donor
in the hospital.

103
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,585
- Yes.

104
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:44,849
Unfortunately, the lungs
were not a match to Carson.

105
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,595
Kendall, he's at the very top
of the transplant list.

106
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,554
The next pair of lungs
that match will be his.

107
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:55,469
- If they come in time.

108
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:59,037
Clots formed again in
the ECMO circuit last night.

109
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,344
They're forming
more frequently too.

110
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,346
- Yeah, I read that
in his chart.

111
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,002
- Dr. Marcel, I am trying
so hard to stay hopeful,

112
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:09,570
but you were concerned that
Carson wouldn't survive a week

113
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,920
on ECMO without lungs.

114
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,356
It's been over three.

115
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,447
- Yeah, well,
we've come this far.

116
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,797
Gotta keep the faith.

117
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:30,577
- Name's Perry Eastman.

118
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:32,767
He's 22 and flying high
on something.

119
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,812
Paramedics picked him up
a few blocks from CCU.

120
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,205
He's a college student.
- All right, thanks.

121
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:37,554
- On my count.

122
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:39,469
One, two, three.

123
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:44,256
- All right, Perry, if you're
able to take any of this in,

124
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,562
I'm Dr. Archer.

125
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:49,131
You're in the ED
of Chicago Med.

126
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,741
What the hell is this, bark?

127
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,569
- When we got there, he was
going toe-to-toe with a tree.

128
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:54,310
- I'm guessing the tree won.

129
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,790
- We were able to coax him
into the ambo,

130
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:57,400
gave him two of Versed
for medical control

131
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,402
to calm him down a bit.

132
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,969
He's all yours.

133
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,492
- Gee, lucky us.

134
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,847
All right, Perry, looks like
you only busted a few fingers.

135
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,415
All things considered, I'd say
that's a pretty good outcome.

136
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,591
Let's get ice on these hands
and an X-ray

137
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:16,811
and also the usual
from the OD menu.

138
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:21,816
- Chest X-ray, EKG, CBC, BMP,
pan CT, and a urine tox.

139
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,339
- Have security
check his clothes,

140
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,428
make sure he doesn't have
any more drugs on him.

141
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,343
- Yeah, you got it.

142
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,086
Dr. Archer, um, I have

143
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,479
a situation with my patient.

144
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,263
- Why are you whispering?

145
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,091
- Well, it's not
exactly with my patient.

146
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:39,137
She just has a sinus infection.
- Oh, Zach, get to the point.

147
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,618
- Right.
It's my patient's husband.

148
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:43,315
Look.

149
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,318
- Under his jacket.

150
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,885
You see it?

151
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,758
His name is Greg Sanders.
- Is he a cop?

152
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,368
- No, an accountant.

153
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,414
- Wow, that's a problem.

154
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,243
- What's going on?

155
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,028
Thought you said Florence
only had a sinus infection.

156
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,203
- It is.
This isn't medical.

157
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,509
- I got this, Dr. Hutchins.

158
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,511
Mr. and Mrs. Sanders,
I'm Dr. Archer.

159
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,034
I'm chief of the ED.

160
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,775
First, Mrs. Sanders,
I'm sorry

161
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:09,124
you're not feeling well.

162
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,692
Second, Mr. Sanders,
your firearm is poking out

163
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,258
from under your jacket.
- Oh.

164
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,825
- Outside of law enforcement,

165
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,740
firearms are not permitted
in the hospital.

166
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,351
- I have a
concealed carry license.

167
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,005
- Permit or not, it's a felony

168
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,224
to have a weapon
in the hospital,

169
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,400
so either
you stash it in your car

170
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,054
or leave the premises with it.

171
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:28,404
Otherwise, security is
gonna have to get involved.

172
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,015
- I'll keep it covered.
Problem is solved.

173
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,496
- Not on my end.

174
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,672
- Honey, it shouldn't be
that much longer.

175
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,545
Why don't you just
wait for me outside?

176
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:40,547
- That sounds like
a great idea.

177
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,679
- Yeah, fine. Okay, yeah.

178
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,507
Just, you know,
if you need me, call me.

179
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,857
- Dr. Hutchins, how about
you walk Mr. Sanders out?

180
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,775
- I'm sorry.
- It's--

181
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,735
- Greg was mugged
a few months ago,

182
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:57,738
and the thief
pulled his wedding ring

183
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,870
right off of his finger,
so now he feels like

184
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:03,134
he needs the gun
to protect himself and me.

185
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:07,399
I don't like it, but I get it.

186
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:10,098
- I understand.

187
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,934
- My patient's been waiting
almost two years on a heart.

188
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,979
Thank you. Day zero.

189
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,851
- Second birthday.

190
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,945
Wow, that was powerful.
- Yeah, it hits deep.

191
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,686
- We'll never meet
that patient,

192
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,470
but we'll always know
that we helped save her life.

193
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,125
- Mm-hmm.
All right, let's go home.

194
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,386
- Yeah.

195
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:44,261
- Ripley called in sick.

196
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,263
Flu's going around.

197
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,308
Is that what it is?

198
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,266
- How should I know?

199
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,442
- I figured you might,
that's all.

200
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,489
- Dr. Asher,
you have a patient in three.

201
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,187
Mallory Bates--
fatigue, nausea,

202
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:57,798
diarrhea, and a low fever.

203
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:00,148
- Okay, I'll take a look
at her chart and be right in.

204
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:01,584
- Yeah.

205
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:05,370
- Anyway, regarding Ripley,
chicken soup may help,

206
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,372
you know, if you talk to him.

207
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:11,812
- Talk to me.

208
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,292
- June Bishop, 28,
suicide attempt.

209
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:17,382
Witnesses saw her jump
from her fourth-floor balcony.

210
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:19,646
BP 90 over palp.
Heart rate 118.

211
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,604
Intubated in the ambo
with no drugs.

212
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,258
Peri-arrest
the whole ride here.

213
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,608
No movement at all.
- Okay.

214
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:26,870
All right, here we go, folks.

215
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:29,351
Nice and easy.
On my count, okay?

216
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:31,483
Ready? One, two, three.

217
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,355
Start a unit
of whole blood, please.

218
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,622
Breath sounds bilateral.

219
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:42,625
Compound fracture,
left humerus.

220
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,888
No rock in this pelvis.

221
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,936
No deformity of the legs.

222
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,067
Pinching the feet.

223
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:54,811
No response to pain.

224
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,204
Sternal rub.

225
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,640
Again, no response.

226
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:00,164
Mike, let's get X-rays,
chest and pelvis.

227
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,558
Okay, I got a massive
head trauma and blood loss.

228
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,821
Brain's exposed.

229
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,954
I think some of it's missing.

230
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:09,652
- Chest X-ray up.

231
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,828
- Okay, multiple
left rib fractures,

232
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:14,004
large pulmonary contusion,
left side.

233
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,572
- Pelvis X-ray up.

234
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,443
- All right, pelvis is normal.

235
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:20,054
Might be the only thing
that is, though.

236
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:22,230
All right, guys,
let's roll to the CT.

237
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,971
- My wife? Where's my wife?

238
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,843
June--June Bishop. June?

239
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:29,498
Is that June? June? June?
- Sir? Sir!

240
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,152
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

241
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,719
I'm right here, baby.

242
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,851
It's gonna be all right, okay?
I love you.

243
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:37,506
- Sir, please. I'm so sorry.

244
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,594
We gotta get through.

245
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,987
Dr. Charles, please.

246
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,032
You gotta let us
get through, okay?

247
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,904
- Sir, sir.

248
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,427
I'm Dr. Charles.

249
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,908
Now they're gonna take
the best possible care of her,

250
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,561
but we've gotta let them
do their job, all right?

251
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,085
- Okay.

252
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:52,913
- So I want you to come down
here with me, all right?

253
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:03,488
- I was at work,
and my neighbor called,

254
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,883
and he said that

255
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,406
he saw June jump.

256
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:12,367
I just don't get it.

257
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,456
Why? Why would she do this?

258
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:18,242
I don't--I don't understand.

259
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:21,898
- You notice any, I don't know,
changes in her mood recently

260
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,987
that were unusual?

261
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,122
- No, I don't think so.

262
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,777
And we just got married,
you know?

263
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,779
We bought a condo.

264
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,346
Um, she likes her job.

265
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,697
You know,
she's close with her family.

266
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,351
She's got a lot of friends.

267
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:44,965
- In her day-to-day life,
no changes there, either?

268
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,575
- Um, I don't--

269
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:49,230
I don't really know.

270
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:53,974
The last few weeks, I've been
kind of absent, you know?

271
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:57,020
Um, work's been crazy.

272
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:59,414
I've been pretty much
living at the office.

273
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:06,160
What if--what if
that was the problem, me?

274
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,422
- No.

275
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,859
- No, neglecting June,
being a bad husband.

276
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,818
- No.
- What if--what if

277
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,645
I'm the reason this happened?
- Nathan.

278
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,213
- Oh, my God, this--
this is my fault, isn't it?

279
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:19,347
- Nathan, it's not
your fault, all right?

280
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,392
The reasons that people
take their own lives,

281
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:24,569
it's just very complex
and mysterious,

282
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,528
and it's rarely just one thing
or one person.

283
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,182
- No, June--

284
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:31,751
June wanted to talk last night,
but I had another long day.

285
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,231
You know, I was exhausted.

286
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:37,626
She was reaching out for help,
and I ignored her.

287
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:40,455
And now--now she--

288
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:43,937
- Mr. Bishop?

289
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,069
- No, no, please.

290
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:47,592
- Mr. Bishop,
your wife suffered

291
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,377
a catastrophic head injury.

292
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:53,033
Trauma to her brain
is extensive,

293
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,775
and all we can offer at
this time is supportive care.

294
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:02,303
She's now on a ventilator
in the ICU.

295
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:03,608
The nurse can take you
to see her.

296
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:09,571
- I'm so terribly sorry,
Mr. Bishop.

297
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:10,659
I really am.

298
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,449
- This is gonna be brutal.

299
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:21,539
- Hey, Dan,
June's chart shows that she--

300
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,280
she was seeing
a doctor here at Med,

301
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:26,501
Valerie Clark, psychiatrist.
- Oh.

302
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:30,940
- Ooh.

303
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,594
- Does that hurt, Mallory?

304
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:34,901
- No, no, it's just tender.

305
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:38,165
My whole body feels tender
and exhausted,

306
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,210
probably from trying
to shake this fever.

307
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,865
- How long
has this been going on?

308
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,475
- A week or so.

309
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,651
I thought I was pregnant,
but the home test was negative.

310
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,218
Thank God.

311
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,960
I just moved to Chicago
and started a new job.

312
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,920
That is all I can handle
right now.

313
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,399
- I can understand that.

314
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,881
You take care of you,
and the rest will follow.

315
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,796
- You're the nicest doctor
I've had so far.

316
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,145
- So far?

317
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:03,755
- I went to urgent care.

318
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,540
They said it was a cold.

319
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,151
When I started feeling worse,
I went to East Mercy.

320
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,850
They thought
it might be the flu.

321
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,853
- Hmm. Well, it's possible.

322
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,943
The flu is
going around right now.

323
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:19,293
- I don't know.

324
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:22,513
I had the flu in January,
but this feels different.

325
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,907
I told that to the resident
at East Mercy.

326
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,823
He ordered some labs,
but then he disappeared.

327
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,043
I felt so crappy.

328
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,566
I just went home.

329
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:32,915
Never got my results.

330
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,221
- Well, that's okay,
because you're here now,

331
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:36,397
and we will start over.

332
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,795
- You know, flying a helicopter
is a balancing act.

333
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,363
The three main controls have
to work together as one.

334
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,888
It's all about synergy.
- That sounds like the ED.

335
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,847
- Well, you gotta think
just as fast, that's for sure.

336
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,196
- Oh, really?

337
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,198
Oh, what was that?

338
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:57,287
- Collecting some moisture.

339
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,072
Look, I'm gonna drop us down
to about a thousand feet,

340
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,725
see if we can't
duck under this weather.

341
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,946
Loren, what's going on?

342
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,296
- Yeah, we're losing lift.

343
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,516
Ice is forming
on the rotor blades.

344
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,734
- Ice? But it's May.

345
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,084
- Yeah, well,
it's winter at 3,000 feet.

346
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,520
Okay, Maggie,
I need you to hold on tight.

347
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:14,217
I'm gonna take us down
really fast,

348
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,958
try to get us
below this icing level.

349
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,177
- Oh, my God.

350
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,526
- We're dropping
through 500 feet,

351
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,006
and the ice on the rotor
isn't melting.

352
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,311
Okay, Maggie, I need you
to brace yourself.

353
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,747
I'm gonna take us down.

354
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,271
It's gonna be a hard landing.

355
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:27,970
- Oh!

356
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,586
- Hey, Maggie, you hurt?

357
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,588
- Just shook up.

358
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:38,938
But I'm not injured.

359
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,809
- That's good.
- You okay?

360
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:42,767
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

361
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,213
- Mr. Bishop?

362
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,173
Hi, my name is Sharon Goodwin.

363
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,523
I'm with patient services.

364
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:03,005
I'm so very sorry
for your loss.

365
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:06,966
And unfortunately,
there's no good time

366
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,229
to bring this up,
but would you be open

367
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:10,926
to speaking
with a representative

368
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,973
from Organ Donors of America?

369
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:18,064
- I figured someone was gonna
come and ask me that.

370
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:19,979
And I believe
in organ donation.

371
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,633
I think it's a wonderful thing.

372
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:26,463
But no, I do not wanna talk
with them

373
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,249
because June
is going to wake up.

374
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:33,253
You know,
the first time that we

375
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:37,997
held hands was in the winter.

376
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,347
It was freezing cold.

377
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:44,655
But she was so warm.

378
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,615
She still is.

379
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:50,618
So I have to believe
that she's still in there.

380
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,623
So however long it takes,
I will sit here

381
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:59,322
holding June's hand
until she wakes up

382
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:02,064
so I can apologize
and we can talk.

383
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:08,243
- I will leave you alone
with your wife.

384
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,079
- He said no.

385
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,907
- Perhaps you can speak
with him later.

386
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:22,171
- No, I don't think so.

387
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:24,217
June's blood group
indicates that she's

388
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,134
a possible organ donor
to my other patient, Carson,

389
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:31,137
but we all know
what happened to Zola.

390
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,052
In cases like these,
it's easy to overstep,

391
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,879
and I don't wanna
influence Mr. Bishop

392
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:38,100
into making a decision
he's clearly not ready to make.

393
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,278
- Hey, everybody.

394
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,151
Everybody,
just gather around please.

395
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,414
I've got news to share.

396
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:50,286
Uh, just learned
that Loren and Maggie

397
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,332
hit some weather
during their flight,

398
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,030
and their helicopter went down.
It is not a crash.

399
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,381
It is just a--a hard landing.
- What does that mean?

400
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:00,514
Are they okay?
- They seem to be fine.

401
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:03,865
Uh, the area they went down in
is remote.

402
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:07,086
Loren is in contact with 911
and the helicopter company,

403
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,913
and they're working out a plan.

404
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:12,395
Loren is an army guy,
so Maggie is in good hands.

405
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:15,659
All right, let's--
let's get back to it.

406
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:18,097
- The urine tox came back
on your patient, Perry--

407
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,142
cocaine and PCP.

408
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,666
- Cocaine and PCP?
That's a jolt.

409
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,407
Explains him trying
to beat up a tree.

410
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,495
- Security went through
his clothes,

411
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,975
didn't find any more drugs.

412
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,586
- Okay, has ortho checked out
his busted fingers?

413
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,631
- They said soon.

414
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,589
- Okay, that means a few hours.

415
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,983
Do me a favor, uh,
get those pamphlets

416
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:36,941
on drug treatment,
meet me in there, all right?

417
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,553
- I got it.

418
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,383
- Ah, damn it. Trini!

419
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:47,474
Damn it. Perry bolted.

420
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,258
His clothes are still here,
so he can't be far.

421
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:51,652
Look at this.
You believe this?

422
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,089
Secret compartment in his shoe.
Security missed it.

423
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,612
- Emergency stash.
- If it's cocaine

424
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:58,659
laced with PCP,
then he's wired as hell.

425
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:01,096
All right, get security
to start looking for him,

426
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,837
tell them to check
the bathrooms.

427
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,968
- You're gonna fight me?

428
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:05,970
- Get back!

429
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,189
- Scratch that.

430
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,800
Tell them to get to ambo bay.
- Yeah.

431
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,759
- Get back!
Get back! Get back!

432
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,456
- You're gonna fight me?
You're gonna fight me?

433
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,849
You're gonna fight me?
You wanna fight me?

434
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,678
You're gonna fight me?
You're gonna fight me?

435
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:18,809
- Get back!

436
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,463
- I'm gonna fight you.
- Perry, stop.

437
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:22,117
Perry, stop. Perry.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

438
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,989
- I'm warning you, get back!
Get back!

439
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:34,651
- Mr. Sanders?

440
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,263
- Huh?

441
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:55,954
- Bilateral breath sounds.

442
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:58,460
- BP 112/72.
Heart rate 118.

443
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:02,592
- Two holes, left deltoid,

444
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,247
close together,
through and through.

445
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:09,904
Two holes, upper left arm,
another through and through.

446
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:13,429
Single hole, upper left
quadrant of the belly.

447
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,736
Uh, need to roll him, please.

448
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,216
Yeah. No exit wound.

449
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,655
Mike, need images,
chest and torso.

450
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:24,353
- X-ray.

451
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:26,660
- No bullet. Torso?

452
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,663
- X-ray up.

453
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,142
- Retained bullet,
left abdomen.

454
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,796
All right, that means surgery.

455
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,408
Coming to the hybrid OR.
Rails up.

456
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:37,105
Trini, I need six of blood
and six of plasma waiting

457
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,846
for me when we get there.
Let's go.

458
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:42,980
- Well, she's grounded.

459
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,679
One of the main rotor blades
is cracked.

460
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:46,810
The company
will have to figure out

461
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:49,073
how they wanna recover it.

462
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:51,598
Meanwhile, volunteer search
and rescue is coming for us,

463
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,556
but we're in
the middle of nowhere,

464
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,471
so it's gonna be a few hours.

465
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:58,648
- Yeah, there could be
worse places to wait, right?

466
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,781
Yeah.

467
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,696
- Loren, are you okay?

468
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,306
- Yeah, cyclic jammed me
in the chest

469
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,438
when we hit the ground.

470
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:06,656
I think it might have
broken a rib.

471
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,311
- Oh.

472
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,704
Oh.

473
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,488
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay.

474
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:14,229
There you go.

475
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,187
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

476
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,191
Your pulse is thready.

477
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,324
Okay, why don't you lie down?

478
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,239
There you go.

479
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,676
Okay, I'll go get
the trauma bag.

480
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,331
- Yeah. Oh.

481
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:38,253
- Give me your arm.

482
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,776
There you go.

483
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:44,694
Tell me what you're feeling.

484
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:46,087
- It's tough to breathe.

485
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,437
My chest is really tight.

486
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:52,920
- BP 94 over palp.

487
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,530
- That's too low.

488
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:56,053
What do you hear?

489
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:58,882
- No air moving
on the left side.

490
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:01,798
Tension pneumothorax?

491
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:02,930
- Touch the skin.

492
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,282
It looks bad, doesn't it?

493
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,936
- I've seen worse.

494
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,851
- Is it crackly?

495
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,855
- No crackles.

496
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:17,336
- Probably not
a tension pneumothorax.

497
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:21,252
- Hemo pneumo.

498
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:23,080
You're bleeding
into your chest.

499
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:24,560
- Pressure's collapsing.

500
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:26,867
Okay, look, you're gonna
have to decompress me.

501
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,696
- Seriously?
There's no chest tube kit.

502
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,219
There's only a Cordis kit here.

503
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,178
- It'll have to do.

504
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:38,792
- Okay, okay, okay.

505
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:43,405
- I'm sorry, Dan,
it's just shocking.

506
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,886
June Bishop jumped
from her balcony?

507
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,410
- This morning.

508
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:51,848
- I'm absolutely stunned.

509
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:54,982
I'd only recently
started seeing her.

510
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:58,159
I didn't detect
any suicidal tendencies.

511
00:22:58,202 --> 00:22:59,943
- Yeah, I'm having
a little trouble with it

512
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:01,118
myself, you know?

513
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,598
Just the lack of
warning signs, you know,

514
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:06,602
the no note, and the overtly
public nature of the act.

515
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:09,170
I mean, female suicides tend
to be more private, right?

516
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:11,694
And this is just anything but.

517
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:14,436
Do you mind me asking what
you she was seeing you for?

518
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,872
- Insomnia.

519
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,657
It was a recurring issue
that had been at bay

520
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,920
and recently came back.
- Huh.

521
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,269
- She works from home,
so she'd been

522
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,619
taking naps during the day,

523
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:26,579
but her sleep cycle
has really been suffering.

524
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,972
- Insomnia can be tricky.

525
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:32,280
Any idea why maybe
it resurfaced now?

526
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,673
- We only had two sessions.

527
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:36,023
I hadn't yet landed on a cause.

528
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:38,112
I recommended that
she get a sleep study.

529
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:40,462
She emailed me and said
that she'd had it done

530
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,683
and that she would bring the
results to our next session.

531
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,467
- As you might imagine,
her husband, Nathan,

532
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,251
is just an absolute mess,

533
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:50,341
but he didn't mention to me
this morning that his wife

534
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:51,647
had been seeing a psychiatrist,

535
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:54,563
and it makes me wonder,
maybe he didn't know.

536
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,130
- He didn't.

537
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:58,567
She was planning to tell him
after the sleep study.

538
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:00,917
With everything that Nathan
was dealing with at work,

539
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,310
June really wanted to make sure

540
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:04,051
that she was working
on a solution before

541
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:05,792
she dropped her baggage
in his lap.

542
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:07,968
- Huh.

543
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:14,627
- Hey, how is your patient,
Mr. Eastman?

544
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,498
- He's stable. And Greg?

545
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,458
- The detectives are getting
his version of events,

546
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,416
but the video
and witness statements

547
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,505
point to him acting
in self-defense.

548
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,072
- It looked
that way to me too.

549
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:29,076
- Well, legally, I don't
expect charges to be filed,

550
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,472
but emotionally,
he's shattered.

551
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,038
- Well, he found out
what it feels like

552
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,300
to actually shoot someone.

553
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:44,178
- Okay, Mallory,
I'm seeing your stomach

554
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:47,268
is a bit distended,

555
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:50,097
and I'm seeing
some dilated loops of bowel.

556
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,707
- Which means?

557
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,796
- Right now, it's hard to say.

558
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,233
The bowel can be really
reactive to inflammation.

559
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:59,933
So it could be gastroenteritis
or an obstruction

560
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:01,717
or maybe even an ileus.

561
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:04,024
That's when your intestinal
muscles don't contract

562
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,329
the way that they need to.

563
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,723
And the next step
is an NG tube.

564
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,596
It'll go in through your nose,
down into your stomach.

565
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:12,293
- In my nose?
- I know.

566
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:15,557
It doesn't sound pleasant,
and it's not,

567
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,560
but it will ease your nausea,
and you'll feel better.

568
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:21,868
- Well,
that's worth it, I guess.

569
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,435
- Okay, well, after the tube,
I'd like to get a CT

570
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,481
so we can take a better look
at your abdomen.

571
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,700
- Tubes?

572
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,440
Scans?

573
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,704
I was hoping
all I needed was an antacid.

574
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:32,748
- I'm sorry.

575
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,144
- Wait.

576
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:40,321
You're OB,
but I'm not pregnant.

577
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,628
Am I getting passed off
to another doctor?

578
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:45,108
- That is how it works.

579
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,373
But, you know, I--

580
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:53,116
I know what it's like to need
someone in your corner,

581
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,945
so I'm not gonna
disappear on you.

582
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,077
Okay, Mallory?

583
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:05,912
- Yeah?

584
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:08,958
- Hey, Daniel.

585
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:12,222
I just got a call from the ICU.

586
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,790
June Bishop's nurse
says that Nathan

587
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,749
refuses to let go of her hand.

588
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,055
It's interfering with her care.

589
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:21,449
And I'll tell you,
I sat with him for a bit,

590
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:24,147
and he's clinging
to false hope.

591
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:25,888
I'm--I'm worried about him.

592
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:28,369
- Yeah, you and me both.

593
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,371
- What's all of this?

594
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:32,852
- Everything that we know
about June Bishop.

595
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,636
It's, um, you know, her charts,

596
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,292
uh, it's session notes
from Dr. Clark,

597
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:40,337
you know, her shrink
that I was telling you about,

598
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,905
the sleep study that
she ordered a couple weeks ago.

599
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,428
- What are you looking for?

600
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:46,430
- Look, we know that
she stepped off that balcony,

601
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:48,171
right?
But suicide?

602
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:51,435
I mean, just not quite
making sense to me yet.

603
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,916
So I'm just looking
for some other reason

604
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,962
that makes a little more sense

605
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,486
for Nathan
to wrap his head around

606
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,444
so he can start to process.

607
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:03,099
- I'll let you get back to it.

608
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,927
- Thank you.

609
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:07,669
- Lidocaine going in, but
I think it's still gonna hurt.

610
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,845
- Yeah, if it's pain
or death, I'll deal.

611
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:11,673
- Okay.

612
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:12,979
One...

613
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:16,635
Two...

614
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:20,377
Okay, okay, okay.

615
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,641
All right, through the muscle.

616
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:25,861
- And I'm in. Oh.

617
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:28,037
Okay, okay.

618
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,083
- You're doing great, Maggie.

619
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,086
- Hang in there, Loren.

620
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:35,218
You're doing great.

621
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:39,222
Tube is in.

622
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:40,746
Okay.

623
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:45,620
Diluters coming out.

624
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,621
- Ah.

625
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,673
- Okay. Okay.

626
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,022
- Nice job.

627
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,502
Now we can both breathe
a little easier, huh?

628
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:01,244
- Yeah.

629
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:03,812
You're losing a lot
of blood, Loren.

630
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,945
- The helo carries two units.

631
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,207
- That's it?

632
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,036
- It'll be enough.

633
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,648
- Yeah, yeah.

634
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:20,369
- And then you got shot,
three times to be exact--

635
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:22,091
shoulder, arm, and belly.

636
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:25,268
- Man, I don't remember
any of it.

637
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:27,314
I went out
to a party last night,

638
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:29,882
and I ended up here.

639
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:32,885
Sounds like you fixed me up
real good, though.

640
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:35,409
Saved my life, even.

641
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:37,803
Thank you.

642
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:39,979
- So, Perry, you're gonna
be here in recovery

643
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:43,069
for a couple hours,
ICU for a few days,

644
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:44,853
and then the hospital floor,

645
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:46,768
and then eventually
outpatient care.

646
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,727
- You'll still be my doc, yeah?

647
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,164
- Technically.

648
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:55,124
But now you've been admitted
to trauma service.

649
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,779
There'll be other residents and
attendings taking care of you.

650
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,781
- Okay.

651
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:01,870
I guess this is goodbye, then.

652
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:05,569
Thanks again.

653
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:08,224
- Yeah.

654
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:10,966
- I understand,
but I've got a nurse

655
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,882
that just placed a chest tube.

656
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,146
Well, how long until

657
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,367
your search and rescue team
gets there?

658
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,152
Okay, okay. Thanks.

659
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:24,980
- Wait, Maggie placed
a chest tube?

660
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:26,460
Dean said everyone was fine.

661
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:28,244
- Well, it seems Dr. Johnson

662
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:30,420
was more injured
than he let on.

663
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:33,510
Maggie got him stabilized,
but now they're running low

664
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:35,338
on oxygen and blood.

665
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:38,167
The SAR team is moving
as fast as it can.

666
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:41,257
Doris, give Dr. Archer
the update

667
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:44,434
and share the info
with the rest of the ED.

668
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:45,696
- It's gonna be dark soon.

669
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,610
That's gonna slow
the SAR team down.

670
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,003
- Yeah.

671
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,004
- The CT results for
your patient, Mallory.

672
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:50,353
- Thank you, Trini.

673
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:52,529
- Listen, uh, when I get
more info, I'll find you.

674
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:54,053
- Okay, thank you.

675
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,971
- So what did the scan show?

676
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:02,061
- There's an obstruction
in your right heavy pelvis,

677
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:03,497
a mass.

678
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:06,413
- A mass?

679
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:11,810
Is--is that, like, a tumor?

680
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,376
Cancer?

681
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,336
- I can't say for certain,
but that is a concern.

682
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:19,469
- It was a stomachache,
that was all,

683
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:22,559
and now I have an IV
and a tube in my nose

684
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:26,215
and possibly cancer?

685
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,086
I wanna go home.

686
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:28,609
- I'm sorry, Mallory.

687
00:30:28,652 --> 00:30:30,741
Because of your fever,
the distended stomach,

688
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:34,049
dilated bowel,
whatever this mass is,

689
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:36,051
we need to get it out
immediately.

690
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:37,618
- You mean, like, today?

691
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:40,316
- I mean, like, right now.

692
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:51,719
- Um, is he--

693
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,155
- He's gonna be okay.

694
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:57,899
- I keep playing it over
and over again in my head.

695
00:30:57,943 --> 00:31:00,032
I'm sorry.

696
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,642
I'm so sorry.

697
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:03,600
Please, will you tell him?

698
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,784
- And when I walk home
from work at night,

699
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:17,266
sometimes it can be scary.

700
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,616
- Mm-hmm.

701
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,488
Thought of getting a gun?

702
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,839
- Yeah.

703
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,406
- So what do you think now?

704
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:32,238
- This is a scan
of June's brain

705
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,979
when she's asleep, all right?

706
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:36,764
You'll notice that these areas,
right, this one

707
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:39,593
controls movement,
sight, speech.

708
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:41,334
Those are all active.

709
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:43,597
But this area up here,
the prefrontal cortex,

710
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,034
not active.
- Okay, what does that mean?

711
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:48,297
- Well, the prefrontal cortex,
it's our--

712
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,909
it's responsible for--
for awareness, right?

713
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,736
It's our--
it's our decision maker.

714
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,130
- So you're saying that Jean
could walk, talk and see,

715
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:56,740
but had no idea
what was going on?

716
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:57,959
- Yeah.

717
00:31:58,003 --> 00:31:59,308
- So then what was she doing?

718
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:02,964
- I think that your wife
was a sleepwalker.

719
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:05,271
- Sleepwalker?

720
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:08,056
- People have been known to,
you know, leave the house,

721
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,232
go for a drive, cook a meal.

722
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:12,626
And they've been known
to injure themselves,

723
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:14,715
you know, falling down
a flight of stairs

724
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:17,283
or even jumping out a window.

725
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:22,331
- I mean, there's been times
that I'd wake up

726
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,856
in the middle of the night,
and June would be, you know,

727
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,077
on the couch with the TV on.

728
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:31,645
One time, though,
she was at the table,

729
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,255
and there was food out.

730
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,997
And I just assumed that she
dozed off after having a snack.

731
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,825
Do you think
she was sleepwalking?

732
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:40,393
- I think
it's very likely, yeah.

733
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:45,311
- Wait, two weeks ago,
she stayed with her sister

734
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:47,617
up in Bucktown
for a few nights,

735
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:50,098
but she was actually
getting the sleep study done.

736
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:51,926
Why didn't she tell me
about any of this?

737
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,103
- I think that she was probably
just trying to be considerate,

738
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,323
you know, given what you
were going through at work.

739
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:59,238
I think that she
didn't wanna burden you

740
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:00,761
with it until
she had a better idea

741
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:03,372
of what she was dealing with.

742
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,721
- Do you think that's
what she wanted to talk

743
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:05,984
with me about last night?

744
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,681
- I think it's possible, yeah.

745
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:11,554
But listen, Nathan, even if
you had had that conversation,

746
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:15,123
last night, all June had was
the results of the sleep study

747
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,777
in terms of raw data, right?

748
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,040
She had not had
a clinical interpretation yet.

749
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:22,739
So if she didn't know
about sleepwalking,

750
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:24,002
how could you?

751
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:35,926
- How'd he take it?

752
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,625
- You know, he--
uh, he listened.

753
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:41,541
So fingers crossed.

754
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:52,856
- Your pulse is still thready.

755
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,510
It's worse than before.

756
00:33:57,165 --> 00:34:02,257
Oxygen tank is almost empty,
and...

757
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:04,651
catheter,
it's still draining blood.

758
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:10,831
We're gonna need more.

759
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:13,051
- We're out?

760
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,443
- Yeah.

761
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:18,839
I wish I could, um,
recycle your blood.

762
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:21,668
- You can't.

763
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,976
Where's the SAR team?

764
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,242
They should be here by now.

765
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:31,764
- I'm really cold.

766
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,809
- You're getting cold?

767
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:34,507
Okay.

768
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,818
Let me warm you up. Okay.

769
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:43,081
There you go.

770
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:46,867
- Maggie, I messed up.

771
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,303
- No, you didn't.

772
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,391
There was ice on the rotor.

773
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:52,132
You didn't do anything wrong.

774
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:56,703
- No, I--I messed up with you.

775
00:34:56,746 --> 00:35:00,489
The moment I met you,
I was like, "Damn."

776
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,886
But you were married.

777
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:08,758
And now you're not.

778
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:11,848
And I kept waiting for this
right moment

779
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:14,895
to ask you out, and...

780
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:16,244
Maggie, I--

781
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:19,421
Maggie, I--

782
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:25,079
I shouldn't have waited.

783
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:30,040
Yeah.

784
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:38,353
- Loren?

785
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:42,792
Loren?

786
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:45,839
- Dr. Loren Johnson.
This is a search and rescue.

787
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:48,929
- We're here! We're here!

788
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,454
They're here.

789
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:03,484
- Have you been following the
data on early onset cancers?

790
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,250
- It's on the rise
for people in their 30s,

791
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:06,555
especially in women.

792
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,296
You caught this one early,
though.

793
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,515
- I hope so.

794
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:11,517
- Lots of adhesions
in the pelvis.

795
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,909
This is odd.

796
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:15,216
- Right lower quadrant's
really socked in.

797
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,652
Looks to be all cecum.

798
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:20,743
- Peeling the small bowel
off the ab wall.

799
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,225
Whoa, suction.

800
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:25,357
- Is that pus?

801
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,749
- Yeah.

802
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,360
Hannah, there's
no mass in here.

803
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:33,278
What you saw on the CT was a
big clump of infected schmutz.

804
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,801
- Okay, well,
where's it coming from?

805
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:36,629
- That's a good question.

806
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,108
Sponge stick.

807
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,546
Give me this.

808
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:43,070
There we go.

809
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:47,030
Appendix is disintegrated
into mush, totally ruptured.

810
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:50,599
Well, ironically,
this is a pleasant surprise.

811
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:53,254
- Yeah, it means Mallory
doesn't have cancer.

812
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:58,041
- No, just an odd presentation
of a perforated appendicitis.

813
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,262
And urgent care thought
this was a cold?

814
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:03,525
- And East Mercy
thought it was the flu.

815
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,746
All that pus, Mallory easily
could have become septic.

816
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:08,269
- It's a good thing
you didn't pass her off.

817
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:10,228
By the time
a resident from medicine

818
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:13,231
would have seen her,
run it by their attending,

819
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,145
it've been too late.

820
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:16,408
Nice job.

821
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:19,019
All right, irrigation.

822
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:22,718
- Hey.

823
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:24,285
- Treatment seven.

824
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,417
- Doris, I'm good.

825
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,983
I'm out of the danger zone.

826
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,637
- Yeah, well, you're still
getting a full workup.

827
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,204
Zack, Trini, you're up.

828
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,468
- Chest tube out
of a Cordis kit? Nice.

829
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:36,166
- Nursing 101.
- Yeah, right.

830
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,125
- I'm just happy
that Loren's doing okay.

831
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:39,387
- Humble in
the face of victory,

832
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:41,302
that classic hero behavior.

833
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,130
- Oh, it's the ICU.

834
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,654
Nathan Bishop
wants to speak to me.

835
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:47,961
Look, Maggie, I gotta go.

836
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,963
But you had us
worried for a bit.

837
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:51,486
- Happy ending.
- Yes.

838
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:58,972
- An emergency landing
in the boonies?

839
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:00,800
Are you kidding me?

840
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:03,977
- And that wasn't even the most
unexpected part of the day.

841
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:07,937
- Oh, my.

842
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:09,591
- Girl, I'll call you later.

843
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:13,769
- Okay. Okay.

844
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,862
Doris, the Mariano's
around the corner,

845
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:20,907
how's their chicken soup?

846
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,778
- Mmm, so worth it.

847
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,307
- No, no, I get it.

848
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,614
I appreciate you trying.
All right.

849
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:34,834
Hey.
- Hey.

850
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:36,749
- Still no luck
in finding Carson the lungs.

851
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,359
- You don't need luck anymore.

852
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:41,449
Mr. Bishop's asked to speak
to Organ Donors of America

853
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:43,146
about June.

854
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,802
And this time, I think you
should join the conversation.

855
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:59,119
- Can you page me
when Mallory wakes up?

856
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:04,559
- You're back.

857
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:07,519
- I'm back.

858
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:10,957
And I was thinking

859
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,308
maybe I could stick around
through your recovery.

860
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,397
- Yeah, thanks.

861
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:17,703
I'd like that.

862
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:21,402
- And also,
there's another doctor

863
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:25,058
I was hoping you might want
on the team with me.

864
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:28,409
It's Dr. Collins,
addiction medicine.

865
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:33,719
- Perry...

866
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:36,852
beating up trees,

867
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,288
emergency stashes,

868
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:42,380
and secret compartments,
getting shot?

869
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,164
Where you are right now,

870
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,166
this doesn't seem
like a party, man.

871
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,255
This seems like a problem.

872
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,214
- Yeah.

873
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:58,787
I've tried to stop using
a few times.

874
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:02,138
I just keep slipping, man.

875
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:03,444
- I know.

876
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:06,316
So is that a yes, then?
You'll meet her?

877
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:10,364
- Yeah.

878
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,757
- Good.

879
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:24,334
- Hey, Perry.

880
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,562
- Okay, suture line is intact.

881
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,524
No leaks.

882
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:40,786
Nice and pink.

883
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:41,961
Good blood flow.

884
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:44,137
I like it.

885
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,140
Carson, my man,
you got new lungs.

886
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:49,359
They came from
a special young woman.

887
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,796
Her name is June.
