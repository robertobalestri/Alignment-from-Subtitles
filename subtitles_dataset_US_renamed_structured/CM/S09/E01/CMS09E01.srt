1
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:09,526
- OR 2.0 is the fruit
of years of development.

2
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,719
I know the tech.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,362
I promise you, it
won't let you down.

4
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:15,515
- You know tech, but
you don't know surgery.

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,975
- Are you having an affair?
- No.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,224
Never.

7
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:22,587
I don't know if Ben and I
are on a path to divorce.

8
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:24,083
- Dayton has bought
controlling interest

9
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,650
in the Gaffney Medical Group.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,111
- So I guess he's in charge now.

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,196
- We will be
livestreaming a surgery

12
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,407
for the entire world to watch.

13
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,700
- This is not a simulation.

14
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,011
There's a human
being on that table.

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,512
- I know, and you're
gonna save his life.

16
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,246
- And what if I don't?

17
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,940
What if he dies?

18
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:43,877
- I'm officially in end
stage renal disease.

19
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,296
- Sean is your best
possible donor match.

20
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,424
- I'm not taking my
son's kidney, Hannah.

21
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,968
Warning, warning.

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,012
- The platform is defective.

23
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,680
We gotta shut it down.

24
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,098
- I'm ruined, Sharon.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,059
I have to sell the hospital.

26
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,355
- Come on, Brice.

27
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,524
Brice, move your feet
for me.

28
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,276
Squeeze my fingers.
Come on, buddy.

29
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,778
Squeeze 'em.

30
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,422
On extrication, he was
moving all his limbs.

31
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,132
- There's nothing now.
- Listen up, everybody.

32
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,574
Listen up.

33
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,826
Multi-vehicle crash
on the interstate.

34
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,245
Mass casualties en route.

35
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,997
Ambos are about
to land right now.

36
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,917
Hannah, I'm gonna need you
for more than OB today, okay?

37
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,627
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

38
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,271
- Need to secure his
airway before he crashes.

39
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,756
0.2 mgs per kg etomidate,
0.6 mgs per kg roc.

40
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,799
- Got it.

41
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,219
- Tube.
- Ready.

42
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,595
- I'm in.

43
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,638
Bag him.

44
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,728
- Peter, I'm gonna
have to cut this short.

45
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,729
Take care.

46
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,106
Thank you.

47
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,732
- 25-year-old male.

48
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,443
Heart rate 115. BP 75/50.

49
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,320
GCS 13. Arterial bleed.

50
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,780
Tourniquet placed in the field.

51
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,782
- Ripley, with me in six.

52
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,824
- You got it.

53
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,954
- Dr. Marcel? ETA in five.

54
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,435
- Joshua, you got
enough with this.

55
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,478
That's a red tag. You're good.

56
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,795
Tracy, I'll be right back.

57
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,380
Oh, I'm sorry,
hold for a second.

58
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,923
That is a green tag.

59
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,633
Non-emergency for now, sir.

60
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,486
We're gonna have you wait
in the waiting room, okay?

61
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,886
Let's go back. You, too.

62
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,096
I'm so sorry.

63
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,180
That is a green tag also.

64
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,557
Everyone with a green tag,

65
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,993
you have to wait in
the waiting room.

66
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,268
Green tag in the waiting room.

67
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,311
Thank you.

68
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,730
- Check his arm, please.

69
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,406
Chest is clear.

70
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,907
What are you doing?

71
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,660
- Making sure this
is an arterial bleed.

72
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,788
Cuff works as a
secondary tourniquet.

73
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,415
Release it slowly,

74
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,559
and if the bleeding
has stopped...

75
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,460
- It's not an arterial bleed.

76
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,045
Not everybody knows that trick.

77
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,171
Very nice.

78
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,214
- So I pass?

79
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,516
Oh, God.

80
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,019
It all happened so fast.

81
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,520
I didn't mean it.

82
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,522
I tried not to hit
them. I couldn't stop.

83
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,524
- It wasn't your fault.
- Oh, my God.

84
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,276
- It's not your fault.
- Oh, my God.

85
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,698
- Let's see if we can find
somebody to take a look at you.

86
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,867
- We're doing our best
right now to get everyone.

87
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,868
All the information...

88
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,203
- Dolores Williams, is she here?

89
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,662
- Robbie. Robbie Wilson.

90
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,915
- Please, please, everyone,
go to the waiting room,

91
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,584
and someone will be out soon
to answer all your questions.

92
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,378
To the waiting room, please.

93
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,213
That's it. Cesar, talk to me.

94
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,756
- Ivy Vance, 30s.

95
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,233
Hit her head against the
interior of her vehicle.

96
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,884
Complaining of
headache, disoriented.

97
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,927
GCS 12.

98
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,303
- You're going to
treatment three.

99
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,614
- I got no movement
through the limbs.

100
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,182
- Got you.
- Coming in.

101
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,350
- I've got it.

102
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,851
- Easy.
- Yep, yep.

103
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,893
- Keep him steady.

104
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,605
All right, let's move. Ready?

105
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,279
- Hey, Maggie, you need
an extra pair of hands,

106
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,447
I could put the gloves on.

107
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,074
- I might take you up on that.

108
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,617
- Maggie, need ortho in there.

109
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,743
- Got it.

110
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,804
Oh, and you're going
to treatment three.

111
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,955
- Got it.

112
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,081
Zach, what do we got?

113
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,416
- Ivy Vance.

114
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,002
Few lacerations,
closed head injury.

115
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,461
- Okay. Hi, Ivy.

116
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,838
I'm Dr. Asher.

117
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,091
I'm gonna ask you
some questions, okay?

118
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,592
Okay.

119
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,802
So you hit your head.

120
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,053
- Uh-huh.

121
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,430
- Do you know where you are?

122
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,432
- Hospital.

123
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,102
- What day is today?

124
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,271
- Um...

125
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,106
Wednesday.

126
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,482
- Okay, everything's good.

127
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,210
We just need to check that
head bump out, get a CT.

128
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,028
Sound okay?

129
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,321
- Transport.

130
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,827
- What's that?

131
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,120
- Hamster.

132
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,162
Came in with her.

133
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,168
- Yep. Maggie.
- Yeah?

134
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,503
You're going to Baghdad.
- I got a ten-year-old boy.

135
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,464
Brice Morgan. GCS 7.

136
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,049
Vehicle was crushed
under a semi.

137
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,426
Father died at the scene.
Mike, X-ray. Let's go.

138
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,219
- Got it.

139
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,972
- Jimmy, take over.

140
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,724
Mike, give me a
cross-table C-spine.

141
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,767
- Yep.

142
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,771
- Clear.

143
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,233
- The ligaments.

144
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,568
Is that even possible?

145
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,821
- Yeah. He's
internally decapitated.

146
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,282
- The only thing holding
his head on is his skin.

147
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,638
- Jack.
- Hey.

148
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,516
Eight-year-old boy
with a head lac.

149
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,393
- He's my son.
- We'll take good care of him.

150
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,412
Keep that compress on his head.
You're going to treatment two.

151
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,938
Thanks, Jack.
- Mm-hmm.

152
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,732
- Dean. Hey.

153
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,733
You're getting a
new kidney tomorrow.

154
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,069
Take it easy.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

155
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,573
Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah?

156
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,118
- The boy's mother's here.

157
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,578
- Okay.

158
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,789
- Ms. Morgan, I'm Dr. Marcel.

159
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,916
I know you lost your
husband. I'm very sorry.

160
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,463
- My son, Brice, please
just tell me he's alive.

161
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,798
- He is.

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,109
But he has been
critically injured.

163
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,676
Here.

164
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,554
Oh, my God.

165
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,265
No, no, no, no!

166
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,851
- Look, I'm gonna do my
very best to help your son.

167
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,769
Okay, but I don't wanna
minimize the severity

168
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,396
of Brice's condition.

169
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,690
He suffered what's called

170
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,900
a bilateral atlanto-occipital
dislocation.

171
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,920
What that means is that the
ligaments from his skull

172
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,280
have separated from
his spinal column.

173
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,489
- Oh, no. No.

174
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,658
- We're gonna do
a CT and an MRI,

175
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,927
and that's gonna
help us determine

176
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,661
how to proceed surgically, okay?

177
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,912
- Surgically.

178
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,205
- Yes.

179
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,749
It's necessary in
order to stabilize

180
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,958
the head to the spine.

181
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,127
And let's page
Dr. Abrams, please, okay?

182
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,589
- Liz, Dr. Abrams is
a great neurosurgeon.

183
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,132
Okay?

184
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,467
- All right.

185
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,926
Why don't you come be with him?

186
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,219
Come on.

187
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,557
- Hey, baby.

188
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,227
It's okay, Mommy's here.

189
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,438
Mommy's here.

190
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,939
- Maggie.

191
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,566
- Matt.
- Harris Shorr, 40s.

192
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,901
Injured in that accident.

193
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,295
His right arm is
swollen and bruised.

194
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,755
Complained of
dizziness on the scene.

195
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,989
GCS 15. Heart rate 110.

196
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,258
Respiratory rate 25 per minute.

197
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,868
- All right, you're
going to treatment four.

198
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,744
I'll have a doctor in
there as soon as possible.

199
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,579
- Are you done yet?

200
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,039
- Almost.

201
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,420
Decision time, AJ.

202
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,755
We got two types of bandages.

203
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,633
We've got Wolverine
or Spider-Man.

204
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,967
What's your poison?

205
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,178
Poison? I don't want poison.

206
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,223
No, honey, he's asking
which one you want.

207
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,599
- Oh. Spider-Man.

208
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,142
- All right.

209
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,688
My friend here will fix you
up. I'll catch you later, AJ.

210
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,357
- Dr. Asher, here's Ivy's CT.

211
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,859
I got in touch with
her emergency contact,

212
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,277
a woman she works with.

213
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,529
- No family?

214
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,114
- It doesn't seem like it.

215
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,591
The woman explained
about the hamster.

216
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,033
She said it's probably a rescue.

217
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,494
She says Ivy likes to
find homes for things.

218
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,037
- Aw.

219
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,039
Well, it looks like she
can continue to do so.

220
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,208
I'm just seeing a
small contusion.

221
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,544
Nothing serious.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

222
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,922
- Yeah, well, I
will let her know.

223
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,591
Hey, Ivy.

224
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,218
How you feeling?

225
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,137
- Better.
- Good.

226
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,806
Well, good news, your CT didn't
show any concerning injuries,

227
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,433
so we're gonna give
you a neuro check

228
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,685
every couple hours just to
make sure everything's okay.

229
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,062
- Thank you.

230
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,566
- Your work friend said that
you like to rescue animals.

231
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,317
- They're family.

232
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,820
- Yeah. I guess I
can understand that.

233
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,157
I mean, we are all related,
from fish, to hamsters,

234
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,742
to us, so...

235
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,411
- And we all need a home.

236
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,122
- That we do.

237
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,540
- I was rescued.

238
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,714
I was in a very bad place,
and someone took care of me.

239
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,507
- Yeah.

240
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,634
I can relate to that.

241
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:16,264
It is a good thing that people
like you are in the world.

242
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,109
Hey, Archer.
- Yeah.

243
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,361
- Who is that?

244
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,447
- That's the new ED
attending. Name's Ripley.

245
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,782
- Ripley?
- Yeah.

246
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,159
- Huh. Look so familiar to me.
- Yeah?

247
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,370
- What do you, uh, what
do you know about him?

248
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,954
- Ah, he's really smart.

249
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,457
Got a full ride to Columbia.

250
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,834
Got great references.

251
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,048
- Hmm.

252
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,634
- Dr. Ripley, help me
with a patient in four.

253
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,427
I just sent you the chart.

254
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,973
- Mr. Shorr.

255
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,725
Harris is fine.

256
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,976
This is my wife, Audrey.

257
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:06,064
- I'm Dr. Ripley,
and this is, um,

258
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,733
Maggie Lockwood,
our charge nurse.

259
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,859
- Mrs. Ben.

260
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,277
- Excuse me?

261
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,279
- Oh, our son Michael was
your husband's student.

262
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,323
We met last year at
parent-teacher night.

263
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,700
- Oh.

264
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,244
- So you two were
in that pile-up?

265
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,537
- Tried to avoid it.

266
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,872
Harris lost control of the car.

267
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,833
- I don't know what happened.

268
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,544
I got dizzy.

269
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,296
Also, I think I broke my arm.

270
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,173
- X-ray.
- Yup.

271
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,344
- Let's get AP and lateral views

272
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,597
of the right upper
arm and forearm.

273
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,640
You say you got dizzy?

274
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,600
- That's been happening a lot.

275
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,810
- And you're short of breath?

276
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:44,853
- A little bit.

277
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,230
Clear.

278
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,108
- Non-displaced fracture
of the distal radius.

279
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,901
Afraid you do have
a busted wing.

280
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,653
- Get ortho down
here to take a look?

281
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,530
- Please.

282
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,490
Your blood pressure's high.

283
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,284
Did you know that?
- No.

284
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,036
- It says here you're on lithium

285
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,997
as well as quetiapine
and lamotrigine.

286
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,165
- Yeah, I'm bipolar.

287
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,208
- He's been managing very well.

288
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,376
- That's good.

289
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,687
But I am concerned
about your breathing,

290
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,588
blood pressure, the dizziness.

291
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,048
I'd like to do more of a workup.

292
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,508
- I wish you would. I've
been worried about him.

293
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,470
- But you're okay,
Audrey? Nothing hurts?

294
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,096
- No.
- Okay.

295
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,808
- Please give our
regards to Mr. Ben.

296
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,227
- Let's start with
standard blood work.

297
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,271
I'll come back
soon and follow up.

298
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,482
- Thanks, Doc.

299
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,109
- Since Mr. Shorr is
on mood stabilizers,

300
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,004
shouldn't we have psychiatry
take a look at him?

301
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,738
Dr. Charles is on call.

302
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,198
- I don't wanna
bother him just yet.

303
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,550
Let's just see
what the labs show.

304
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:40,742
- All right.

305
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,164
- Oh. How's she doing?

306
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,750
- Emotionally, she's a wreck.
Thinks it's all her fault.

307
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,585
Physically, I don't know yet.

308
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,836
I found a bruise on her scalp,

309
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,171
so I'm ordering
a non-contrast CT

310
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,673
to see if there's
something there.

311
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,914
- Okay. Keep me posted.
- Sure.

312
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,265
- She's in V-fib.

313
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,701
- Set up the paddles.
Start bagging.

314
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,769
- On it.

315
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,937
- Charge to 120.

316
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,440
- Charging.

317
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,609
- Clear.

318
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,902
- No pulse. 1 epi milligram.

319
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,320
- Coming.

320
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,215
- What happened... gotta
be the head trauma, right?

321
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,782
I mean, she doesn't even...

322
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:21,842
she doesn't have
any other injuries.

323
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,784
- No, it shouldn't be happening.

324
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,327
- Charge to 200.

325
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,370
- Charging.

326
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,412
- Clear.

327
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,958
- Another 1 of epi.

328
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,876
- 200 again.

329
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,294
Charging.

330
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,504
- Clear.

331
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,298
- Okay, okay.

332
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,053
I got a pulse.

333
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,742
- Her, um... her
pupils are blown.

334
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,493
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

335
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,370
Watch out, watch out.

336
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,378
She's brain dead, isn't she?

337
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,257
- Let's, um, let's intubate.

338
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,092
Put her on a vent
until we confirm

339
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,594
and hear from her contact.

340
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,225
- What, did I miss something?

341
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,522
Is there something
else I could have done?

342
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,232
- I sincerely doubt that.

343
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,401
- I'm OB/GYN. This
isn't what I do.

344
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,529
- Probably a pseudoaneurysm
the CT didn't pick up.

345
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,864
- Or I didn't see it.

346
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,366
- Hannah, nobody did.

347
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,617
All right?

348
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,969
This kind of thing
happens. Not your fault.

349
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,244
- Really?

350
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,638
Hardly your area of
expertise, either.

351
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:02,943
- It's true. I can
perform miracles.

352
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,386
But this?

353
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,429
I mean, I've never
seen such distraction

354
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,431
and dislocation
of skull to spine

355
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,100
and still have
the patient alive.

356
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,768
- Yeah. I've been thinking.

357
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,454
It doesn't seem like we
could take the standard

358
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,664
posterior approach, not
with all the massive

359
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,564
scalp and neck lacerations.
- Yeah.

360
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,983
And an occipital bone only
a few millimeters thick.

361
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,902
- Yeah. So what do we do?

362
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,779
Go in through the mouth?

363
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,406
- Yeah.

364
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,116
Transoral.

365
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,283
- Are you serious?

366
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,469
- It's the only
option for anterior

367
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,120
atlanto-occipital
screw fixation.

368
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,122
But it's not a good one.

369
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,415
- Has it ever been done before?

370
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,709
- Once or twice in
cadaver studies.

371
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,168
- Cadaver.

372
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,479
Never on a live patient.
- That's correct.

373
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,754
And they were adult cadavers.

374
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,840
I have no idea if it
could work on a child.

375
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,970
- Survival rate for this
kind of injury is, what, 50%?

376
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,638
What do you give this kid?

377
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,726
- 5%, best.

378
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,564
- We gotta increase those odds.

379
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:07,323
- Dennis, the ED is overwhelmed
and has got to clear rooms.

380
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,660
Every department needs to
find beds for more patients.

381
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:15,123
Well, double up the private
rooms if you have to.

382
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,541
Come in.

383
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,168
- Ms. Goodwin.

384
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,087
We have a ten-year-old boy with
atlanto-occipital dislocation.

385
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,589
- I'm sorry to hear that.

386
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,025
- Yeah, well, the thing
is, we can't attempt

387
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,508
the standard surgical approach.

388
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,069
We have to try going
in through the mouth.

389
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,303
- Whoa.

390
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,888
- And why are you
bringing this to me?

391
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,891
- Because this has never
been done before on a child.

392
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,227
In fact, it's only been
done on adult cadavers.

393
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,649
I need you to
authorize my using 2.0.

394
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,234
- 2.0? No.

395
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,361
Come on, it's a disaster.

396
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,196
It hallucinated data.

397
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,655
You can't use the hybrid OR?

398
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,990
- Not up to the task.

399
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,077
- And you've managed to
put up guardrails on 2.0?

400
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,870
I think I have.
- Oh, you think?

401
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,372
- I've run simulations,

402
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,123
and the platform's
performed very well.

403
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,184
- Yeah, but not
with a real patient.

404
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,376
- No, not since...

405
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,128
- It sent this hospital
into bankruptcy.

406
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,630
- Look, 2.0's tech
is more advanced

407
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,423
than anything else
in this hospital.

408
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,302
I believe in it.

409
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,904
And I believe it's
that boy's only hope.

410
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,347
- Sharon, come on.

411
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,557
I mean, the liability,
potential lawsuits...

412
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,018
- Peter.

413
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,606
If it's the boy's only hope,
what choice do we have?

414
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,986
You have my authorization.

415
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,198
- Thank you.

416
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,368
- Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah?

417
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,955
Our new owners...
they're business people.

418
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,874
The surgery goes south,
they're gonna want your head.

419
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,169
- I hear you.

420
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,715
- And they're gonna
want your head too.

421
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,301
- What else is new?

422
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,767
- Dean, did you get Sean's text?

423
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,769
He was admitted to pre-op
for tomorrow's surgery.

424
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,771
- Oh. No.

425
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,249
- Hey, why don't you
go up and see him?

426
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,524
We'll manage.

427
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,742
- I'm sorry about your patient.

428
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,035
Are you gonna be okay?

429
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,303
- You mean, am I gonna
head to the ladies room

430
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,388
and shoot up?
- Oh, stop it.

431
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,706
- Sorry. Sorry.

432
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,166
Yeah.

433
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,500
- All right.
- I'll be fine.

434
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,336
- Okay.

435
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,758
- Dr. Ripley.

436
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,343
I'm Dan Charles.

437
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,719
We've met before.

438
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,763
Haven't we? We
know each other.

439
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,972
- Good memory.

440
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,474
It was 20 years ago.

441
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,808
I looked a little different.

442
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,478
- Dr. Ripley, take a look.
Mr. Shorr's labs are in.

443
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,482
- Excuse me.

444
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,906
Harris, Audrey.

445
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,116
- Hey, Doc.

446
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,660
- So...

447
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,455
your blood work shows
elevated glucose, LDL...

448
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,665
inflammatory markers.

449
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,251
Have you experienced
unusual weight gain?

450
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,003
Uh, yeah.

451
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,339
Look at this gut.

452
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,007
- These are all
metabolic symptoms,

453
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,386
which can be associated with
the mood stabilizers you're on.

454
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,679
- Is that serious?

455
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,389
- It can be life threatening.

456
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,890
- Oh, my God.

457
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,184
I knew something was wrong.

458
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,853
You think that his mood
stabilizers are the problem?

459
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,981
- What I think is that your
husband is overmedicated.

460
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,318
Too many medications and at
unnecessarily high doses.

461
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,653
They're putting him at risk.

462
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,363
- But his doctor
prescribed them.

463
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,407
- Doctors can be wrong, honey.

464
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,491
No offense.

465
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,369
What do we do?

466
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,537
- I wanna try taking you off

467
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,330
one of your meds,
the quetiapine,

468
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,791
and see if your metabolic
symptoms improve.

469
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,917
- Take him off?

470
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,436
- Just while he's
here in the hospital

471
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,045
where we can keep him
under observation.

472
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,715
If there is a problem, we
can put him right back on.

473
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,097
Yeah, okay.

474
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,057
Let's do it.

475
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,184
- Okay.

476
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,847
- Archer.

477
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,366
I just started the intake on a
little girl from the accident.

478
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,433
Maybe you wanna weigh in.

479
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,477
- All right, Hannah.

480
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,812
You've had a tough loss, and
I have every faith that...

481
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,107
- I'm asking because she's
a recent kidney recipient.

482
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,859
- Oh.

483
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,529
Hello, Kayla.

484
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,239
I'm Dr. Archer.
- Hi.

485
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,200
- Hi.
- I'm her dad, Tom.

486
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,618
- Yes.

487
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,970
I understand you got
a new kidney, huh?

488
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:03,953
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

489
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,663
- About three months ago.

490
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,791
- We're waiting on labs,
but Kayla is not showing

491
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,168
any obvious signs of
injury from the accident.

492
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,420
But her X-rays were good.

493
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,547
- I told you I was fine, Dad.

494
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,299
- She didn't wanna come in,

495
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,468
but, you know, I
worry about her.

496
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,511
- Of course.

497
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,887
BP's a little soft.

498
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,347
- She's tachy.

499
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,808
- I don't feel bad, really.

500
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,018
- All right, I'm gonna
touch your tummy, okay?

501
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,731
This hurt?
- No.

502
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,274
- No? How about here?

503
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,317
- Uh-uh.

504
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,360
- Here?

505
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,945
- Ow.
- Hmm.

506
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,364
- Uh, just hurts a little bit.
- Yeah?

507
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,866
Did this start today
after the accident?

508
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,451
- Maybe.

509
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,662
- Were you wearing
your seatbelt, Kayla?

510
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,206
- Dad doesn't drive
me if I don't.

511
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,541
- What are you getting at?

512
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,810
- When your car
stopped abruptly,

513
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,377
if the seatbelt was riding high,

514
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,838
it might have pulled across her
abdomen instead of her hips.

515
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,548
- So it could have
damaged her kidney?

516
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,841
- Well, possibly.

517
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,592
But let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

518
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,387
We're gonna send Kayla
for a CT to check, okay?

519
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,058
- It's okay. I'll be fine.

520
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,478
- Her kidney's
bleeding, isn't it?

521
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,230
- She could lose it, yeah.

522
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,492
- Hey. Daniel.

523
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,453
We are swamped. I'm
looking for beds.

524
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,414
Can you see if anyone
qualifies for early discharge

525
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:30,707
in the psych unit?

526
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,376
- From... yeah. Yep.

527
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,377
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

528
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,419
- Hey.

529
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,798
What's the matter?

530
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,427
- I ran into a
patient of mine...

531
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:43,904
well, actually, somebody
who was a patient of mine,

532
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,389
like, 20 years ago, when
they were a teenager.

533
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,849
- And?

534
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,142
- They were violent back then.

535
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,935
You know, put another
kid in the hospital.

536
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,122
I mean, they're... seemed to
really turn their life around.

537
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,899
Fancy college,
fancy... fancy job.

538
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,068
I mean, it's actually a
great story is what it is.

539
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,070
- So... so it's good?
- It's good.

540
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,613
It's really good. Yeah. Good.
- Okay.

541
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,823
Now you can help me out?
- Okay.

542
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,468
- Find me some beds?
- I'll look, yeah. I'll look.

543
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,786
- Okay. Thank you.

544
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,704
- Thanks, Dr. Cameron.
Appreciate it.

545
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,748
- Hey.
- Hey.

546
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,416
Dr. Cameron says
I'm good to go.

547
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,584
- Oh, yeah?

548
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,419
- Bloodwork,
imaging, all perfect.

549
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,129
Congratulations.

550
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:23,259
- Yeah.

551
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,553
Congratulations.

552
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,890
You don't have to
do this, you know.

553
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:33,395
- What are you talking
about? I want to do this.

554
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,897
I'm just sorry it
hasn't happened sooner.

555
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,273
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

556
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,441
- You're sorry?

557
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,943
What are you sorry about?

558
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,545
'Cause if anybody's got
something to be sorry for,

559
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,822
that's me.
- Dad, please stop.

560
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,493
Hey.

561
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,329
Do you remember that family
that lived next door?

562
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,956
The Barns?

563
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,458
- Yeah.
- Well, they had a daughter.

564
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,793
Sarah.

565
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,336
Just a couple years
younger than me.

566
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,715
Anyway, she lost her cat.

567
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,342
And she was crying
and everything.

568
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,261
Like, really upset.

569
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:11,016
So I went to look for it.

570
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:16,021
And weirdly enough, I
found it under our porch.

571
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,857
So I got it and I
brought it back to her.

572
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,318
And she was so...

573
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:27,741
Happy.

574
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:32,412
And it was, like, the
best day of my life.

575
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,622
Best day of my life.

576
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,374
Till now.

577
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,977
- I've often thought your
judgment was suspect,

578
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,892
but this, this might be your
most boneheaded idea yet.

579
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,019
- You know 2.0 is
Brice's best chance.

580
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:58,480
- Of what, dying on the table?

581
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,023
- So what you wanna do, Sam?

582
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,233
You want me to find
another neurosurgeon?

583
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,651
- No.

584
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,028
I'm the only one
who might be able

585
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,780
to save you from yourself.

586
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,466
But how in God's name are
you gonna be able to verify

587
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,741
what the AI is telling us?

588
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,951
- Oh, I won't be alone.

589
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,703
I'll be working with
the best neurosurgeon

590
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:14,913
on the planet, right?

591
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,255
- Tom, Kayla, this
is Dr. Cameron.

592
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,633
He's our chief of
kidney transplant.

593
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:27,967
- Hello.

594
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,512
Dr. Archer shared Kayla's
CT and labs with me.

595
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:34,265
- So, Kayla, your labs indicate
that even before the accident,

596
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,227
your kidney was not doing well.

597
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,896
- And the CAT scan shows
what we call an active blush,

598
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,981
which means the
kidney is bleeding.

599
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,567
It's... well, it's not
working at all now.

600
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,403
- Oh, God.

601
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,113
- It failed?

602
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,365
- Yes.

603
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,534
- So it's back on
dialysis, I guess.

604
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,952
- I'm afraid so.

605
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,638
- Yes, but first we
need to send you to IR.

606
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,247
That's Interventional Radiology

607
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:01,126
to embolize the kidney
to stop the bleeding.

608
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,669
- Okay.
- All right.

609
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,605
We need this done right away.
I'll go get things moving.

610
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:05,797
- Thank you.

611
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,969
- Dr. Cameron is gonna
take very good care of you.

612
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,554
Okay? He's the best.

613
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:16,016
And I know this because
he's my doctor too.

614
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,601
- You have kidney disease?

615
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,311
- Yes, I do.

616
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,899
- I'm really sorry.

617
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,654
- Oh, thanks.

618
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,909
Um, all right, there's
somebody gonna come, uh,

619
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,911
take you down to IR soon, okay?

620
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,053
Hey, Mark.

621
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,806
By any chance, is Sean
a match for Kayla?

622
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,767
- I'm sorry?

623
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:04,272
- Could Sean, you know,
donate his kidney to Kayla?

624
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,107
- Sean is donating
his kidney to you.

625
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,026
Why would you even ask that?

626
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,654
No.

627
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:12,989
He's not a match.

628
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,036
- Dean, can I talk to you?

629
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:23,625
- Yeah?
- What the hell?

630
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,835
You'd have Sean give
his kidney to Kayla?

631
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:26,795
- Hey, it's not your
business, Hannah.

632
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,421
Not my business.

633
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,340
Okay, that's pretty
cold, even for you.

634
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,109
- You've had a lousy
day. It's not my problem.

635
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,010
- No. Hey, hey.

636
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,763
All this time, I thought
that you were worried

637
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,032
about Sean giving up his kidney.

638
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,683
But that's not it at all.

639
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:42,227
What really bothers you is
that he's giving it up to you.

640
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,996
- Yeah, well, maybe because
there's a 13-year-old girl

641
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,039
out there who needs a kidney.

642
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,439
- And you don't?

643
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,857
Look at you.

644
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:50,735
- Listen, this is my son.

645
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,905
And he wants to sacrifice
a piece of himself for me.

646
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,156
- Yeah, he does.

647
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:56,449
- Look, I don't...

648
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,370
I don't deserve it.

649
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:03,164
All right? I was
a terrible father.

650
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:05,125
Do you get that?
- I get it.

651
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,253
- Do you get that?

652
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,213
I get it.

653
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,631
I get it. I get it.

654
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,299
You feel unworthy.

655
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,592
Yeah.

656
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,635
I'm an addict.

657
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,220
Okay, I... no, I know.

658
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:20,557
I know what it feels
like to be unworthy.

659
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,183
So does Sean.

660
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:24,227
And he knows about loneliness

661
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,104
and about being cut
off from everybody.

662
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,897
And take it from me,
drugs are a great way

663
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:29,375
to fill that space.
- Hannah, please.

664
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,860
- No, now you listen to me.

665
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,070
Your son doesn't
want drugs anymore.

666
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,989
He wants connection.

667
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:39,242
And he wants it
with his father...

668
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:42,579
his father, whom he loves.

669
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:48,418
You feel unworthy.

670
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,796
But if you deny Sean this,
you will destroy him.

671
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:19,342
- I don't wanna be
here. Let me go!

672
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:20,742
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

673
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,327
- No, I'm gonna go.

674
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,721
You gotta let me get
out of here, okay?

675
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,163
Let me out of here!
- Security!

676
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,623
- I said let me out of here!

677
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,833
Let me... I'm getting out.

678
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,335
No! They're gonna kill me!

679
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,128
They're gonna kill me. No!

680
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,089
Get me out of here!
- Okay, okay.

681
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,800
- No! No, why did
you bring me here?

682
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,259
- I'm good.

683
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:39,427
There you go.

684
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:41,637
There you go.

685
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,391
I'm good, guys. Thank you.

686
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,643
- Can I have a little quick
look at his chart, please?

687
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,693
Dr. Ripley, can I, um...

688
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,444
could I get a
quick word, please?

689
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,664
So you took Mr. Harris
off his quetiapine.

690
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:09,582
I'm just curious
why you did that.

691
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,126
- He's a bomb about to go off.

692
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,627
Did you look at his chart?

693
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:16,423
Dyspnea, high BP, blood sugar,
low HDL, central obesity.

694
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,425
I need to find out if
that's from his meds.

695
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,844
- And it didn't
occur to you to maybe

696
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,595
just call in psych
for a little consult?

697
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,180
I mean, I've been here all day.

698
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,765
- He's not your patient.

699
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,243
- He's looking an awful lot
like a psych patient to me.

700
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,560
- Not today.

701
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,204
Today, he's an ED patient
with metabolic syndrome.

702
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,415
- Who just flipped out 'cause
you took him off his meds.

703
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,291
- To keep him from having
a coronary or stroking out.

704
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:35,775
He is overmedicated.

705
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,818
- You can't know that.

706
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,778
- Quetiapine,
lithium, lamotrigine?

707
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,405
All neurotransmitter modulators.

708
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,948
They overlap.
They're redundant.

709
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,491
- They are not redundant.

710
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,302
The two mood stabilizers
are actually complementary.

711
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,911
Okay? And quetiapine...

712
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,830
- Yeah, yeah. You
guys love to medicate.

713
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,874
- You can't just stop it.

714
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,212
I mean, honestly, Dr. Ripley, I
think what you did today was...

715
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,756
a little reckless.

716
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:58,965
- Reckless?

717
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,800
- Reckless.

718
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:03,053
- Well, come on, Dr. Charles.
Why don't you just say it?

719
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,180
"Impulse control disorder."

720
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:06,741
Isn't that what you
called it back then?

721
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:09,726
- Oh, so you took him off
his meds 'cause of me?

722
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,561
- I took Mr. Shorr
off one drug,

723
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,313
the one most likely
to be causing

724
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:14,707
his metabolic
symptoms, and I did so

725
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,984
in a controlled
clinical setting.

726
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:21,905
Now, I'm an attending
physician at this hospital.

727
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:25,075
Do not treat me like the
boy you knew 20 years ago.

728
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,000
- Dissecting soft
tissue to prepare

729
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:38,213
the anterior C1 ring for the
AO transarticular screws.

730
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,507
2.0, what is the ideal
screw entry point?

731
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:43,259
- Ideal entry point
is lower one third

732
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,136
of midline of C1 lateral mass,

733
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,514
just above C1-2 joint capsule.

734
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,033
- Yeah, that's what
the cadaver studies

735
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,600
in our simulation suggested.

736
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,852
Drill.

737
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,521
Okay.

738
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,123
Starting with the left
side, drilling laterally,

739
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:59,275
posteriorly, and upwardly.

740
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:00,944
- The kid's end tidal
CO2 just dipped.

741
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,445
- 2.0, assess.

742
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:04,864
- Based on baseline
and trending vitals,

743
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:08,410
there is high likelihood
of venous air embolism.

744
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:09,536
- Is that really the case?

745
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,846
Slight dip could
be bronchospasm,

746
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,997
poor tissue perfusion,
or nothing at all.

747
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,458
- Yeah, 2.0, verify venous
air embolism, please.

748
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,876
- Verified.

749
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:20,338
There is a greater than
75% chance of mortality

750
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,923
or catastrophic outcome.

751
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,466
Address immediately.

752
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,653
- I don't know, maybe the damn
thing's hallucinating again.

753
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:27,137
- Yeah.

754
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:29,723
- BP's just a tad low. 85/49.

755
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:31,391
- Hey, we need to
finish this surgery.

756
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,952
Get this kid off the table.
- No, hold on.

757
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:33,977
Lower his head.

758
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,103
Place a precordial doppler

759
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:36,205
and set up for a
transesophageal echo.

760
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,397
- Crockett.

761
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,708
- An air embolism
could kill him.

762
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,067
We have to know what
we're dealing with.

763
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:47,741
- That sound from the doppler...

764
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,034
it's air bubbles.

765
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,636
- Yeah, I think when we
drilled into the bone,

766
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,495
it got sucked into
the vascular system

767
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,056
directly to the heart.

768
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,373
- BP is dropping more now.

769
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,959
65/33.

770
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,252
And heart rate, too, at 36.

771
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,295
- There it is.

772
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,088
Significant air bubbles.

773
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,025
- Yeah, they're embolizing
into the pulmonary artery,

774
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:05,258
causing right heart strain.

775
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,760
- Yeah, 2.0 was correct.

776
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,762
Marty, give the kid
100% O2 and bag him up.

777
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:11,639
- Coming.

778
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,017
But I'm having trouble
ventilating and oxygenating.

779
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,394
80% sat.
- Confirmed.

780
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:20,231
Critically significant hypoxia
and poor systemic perfusion.

781
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:21,751
- We're gonna have to suction
the air out of the kid's heart.

782
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,318
Give me the Swan-Ganz catheter.

783
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,612
- Seeing ST segment
changes on EKG.

784
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,673
- Got about a minute before
complete cardiac collapse.

785
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,240
- We're gonna float
the existing cordis

786
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:30,992
right into the pulmonary artery.

787
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,410
- Vitals are tanking.

788
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,621
Systolics in the 40s.
- Get a crash cart.

789
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,581
- In the right
ventricle. Balloon up.

790
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,458
- Balloon's up. Go ahead.

791
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,377
- Okay, advancing.

792
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:47,884
- Any day now, Crockett.

793
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:50,178
- Almost.

794
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,138
Okay, I'm in the
pulmonary artery.

795
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,890
Syringe?
- On it.

796
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:00,647
- No air.

797
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,399
- Barely seeing
an arterial trace.

798
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,650
He's bradying down.

799
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:04,859
- Cardiac arrest is imminent.

800
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,986
- Push a milligram
of atropine now.

801
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,863
- Advancing further.
Balloon down.

802
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:16,621
Come on.

803
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,876
Got air.

804
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:24,004
- BP, heart rate.

805
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:27,716
- Pulmonary air embolism
successfully addressed.

806
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:34,722
- Audrey?

807
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,968
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

808
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,561
- Poor Harris.

809
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:45,413
He works so hard to stay well.

810
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,068
- It's a rough illness.

811
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,029
- I wish more people
saw it that way

812
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,655
and not as some kind of failing.

813
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:56,494
Your husband's one of the
rare ones who understands.

814
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:58,913
He was always so
good to our son.

815
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:01,374
There was a time that Harris
had to be hospitalized.

816
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,209
Michael was so scared and upset,

817
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:06,588
and Mr. Ben really
helped him through it.

818
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:12,594
Made him see that people can
get sick in different ways.

819
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:16,181
And that his daddy
was gonna be okay.

820
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:19,893
- He will be, Audrey.

821
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:22,937
He will be.

822
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,110
- That was nice... what
she said about Ben.

823
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,612
- Yeah, to tell you
the truth, Doris,

824
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,865
I really don't wanna
hear about Ben.

825
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,784
- Okay.

826
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,078
- Hey, Doris, what's
happening with the hamster?

827
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,997
- No one wants it. I
called animal control.

828
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,793
- Dean, I saw tomorrow's
surgical schedule.

829
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,586
Looks like you're
getting that transplant.

830
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,672
- Yeah.

831
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:54,886
- Dr. Charles.

832
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,639
Judith's CT showed an
acute subdural hematoma.

833
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,432
Her doctor has her
on blood thinners,

834
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:00,767
so it could get worse.

835
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,644
- So she needs surgery?
- Yeah.

836
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,313
Thing is, she's
refusing treatment.

837
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:07,315
Says she wants to die.

838
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,025
She's suicidal.

839
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:11,486
We could hold her?

840
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,113
- Uh, we could.

841
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:16,282
But let me, um, let
me have a chat first.

842
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:17,324
- Yeah.

843
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,622
- Judith, I'm Dr. Charles.

844
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:25,083
We, uh, we met earlier today.

845
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,877
I don't know if
you remember that.

846
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,547
I am being told that
you don't want us

847
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:33,550
to treat your hematoma.

848
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,972
It's just important for me
that I know that you understand

849
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:42,308
that, if left untreated,
that it could kill you.

850
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,352
- I don't deserve to live.

851
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,897
- Okay.

852
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:50,108
Can I ask you a question?

853
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,861
If somebody that you knew
and that you cared about

854
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:55,321
were in exactly
the same situation,

855
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:58,033
is that what you'd say to them?

856
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,827
Would you say that they
didn't deserve to live?

857
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,455
I mean, I... I don't think so.

858
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:04,682
I mean, you wouldn't, would you?

859
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,584
What you'd say to
them, probably, is...

860
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:08,710
"It wasn't your fault."

861
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,587
- But this was my fault.

862
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:13,882
I hit the brakes, and the
car just started spinning,

863
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,009
and I crashed first,

864
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:18,887
and then all of the other cars
started to crash behind me.

865
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,472
If it hadn't been for me,

866
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:22,349
none of this would
have happened.

867
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,934
- You hit some black
ice. It was an accident.

868
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:27,812
You didn't hurt all
those people on purpose.

869
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:32,817
One of the hardest
moments in life

870
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,736
is when we figure out

871
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,030
how little control
we actually have

872
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:39,032
over the things that
happen to us, right?

873
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:44,162
But... but what we can control
is how we respond to them.

874
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:47,332
And I just know that
with a little time,

875
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,209
clarity will come, you know?

876
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,755
And maybe, just
maybe, you might even

877
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:56,257
get around to doing one
of the hardest things

878
00:36:56,299 --> 00:37:00,428
that a human being can
learn how to do, which is...

879
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,097
to forgive yourself.

880
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:07,602
But if you don't...

881
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,354
let us help you,
there's just no chance

882
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,439
that that's gonna happen.

883
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:18,238
So would you let us help you?

884
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:25,662
Okay.

885
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:28,373
- Okay, Brice, squeeze
my hands for me.

886
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:31,001
Good. Good.

887
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,836
Can you wiggle your
feet back and forth?

888
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:42,220
Okay, now stick your
tongue straight out.

889
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:45,598
Even the hypoglossal's
working well.

890
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,767
I think your son's
gonna be fine.

891
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:52,188
- Thank you.
- Okay.

892
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,816
- Thank you.

893
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,987
- We'll give you some
time with your boy.

894
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:01,072
- You're gonna be okay, okay?

895
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,579
- Did you hear? Ivy
was an organ donor.

896
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,747
- Oh?

897
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,331
- Yeah. Dr. Archer
had her typed.

898
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,459
Turns out she's a match
for a little girl here

899
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,210
who needs a kidney.

900
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:16,296
- Archer?

901
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,968
No, I hadn't heard.

902
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,863
- Just thought it might make
you feel a little better.

903
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:41,863
- Mags, grab your coat, and
I will walk you to your car.

904
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,990
No.

905
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,658
Janine's running a
couple hours late,

906
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,161
and I said that I'd cover
for her until she gets here.

907
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,372
- No. You've been
working nonstop all day.

908
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,791
Have somebody else cover.
- That's okay. I don't mind.

909
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,210
- No. You need to
go home to Ben.

910
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,712
He's probably wondering
where his wife is.

911
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,464
- Ben's just fine.

912
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:00,858
- Mm, if I had a guy like
Ben waiting for me...

913
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,717
- Just stop.

914
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,427
Stop, okay?

915
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:06,221
Stop.

916
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:09,099
Everybody keeps on talking
about my wonderful Ben.

917
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,976
Well, my wonderful
husband wants a divorce.

918
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:17,899
- No.

919
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:45,217
- Mitch.

920
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,931
- If this is about Mr. Shorr,
he is rational again.

921
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:52,684
Back on his full
panoply of meds.

922
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:55,520
We still need to address his
metabolic issues, and soon.

923
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,105
- Of course.

924
00:39:57,147 --> 00:40:00,066
But, um, you know, what
I really came up here

925
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,277
to tell you is
how impressed I am

926
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:04,320
with how you turned
your life around.

927
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:06,531
You know, truly. I
mean, you've done...

928
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,950
you've done so well.

929
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,911
- Better than you expected?

930
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:14,456
- Well, I mean, you
had a lot to overcome.

931
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:15,790
- Yeah.

932
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:17,751
Top of the list,
maybe county juvenile.

933
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,461
My psych care, remember?

934
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:22,589
Haldol, Zyprexa...
the whole candy store.

935
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,424
- I do. I remember.

936
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,134
I remember that
you were violent,

937
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,803
and you were aggressive.

938
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:30,263
It was a big place,
a lot of kids.

939
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:31,973
You know, we had
to protect them.

940
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:34,517
- Chemical restraints.

941
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,977
They worked.

942
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,480
I couldn't move, couldn't sleep.

943
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:40,065
Couldn't pee, either.

944
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,566
It's fun times.

945
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:45,779
- Look, we know a whole lot
more about those meds now

946
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,530
than we did then.

947
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:49,491
You know, we've gotten
much better at dosing.

948
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,660
I mean, frankly, you
probably were overmedicated.

949
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,454
You were.

950
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:55,705
- And then you booked.

951
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:56,873
- I booked?

952
00:40:56,915 --> 00:41:00,502
- You took off. You left.

953
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:05,882
- Well, I mean, I imagine
that's because I had a...

954
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:10,345
that my... my rotation
was probably...

955
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,683
- Okay.
