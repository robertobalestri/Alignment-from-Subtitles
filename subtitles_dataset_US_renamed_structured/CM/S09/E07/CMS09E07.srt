1
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,903
I screwed up, okay? I know that.

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,738
<i>I'm just trying to
look out for the guy.</i>

3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,198
I get that, but ideally,

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,326
you don't wanna risk
your job in doing so.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,328
<i>I've diagnosed
Bert with dementia.</i>

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,497
I have to take care
of my ex-husband.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>The decisions, the treatments,</i>

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,753
that's all gonna fall on me.

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,339
This is Dr. Collins.
She started our center.

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,341
I think I've seen you
around the hospital.

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,744
Just so you know, your son,
he's been a real godsend.

12
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,599
- Yes!
- Oh, man! Yes.

13
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,518
{\an8}Should have known better than
to invite a bunch of surgeons.

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,355
{\an8}Oh, please. My talent
is innate, all right?

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,274
{\an8}- Okay.
- Oh, yeah!

16
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,525
{\an8}It's okay. It's not your fault.

17
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,111
{\an8}- Clearly a recessive gene.
- Heh. Mean.

18
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,096
{\an8}Okay, let's give this a whirl.

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,953
{\an8}That was how it's done.
- Bam.

20
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,165
{\an8}A good time for cupcakes, yes?

21
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,399
{\an8}- Yes.
- Indeed, please.

22
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,379
{\an8}- Hey.
- Buddy boy!

23
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,840
{\an8}Happy one year sober.

24
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,091
{\an8}- Whoo.
- Yeah!

25
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,968
{\an8}Yes, congratulations on
this milestone, Sean.

26
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,928
{\an8}- Speech, speech!
- Nailed it!

27
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:17,970
{\an8}- Speech.
- Speech.

28
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,305
{\an8}- Speech.
- Okay, okay, okay.

29
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,640
{\an8}I actually have a
lot of thank yous.

30
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,100
{\an8}Um...

31
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,228
{\an8}I'm grateful for so many things.

32
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,772
{\an8}My dad's health,

33
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,149
{\an8}that the kidney
transplant was a success.

34
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,692
{\an8}And now I have something
to hold over him

35
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,903
{\an8}every time he's too
busy for a Cubs game.

36
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,200
{\an8}Margo, thank you so
much for the opportunity

37
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,493
{\an8}to work at your center

38
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:44,580
{\an8}and help others
struggling with addiction.

39
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,917
{\an8}I have such an incredible
group of people in my corner.

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,295
{\an8}And I figure if I'm
anything like you, Dad,

41
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,756
{\an8}I'm moving in the
right direction.

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,091
{\an8}Aw.

43
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,635
{\an8}Love you, kid.

44
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,595
{\an8}All right.

45
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,597
{\an8}- All right, show's over.
- Blow it. Blow it out.

46
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,015
{\an8}Yep.

47
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,184
{\an8}Yay.

48
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,019
{\an8}Thank you.
- Congratulations, Sean.

49
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,479
{\an8}- Good work.
- Thank you.

50
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,231
{\an8}- Just keep them over here.
- Do you need a hand here?

51
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,191
{\an8}Yeah, you better.

52
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,484
{\an8}You gotta redeem yourself here.

53
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,610
{\an8}You're apparently missing
out on Cubs games?

54
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,820
{\an8}- Oh, no.
- Yeah, I know.

55
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,154
{\an8}Where are all the
good men, I ask you?

56
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,490
{\an8}Yeah, well, apparently,
Wrigley field.

57
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,575
{\an8}Well, it's a
good thing opening day is,

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,244
{\an8}you know, right
around the corner.

59
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,038
{\an8}I just need to find something
to do with myself until then.

60
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,790
{\an8}- Ah, Chicago.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,125
{\an8}Plenty of stuff to do.

62
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,130
{\an8}Okay.

63
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,673
{\an8}We should stop after work,

64
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,134
{\an8}pick up something
to make for dinner.

65
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,218
{\an8}Oh, let's order in.

66
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,928
{\an8}- Oh, you're lazy.
- I am.

67
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,304
{\an8}I am indeed.

68
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,265
{\an8}But here's the thing.

69
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,644
{\an8}I love you too.

70
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,668
{\an8}See you later.

71
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,524
{\an8}Oh, Sharon, good morning.

72
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,360
{\an8}Oh, Daniel, I was
hoping I'd catch you.

73
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,778
{\an8}Just one second.

74
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,614
{\an8}I'm telling Bert where
I put his cereal bowls.

75
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,742
{\an8}Still getting the
place re-organized?

76
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,494
{\an8}Well, I finished labeling
everything in the kitchen.

77
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,954
{\an8}The bedroom's next.

78
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,998
{\an8}But so far, he's not
taking to it well.

79
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,499
{\an8}You know what?

80
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,793
{\an8}Alzheimer's is just a very
tricky diagnosis to accept.

81
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,670
{\an8}So you gotta be
patient with him.

82
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,673
{\an8}Well, I keep reminding
myself of that.

83
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,133
{\an8}You want me to stop by on
the way home from work,

84
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,509
{\an8}just to look in
on him real quick?

85
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,262
{\an8}That would be great. Thanks.

86
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,139
{\an8}Any time.

87
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:29,018
{\an8}One, two, three, four, five.

88
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,022
{\an8}My friend, can we
pick it up a notch?

89
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,067
{\an8}Oh, you're messing me
up. Just... please.

90
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,528
{\an8}One, two...

91
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,323
{\an8}- Hey, marathon man.
- What's up, Asher?

92
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,824
{\an8}We missed you last night.

93
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,576
{\an8}Yeah, sorry about that.

94
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,411
{\an8}Thanks for the invite,
but I had to get up early,

95
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,996
{\an8}you know, get in my run.

96
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,915
{\an8}Yeah, I can see that.

97
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,751
{\an8}So how was it? You
make it a burner?

98
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,252
{\an8}Uh, kind of?

99
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,089
{\an8}I tweaked my hammy.
Only three miles.

100
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,466
{\an8}I'll ice at lunch and try to
get in another five tonight.

101
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,884
{\an8}That's hardcore.

102
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,178
{\an8}Yeah, yeah, I admit I
can be a little, uh,

103
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,013
{\an8}type A when it
comes to my routine.

104
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,057
{\an8}Trust me. I get it.

105
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,768
{\an8}I go to meetings, you run.

106
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,728
{\an8}We all have our things.
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,855
{\an8}I'm gonna hit the
floor. You coming?

108
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,233
{\an8}Go ahead. I'm gonna grab
a drip and get showered.

109
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,508
{\an8}I'll see you out there.

110
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,072
So that's enough.
You need to step out.

111
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,116
- Take your time, man.
- Sorry. Can you just...

112
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,617
- We'll all wait.
- Yeah, please.

113
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,453
Can you not do that?
You're just messing me up.

114
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,623
What's going on?

115
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,710
Guy's been in the door
forever holding everybody up.

116
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,378
You mind if I have a chat?

117
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,737
Be my guest.

118
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,217
Everything okay, pal?

119
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,970
Yeah. Yeah, um...
yeah, I'm fine.

120
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,471
I'm fine. I'm fine.

121
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,848
One, two...

122
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,808
You know, there's a
lot of people waiting.

123
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,184
Yeah, I... I know.

124
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,477
It's just... it's just
people keep pushing the door

125
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,770
and they're messing up my count.

126
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,523
Please stop.
- Your count?

127
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,775
Two... I just need a
few more minutes, okay?

128
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,985
Three...
- Yeah, I don't think so.

129
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,194
- No, no, no.
- I need you out of there.

130
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,654
Hey, no, no, no, no!

131
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,615
No, please! Please,
please, please don't!

132
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,117
- I'm not gonna take...
- Okay. Whoa, whoa.

133
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,410
Easy, easy, easy. Okay.

134
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,789
You're okay. I need
some help over here!

135
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,917
Just breathe, buddy. I got you.

136
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,920
Okay, okay. Listen to my
voice. Listen to my voice.

137
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,921
I can't breathe.

138
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,164
Oh, he's moving!

139
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,062
I can feel him!

140
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,855
Dan, a little help, please?

141
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,148
Look at me.

142
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,650
In through the nose.

143
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,068
Out through the mouth.

144
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,402
- Oh, my God.
- In through the nose.

145
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,528
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God,

146
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,530
oh, my God, oh, my
God, oh, my God.

147
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,491
Oh, my... Please don't hurt him.

148
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,660
I'm doing the best I can.

149
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,203
Got him, got him.

150
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,954
All right.

151
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,998
Here we go.

152
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,292
Oh, my God.

153
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,877
All right. Okay.

154
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,548
Sheesh.

155
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,841
Hey.

156
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,137
Can you put him in something
so I can take him home?

157
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,764
Are you really sure
you wanna do that?

158
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,973
Yeah.

159
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,892
He's Rupert. He's my pet.

160
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,268
Hey.
- Mm.

161
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,770
Do me a favor.

162
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,398
Let's not let Rupert share
your pillow anymore, okay?

163
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,234
Yeah, that's a solid suggestion.

164
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,986
Excuse me, Dr. Charles.

165
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,779
Do you have a minute?

166
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,471
- Well done.
- Thanks.

167
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,118
{\an8}Name's Jason Davies,
32 years old,

168
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,830
{\an8}brought his mom in for an
outpatient gallbladder removal,

169
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,748
{\an8}dropped her off so
he could park the car

170
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,127
{\an8}but got stuck in the
revolving door on his way in.

171
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,129
{\an8}Stuck?

172
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,588
{\an8}Refused to exit the door

173
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,758
{\an8}until he had an even number
of steps per revolution.

174
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:52,263
{\an8}Uh, had a panic attack the
second we tried to intervene.

175
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,931
He's got an OCD diagnosis.

176
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,600
That includes a need for
even numbers and symmetry.

177
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,562
We had to double everything...
BP cuff, pulse ox.

178
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,273
He made me rearrange the chairs
so there's one on each side.

179
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,317
It's such a
misunderstood disorder.

180
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,319
So many people think it's
just this silly thing

181
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,237
about people who wash
their hands too much.

182
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,323
But it can be
seriously debilitating.

183
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,158
The longer compulsive
behavior is entrenched,

184
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,367
the harder it can
be to bust it loose.

185
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,411
It's... it's tricky.

186
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,621
Well, I'm hoping you
can give him a jostle.

187
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,207
He's pale, sweaty, and
keeps rubbing his sternum.

188
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,626
I'm worried he could
have a heart issue.

189
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,713
I need an EKG to rule it out,
and so far, he's refusing

190
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,341
because the leads don't sit
symmetrically on his chest.

191
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,967
Well, um, let's
see what we can do.

192
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,177
Mm.

193
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,345
You all right?

194
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,913
Yeah, just a sprain. No biggie.

195
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,727
Snake's out.

196
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,354
Start a discharge.
And do me a favor.

197
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,064
Next time there's a
reptile in an orifice,

198
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,148
give it to a resident.

199
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,799
Noted.

200
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,365
Hey, you want me to pass a note

201
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,700
to Ripley from you after recess?

202
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,410
Please.

203
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,537
You're one to talk.

204
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,666
I saw you flirting
with Margo last night.

205
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,709
- You're imagining things.
- Okay.

206
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,252
Come on, Dean, you
could do so much worse.

207
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,338
She's smart and funny and sweet.

208
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,256
And Sean's boss.

209
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,425
I don't think he'd appreciate
seeing me around the office.

210
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,053
I think he would be
happy if you are.

211
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,304
Well, I'll keep that in mind

212
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,473
if I'm ever actually
looking for a date.

213
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,184
Dr. Archer, head lock in T4.

214
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,811
This isn't over.

215
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,730
Hannah, we've got incoming.
We're shorthanded today.

216
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,273
Can you start the workup?
- Yeah.

217
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,358
- Treatment three.
- Got it.

218
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,110
- Great.
- Going to three.

219
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,903
Marisol Robles, 26.

220
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,448
BP 117/79, heart rate 182,

221
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,035
experienced near syncope
unloading groceries.

222
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,286
This is so embarrassing.

223
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,871
All this fuss because
of some dizziness?

224
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,916
There's no fuss, Marisol.
Anything else we need to know?

225
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,209
No, I don't think so.

226
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,377
Seriously?

227
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,503
Okay, fine.

228
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,713
A few days ago,
I started getting

229
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,339
what feels like...
like a weird heartbeat,

230
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,590
like a pounding in my chest.

231
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,342
And she's been really
sweaty and gross.

232
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,635
Gee, thanks, hon.

233
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,845
You know what I mean.

234
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,138
All right, let's
get you transferred.

235
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,597
Oh, no, please, I got it.

236
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,058
Okay.

237
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,393
All right.

238
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,855
Any fever or loss of appetite?

239
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,108
No, but the heartburn.
I've been living off Tums.

240
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,068
Well, your lungs sound clear.

241
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,032
Lymph nodes don't feel swollen.

242
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,576
Any chance these are
early signs of pregnancy?

243
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,328
We've been trying.
- Well, it's hard to say.

244
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,164
But we can get a full workup,
including pregnancy tests.

245
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,707
Sound good?
- Yeah, thanks.

246
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,083
Great.

247
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,693
I will put that order
in and check back later.

248
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,841
EKG has too much artifact
with the leads out of place.

249
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,135
Jason, if I could
just shift these two

250
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,136
to the other side...
- No.

251
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,554
I told you.

252
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,349
The only way we do this is
if everything's balanced.

253
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,184
Okay, um

254
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,518
how about a fresh set of vitals?

255
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,645
- Okay.
- Okay?

256
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,772
Just to get us started.

257
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,690
Hey. Hey! What are you doing?

258
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,983
I'm just grabbing a thermometer.

259
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,526
No, no, no.

260
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,322
Please, I told you, you
have to stay... stay there.

261
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,448
Everything has to stay balanced.

262
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,616
And you have to stay there.

263
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,118
We understand, all right?

264
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,080
Just remember, buddy, we're
trying to help you, all right?

265
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,858
How about we start with
blood pressure, okay?

266
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,838
There we go.

267
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,465
So Jason, you've been diagnosed

268
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,033
with obsessive compulsive
disorder, correct?

269
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,223
What kind of treatment
have you had, if any?

270
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,308
Everything's failed. I

271
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,686
uh...

272
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,312
A... a... a strict routine
is the only thing that works.

273
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,022
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

274
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,817
And what happens if,
for whatever reason,

275
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,821
you're forced to, you know,
deviate from that routine?

276
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,573
Jason, you're still a
little short of breath.

277
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,535
Without the EKG, we're stuck.

278
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,828
If you let me place
the leads properly,

279
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:44,996
they wouldn't be
on for very long.

280
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,956
No. No, no, no.

281
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,166
Please, I mean, how many
times do I have to say it?

282
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,334
You know what we could do?

283
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,003
We could, uh

284
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,337
we could draw some
blood, all right?

285
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,630
A little bit from each arm,

286
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,342
keep things nice and...
nice and symmetrical?

287
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,677
Same amount from each arm?

288
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,138
Down to the centiliter,
I promise you.

289
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,432
Okay?

290
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,766
- Thank you.
- You hang tight.

291
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,186
And, uh, we will
get that set up.

292
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,069
Trini, set up for a blood
draw. I'm gonna need two kits.

293
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,488
- Two?
- I'll explain in a second.

294
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,614
Blood's a good start,

295
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,866
but it's only
gonna get us so far

296
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,909
if he has a heart condition.
- I know.

297
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,871
But you can't really steamroll
a patient like this, right?

298
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,540
This is nuts. I mean,
I'm familiar with OCD,

299
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,542
but needing a
routine to the extent

300
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,336
that it's jeopardizing
his health?

301
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,672
The routine creates this
crucial illusion of control,

302
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,716
right, which is ironic
because it's compulsion,

303
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,718
which he has no control over.

304
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,887
But the theory is that
they are triggered

305
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,806
by these dark, intrusive
thoughts, right,

306
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,309
this fear that something
really bad is gonna happen,

307
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,769
a fear that something really bad

308
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,896
has already happened
that's <i>his</i> fault, right?

309
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,731
And that's the obsessive part.

310
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,733
The compulsions,
in Jason's case,

311
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,193
the whole symmetry
thing, they develop

312
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,113
as a kind of a ritualistic
coping mechanism, right?

313
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,198
So how do we help him?

314
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,574
Well, the first step,

315
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,619
try and figure out
what he's so afraid of.

316
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,454
Yeah, well, we got an
ED full of patients

317
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,164
who also need our attention.

318
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,166
Yeah. Is his mom
still up in pre-op?

319
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,418
She's rescheduling her
surgery for this afternoon.

320
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,920
So she should be down soon.

321
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,922
Okay, give me a heads-up
when she gets here.

322
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,675
She might be able to, you
know, shed some light.

323
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,927
Thanks.
- Yeah.

324
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,892
Okay, so you fell coming
down the stairs, huh?

325
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,436
I know. I'm such an idiot.

326
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,438
I was running late
for work again,

327
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,273
missed the last step.

328
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,900
Better than falling
from the top, I guess.

329
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,443
No doubt.

330
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,362
So it doesn't look too bad.

331
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,822
Besides this little goose egg,

332
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,699
any dizziness or
lightheadedness?

333
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,118
No, occasional headaches,
but that's probably

334
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,452
just because I've been
hitting dollar margarita night

335
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,745
a little too hard.

336
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,789
I know I shouldn't,
but a dollar?

337
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,541
Well, worse ways to
spend a buck, I guess.

338
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,418
There's my girl.

339
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,794
Dr. Dennis!

340
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,754
I got your text.
I came right down.

341
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,464
Sorry, I guess I should
call you Dr. Washington.

342
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,300
Oh, no, it's fine.

343
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,802
So what have you gone and done?

344
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,388
Mm, little altercation
with the front stoop.

345
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,598
I'm sorry to barge in
like this, Dr. Marcel.

346
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,975
Hillary and I go way back.

347
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,643
I can see.

348
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,312
Approaching two decades
cancer-free and clear.

349
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,981
Wow. That's fantastic.

350
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,482
I'll check in on you in a bit.

351
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,608
All right, I'll be here.

352
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,235
Okay.

353
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,487
All right, let's put
this back on there.

354
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,489
Best I can tell,
it's just a sprain,

355
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,783
but I'll get some
X-rays to confirm.

356
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,952
I'd also like to do some
additional tests and scans

357
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,996
just to make sure
it's the margaritas

358
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,789
causing those headaches.
How does that sound?

359
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,333
- Good.
- Okay, good.

360
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,692
I'll be back in a bit.
Just hang tight for me.

361
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,675
Dr. Washington, what
brings you down here?

362
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,261
Checking on a former patient.

363
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,471
Though I gotta admit,

364
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,973
it's certainly a nice
perk running into you.

365
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,850
Are you free for lunch?

366
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,810
Back-to-back meetings
with Everett.

367
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,229
I hope he doesn't
drone on too long.

368
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,190
Don't ask him about
his golf game.

369
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,566
You never have to.

370
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,652
Would you settle for dinner?

371
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,445
It's a date.

372
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,845
All right.

373
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,283
Okay, your white count's normal.

374
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,035
No sign of infection.

375
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,770
All other labs,
you're looking good.

376
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,208
But I am sorry to say that

377
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,502
your pregnancy test
came back negative.

378
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,755
Well, I've always wanted
to be a medical mystery.

379
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,256
No, no, no.

380
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,966
We still have plenty
of stones to turn.

381
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,718
We'll get this chest X-ray out
of the way and go from there.

382
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,661
Mike, we good?
- All set.

383
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,723
Everybody clear.

384
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,898
Marisol, it appears you
have a foreign object

385
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,025
lodged in your heart.

386
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,052
Oh, my God.

387
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,823
What is it?

388
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,308
I don't know, but it
shouldn't be there.

389
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,340
Your CT confirmed
a foreign object,

390
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,878
a rod about 4 centimeters long

391
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,798
lodged in your left
pulmonary artery.

392
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,966
How did it get there?

393
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,093
That's the
million-dollar question.

394
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,720
Have you ever had any surgeries?

395
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,722
Not since I was a baby.

396
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,266
They took out...
what's it called?

397
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,351
A bronco...

398
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,854
A bronchogenic cyst? Yeah.

399
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,981
Yeah, that's...
that's a big surgery.

400
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,899
I guess I don't remember.

401
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,652
What about any accidents,
traumas, procedures?

402
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:30,323
No, nothing.

403
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,700
What?

404
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,827
Marisol?

405
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,162
Three months ago,

406
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,332
I had a birth control
implant put in my arm.

407
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,501
What? Birth control? What
are you talking about?

408
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,170
I'm so sorry, honey.

409
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,673
- I can't believe this.
- I know, I know. I'm sorry.

410
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,133
You said you wanted kids.

411
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,676
I do.

412
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,345
I did.

413
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,388
I mean, you're not freaked
out about the world?

414
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,389
What?

415
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,891
War, climate change, pandemics.

416
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,018
We're really gonna bring
a baby into all that?

417
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,061
Honey.

418
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,604
You know what I'm saying, right?

419
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,105
To tell you the truth,

420
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,940
I don't think there's ever
been a good time to have kids.

421
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,150
If that implant was
placed improperly,

422
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,735
it could have traveled
through a large vein

423
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,362
into your pulmonary artery.

424
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,571
Oh, my God.

425
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,865
She should be fine once
the rod is removed.

426
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,284
It's a minimally
invasive procedure

427
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,328
done in interventional
radiology.

428
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:20,039
A catheter is snaked
up through your thigh.

429
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,707
The rod is grabbed.

430
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,751
And then the artery is repaired.

431
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,753
There's no major incisions.

432
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:29,757
And you might even be able to
get out of here by tonight.

433
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,509
Sound good?

434
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,969
- Yeah.
- All right.

435
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,721
I'll put you on
the schedule then.

436
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,893
Ah, oh.

437
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,561
I know that look. Spit it out.

438
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,271
This kind of surgery is
your bread and butter,

439
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,107
but instead, you punt it to IR.

440
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,650
She had a thoracotomy
when she was a baby,

441
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,944
so I'm guessing she has a mess
of scar tissue in her chest.

442
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,904
We open her up again, all right,

443
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,656
the complication
rates skyrocket.

444
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,408
IR is less invasive, sure.

445
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,410
But sneaking a wire through
her pulmonary artery

446
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,787
with limited visibility
is no cakewalk.

447
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,080
Yeah.

448
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,707
Have you ever seen
a birth control rod

449
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,667
in the heart before?

450
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,585
No? Yeah, that's what I thought.

451
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,087
No one has, all right?

452
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,923
There is no road map
for this procedure.

453
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:15,594
So we pick the
safest possible path.

454
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,305
IR, all right?

455
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,473
And if you're so
worried about it,

456
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,600
why don't you scrub
in and babysit?

457
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,019
Maybe I will.

458
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,360
Hey, looks like ortho
got you fixed up.

459
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,946
You were right. Just a sprain.

460
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,866
That's good. Good, good.

461
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,659
I know this move.

462
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,328
What is it?

463
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,583
So your CT scan showed
a tumor in your neck.

464
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,294
And it's compressing
your carotid artery.

465
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,048
Explains your headaches
and unsteadiness.

466
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,300
So my cancer's back?

467
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,886
It's hard to say conclusively
without a biopsy,

468
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,348
but given your history...

469
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,141
I've been dreading this moment,

470
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,393
more chemo, radiation...

471
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,479
Well, not necessarily.

472
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,647
Far as I can tell,

473
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,566
the tumor's confined
to your neck, okay?

474
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,860
Which means there's
a surgical option.

475
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,488
Now, we do have an OR available.

476
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,823
And if you give me your consent,

477
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,116
I'd like to operate today.

478
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,868
- Today?
- Yeah.

479
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,328
Wow.

480
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:25,498
Yeah, look, I know that
this is a lot to digest.

481
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:29,669
But this tumor, it's in
a precarious location.

482
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,045
What do you mean precarious?

483
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,465
Well, because it's on
the carotid artery,

484
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,760
it could cause
visual disturbances,

485
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,596
a loss of consciousness

486
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,973
possibly stroke.

487
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,976
Okay.

488
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,852
You'll let Dr. Dennis know?

489
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,354
Yeah, of course.

490
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,440
Of course. I'll go page him now.

491
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,567
You hang in there for me, okay?
- Okay.

492
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,862
We'll get this figured
out, all right?

493
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,826
You said Davies, right?

494
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,452
Yes, Jason. I'm his mother.

495
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,329
- Uh...
- Doris, I can take her back.

496
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,415
- Thanks.
- Miss Davies, I'm Dr. Charles.

497
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,417
I'm one of the physicians
who's treating your son.

498
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,377
Come with me.

499
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,420
Oh, how is he?

500
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,213
You know, right now,
he's doing okay.

501
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,298
Oh, thank God. I'm sorry.

502
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,051
I hear he made a scene
entering the hospital.

503
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,262
I wouldn't have had him
come, but he insisted.

504
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,139
Do you mind me asking
you when you noticed

505
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,141
these behaviors
showing up in your son,

506
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,600
at what point in his life?

507
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,145
Oh, even as a toddler,
he would have a meltdown

508
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,772
if his apple slices
weren't cut evenly.

509
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,274
We didn't really
think much of it.

510
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,400
Oh, of course, because
it just seemed like

511
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,485
normal toddler
behavior at the time.

512
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,903
Exactly.

513
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,780
It was really when
Jason's father

514
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,365
passed away that it got worse.

515
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,075
Yeah, he was only ten years old.

516
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,119
It was extremely hard on him.

517
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,288
He did say he has had
some therapy, though?

518
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,165
Well, he's been in
and out of therapy

519
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,958
but never gets too far.

520
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,961
In fact, lately, it only seems
to be getting more intense.

521
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,379
Really?

522
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,256
Any changes going
on in his life?

523
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,258
Any big transitions or anything?

524
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,595
No. Well, other than my surgery.

525
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,638
Excuse me, Dr. Charles, can
I talk to you for a second?

526
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,599
Dr. Ripley, this is...
this is Miss Davies.

527
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,059
This is Jason's mom.

528
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,518
Miss Davies, hi.

529
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,020
I just got your
son's lab work back.

530
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,564
And?

531
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,341
It seems Jason didn't
just have a panic attack.

532
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,157
Jason, your lab showed
elevated levels of troponin

533
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,408
in your bloodstream.

534
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,452
That's a protein that's released

535
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,704
when there's a breakdown
of heart muscle,

536
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,707
most commonly as a
result of a heart attack.

537
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,460
- A heart attack?
- Unusual in somebody your age.

538
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,420
But, you know, we
caught it early,

539
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,674
and so we can address it before
there's any lasting damage.

540
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,759
You'll need an angiogram to find

541
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,637
the source of the blockage and
potentially insert a stent.

542
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,514
It's a simple
outpatient procedure.

543
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,557
They're gonna get you
all fixed up, honey.

544
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,142
Nothing to worry about...
- Mom.

545
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,603
Mom, please.

546
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:56,440
Can you... can you move
back to the center?

547
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,025
Look, just sit tight, Jason.

548
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,987
Uh, we'll let angio
know we're coming.

549
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,470
Wait.

550
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,059
I only had one heart attack?
- Yeah.

551
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,206
I have to have another one.

552
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,290
I'm sorry, what?

553
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,376
Even numbers. Symmetry.

554
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,669
Jason, I just wanna make sure

555
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,546
you understand what
you're saying here.

556
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,466
We need to fix this now. And
if we don't, you could die.

557
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,552
Honey, please listen
to the doctors.

558
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,721
You need this treatment.
- No.

559
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,931
It's too important.

560
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,684
I'm not doing anything until
I have another heart attack.

561
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,274
Good to go?

562
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,192
Change of plans.

563
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,944
Based on the location
of the tumor,

564
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,571
I believe it's a paraganglioma.

565
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,031
Uh-huh.

566
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,991
Which means I expect it to
respond well to radiation.

567
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,827
Now, radiation's not gonna
do us much good here, Dennis.

568
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,913
This tumor is completely
encasing her artery.

569
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,415
I need to take it out.

570
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,708
And once I shrink it,

571
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,627
you'll be in a far better
position to do that.

572
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,171
Hillary and I discussed
all the options,

573
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:04,008
and it's clear that radiation
is the best place to start.

574
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,093
She's already
consented to surgery.

575
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,554
She's rescinded that consent.

576
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,723
- You're kidding me.
- This is now an oncology case.

577
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,892
And I'm taking over
Hillary's care.

578
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,460
And we are no longer
in need of a surgeon.

579
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,673
You know I'm gonna have
to take this upstairs?

580
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,319
That's certainly
your prerogative.

581
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:37,968
Okay, exiting the
right ventricle

582
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:43,381
and advancing over the wire
into the pulmonary artery.

583
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,341
Oh, jackpot. There it is.

584
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,410
Here we go. Opening the grasper.

585
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:50,930
Got it.

586
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,141
Wow, that's really
wedged in there.

587
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,685
Yeah, not budging.

588
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,270
BP and sats are falling.

589
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,605
What happened?

590
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,315
Must have perforated
the pulmonary artery.

591
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,566
Damn it. She's bleeding
into her chest.

592
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,193
Marty, start the massive
transfusion protocol.

593
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,153
I'll be right back.

594
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,404
Dean?

595
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:07,571
Hey, we need you.

596
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,532
- What?
- She perforated.

597
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:09,907
We gotta open her up.

598
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,518
So much for playing it safe.

599
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,665
If we had a court order,

600
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,542
we could wrap this
up, put in that stent.

601
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,044
Yeah, I just... I don't know.

602
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:26,882
Mrs. Davies, it is clear your
son is causing himself harm.

603
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,677
Any judge would agree.
- Miss Davies, do you mind?

604
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,470
Can I just grab
Dr. Ripley for a second?

605
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,705
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

606
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,851
I know what you're gonna say.

607
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:37,977
I'm not sure you do.

608
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,021
Look, Mitch, in any
other circumstance,

609
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,564
I'd probably agree with you.

610
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,482
The problem with forcing
treatment, though,

611
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,735
is that we would violate
Jason's sense of control

612
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,987
over his environment
to the extent that

613
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,656
we or anybody else would lose
any chance of helping him

614
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,658
with his OCD for
a long, long time.

615
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,035
At this point,
doesn't helping him

616
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,953
mean ensuring he doesn't
have a massive coronary?

617
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,621
Yes. The thing is,
I'm just starting

618
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,956
to figure out
what's behind this,

619
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,084
and I just need a little
more time to reach him.

620
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,377
Okay, well, you better hurry,

621
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,041
'cause time's the one
thing we don't have.

622
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:12,511
Paraganglioma,
headaches, syncope.

623
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,430
I mean, Hillary's
already symptomatic.

624
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,057
But as I've explained,

625
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,601
in her case, starting with
surgery's not the answer.

626
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,478
If I understand correctly,

627
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:24,774
your concern is for the
integrity of the artery.

628
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,776
Remove the tumor,
and you run the risk

629
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,320
of taking her entire
carotid out with it.

630
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,613
She'll bleed out on the table.

631
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:31,697
And if you radiate first,

632
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,282
it would scar and
distort the anatomy,

633
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,742
making surgery even
more difficult.

634
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,285
Actually, radiation
would save you

635
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,412
from a difficult operation.

636
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:42,041
If I shrink the mass, you can
likely avoid a carotid bypass.

637
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,209
Please, Ms. Goodwin,

638
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,127
Dr. Washington and I
can do this all day.

639
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,881
Surgery versus radiation,
I can't even begin to count

640
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,592
the number of times
I've heard this debate.

641
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,887
And there's never
a clear-cut answer.

642
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,139
But in this case,

643
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,726
given Dr. Washington's
extensive knowledge

644
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,895
of the patient and
her medical history,

645
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,816
he's in a better position
to make this call.

646
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,944
You can move forward
with radiation.

647
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,862
Thank you, Sharon.

648
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,493
This isn't right.

649
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,996
Dr. Marcel, you brought
me in for arbitration,

650
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,205
and that's what I did.

651
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,832
Yeah. Yeah, okay,

652
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,500
and your relationship with
him didn't play a role?

653
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,461
Excuse me?

654
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,963
Miss Goodwin, I...

655
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:36,722
You know, one thing
I wanna tell you

656
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:38,472
is that I just really...

657
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,808
I really get how

658
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:43,519
incredibly difficult all
this must be for you.

659
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,773
I don't have a choice.

660
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:51,176
Which must just
make it exhausting.

661
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:56,907
And that's why I wanna

662
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,160
which is why what I
ask you, like, what if

663
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,435
what if we could help you?

664
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,897
You can't.

665
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,709
But wouldn't you wanna
spend the rest of your life

666
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:10,713
feeling, I don't know,
like, a little less

667
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:14,175
less like a prisoner
of... of your own mind?

668
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,718
Yeah.

669
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:19,305
I mean, I'm wondering
if you were scared

670
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:23,768
that if we give you that stent
and disrupt your symmetry

671
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,771
that something really
bad is gonna happen

672
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,555
and that you're gonna
think it's your fault.

673
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:34,403
I mean, is that your take on

674
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,781
on what happened with your dad?

675
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,532
And his heart attack
when you were a kid?

676
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:45,247
My dad was walking me to school.

677
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,000
I was trying to get an
even number of steps

678
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:52,755
in between the
sidewalk pavement.

679
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:57,677
But we were late, so he
was hurrying me along.

680
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:02,098
And he just kept pulling
me and pulling me.

681
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:06,852
And I just... I
couldn't keep up.

682
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,898
And then when I lost count

683
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:15,111
he just dropped to the pavement.

684
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:18,030
It was just... he fell.

685
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,410
And now today

686
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,787
in the revolving door...

687
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:29,375
I couldn't... I
couldn't keep count.

688
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,836
And then I had a heart attack.

689
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,170
So now you're worried
that something bad's

690
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,255
gonna happen to your mom?

691
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,799
I don't wanna kill my mom.

692
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,176
That's why I have to have
another heart attack.

693
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,469
Right.

694
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,179
And the second heart attack...

695
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,851
You wanna have a
second heart attack

696
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,769
because you think that that
is gonna make that not happen?

697
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,521
Yeah. It'll be even.

698
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:51,731
- It'll be even.
- Even.

699
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,232
It'll make it even.

700
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,817
And your mom'll be safe

701
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,277
if you can have a
second heart attack?

702
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,487
Yeah, if I... if I have
a second heart attack...

703
00:27:58,511 --> 00:27:59,780
Okay, I get it.

704
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:03,326
- My mom will live.
- Right.

705
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,995
Okay.

706
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,330
Pressure's in the tank.

707
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,748
She's still bleeding.

708
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:14,378
This damn lung is completely
fused to the chest wall.

709
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,796
Ugh. More suction.

710
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,673
Good. Can't even see the bleed.

711
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:20,134
Pressure's still down.

712
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,844
Keep transfusing.

713
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,388
Okay. All right, all right.

714
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,848
Got the lung.

715
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,142
Yeah. I see the tear.

716
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,228
All right, I'm pinching
the pulmonary artery now.

717
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,271
Okay.

718
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,858
I need a Satinsky clamp.

719
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,401
Wait, what are you doing?

720
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,653
What are you doing?

721
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:41,030
I need to perform
a formal lobectomy.

722
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,865
You're gonna remove a
whole lobe of her lung?

723
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,076
It's that or let
her bleed to death.

724
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,832
The last clamp on. And
the lobe comes out.

725
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,254
She's not doing well, Dean.

726
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,381
I'm having trouble
keeping her pressure...

727
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,133
Just buy me 40
seconds, Marty, please.

728
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,551
Okay.

729
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:03,678
Got it. Blowing mass.

730
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,686
Okay.

731
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,879
All right. Lobe is coming out.

732
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:17,424
There it is.

733
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:21,904
Rod's still intact.
- Mm.

734
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,823
All right.
- Numbers are better.

735
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,283
All right, let's finish it up.

736
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:32,289
So Jason thinks that a
disruption in his routine

737
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,334
killed his father when
he was a little kid.

738
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:36,711
So then this morning,

739
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:39,797
after he messes up his
steps in the revolving door,

740
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,882
he becomes convinced
that his mom is next.

741
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,426
That's why that the
second heart attack

742
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,886
becomes so important
to him, because he

743
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,805
he thinks that that's
gonna restore symmetry.

744
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,140
Right? Get him back on track.

745
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,641
And that if that doesn't happen,

746
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:54,520
then his mom will never get
up off the operating table.

747
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:56,230
Wow.

748
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,982
Yeah.

749
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,150
So what's the next step?

750
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,152
Well, I think I
figured out a way

751
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:04,613
to sort of decouple his
compulsion from his fear,

752
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,282
you know, to break the delusion,

753
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:10,119
but, um, I'm gonna need
your help to do that.

754
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:11,895
Okay.

755
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,832
Uh, you're not
gonna convince me.

756
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,417
That's not why we're here.

757
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,502
So look, your mom knows
that you can get anxious

758
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:19,962
about her health, right?

759
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,339
She's in pre-op right now,

760
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,549
but she has gotten permission
from Dr. Tanaka-Reed

761
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:26,469
for us to bring you up
there so you can meet him,

762
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,472
see what great hands she's
in, and also say hi to her

763
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:32,099
before she goes into the
OR and when she comes out.

764
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:35,311
We'll each stay on one side
of you just like we are now.

765
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,937
And also, just because we really

766
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,357
wanna think about protecting
your heart at this point,

767
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,692
we're gonna give you a mild
sedative called a pyrazolam.

768
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:42,902
Have you had that before?

769
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,362
Yeah, I've had that before.

770
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:45,821
Great.

771
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,698
Good, well, Dr. Charles
and I split the pill in two

772
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:49,533
just to keep things balanced.

773
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,958
Taking Hillary
upstairs, as directed.

774
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,293
Hey, Hillary.

775
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:00,670
Richard here is gonna
take you upstairs

776
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,046
to radiation oncology.

777
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,048
Where's Dr. Washington?

778
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:06,384
He'll be up shortly to get
you started, all right?

779
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,551
Come on.

780
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,803
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.

781
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:10,888
I got her. I got you, I got you.

782
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,122
It's okay.

783
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,393
Hey, you with me?

784
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,979
You with me? You okay?

785
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,106
Give her a liter of LR.

786
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,567
Hillary, please, you
need this operation.

787
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,653
No.

788
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,739
Dr. Washington's against it.

789
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:29,991
Dr. Marcel?

790
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,080
Hang tight for me, all right?

791
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,582
Is this a change
in her condition?

792
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,875
Mm-hmm.

793
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,460
And it's because of the tumor?

794
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:44,213
It's clearly starting to
intrude into her carotid now.

795
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:47,157
She can't wait any longer.

796
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:54,640
Jason, this is Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

797
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:55,891
Hi, Jason.

798
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,268
He is a first-class surgeon

799
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:59,145
who's gonna take excellent
care of your mom.

800
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,479
We'll be texting
Dr. Charles throughout

801
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:01,939
to keep you up to date.

802
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,607
I'll take good care of her.

803
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,484
Okay.

804
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,028
Okay, so obviously,

805
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:09,697
the hospital's not gonna let
you observe the procedure.

806
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,574
But we have arranged for

807
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,117
what we think is
the next best thing,

808
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,910
which is to monitor
it from in here,

809
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,246
in this little area
that we've set up.

810
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,123
Your mom will be in OR two.

811
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,791
As you can see, the
light is currently green,

812
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:23,586
which means her surgery is
just about to get underway.

813
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,421
It'll switch to red
as soon as she's done.

814
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,798
In the meantime, I think
we have things set up

815
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:29,050
pretty much the
way you like them.

816
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,926
And Dr. Ripley and I are

817
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,804
gonna be here with
you the whole time.

818
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:34,889
Thanks.

819
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,265
We've got Hillary on fluids

820
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,351
and she's stable for the moment,

821
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,228
but Dr. Marcel is
concerned the tumor

822
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:45,566
is disrupting the blood flow.

823
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,652
So we wanna revisit surgery?

824
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,070
Yes, Dennis.

825
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:53,991
This... this new complication
changes the calculus.

826
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:56,994
It does.

827
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,205
I'm afraid radiation
is no longer viable.

828
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:04,543
And Hillary is refusing to
consent unless you're on board.

829
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,840
In the early years
of my practice,

830
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:12,176
so many kids didn't make it.

831
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,887
I was burning out when
Hillary came along.

832
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:19,934
Her prognosis wasn't good,
went through more than most.

833
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,560
But she survived.

834
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:24,021
She gave me hope.

835
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:26,589
And that hope allowed
me to keep going.

836
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:35,342
And Dr. Marcel is a skilled
and experienced surgeon.

837
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:39,602
I have all the confidence in
the world that he can do this.

838
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,707
All right.

839
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:52,614
Are we ready?

840
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:56,345
Everything is gonna be okay.

841
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,848
I'll be right here
when you wake up.

842
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,850
Tumor-free.

843
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:02,685
Okay.

844
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,104
Okay.

845
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:08,024
- Take good care of her.
- You have my word.

846
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:22,354
Ah, okay, looks like
they are almost finished.

847
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,334
What... what are you doing?

848
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:27,877
I just wanna show you something.

849
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:31,005
No, the light's still green.
The surgery isn't over.

850
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,340
Buddy, it's gonna be okay.

851
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:33,632
You wanna take a
deep breath for me?

852
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:34,675
Why are you doing this?

853
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,344
Because I wanna prove to you

854
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,387
that you had nothing whatsoever
to do with your father's death.

855
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,556
Move back. Please, she'll die!

856
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,516
No, she's not.

857
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,184
She's gonna be absolutely fine

858
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,227
because the truth is,
is that your behavior,

859
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:48,147
your routine, I appreciate
it makes you feel better,

860
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:51,067
but it has nothing whatsoever
to do with outcomes

861
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,151
out in the real world.
- No.

862
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,486
- It doesn't.
- Yes, it does! It does!

863
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,654
- Hey, Jason.
- Hey, no, no, no, no.

864
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:56,030
It does!
- Jason, Jason.

865
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,239
- Please, sit down! Sit down!
- Jason, just relax!

866
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,325
Look, look! It's red.

867
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:02,078
Surgery's over.
- She's finished.

868
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,497
She's fine.

869
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,581
What?

870
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,749
It's over.

871
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,754
Really?

872
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:15,966
Oh. Matter of fact, I'm
just getting a text.

873
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,885
Surgery on Frances has ended.

874
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,596
She's heading into post-op now.

875
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,014
So she's okay?

876
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:23,766
She's okay.

877
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,101
- Jason.
- What?

878
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:29,939
Jason, your mom's fine, okay?

879
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,858
But right now, it's
you who's in danger.

880
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:36,237
So please, before you
have another heart attack

881
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,679
let us place that stent.

882
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:45,020
Okay, okay.

883
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,792
Here it is.

884
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,711
Hmm? You did great.

885
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,004
Thank you.

886
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:54,380
Okay, you're looking
at several weeks

887
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,966
of rest and rehab, and once
you're feeling up to it,

888
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,760
you can decide if you wanna
put one of these back in.

889
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:01,721
We don't want you to leave
here with the wrong impression.

890
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:05,433
This is a safe and effective
method of birth control.

891
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:08,227
What you experienced
was improper placement.

892
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:10,646
But you have no need to
fear something like this

893
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,398
ever happening again.

894
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:15,735
Like you said, there's never
a good time to have a child.

895
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:18,154
I think I'm really just scared
about becoming a parent.

896
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:20,072
You think I'm not?

897
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,491
Why didn't you just talk to me?

898
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:25,494
I don't know. I...
I should have.

899
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:28,748
Because I just...
I felt ashamed.

900
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,708
There's no shame in
that, believe me.

901
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,335
You have kids?

902
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:35,713
Mm. A son, grown now.

903
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,006
And you were scared?

904
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,966
Oh, petrified.

905
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:44,263
Listen, my son and I give each
other a fair amount of grief.

906
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:47,308
Still, he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

907
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,810
The trouble is, it's
impossible to understand

908
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,687
unless it happens to you.

909
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:55,232
It's one of the many
flaws of nature, I guess.

910
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,360
But the point is, there
are plenty of good reasons

911
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:01,530
not to have kids, but
fear is not one of them.

912
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:04,140
You might miss out
on something great.

913
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,953
I don't know about the implant.

914
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,538
I have a lot to figure out.

915
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:12,583
<i>We</i> have a lot to figure out.

916
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:13,733
Together, I hope.

917
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:20,466
All right. Well, get some rest.

918
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,719
So fear can make you miss
out on something great, huh?

919
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:24,970
Did I say that?

920
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,663
That's what I heard.

921
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,935
She did great.

922
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,311
Tumor came out intact,

923
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,689
successfully
bypassed the carotid.

924
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,732
Thank you.

925
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:37,775
You bet.

926
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:46,575
Listen, Ms. Goodwin

927
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,913
what I said earlier,
I was out of line.

928
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:52,665
That won't happen again.

929
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,917
You have my word.

930
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:57,003
My apologies.

931
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,170
You have a good night.

932
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:00,488
Good night, Dr. Marcel.

933
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,680
What was that about?

934
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:11,434
Dr. Marcel and I had
a little dust up.

935
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,853
Sorry you got put in
a difficult position.

936
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,146
Colleagues dating.

937
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,689
It was bound to happen.

938
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,983
Yeah.

939
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,401
We're still on for dinner?

940
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,236
Yeah, we still are.

941
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:29,869
Cardiology placed one stent
into his right coronary artery.

942
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:32,246
Thankfully, the damage
to his heart was minimal.

943
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,622
Oh, great.

944
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,875
So did you two
grifters pull it off?

945
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:36,959
I had that green light on

946
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:38,502
for almost ten minutes
after we closed.

947
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:40,588
The whole team kept asking
what the hell we were doing.

948
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:43,257
You know, just wanted to make
sure Mom was out of the woods

949
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:44,967
before we shook
things up, right, Doc?

950
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,135
Right.

951
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,137
Well, you owe me one.

952
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,805
We sure do. Thanks again.

953
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,515
Yeah.

954
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:54,310
Hopefully, this is a step
in the right direction.

955
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:55,478
Yeah, you know, hopefully,

956
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:57,647
we did crack that
door open today.

957
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:00,274
Well, there's still
time to get in my run.

958
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,360
On that leg?

959
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,737
Maybe I'll give
it a rest tonight.

960
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,322
Good call.

961
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,866
- See you tomorrow?
- You bet.

962
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,998
Oh, hi. Margo, hi.

963
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:17,625
- Oh, hey, Dean.
- Hi.

964
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,001
Hi.

965
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,503
Uh, what are you doing here?

966
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,922
Oh, one of my residents
had her appendix out,

967
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,548
so I just thought I'd stop in.

968
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:25,716
- Okay.
- Yeah.

969
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,741
Yeah.

970
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:30,054
- okay.
- Mm-hmm.

971
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:32,973
Well, uh, good night.

972
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:34,475
Stay warm.
- Thank you.

973
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,644
And, Margo?
- Yep?

974
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:37,919
Uh...

975
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,482
- Okay, so...
- Mm-hmm?

976
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:44,694
I was wondering if maybe you, uh

977
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:48,072
you know, you'd ever
wanna go out sometime?

978
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,865
- Yeah, I would.
- Oh.

979
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:53,661
So why don't you call me
and we'll make a date?

980
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,603
- All right.
- Okay.

981
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:59,375
Huh.

982
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,681
Hey!

983
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:16,392
- Hey.
- You're not running tonight.

984
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,894
What happened to
your type A routine?

985
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:22,565
I decided to rest my leg
and, uh... and walk instead.

986
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,233
Oh, no. You don't
need to do that.

987
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:26,152
I'll give you a lift.

988
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,321
- Yeah?
- Yeah, jump in.

989
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,687
- Thanks.
- Sure.

990
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:42,335
If you wanted to go to my place,

991
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:47,048
I've got some epic herbal tea.

992
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:49,342
Wow. Epic?

993
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:51,802
How can I refuse?

994
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,429
You can't.
