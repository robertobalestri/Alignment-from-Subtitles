1
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,456
I've been here a month, and
already, I've been assigned

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,486
<i>an ethics course,
pissed off the board,</i>

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,114
<i>and now this disaster
with Exsomadex?</i>

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,658
Maybe you should think
about another career.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,661
<i>There's 40,000 single
men in Chicago,</i>

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,038
<i>so you've gotta click
with at least one of them.</i>

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,124
If you wanted to go to my place,

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,334
I've got some herbal tea.

9
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,920
How can I refuse?

10
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,672
<i>So tell me, doctor,</i>

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,674
you deal with any
crazy people today?

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,384
Pawel! I'm sorry.

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,745
He's my brother, and we are
responsible for each other.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,935
Hey, Lil, I think
I heard the door.

15
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,711
{\an8}I will get it.

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,190
{\an8}Pawel.

17
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,195
{\an8}It's freezing.

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,533
{\an8}Which side?

19
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,909
{\an8}What arm?

20
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,703
{\an8}What's going on?

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,706
{\an8}My brother said he'd
hurt his shoulder.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,541
{\an8}Well, it's nothing.

23
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,544
{\an8}But I can use
something for the pain.

24
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,546
{\an8}Figure you keep some
goodies in the cookie jar.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,090
{\an8}Only goodies we have
in the cookie jar

26
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,801
{\an8}are your sister's
delicious shortbreads.

27
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,678
{\an8}You mind if I take a look?

28
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,889
{\an8}Can I take a look?

29
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,601
{\an8}That looks like a
dislocated shoulder to me.

30
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,561
{\an8}How'd that happen?

31
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,312
{\an8}Did somebody do this to you?

32
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,897
{\an8}I slipped on some ice.

33
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,065
{\an8}It's happened before.

34
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,567
{\an8}I can pop it back myself.

35
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,110
{\an8}Can't you just write
me a prescription?

36
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,445
{\an8}I can't.

37
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,280
{\an8}But you know, I'm headed
into work right now.

38
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,990
{\an8}Why don't we let somebody
at Med take a look at it?

39
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,784
{\an8}Come on. You can ride with me.

40
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,186
{\an8}Oh, please. Let's go.

41
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,374
{\an8}Wait, what?

42
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,751
{\an8}He just had a cup,
and then he left?

43
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,252
{\an8}I mean, no.

44
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,879
{\an8}He said he had to get
up early for work,

45
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,757
{\an8}which, basically, yes.

46
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,550
{\an8}Nothing happened.

47
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,052
{\an8}And you're sure
that he understood

48
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,096
{\an8}your intentions, that...
- Maggie.

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,390
{\an8}I invited him to my
apartment for tea.

50
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,433
{\an8}Could I have been any clearer?
- That depends.

51
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,310
{\an8}Did you do that little quote
thing with your fingers

52
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,062
{\an8}when you asked him?

53
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,356
{\an8}- No!
- I'm so mortified!

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,566
{\an8}I've been avoiding him
for, like, three days.

55
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,443
{\an8}I don't know. Maybe
he's just not into me.

56
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,112
{\an8}No, I wouldn't jump
to that conclusion.

57
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,738
{\an8}- No?
- No.

58
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,615
{\an8}Maybe he's just
one of those guys

59
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,617
{\an8}that doesn't wanna cross a
boundary with a co-worker.

60
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,995
{\an8}Or maybe he's just
like a lot of men

61
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,037
{\an8}oblivious.

62
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,791
{\an8}Go on.

63
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,209
{\an8}No time like the present.

64
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,169
{\an8}Yeah, no, I don't
know. It's, um...

65
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,921
{\an8}Hannah, you can't just
keep avoiding him.

66
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,506
{\an8}I'm not.

67
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,091
{\an8}You know, I just realized that
I forgot my whatchamacallit

68
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,408
{\an8}and my thingamajig.

69
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,806
{\an8}Can you believe how
cold it is outside?

70
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,767
{\an8}I thought Easter was supposed
to welcome in spring.

71
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,810
{\an8}What's all this?

72
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,812
{\an8}Peds ward Easter egg hunt later.

73
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,315
{\an8}We're going extra
lilac this year.

74
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,607
{\an8}I don't really get this holiday.

75
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,318
{\an8}The symbology is
all over the map.

76
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,819
{\an8}Like, what's with the
eggs and the bunnies?

77
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,821
{\an8}Because death and
resurrection aren't as fun

78
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,864
{\an8}dipped in chocolate.

79
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,991
{\an8}- Hey, that's for the kids.
- Ow!

80
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,743
{\an8}Besides, you need to
keep your hands clean.

81
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,785
{\an8}Ambo's coming in.

82
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,495
{\an8}Okay. Okay.

83
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,582
{\an8}Is there a different holiday
you prefer to observe?

84
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,292
{\an8}Religion's not really my thing.

85
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,003
{\an8}Relying on cosmic
forces to save the day?

86
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,963
{\an8}I don't know. Isn't that
what we're here for?

87
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:20,176
I'll take all the help I can
get, cosmic or otherwise.

88
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,011
Carson Miller, 28-year-old male,

89
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,471
late-stage cystic fibrosis,

90
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,972
known to your
transplant service.

91
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,433
Trouble breathing, febrile
at home with a temp of 103.

92
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,934
Have him on high-flow oxygen.

93
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,853
All right, Carson,
I'm Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

94
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,896
This is Dr. Ahmad.

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,856
We're gonna get
you taken care of.

96
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,275
Nice and easy, everyone.

97
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,652
On my count.

98
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,237
One, two, three.

99
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,114
Let's get a chest X-ray stat.

100
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,366
He caught a bug a week ago.

101
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,575
Can't seem to
fight this one off.

102
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,410
I'm his wife, Kendall.

103
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,246
Okay, let's take a
listen to those lungs.

104
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,332
Take a deep breath for me?

105
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,752
I'm sorry.

106
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,087
That's all I got.

107
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,421
Sats at 82.

108
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,923
It was above 90 when
we left the house.

109
00:03:58,947 --> 00:03:59,965
X-ray up.

110
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,451
All clear.

111
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,847
It's all whited out.

112
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,058
Let's increase his
oxygen to 15 liters,

113
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,393
draw labs and cultures.

114
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,811
Where is he on the
transplant list?

115
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,813
He's been waiting for
over three years now.

116
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:17,108
I've been holding on to faith
that I'll receive a new pair,

117
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,069
but the way I feel today...

118
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,196
No, come on, baby.
Don't talk like that.

119
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,739
Hang in there.

120
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,282
Carson, I'm gonna intubate
you to help you breathe.

121
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,909
Are you okay with that?

122
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,246
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

123
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,332
I'm gonna hold you to that.

124
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,443
20 of etomidate and 100 of sux.

125
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,321
You're gonna go to
sleep now, Carson.

126
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,428
Hello, Becca. I'm Dr. Archer.

127
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,722
I understand you
burned your hand.

128
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:51,475
{\an8}I bumped into the coffeemaker
at work with my belly.

129
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,352
{\an8}I keep forgetting
how big I'm getting.

130
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,645
{\an8}How many weeks are you?

131
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,896
{\an8}37.

132
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,106
{\an8}I'm going to have a boy.

133
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,441
{\an8}Ah, congrats.

134
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,842
{\an8}Yeah. Okay.

135
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,656
{\an8}All right, well,
the good news is,

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,366
{\an8}it seems pretty superficial.

137
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,868
{\an8}That's what I figured.

138
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,536
{\an8}I wouldn't even come in if
my manager hadn't insisted.

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,787
{\an8}Well, you know what?

140
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,289
{\an8}Let's just ice it,
put a dressing on it,

141
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,753
{\an8}and we'll send you
back on your way.

142
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,877
{\an8}So is it your first?

143
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,629
{\an8}No, it's not.

144
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,073
{\an8}There you are, babe.

145
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,718
{\an8}I came down here
as soon as I could.

146
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,470
{\an8}Tyler, I already told you,

147
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,554
{\an8}it wasn't necessary
for you to come in.

148
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,348
{\an8}It's barely even a thing.

149
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,933
{\an8}- And you are?
- Tyler, her husband.

150
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,185
{\an8}So what happens now?

151
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,896
{\an8}Do we induce or go
straight into a C-section?

152
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,649
Well, I'm no
obstetrician, but, uh,

153
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,025
from what I can
tell, there's no need

154
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,110
to deliver the baby today.

155
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,320
You didn't tell him?

156
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,988
Tyler, please, you need to stop.

157
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,657
Tell me what?

158
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,242
This baby needs to
be delivered today.

159
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,994
Why?

160
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,955
Tyler thinks that
he's telepathic.

161
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,917
I am telepathic.

162
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,837
So, what? You can
read your baby's mind?

163
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,506
He's saying that
he's in distress

164
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,633
and that he needs to come out.

165
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,617
So I want an OB down here now.

166
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,973
Why won't anybody listen to me?
- Okay.

167
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,846
Lift the line.

168
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,181
Help it drain.

169
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,081
There's enough pus in there
to fill the Chicago River.

170
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,000
Pretty rank.

171
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,583
Yeah, he's septic, all right.

172
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,127
Those lungs are shot.

173
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,629
Look, I'm not gonna be
any use to you, Marcel.

174
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,464
Even if I had a new pair
of lungs to transplant,

175
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,676
there's too much infected
tissue in there for it to take.

176
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,511
Only thing to do is
keep hitting him hard

177
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,595
with the broad-spectrum
antibiotics

178
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,638
and hope for the best.

179
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,640
Hope for the best?

180
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,975
Who's this?

181
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,228
Dr. Zola Ahmad,
third-year EM resident.

182
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,813
Third year.

183
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,398
I didn't realize I was
speaking to someone

184
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,774
with so much experience.

185
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,984
I fail to see how doing nothing

186
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,569
could be considered
the best option.

187
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,903
Ah, I see you've
already trained her

188
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,488
to disrespect her superiors

189
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,282
in your own inimitable
way, Marcel.

190
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,201
And I see your skin hasn't
gotten any thicker, Morris.

191
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:18,497
So run me through what
happens if his lungs come out.

192
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,874
Both of them?

193
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,917
Well, they're doing
more damage than good.

194
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,338
So yes, if we remove them,
then we remove the infection,

195
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,256
get the heart and body
a chance to heal, right?

196
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,842
And what do you plan on
putting in their place?

197
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,719
Why can't we put him on ECMO?

198
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,054
What happened?

199
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,014
They no longer teach
anatomy at med school?

200
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,224
When you take the lungs
out, ECMO is not an option.

201
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,726
There's no way to
complete the circuit.

202
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,187
Unless we Jerry-rig a new one.

203
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,023
Look, I'm aware it's a risk
but not one we can't overcome.

204
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,025
He'll be lucky to
survive the surgery,

205
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,236
let alone living long enough
for a new donor to come along.

206
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,863
No. I'm sorry.

207
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,282
You two are on your own.

208
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,410
So what now?

209
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,921
Okay, baby is in the
correct position.

210
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,589
Amniotic fluid looks good.

211
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,466
Blood pressure is
a bit elevated,

212
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,842
but I'm not too concerned.

213
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,303
So we'll see what
the labs tell us.

214
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,430
The blood pressure could
just be from stress, right?

215
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,765
Possibly, yes.

216
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,392
I wonder what could
be causing that.

217
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,060
Hmm.

218
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,938
Are you sure you're reading
that thing correctly?

219
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:24,981
Yes.

220
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,732
Maybe it needs to
be recalibrated.

221
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,067
Clinical engineering
just serviced

222
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,819
all the ultrasound
machines last week.

223
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,529
So you're saying it
needed to be serviced?

224
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,655
Enough.

225
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,074
You need to see a psychiatrist.

226
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,142
Would you be able
to make that happen?

227
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,916
{\an8}So what do you make
of the husband?

228
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,419
{\an8}- Telepathy?
- Yes.

229
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,214
{\an8}Military and CIA spent who
knows how many billions

230
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,800
{\an8}trying to weaponize
mind control.

231
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,428
{\an8}Total waste of time and money.

232
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,555
{\an8}Okay?

233
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,931
{\an8}Uh...

234
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,101
{\an8}Sorry for being a bit grouchy.

235
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:07,606
{\an8}Uh, I'm supposed to meet
Margo later for lunch.

236
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,275
{\an8}Having cold feet.

237
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,860
{\an8}So you took my advice
and called her.

238
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,028
{\an8}Good for you.

239
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,947
If it goes south,
I'm blaming you.

240
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,782
Hey, Dan, we have a
patient we were hoping

241
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,743
you could speak with quickly.
- Be right there.

242
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,328
Hey, Mitch, you got a sec?

243
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,662
Yeah.

244
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,873
- Have you ever met Liliana?
- Uh, not directly.

245
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,082
But she works here right?

246
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,709
Yeah, she's my girlfriend.

247
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,504
Anyway, her brother appears to
have dislocated his shoulder.

248
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,797
You want me to take a look?

249
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,090
- I'd so appreciate it.
- Yeah, of course.

250
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,301
- Let me introduce you.
- Sure.

251
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,552
Hey.

252
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,972
Hey, um, how's your hamstring?

253
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,640
Uh, yeah, it's still
a little tight.

254
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,352
But okay. Thanks for asking.

255
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,649
What was that about?

256
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,775
What was what about?

257
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,401
You and Ripley?

258
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,070
I thought I was picking up
a little something there.

259
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,988
Yeah, says the guy who
doesn't believe in ESP.

260
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,492
Trust me, there's nothing there.

261
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,118
Nothing.

262
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,830
What's going on? How can I help?

263
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,791
So you can hear
your son's thoughts,

264
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,210
and he's telling you
that he's in pain?

265
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,753
Yes.

266
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,839
Right. Going on for three weeks?

267
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,174
Can we wrap this up already?

268
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,259
Just a couple more
questions, I promise.

269
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,679
Um, and as much as you're
able, can you tell me,

270
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,847
how do you actually
experience it?

271
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,475
Is it like your son
is... is speaking to you?

272
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,227
No, no, of course not.

273
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,480
He hasn't developed
language skills.

274
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,524
It's more elemental than that.

275
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,734
So is it more like

276
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,154
like... like a radio
signal or something?

277
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,406
Yes.

278
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,199
And does it... does it
only happen with him?

279
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,326
Or does it happen
with other people too?

280
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,286
I see where you're
going with this.

281
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,414
You're trying to see
if I'm exhibiting

282
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,749
signs of schizophrenia.

283
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,460
I've just been down
this road before,

284
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:56,966
you know, being analyzed
by my wife and her friends.

285
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,051
They all think I'm
showing signs of PTSD

286
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,721
because of what
happened to Chloe.

287
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,455
Who's Chloe?

288
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,727
Their first child
died from SIDS?

289
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:12,773
A girl, Chloe, about four
years ago, age eight months.

290
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,358
Oh, God, I feel
horrible for them.

291
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,194
I suppose that
explains the telepathy.

292
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,238
I don't wanna be
tilling your field,

293
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,116
but doesn't that sound
like PTSD to you?

294
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,076
Maybe.

295
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,994
You know, maybe a response

296
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,203
to all the grief and the trauma

297
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,831
but, admittedly, an unusual one.

298
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,042
Well, is there
anything you can do?

299
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,877
Don't think he's gonna be
too responsive to any kind

300
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,463
of counseling right now, given
that her due date is so close.

301
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,006
I guess we just have
to wait for them

302
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,549
to give birth to a healthy child

303
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,218
in order to prove them wrong,
and that's your department.

304
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,429
Okay, well, I'll go
check Becca's BP,

305
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,954
see if it normalized.

306
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,460
And back.

307
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,193
That's not hurting him?

308
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,903
Not with the
anesthetic we gave him.

309
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,179
Now just a bit more
counter traction.

310
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,993
There.

311
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,454
That should do it.
Back in the socket.

312
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,873
How's that feel, Pawel?

313
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,416
Good.

314
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,502
We'll keep his shoulder
iced to reduce the swelling,

315
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,570
and, uh, I'll be back in
a bit to check on him.

316
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,428
He's been living with
this disease for so long.

317
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,682
I just assumed he
was invincible.

318
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,558
Don't give up hope yet, Kendall.

319
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,144
I've witnessed plenty
of last-second miracles.

320
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,982
My husband is the most
generous person I've ever met.

321
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,275
He runs a homeless
shelter, you know?

322
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,570
He's given so much to so many.

323
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,573
When is it gonna be
his turn to get...

324
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,826
Let's get you settled
in the waiting area.

325
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,436
The doctors will come and
find you when they know more.

326
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,876
Dr. Ahmad, we need
you in treatment six.

327
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,714
On my count. One, two, three.

328
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,132
What's going on here?

329
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,093
Guy was found face down in
a culvert, frozen solid.

330
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,261
No way of telling how
long he was there.

331
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,595
No rhythm on the monitor.

332
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,847
Not sure this guy's alive.

333
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:08,973
And the cup?

334
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,019
I'm guessing it
wasn't self-inflicted.

335
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,396
Okay, let's do an ultrasound.

336
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,190
Do you have an ID?
- Leo Pruitt, known scumbag.

337
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,692
Done time for
assault and battery,

338
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,193
felony sex trafficking.

339
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,779
Can't say there'll be tears
shed at the 23rd tonight.

340
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,698
His temp is

341
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,283
11 degrees Celsius.

342
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,369
I'm not seeing any
discernible cardiac motion.

343
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,912
Why wasn't he brought
straight to the morgue?

344
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,205
He can't be declared dead

345
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,540
until he's declared
warm and dead.

346
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,208
Okay.

347
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,878
Let's start a warm saline
lavage of his bladder.

348
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,421
Thaw him out.

349
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,870
How's that?

350
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,849
I cannot make a fist.

351
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,352
That can happen sometimes
when you dislocate a shoulder.

352
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,271
It can put a stretch
on the nerve.

353
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,607
It didn't feel like
this when I came in.

354
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,275
I suspect it'll improve

355
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,194
as soon as the
swelling goes down.

356
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,695
But if it doesn't get
better by, say, next week,

357
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,157
just come back in, and I'll
take a look at it, okay?

358
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,785
And a prescription for the pain?

359
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,579
I'll have it waiting for you
with your discharge paperwork.

360
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,456
Thank you, Dr. Ripley.

361
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,065
You're welcome.

362
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,089
Pawel's good to go.

363
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:26,842
Oh, Mitch, can I ask you, um...

364
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,804
Pawel said that he slipped
on the ice this morning.

365
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:32,848
Would you be able to tell if
his X-rays were, I don't know,

366
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,225
consistent with that claim?

367
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,185
Versus what?

368
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,854
I don't know, something
more intentional?

369
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,398
Like somebody did this to him,

370
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,441
or he did this to himself?

371
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,568
I don't know,
something like that.

372
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,737
I mean, I guess.

373
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,823
But you wouldn't be able
to tell from the X-rays.

374
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,991
Okay.

375
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,784
Why are you asking?

376
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,578
You know, he went through a
tough time a little while ago.

377
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,997
I worry about him a bit.

378
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,416
But, um, anyway, thanks again.

379
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,709
I really do appreciate it.

380
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,002
Yeah.

381
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,548
- You got it.
- Yeah.

382
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,675
I got it.

383
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,885
Okay.

384
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,345
Both: Ooh.

385
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,847
It's all so trashed.

386
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:16,434
Yeah, elution is the
solution to pollution.

387
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,477
So let's wash everything out,

388
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,856
make sure there's no
lingering bacteria.

389
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,150
There you go.

390
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,319
Get in there. Get in there.

391
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,529
Now all we need to do is
create a temporary bridge

392
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,449
between the right pulmonary
artery and the left atrium.

393
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,267
Dr. Ahmad, someone's
asking for you downstairs.

394
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,372
The neighbor said they heard

395
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,458
some kind of dust up
night before last.

396
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,626
You know, I knew it wasn't good
when I seen his favorite boots

397
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,170
still under the bed.

398
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,714
- You two live together?
- Almost nine years now.

399
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,550
He is my man.

400
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,867
Oh, no.

401
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,598
What, ain't nobody
gonna take that out?

402
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,891
I'm sorry, I should
have warned you.

403
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,225
We were about to remove it.

404
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,685
We just wanted to make sure that

405
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,520
it wouldn't adversely affect
your husband's condition.

406
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,773
- He is not my husband.
- I see.

407
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,067
Well, we're gonna be needing
to make some tough decisions

408
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,568
regarding his care soon, Kimmy.

409
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,612
Is there someone else we
should be speaking to?

410
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,238
No.

411
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,657
No, just me.

412
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,492
You know, Leo made
me power of attorney

413
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,911
the last time he was
in prison, so it's a

414
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,704
yeah, it's just me, I guess.

415
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,539
Okay, well, here's
where we're at.

416
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,124
In the process of
warming his core,

417
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,418
the good news is,
we've achieved return

418
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,253
of his spontaneous circulation.

419
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,550
So his... his heart's
still beating?

420
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,137
Faintly, yes, though it's his
brain we're concerned about.

421
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,014
He's been outside
in the freezing cold

422
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,558
for over 24 hours
in this condition.

423
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,144
We expect that there won't be
a good neurological outcome.

424
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,357
There's still a small chance
that he might come through.

425
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,842
But you should probably
prepare for the worst.

426
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,513
Do you want me to take
a look at that eye?

427
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,450
Um, no.

428
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,160
No, that's nothing.

429
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,370
Is there someplace
that I could go

430
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,955
get, um, coffee around here?

431
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,289
I had a long night last night.

432
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,874
Yeah, just around the
corner on this side.

433
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,251
That'll lead you to a café.

434
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,401
Thanks.

435
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,924
Okay, Becca, we
got your labs back.

436
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,718
And your labs all look good.

437
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,302
Urine doesn't have
any protein in it,

438
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,721
which is what we wanna see.

439
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,681
That's a relief.

440
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,809
Your blood pressure, however,
has remained elevated.

441
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,894
Some readings even in
a more severe range.

442
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,856
Now, while this very well
may be anxiety related,

443
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,735
I can't say for certain that
this isn't preeclampsia.

444
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,322
So I suggest, given
how far along you are,

445
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,615
that we start magnesium
and induce labor today

446
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,367
to prevent you from
getting sicker.

447
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,203
Yes, that's exactly what
we want to have happen.

448
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,873
Becca?

449
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,000
O-okay.

450
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,418
Okay.

451
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,836
Now, the delivery
rooms are all in use,

452
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,005
but by the time you're
ready to deliver,

453
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,965
one should be available.

454
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,967
See? What'd I tell you?

455
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,844
I'd prefer not to see
your face right now.

456
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,387
I mean it.

457
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,514
There's a waiting
room out front.

458
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,016
I know where it is.

459
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,351
Okay.

460
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,855
You're gonna be so
grateful for this.

461
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,148
I can't believe he's
getting his way.

462
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,691
Ugh.

463
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:15,237
A nurse will be in shortly
to give you oxytocin.

464
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,199
Drive safe, and, uh, I'll
be home in time for dinner.

465
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,035
Yes, sweetheart.

466
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,870
- Oh!
- Man.

467
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,753
You all right?

468
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,797
Yeah, yeah.

469
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,591
Just get this jab of pain
sometimes down my arm.

470
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,926
Huh.

471
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,221
How long has that
been, uh, going on for?

472
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,556
Oh, about a month or so.

473
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,809
I must have slept on it
funny and pinched the nerve,

474
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,894
pins and needles.

475
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,522
I, uh... I gotta
call Becca's mom,

476
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,148
let her know what's happening.

477
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,316
Excuse me.

478
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,614
At least we were able
to complete the circuit.

479
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,991
That's not gonna matter

480
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,826
if we can't stabilize
the heart in the chest.

481
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,869
What's going on with
your ECMO circuit?

482
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,663
I don't know. It
keeps kinking off.

483
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,415
Normally we take out
one lung at a time,

484
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,959
but since we got both out,
there's not enough there

485
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,544
to stabilize the heart.

486
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,045
Maybe with another pack.

487
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,381
The problem is, these pads,
they're either too firm

488
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,174
or not bulky enough
to keep that heart

489
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,592
stabilized in the center,

490
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,720
not without impeding
its function.

491
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,222
So what are we
supposed to do now?

492
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:33,797
It's just so frustrating.

493
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,609
I keep banging my
head against the wall,

494
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,652
trying to get
these big hospitals

495
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,862
to adjust their protocols.

496
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,155
Maybe you should wear a helmet

497
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,406
so you don't get a concussion.

498
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,616
You're right.

499
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,201
I probably should.

500
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,246
Uh, but Dean, I'm telling you,
if you just look at the data,

501
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,206
you see how much better
outcomes can be for people

502
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,293
suffering from opioid addiction
if they're initiated in the ED

503
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,794
on the day of first contact.

504
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,987
It's at least 50%
more effective.

505
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,884
I am talking too much, aren't I?

506
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,135
No, you're not.

507
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,095
No, you're passionate
about what you do.

508
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,347
It's good.

509
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,848
I do not usually
go on like this.

510
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,391
I barely let you get a word in.

511
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,833
That's okay.

512
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,438
So this is where you jump in.

513
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,065
Oh, sorry.

514
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,525
Sorry. I might be
a little rusty.

515
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:21,489
Uh, I haven't been on an actual
date with someone for a while.

516
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,990
Hmm.

517
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:26,619
I don't know if lunch
at work with a colleague

518
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,079
counts as a date.
- Oh, I see.

519
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,539
Yeah, but you know,
tomorrow night,

520
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,982
dinner, on the other
hand, that would count.

521
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,379
If you're free.

522
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,589
Uh...

523
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,632
Hey, Margo.

524
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,758
Hey, Daniel.

525
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,176
I am so sorry to interrupt,

526
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,095
but can I just borrow
him for a second?

527
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,306
Yeah, I've gotta get back
to the center anyway.

528
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,100
So will you call me later?

529
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,103
- You bet.
- Great.

530
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,563
What can I do for you?

531
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,652
Trini.

532
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,257
Take these to the lab.

533
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,550
Have them follow
my instructions.

534
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,552
Done.

535
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,938
So how's Carson?

536
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,690
Okay, for the time being.

537
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,525
For the time being?

538
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,485
I'm trying to find something
to fill the chest cavities

539
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,446
to stabilize his heart.

540
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,489
This should do it.

541
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,657
Vacuum dressings?

542
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,577
Are you sure?

543
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,079
Maybe not.

544
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,707
Damn.

545
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,336
I need something, like,
double my hand size,

546
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,379
firm but pillowy,

547
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,173
and sterile.

548
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,740
I think I have an idea.

549
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:08,929
Breast implants?

550
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,931
Yep.

551
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,934
Let's get a couple double
Ds at 400 CC to start.

552
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,436
You gotta be kidding me.

553
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,520
I'm not.

554
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,088
Go ahead and move 'em.

555
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,967
The other one.

556
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,614
Hold that there.

557
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:27,907
Good.

558
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,641
Let it sit. Let it sit.

559
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,913
Now we need one more.

560
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,707
Let me get, uh, let
me get a 250 CC.

561
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,079
They're holding it in place.

562
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:55,184
Nice call, boss.

563
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,686
That wasn't my idea.

564
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,562
Let's go ahead and
close up the best we can

565
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,732
and cross our fingers.

566
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,526
You think Tyler might have MS?

567
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,404
I think he could be
exhibiting early signs, yeah.

568
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,699
Tingling of the fingers
isn't exactly definitive.

569
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,910
New study found that
psychiatric issues

570
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,413
could very well be
the earliest tell

571
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,248
for multiple sclerosis of all,

572
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,750
like maybe as much
as five years.

573
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:22,003
Demyelinated disorders
can have a wide range

574
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,255
of neurological symptoms,
I'll give you that.

575
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,340
Processing speed, all right,
visuospatial perception,

576
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,593
and can alter a person's
perception of self

577
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,095
in relation to others.

578
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,305
Making someone think they
could read people's minds?

579
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,016
I don't know. Maybe.

580
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,102
I mean, the only way to
diagnose that is with an MRI,

581
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,229
and I don't think
you're gonna be able

582
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,772
to get him to consent
to getting one.

583
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,149
I don't think I am, either,

584
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,900
'cause he already
doesn't trust me.

585
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,694
You, on the other hand...

586
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,820
Me?

587
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,204
How am I supposed
to convince him?

588
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,285
How long can he
survive like this?

589
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,870
Well, like I explained earlier,

590
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,621
this is an
experimental endeavor.

591
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,956
So we'll see.

592
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,792
It could be for only a
few hours or a few days.

593
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,586
It's impossible to tell.

594
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,880
But we've bought ourselves
a little bit of time,

595
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,300
and, uh, he's no longer
in septic shock, okay?

596
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:13,161
Kendall, we're gonna
find him a donor.

597
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,795
- Dr. Marcel?
- Yeah?

598
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:26,192
I might have a lead on
a new pair of lungs.

599
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:27,360
Really?

600
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,819
Service contact you?

601
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:29,987
Well, the lungs
I'm talking about

602
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,656
aren't in their system yet.

603
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,242
Frozen guy they brought in?

604
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,452
It's worth getting
the ball rolling

605
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,037
to see if it's a match, right?
- Hold on.

606
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,747
There's a lot of boxes
that need to be checked off

607
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,374
before we can even
declare a guy brain dead.

608
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,376
- I know.
- Tell me.

609
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,337
First, we confirm that his
core temp's back to normal.

610
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,881
Then we have to
perform an apnea test

611
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,425
to determine if his brain
still triggers a breath.

612
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:54,929
Finally, nuclear medicine
conducts a blood flow study.

613
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,223
And then and only then
can we check to see

614
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,892
if the lungs are
an actual match.

615
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,519
You see, these steps
are important, Zola,

616
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,020
and you can't skip any.

617
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,397
Trying to resuscitate
that patient

618
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,089
needs to be your one
and only priority.

619
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,092
Okay, Professor Snape.

620
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,862
I get it.

621
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,955
Hey, Becca, I heard
your water broke.

622
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,916
About three minutes ago, yeah.

623
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,210
Okay, repetitive
decels to the 90s.

624
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,462
She's had a few variables
since the water broke.

625
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,047
I've tried repositioning.

626
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,383
Is anything wrong? It...
that doesn't sound good.

627
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,969
Baby's just jostling around.
It happens all the time.

628
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,762
But I would like to check
how you're progressing.

629
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,764
Can you roll onto
your back, please?

630
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,224
Okay, you're gonna feel

631
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:42,125
a little bit of
pressure, all right?

632
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,607
I feel cord.

633
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:49,900
So let me get this straight.

634
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,235
You're asking for consent

635
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,071
to scan my brain for
a research paper?

636
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,239
Yeah, that's right.

637
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,991
That you hope will demonstrate

638
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,618
a physiological
proof of telepathy?

639
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,078
Yeah, that's correct.

640
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,955
If you're worried about
your anonymity at all,

641
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,373
it's nothing to be
concerned about.

642
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,917
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

643
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,586
Do you really expect
me to buy that?

644
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,005
I don't have to be telepathic
to tell that you're lying.

645
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,989
What's this about?

646
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,346
I'm concerned about some
symptoms you exhibited today,

647
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,182
and an MRI would allow us
to rule some things out.

648
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,017
- Symptoms?
- Mm-hmm.

649
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,602
I understand you've
been experiencing

650
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,271
a pins and needles sensation
for the last three weeks?

651
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,939
So that plus your telepathy...

652
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,191
It's that psychiatrist

653
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,901
putting you up to
this, isn't it?

654
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,528
How have your eyes
been lately, Tyler?

655
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,364
Any soreness?

656
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,115
Has your vision
been blurry at all?

657
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:41,059
Have you experienced any
dizziness or vertigo?

658
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:46,749
We got a cord prolapse.

659
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,167
What's happening?

660
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:49,752
The umbilical cord slipped
past your baby's head

661
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,463
and is being squeezed between
his body and your cervix.

662
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,507
We need to deliver him
immediately via C-section.

663
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,050
What do you need me to do?

664
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,635
You ever deal with
a prolapse before?

665
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:58,803
No.

666
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,054
Glove up, and I need you to do

667
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,847
exactly what I say and
only what I say, okay?

668
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,140
We're gonna have to swap places.

669
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,350
- I'll get an OR open.
- Mm-hmm.

670
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,939
I'm right here.

671
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,524
I'm scared.

672
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,652
Becca, I'm so sorry. I
know this is uncomfortable.

673
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:17,154
Okay, I need to remove
my hand so I can operate.

674
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,156
We need to change places
as quickly as possible.

675
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,866
So slide your hand
in next to mine.

676
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,578
And we'll meet at the head so
it doesn't compress the cord.

677
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:27,289
Okay, I'm there.

678
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,499
Okay.

679
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:30,584
- Now what?
- Don't move until I tell you.

680
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,794
We need to get her upstairs.

681
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:41,808
This is not how I
wanted this to go.

682
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:43,806
Dr. Asher is the
best there is, Becca.

683
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,433
Just stay positive, okay?

684
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,059
You kept telling me
something was wrong.

685
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,144
I'm so sorry I
didn't believe you.

686
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,228
Don't worry, baby.

687
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,521
I'll be with you the whole time.

688
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,732
I'm sorry, we can't have
you in the OR, Tyler,

689
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,443
but we'll let you know as soon
as your baby's been delivered.

690
00:27:57,302 --> 00:28:00,448
- I love you.
- I love you.

691
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,616
Medically speaking, it's
all just a coincidence,

692
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,327
but the guy did call it.

693
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,914
Tyler, Tyler, hey, hey, hey.

694
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,291
You all right?

695
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,334
I don't know what happened.

696
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,002
I just got dizzy
all of a sudden.

697
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,796
Let's find someplace we can,
uh, get you off your feet.

698
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,238
Come on.

699
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,471
His core temperature
is up to 36 Celsius.

700
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,265
He's still not taking his own
breaths on the ventilator.

701
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,018
If he was gonna come to,
we'd see signs of it by now.

702
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,543
Mm-hmm.

703
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,982
I feel pretty comfortable
calling in radiology

704
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,675
to confirm brain death.

705
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,280
I'm really sorry for your loss.

706
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:48,913
So, um, what happens now?

707
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,581
Well, that depends.

708
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,500
As far as we can tell,
Leo didn't stipulate

709
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:56,212
whether or not he wanted
to be an organ donor.

710
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:57,996
Did you guys ever discuss
anything like that?

711
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,802
He told me he wanted to
go to the Grand Canyon

712
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:05,346
once before he died,
but that's about it.

713
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,806
Would you feel
comfortable making

714
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,850
a decision like that for him?

715
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,751
You can, you know.

716
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:15,773
I don't know.

717
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:19,694
Like... if he ever found out...

718
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,737
He's gone, Kimmy.

719
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,990
You don't have to be
afraid of him anymore.

720
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,455
There's a young man
upstairs in the ICU.

721
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,125
He just lost his lungs
to cystic fibrosis.

722
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,419
We have him on a machine now.

723
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,380
But he won't live much
longer without a new pair.

724
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,007
And Leo's are a match?

725
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:42,091
They are.

726
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,324
I checked.

727
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,388
You wouldn't believe
this guy, Kimmy.

728
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:51,058
He runs a homeless
shelter, food bank.

729
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:54,461
His wife told me that they
hope to have kids someday.

730
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,715
Seems like a good guy.

731
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:04,822
I don't know many men like that.

732
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,907
Kimmy, I apologize for
being presumptuous,

733
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,160
but I get the sense that Leo

734
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:10,828
was responsible for
causing a lot of pain

735
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,122
and suffering in his life.

736
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:15,857
It'd be a shame if that's all
that there was to his legacy.

737
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,738
So is there something
I need to sign?

738
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,261
Scalpel.

739
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,013
Hey, Ripley?
- Yeah?

740
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:30,973
You don't remove your
hand from that baby's head

741
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,224
until you feel mine, okay?

742
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,267
Roger that.

743
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,810
Incision.

744
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:40,964
Retractor.

745
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,386
In the top one.

746
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,121
I feel your hand.

747
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:54,372
Okay, you can let go.

748
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,291
I've got the head.

749
00:30:57,315 --> 00:31:00,002
Here we go.

750
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,672
There he is.

751
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,465
Okay.

752
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,008
His color looks good.

753
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:10,304
Looks like we dodged
a bullet, guys.

754
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:13,224
All right. Bring
him to the warmer.

755
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,267
Hey. Nice job.

756
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,353
Thanks, boss.

757
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,659
So that's why
Dr. Archer was trying

758
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,828
to talk me into getting an MRI?

759
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:36,247
Because you think I might
have some incurable disease?

760
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:37,999
Right, and if that's the case,

761
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,543
you should know they are making
great strides in therapies

762
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,837
that mitigate the
symptoms of MS,

763
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,423
especially if we catch it early.

764
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,550
All I'm saying is,
why not look into it

765
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:50,994
if only to rule out the
worst-case scenario?

766
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:56,183
After Chloe died, we tried
really hard to get someone

767
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,102
to tell us exactly
what happened,

768
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:01,105
countless specialists all
saying the exact same thing.

769
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:04,191
Sorry, we don't know what
killed your baby girl.

770
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:06,027
It's a mystery.

771
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:10,364
And now I forge a real
connection with my baby boy,

772
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:12,325
and all I have is people
wanting to give it a name

773
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,951
and tell me I'm wrong.

774
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:17,121
Mr. Easton, I know
that was scary,

775
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,706
but everything went great.

776
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,541
Your baby's Apgar score is high,

777
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,460
which is exactly
what we wanna see,

778
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,378
and your wife did
absolutely amazing.

779
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,005
Thank God.

780
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,715
You're welcome to come meet
your son now if you'd like.

781
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,383
Yes, thank you.

782
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:32,386
Congratulations, Tyler.

783
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,222
You know, if we
would have waited

784
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,599
for her water to break at home,

785
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,809
this might have gone a
whole lot differently.

786
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,603
Real good thing you were here.

787
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:44,273
We're here because I'm
able to listen to him.

788
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:46,966
I've been given a
gift, Dr. Charles.

789
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,242
We expedited the injectables.

790
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,411
Oh, hold on.

791
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:58,996
Where's he going?

792
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,998
Transporting our new donor
down to nuclear medicine

793
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,708
to get a blood flow study.

794
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,001
What, already?

795
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,337
I ticked off all the
boxes like we discussed.

796
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,631
No gag reflex, no
corneal reflex.

797
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:11,634
The guy is brain dead,
warm and brain dead.

798
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,844
The sooner we make the call,

799
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,305
the sooner we can
harvest his organs.

800
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,848
No, we wait a
minimum of 24 hours

801
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:20,267
before we go down the
brain death pathway.

802
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,978
That's protocol, no exceptions.

803
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:25,564
You said every hour
counts with Carson.

804
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,485
Transplant needs to happen now.

805
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:32,029
No, we have an obligation
to this man as a patient,

806
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,781
not as a donor.

807
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,683
We don't even know
if he's a match yet.

808
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:44,000
Tell me you don't already
know he's a match, Zola.

809
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,546
Hey, I don't think
this guy is dead.

810
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,472
CAT scan showed nothing
life threatening,

811
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,227
and the knife caused
only minimal injury

812
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:05,146
to your maxillary sinus.

813
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,355
In a little bit,
we're gonna have

814
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:08,566
a speech therapist come see you

815
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,860
and do a complete
cognitive eval.

816
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:15,031
But, uh, all in
all, Mr. Pruitt, uh,

817
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,782
considering what
you've been through,

818
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:19,869
I'd say you're a very lucky man.

819
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:21,746
As soon as you feel up to
it, I've got some questions

820
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,122
to ask you about the assault.

821
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,498
Yeah, sure, in a second.

822
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,958
Kimmy, where the hell are you?

823
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,668
Coming, baby.

824
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:29,462
If he asks, I
didn't sign nothing.

825
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:37,928
Okay, there's a version of
this where I commend you

826
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,556
for overseeing the miraculous
return from the dead,

827
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,559
but that's not how
this is gonna go.

828
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,794
Yeah, so what the hell happened?

829
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:51,233
From what I can tell, looking
at the course of care,

830
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,069
a bladder thermometer
was used throughout

831
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,363
to measure the patient's
core temperature, right?

832
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:56,739
Uh-huh.

833
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,199
So do you understand
why that might

834
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:00,618
present a problem, Dr. Ahmad?

835
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:03,120
A warming pad and
bladder irrigation

836
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,665
might have raised
the local temperature

837
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,041
around the thermometer.

838
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,250
So that when the thermometer is

839
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:10,127
reading 36 degrees Celsius...

840
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:13,047
The actual core temp
was probably lower.

841
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:17,259
And that the patient
was not completely warm.

842
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,928
No, sir.

843
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,764
And that's exactly why our
hypothermic protocol calls

844
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:23,766
for using an esophageal probe.

845
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,937
Imagine the liability this
hospital would be exposed to

846
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:31,190
if we declared this man
dead and taken his organs.

847
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:32,817
- We were far away from...
- Just go home.

848
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,403
Go home, Zola. Go home.

849
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,121
And you... you

850
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,373
you're supposed to
be her supervisor.

851
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,691
That never should have happened.

852
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,299
There you are.

853
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,301
I was looking all over for you.

854
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,178
Well, you found me.

855
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:08,019
That, that was such
an unbelievable rush.

856
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,770
Wow, wow, wow.

857
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,939
I've never had a feeling
like that before.

858
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,233
I'm thinking maybe I got
into the wrong specialty.

859
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:17,403
And... and you,

860
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:18,863
the way you took control of it,

861
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:22,241
the command, the confidence,
us working together.

862
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,229
Um...

863
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:34,462
Mitch, about the
other night, you know,

864
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:38,656
when I invited you over
to my apartment for tea...

865
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:45,872
You know, I was thinking that
maybe we were something...

866
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:52,921
Is this okay?

867
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,194
I'm not good at reading minds.

868
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:01,697
Maybe you're much
better than you think.

869
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:04,700
No, I'm not exaggerating.

870
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:08,079
We were literally rolling
him out of the room

871
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:12,625
when, bam, out of nowhere,
he just popped right up.

872
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:13,876
It was super creepy.

873
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,127
I was very uncomfortable.

874
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:25,054
- It's eating you up, isn't it?
- What?

875
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:28,307
Possibility that a young father
could be walking out of here

876
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,393
with a debilitating
degenerative disease?

877
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,769
Yeah.

878
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,396
There's a chance
you might be wrong.

879
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,356
Maybe.

880
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,649
I certainly hope so.

881
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:41,153
Well, "maybe" is the
best we can do today.

882
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:44,389
Sometimes you gotta just
live in the mystery.

883
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,417
You guys heading out?

884
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:55,793
Yeah.

885
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,795
Doing anything interesting?

886
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:01,257
Uh, don't know.

887
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,760
I thought maybe we
could go get some tea.

888
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,327
Yeah, tea sounds good.

889
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:10,599
Dr. Mitchell Ripley?

890
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,125
Yeah, that's me.

891
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:16,814
- You've been served.
- What?

892
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,694
What is it?

893
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:22,695
Good night.

894
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,137
Dr. Charles.

895
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,408
Pawel's suing me
for malpractice.

896
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:28,933
What?

897
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:35,774
Liliana!

898
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:40,463
Lil, you upstairs?

899
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,197
She go to supermarket.

900
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,469
I was just having some vodka.

901
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:47,928
Pour you one as well?

902
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:50,163
What are you doing here?

903
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,143
My sister is kind
enough to invite me over

904
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:56,312
to spend the night,
given my injury.

905
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,897
Your injury?

906
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:00,858
That's the same injury that
you're suing the hospital over?

907
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,526
The hospital where
your sister works?

908
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,779
Oh, they tell you already?

909
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,656
I didn't think it
would happen so fast.

910
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,990
When you tee up
your shyster lawyer

911
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:09,742
before you even go
to the hospital,

912
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:10,993
things tend to
move pretty quick.

913
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:14,955
I can't use my hand, see?

914
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:17,166
I think maybe your colleague
is not a good doctor.

915
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,001
No, he's an excellent
doctor, I can assure you.

916
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:21,796
I can't drive my car for
the ride share like this.

917
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,382
This is going to really
harm me financially.

918
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,467
You know what's gonna
really harm you financially

919
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,511
is when you get busted
for insurance fraud.

920
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:29,679
Now, get out of my house.

921
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,472
Daniel, what is this?

922
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,391
Why are you speaking
this way to my brother?

923
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:36,018
Because your brother
is suing the hospital.

924
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:38,688
He's suing Ripley and the
hospital for malpractice.

925
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:40,231
Get out of my house.
- Is that true?

926
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:41,649
- Get out!
- Daniel, please.

927
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,025
Lower your voice.
- Yes, it's true.

928
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,193
I saw the complaint an hour ago.

929
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:45,778
It's okay!

930
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:48,489
I don't wanna be
where I'm not wanted.

931
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:52,451
Wait. Pawel, I will
drive you home.

932
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,446
Zola.

933
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,093
What's this?

934
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:12,096
This is the HLA test you
never should have run on Leo

935
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,223
to see if his
lungs were a match.

936
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:17,101
I'm guessing you
already knew they are.

937
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:20,521
I know I wasn't supposed
to run the HLA test.

938
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,815
But I don't understand
why we're prohibited

939
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,317
from making a draw
in the first place.

940
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:28,946
So that your care for the
patient isn't compromised.

941
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,698
You knew he was a
potential donor,

942
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,743
so you were incentivized not to
double check his temperature.

943
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,583
Am I gonna get fired?

944
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:43,711
It's not up to me.

945
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,464
This will be my third strike

946
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:47,572
my career.

947
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:52,261
I don't know if I'll be allowed
to practice medicine again.

948
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,929
Well, you should have
given that some thought

949
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,723
before you jeopardized
a man's life.
