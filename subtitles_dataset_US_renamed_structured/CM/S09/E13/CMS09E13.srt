1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,396
<i>I'll get a caregiver,</i>

2
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,398
someone who could be
with him when I'm not.

3
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,226
What about you?
What about your job?

4
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:11,488
What about your life?

5
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:13,925
This is not a
long-term solution.

6
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:16,015
<i>He's trying to sue me
to make a quick buck</i>

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,320
<i>off of the hospital.</i>

8
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:18,974
It'd be my word against Pawel's.

9
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,455
<i>A respected physician's
word against a con man's?</i>

10
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,153
The guy's a freaking menace.

11
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:25,850
Am I gonna die?

12
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,591
I must've done something wrong.

13
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:30,246
Sometimes, patients
don't survive.

14
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:33,206
But it's the burden we bear.

15
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:36,035
You promised me. You
said you could save him.

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,212
<i>I thought I could.</i>

17
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:41,170
So what's this one?

18
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:44,044
Ginger chamomile.

19
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:51,920
I like it.

20
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,487
- Really?
- Mm.

21
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:55,445
How much?

22
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:59,494
I mean, words just
can't begin to...

23
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:19,208
It's Med.

24
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,210
Why? You're not on call.

25
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,734
No idea.

26
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:26,476
Ripley.

27
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:29,175
Uh-huh.

28
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,830
Yeah, now's... now's
not a great time for me.

29
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:36,487
Isn't there anyone
else you can call?

30
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,709
I'm on my way.
- Aw.

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,146
Norovirus hit the night shift.

32
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:45,713
They're short.

33
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:47,584
That's not fair.

34
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:49,804
We finally get a night together.

35
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:52,372
Yeah.

36
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:55,637
But... to be continued.

37
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:02,252
Definitely.

38
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:05,211
- Loren, talk to me.

39
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,647
42-year-old male.

40
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,518
Impalement injury
to the abdomen.

41
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,217
Vitals are stable. GCS 14.

42
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,828
He's conscious and
able to communicate.

43
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,265
I gave him 100 mics
of fentanyl en route.

44
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,049
What did he get impaled on?

45
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,749
You ready for this?

46
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,490
VoilÃ .

47
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,753
- Is that...
- Yeah, antlers.

48
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,972
He shot the animal and
tripped trying to move it.

49
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,713
Payback. It's payback.

50
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,585
Give him another 50 of fentanyl.

51
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,761
X-ray. Lateral torso, please.

52
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:35,806
It's... it's... what
do they call it?

53
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:36,938
Karma?

54
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:38,157
Just take it easy.

55
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,159
We're gonna take
good care of you.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,986
Bilateral breath sounds.

57
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,553
Give him a gram of ceftriaxone.

58
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:45,468
150 milligrams of metronidazole.

59
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,341
- X-ray.

60
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,866
Am I gonna die?

61
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,172
No.

62
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,608
But you are gonna need surgery.

63
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,436
Looks like the antlers go
all the way into the back.

64
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:58,351
All right, we're gonna
take you up to the OR

65
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,614
where we can put you to sleep,
have this thing removed,

66
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,833
and see what we
need to fix, okay?

67
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,009
Will you let them know
that we're coming up?

68
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,621
Loren, you're with me.

69
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,928
Bambi's revenge.

70
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,331
Yep. Yep. Yep, I'm awake.

71
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:25,160
Good morning.

72
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,031
Now it is.

73
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:28,381
Here.

74
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:30,253
Thank you.

75
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:34,909
You're a lifesaver.

76
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,040
I know.

77
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,477
How was your night?

78
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,696
Ah, above average.

79
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:42,003
Hmm. I'd love to
hear about that.

80
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,526
But Maggie is asking for you.

81
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,136
Of course she is.

82
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,443
Yeah. Come on.

83
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,055
Ripley? You're on deck.

84
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:52,405
What's going on, Maggie?

85
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,015
High-risk prisoner coming
in from Statesville.

86
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,103
High-risk?

87
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:56,931
Yeah, violent
offender. Anthony?

88
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,367
Doug Green, injured
in an altercation

89
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,716
with another inmate.

90
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:01,718
Contusions, facial
fractures, broken ribs.

91
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,329
You're going to treatment four.

92
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,593
You get all the fun.

93
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,466
You give him anything
for the pain?

94
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:13,077
There was concern he
was drug-seeking, so no.

95
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,297
Joe?

96
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:18,387
Keep getting those
good grades, yeah?

97
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:21,564
Make something of your life.

98
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:24,959
Mr. Green, I'm Dr. Ripley.

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,266
I'm gonna take care of you.

100
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,572
Wha...

101
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:32,227
Do you know where you are?

102
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:33,968
The dentist?

103
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,710
No, you're in the
hospital. Do you know why?

104
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:39,321
I got that damn COVID again.

105
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,280
All right. Cut it out, Green.

106
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,934
Be straight with him.

107
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:45,633
I don't like you.

108
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:51,115
Officer, can I have a word?

109
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:53,554
Keep an eye on him.

110
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,992
How about you remove
those shackles?

111
00:04:57,993 --> 00:04:59,298
Can you work around them?

112
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,822
- It's a hassle.
- But you can.

113
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,345
Shackles stay on.

114
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,304
Why? That guy's
not going anywhere.

115
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,783
Don't let the act fool you.

116
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,611
Green is a
cold-blooded murderer,

117
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:11,049
and he's a lying son of a bitch.

118
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:31,591
Mr. Goodwin, you need
to take smaller bites.

119
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,854
And maybe if you sit up
a little straighter...

120
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,116
Leave me alone!

121
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,813
I'm just trying to help you.

122
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:39,948
You treat me like a baby.

123
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,828
- Thanks, Mike.
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,616
Hey, when's chow time?

125
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:59,358
Pretty soon.

126
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,142
Well, this confirms
his prison X-ray.

127
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,273
Ribs are fractured.

128
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,406
He's legitimately in pain.

129
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,626
25 of fentanyl.

130
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:09,150
Let's get some ice on the
face, draw routine labs,

131
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,805
and see when we can get
him up for a pan CT.

132
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,067
Got it.

133
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:15,112
When's chow time?

134
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:16,679
Just ignore him.

135
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,768
We'll get you something to eat.

136
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:20,379
How'd you get hurt?

137
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,990
He provoked a fight.

138
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:25,296
Who keeps talking? Yakety-yak!

139
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,602
You're not fooling anyone.

140
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,169
His hands aren't bruised.

141
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,823
Doesn't look like he
threw any punches.

142
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,999
Well, maybe he
wanted a beatdown.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,219
Get a hospital vacation.
Happens all the time.

144
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:39,137
- I'll be back.
- Hmm.

145
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:44,098
Morning.

146
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,839
Hey. Good morning.

147
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,537
How, uh... how's it all going?

148
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,148
Well, I'm not getting
very much sleep.

149
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,933
You know, I hear Bert get up,

150
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,456
start wandering
around the house.

151
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,110
I have to go put him back to bed

152
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:57,590
two to three times a night.

153
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,895
Oh, man.

154
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,506
He's starting to
have trouble eating,

155
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:02,072
yelling at the caregiver,

156
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:05,032
and he can't take a
shower by himself anymore.

157
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,468
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:09,471
You know, I think about
a facility, Daniel,

159
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:11,560
but I don't know.

160
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:12,909
It's so hard.

161
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,346
You remember the
kind of man he was...

162
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:19,046
a great father,
teacher, beloved coach.

163
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,351
I sure do.

164
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:24,486
And, you know, after
all he put me through,

165
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:28,317
it still feels like I'd
be throwing him away.

166
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,798
I don't know. Let
me go to work.

167
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:34,018
- You hang in there.
- Okay.

168
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,325
Here you go. Here's two.

169
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:39,153
Crockett.
- Hey, Mags.

170
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:42,504
You heard anything from
Bill Storch, Colin's dad?

171
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,550
All right. Well, let
me know if you do?

172
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,335
Hey, I know it was tough,
sending that little boy home.

173
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:48,554
Yeah.

174
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:51,078
All right.

175
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,647
Dr. Charles, we got
a patient from DOC.

176
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:56,431
Ooh, man. I can see that.

177
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:57,389
Yeah.

178
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,955
The guy got life 50 years ago

179
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,480
for some pretty horrific crimes.

180
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,569
He was brought in today with
injuries from a beating.

181
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,702
They don't look severe,
but there's another issue.

182
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,269
He strikes me as demented.

183
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,359
Well, a long stretch
in the prison system?

184
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,969
Not the best way to, you know,

185
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,971
maintain one's mental faculties.

186
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,277
The guard says he's faking it,

187
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,713
and that's certainly possible.

188
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:20,760
I mean, convicts have
been known to lie.

189
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:23,197
You ever hear of Vinny
"The Chin" Gigante?

190
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:25,504
Mafioso, used to wander
around Greenwich Village

191
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,289
in his robe and slippers,
trying to convince the Feds

192
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,899
that he was non compos mentis.

193
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,118
It was hilarious.

194
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,468
Anyway, you get a CT yet?

195
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,296
Scans are ordered.
He's in the queue.

196
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,080
CT is gonna give
us the best idea,

197
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:38,691
but I'm happy to have
a chat in the meantime.

198
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:39,909
Give me a couple of minutes?

199
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,564
- I'll shoot you his chart.
- Thank you.

200
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,133
How's our antler guy?

201
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:47,526
Mighty Nimrod?

202
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,484
He'll be okay, but
that's one rack

203
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:50,845
he won't be hanging
up on the wall.

204
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,230
Hey.

205
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:59,059
So I gotta get the bird
back in the hangar,

206
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,540
but we still good for
snow crab tomorrow?

207
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,368
Uh, can't wait.

208
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,460
Loren gets that
trauma fellowship,

209
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:11,767
I know who will
be a happy woman.

210
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:12,942
Should be hearing soon.

211
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:14,379
Uh-huh.

212
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:17,991
Mr. Green?

213
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,340
Morning, Officer.

214
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,689
Mr. Green, I'm Dr. Charles.

215
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,996
I was hoping we could
have a little chat.

216
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:25,302
Yakety-yak. Don't talk back.

217
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,478
Psychiatry.

218
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,829
Here we go.

219
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,571
Do you mind if I just get a
few minutes with the patient?

220
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,181
I call the shots when it comes

221
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,270
to this jackass, Doc, not you.

222
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:40,013
Whatever you wanna chat about,
you do it in front of me.

223
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,058
Okay.

224
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,451
So, Mr. Green, I understand

225
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,322
that you were
injured in a fight.

226
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,716
A fight? If you say so.

227
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,718
You don't... you
don't remember?

228
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,372
Yeah, I remember.

229
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:54,680
Okay, well, can you
tell me what happened?

230
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,117
A fight, like...
like... like you said.

231
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,379
Yeah.
- Okay.

232
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,861
So how long have
you been in prison?

233
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,689
I'm not in prison.

234
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,691
Go ahead and tell them
what you're in for.

235
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,562
Don't you wanna know
who you're dealing with?

236
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,346
Tell them what you did,
you remorseless prick.

237
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,521
Go ahead.
- Okay, give me a break.

238
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:13,133
Why is he talking
to me like that?

239
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,438
Mr. Green, don't
worry about him.

240
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,179
Don't worry about him.
You're talking to me.

241
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,181
Don't worry about him.

242
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,358
Who are you?

243
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,971
Katherine Walker,
20 weeks pregnant,

244
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:26,668
lost her balance on the stairs.

245
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,627
GCS 15. Good vitals.

246
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,280
Possible fracture,
lower right leg.

247
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,196
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three.

248
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,677
She's been dizzy,
short of breath,

249
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,026
throwing up a lot.

250
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,680
Oh, God, her leg.

251
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:39,551
My boyfriend, Derek.

252
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:41,291
We splinted in the field.

253
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,684
She says she still
has fetal movement.

254
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:43,555
No abdominal trauma.

255
00:10:43,556 --> 00:10:44,947
Make sure my baby's okay.

256
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:46,470
I'm going to, Katherine.

257
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,559
I'm Dr. Asher. Let's
get her some fluids.

258
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,692
Right.

259
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,259
Needles.

260
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,609
- Honey?
- Why don't you sit down?

261
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,263
Okay, I'd like to
get a chest X-ray

262
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:57,656
and an AP on the leg.

263
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,787
Check the baby.

264
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,876
I'm about to.

265
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,357
X-ray.

266
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:05,752
The chest looks good.

267
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:09,102
X-ray.

268
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:10,581
Okay.

269
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:13,280
Well, your leg isn't broken.

270
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:17,241
This is a pretty, pretty
nasty contusion, though.

271
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,549
Okay, I'm gonna
check the fetus now.

272
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,118
Doctor told me years ago
I couldn't get pregnant,

273
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:28,034
so we weren't using
birth control.

274
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,731
This baby's a miracle.

275
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,124
Yeah.

276
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,823
Kind of a surprise.

277
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:38,435
Okay, I am seeing abnormally
high levels of amniotic fluid

278
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:39,785
called polyhydramnios.

279
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:42,657
Likely why you're short
of breath and nauseated.

280
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:45,834
The position of the
head and the heart is...

281
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:47,967
is a little off.

282
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,533
Because she fell?

283
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,928
No, this is something
that was happening before.

284
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,061
- What was happening before?
- I can't tell yet.

285
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:57,890
We'll need you to get a formal
ultrasound and a fetal MRI.

286
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,456
Do whatever you
have to, but please,

287
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,764
you've gotta save this baby.

288
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,818
Excuse me.

289
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,950
Okay, so he is either

290
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,952
the greatest actor
since Marlon Brando

291
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:19,781
or he's, you know,
not only got dementia,

292
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,740
he's pretty deep into it.

293
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,003
If so, why hasn't
he been diagnosed?

294
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:26,048
Mitch, prison health care?

295
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:29,530
I mean, not exactly
concierge medicine, right?

296
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,837
So this patient
from corrections,

297
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:32,881
what's happening?

298
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:34,274
Waiting to get him up to CT.

299
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:35,971
Well, I can't have
these officers

300
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,625
impeding flow in the ED.

301
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:39,975
- Or that.

302
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,717
I'll call radiology and
see if he can cut the line.

303
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:44,284
You expedite his treatment.

304
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:47,156
If you can't admit him,
then send him back.

305
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,680
I don't have enough
to worry about.

306
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,727
Hey, get me CT.

307
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,949
Hi, Katherine, Derek.

308
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,602
This is Dr. Marcel.
- Hi.

309
00:12:58,603 --> 00:12:59,908
He's a trauma surgeon.

310
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:01,214
I'd love for him to
take a look at your leg.

311
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,693
May I?

312
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:04,044
It looks even worse.

313
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,007
Yeah, compartments are tight.

314
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:15,141
Pulse is still
palpable, but barely.

315
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:16,490
Okay.

316
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,840
So, Katherine, the MRI showed

317
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,017
that the fetus has a
diaphragmatic hernia.

318
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:23,845
That's an abnormal
opening in the muscle

319
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,021
between the chest
and the abdomen.

320
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,849
It's a congenital malformation.

321
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,546
Congenital?

322
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:32,027
You know, I think my sister's
baby had something like that.

323
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,334
Really? You never told me.

324
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,771
It's not like it would come up.

325
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,382
We never even talked about kids.

326
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:42,429
Well, we've only known
each other for five months.

327
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,608
It's kind of like we just
met and then this happened.

328
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,871
Well, the good news is,
a surgical procedure

329
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,961
will allow for you to
deliver a healthy baby.

330
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,571
I don't understand.

331
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,009
You mean a surgical procedure
before I give birth?

332
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,097
- Mm-hmm.
- On the baby?

333
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,273
Yes, a fetal surgery.

334
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,797
We have a surgeon who
specializes in this procedure.

335
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:06,192
He'll make a small puncture
into the abdomen and uterus

336
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,758
and treat the fetus inside.

337
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,543
Oh, God.

338
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,937
I've already spoken with
him, and he suggests

339
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,852
that we proceed with the
procedure immediately,

340
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,244
given the size of the hernia.

341
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,072
Unfortunately, as a
result of the bleeding

342
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:18,552
to the muscle of
your leg, you have

343
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,336
what's called a
compartment syndrome.

344
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:23,035
It also needs to be
addressed immediately.

345
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:26,865
So we have to go in and
open the sides of your calf

346
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,128
to release the pressure,
and we'll do that

347
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:32,044
while Dr. Asher assists
in fetal surgery.

348
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,089
Two surgeries at the same time?

349
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,787
Is that absolutely necessary?

350
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,225
Obviously it is.

351
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:43,359
I have a bit of a problem with
hospitals and stuff, okay?

352
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,100
How did you think we
were gonna have a baby

353
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,928
without going to the hospital?

354
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,974
Yes. I'll do it.

355
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,801
- Great.
- Okay. All right.

356
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,500
All right. We'll
be back shortly.

357
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:55,676
Sharon.

358
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:56,851
Hey, Dennis.

359
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:58,244
How are you doing?

360
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,332
I'm okay.

361
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,987
You know, Bert's been a handful.

362
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,640
I guessed that.

363
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,642
I've been missing you.

364
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:07,557
Well, that goes both ways.

365
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:10,256
Look, I...

366
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:11,431
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:14,913
I realize having my
ex living with me

368
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,350
is not exactly what
you signed up for.

369
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,439
That's not what's bothering me.

370
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,790
It's you not letting me
into this to help you,

371
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,835
you wanting to do
it all by yourself.

372
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,837
But it's... it's not like

373
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,796
I wanna do it by myself, Dennis.

374
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:33,453
I just feel like it's not
fair to burden you with it.

375
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,629
Burden me?

376
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,587
You must not think much of me

377
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,981
to think that I'd be
burdened by your problems.

378
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,288
You know I think
the world of you.

379
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:46,596
Sharon, our relationship is
not just about the good times.

380
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,511
It's a partnership.

381
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:49,991
I know that.

382
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,342
Then invite me into your life.

383
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:02,003
Dr. Archer, got one
for you. Baghdad.

384
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,658
Howard, with me.

385
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,097
Dustin Norris, 20s,
fell off his scooter.

386
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:10,707
Possible fractured wrist.

387
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,013
Arousable but sedate.

388
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,493
The paramedic thought
he was on something.

389
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:15,147
- Dude!
- Vitals?

390
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,105
BP is a little low. 104/80.

391
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,978
Heart rate's high. 114.

392
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,980
Dustin, I'm Dr. Archer.

393
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,372
Oh, the man!

394
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,766
And I'm third-year medical
student Naomi Howard.

395
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,289
Oh, cute.

396
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,118
All right, can you turn
your head from side to side?

397
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,338
Uh, no problemo.

398
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,906
- Up and down.
- Yeah. Yeah.

399
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,996
C-spine's clear.

400
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,041
Collar can stay off.

401
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:43,523
Breath sounds bilaterally.

402
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:44,785
Did you hurt your wrist?

403
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:47,222
I guess.

404
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,616
Ow! What'd you do that for?

405
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:52,706
Dr. Archer needed to see if
you can discriminate pain.

406
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,055
Well, duh.

407
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,231
Dustin, you on any drugs?

408
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,799
You're not allowed
to ask me that.

409
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,410
Well, actually, I am.

410
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,760
So are you?

411
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:04,848
You tell me.

412
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,155
- Give us a urine sample?
- Mm-mm.

413
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:09,810
And I don't gotta pee either.

414
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,813
- Howard.

415
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,076
Just give him a liter of
some fluids and he'll...

416
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,382
he'll pee soon enough.

417
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:17,557
Yeah.

418
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:19,385
Ugh. Got all the
winners today.

419
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:21,387
Got a contact for this clown?
- Yeah.

420
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:24,172
It's your friend
Dr. Collins, Sean's boss.

421
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,783
The guy's a resident
in her facility.

422
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,133
Let's give Margo a call.

423
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,918
This isn't one of
her success stories.

424
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,660
Yeah.

425
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,316
Whatever you gave me for
throwing up last time,

426
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,969
how about making it a double?

427
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,581
I'll check with
Dr. Washington.

428
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,108
I'm gonna beat this.

429
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,458
Yeah. I know you are.

430
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:52,983
All I can think
about is that kid.

431
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,463
Funny.

432
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,813
I never thought I had
it in me to be a dad.

433
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,119
Yeah, me neither.

434
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,121
That's fair enough.

435
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:06,997
Hey.

436
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,477
How's that prick who sued you?

437
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,740
Pawel?

438
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:11,959
I don't know.

439
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,003
Why do you care?

440
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:14,875
He went after you.

441
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:16,006
That's why.

442
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,226
Sully, just let it go.

443
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,402
You're letting him
get away with it?

444
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,274
What happened to you, man?

445
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,276
You used to be the
king of payback.

446
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:27,105
Mr. Sullivan.

447
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,323
Hey, Doc.

448
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:29,846
I understand you had
some side effects

449
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,326
after your first infusion.

450
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,850
Yeah. Out of both ends.

451
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,113
I'm sorry.

452
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,766
But I can help with that.

453
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:40,030
Well, I better, or
your friend here

454
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,989
is gonna give me a hard time.

455
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,947
Nah.

456
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,907
My boy's gone soft.

457
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,306
Mike, getting a picture
of that wrist for me?

458
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:55,829
Yep.

459
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,787
Well, Dustin, I guess you
did have to pee after all,

460
00:18:57,788 --> 00:19:00,138
and lo and behold,

461
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,227
your urine tested
positive for heroin.

462
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,838
No, you must have mixed
it up with somebody else.

463
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,927
Yeah, I've heard
that one before.

464
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:08,059
X-ray.

465
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:13,847
Yeah, you got a broken
wrist. Colles fracture.

466
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:15,849
We'll get ortho down
here to check up on you,

467
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,199
and they'll probably
wanna put a cast on you.

468
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,681
Dean. Dr. Collins
and Sean are here.

469
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,205
Don't go anywhere.

470
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,686
- Hi.
- Hey.

471
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,166
So is he badly hurt?

472
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,907
He took a spill off an
e-scooter, broke his wrist.

473
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,649
Gonna give him a CT,
head and abdomen,

474
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,216
just to check all the boxes.

475
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,696
Was he high?

476
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,393
Sean, I cannot...

477
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,874
- He was.
- Hey, Sean. Sean.

478
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,658
Dustin. You swore to me.

479
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,443
Oh, Sean. Sean.

480
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,618
This is the third time.

481
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,793
Hey, hey, hey.
It's not the time.

482
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:49,099
You don't get it, Dad.

483
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,145
I believed you. I believed you.

484
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,277
All right, let's go. Let's go.

485
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,541
Come on. I need you
to leave right now.

486
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:56,890
He's using again.

487
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,892
I mean, it's part
of the process.

488
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:01,373
It was with you, Sean.

489
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,506
- Hey, Sean.
- Sean, hey.

490
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,162
What's going on?
- Ugh.

491
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:10,730
Sean felt he had a bond with
this guy he's been sponsoring,

492
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:12,035
and he fell off the wagon.

493
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,734
Again.

494
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,214
Look, I need to
get into surgery,

495
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,695
but let me know if I
can help with anything.

496
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:22,959
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

497
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,658
Margo.

498
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:29,052
Dustin's X-ray.

499
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,358
There's something
in his stomach?

500
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,491
Yeah, looks that way.

501
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:33,709
Wanna tell us what it is?

502
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,276
Um, breakfast.

503
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,060
Okay, tell us what
it is, Dustin.

504
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:40,760
Let me guess. Bag of smack?

505
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:43,763
Didn't wanna get caught with it?

506
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:45,765
- Do we need to scope him?

507
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,071
I hate to do it
unless we have to.

508
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:50,291
Let's see if he
passes it on his own.

509
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,597
Keep him on the monitors

510
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:53,687
and track it with
the serial X-ray.

511
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:59,823
Little future advice... only
food belongs in your stomach.

512
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:16,752
Crockett?
- Yeah.

513
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:19,321
Yeah.
- You said you wanted to know.

514
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:26,196
Oh, no.

515
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:27,460
Oh, dear God.

516
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,958
- Kai?
- Hey.

517
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,133
Where's Crockett?

518
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:52,788
He asked me to cover for him.

519
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,312
Why?

520
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,445
He just said he didn't
think he'd be at his best.

521
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,490
What?

522
00:21:58,491 --> 00:21:59,491
I don't know.

523
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,014
Man of mystery.

524
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:03,843
Don't worry. He
thoroughly briefed me.

525
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:06,934
Much more than I
needed. Way more.

526
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:12,331
Position of the fetus is good.

527
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:16,029
Injecting roc.

528
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,684
Dr. Cho and I can't
proceed until the fetus is

529
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,642
thoroughly sedated
and not moving,

530
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:21,817
so you can start.

531
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,471
All right.

532
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:26,693
Making the medial incision.

533
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,526
Going to release the superficial

534
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,789
and deep compartments.

535
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,053
Then I can get
some hematoma out.

536
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:43,578
Fetus is fully anesthetized.

537
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:46,103
Continuing hernia repair.

538
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,890
Evacuating the hematoma.

539
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,372
Ah, I love this part.

540
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,985
Good position beneath
the vocal cords.

541
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,118
And deploying.

542
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:06,906
The deployment looks good.

543
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,952
And I've got hemostasis.

544
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,782
Ready to close.

545
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,830
Mr. Green's head CT.

546
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:21,921
- Global atrophy.
- Yeah.

547
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,662
He's not faking his dementia.

548
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:25,273
No, sir.

549
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,844
With this degree of dementia,

550
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,454
Mr. Green doesn't
belong in prison.

551
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,457
Well, he doesn't belong
in my ED, either.

552
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,068
Where he belongs, and
many others like him,

553
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:40,679
is in a memory care unit.

554
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,029
I mean, I'm telling you,
aging prisoners with dementia,

555
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,857
it's really becoming a crisis.

556
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,512
Daniel, you know
that's not up to us.

557
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,165
You've treated his injuries.

558
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,125
Now he's the responsibility of
the Department of Corrections.

559
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:54,693
What will late-stage
dementia look like

560
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:56,129
for Mr. Green in prison?

561
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,349
As his illness progresses...

562
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,875
Dr. Charles, maybe you
wanna take it from here.

563
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,398
As he becomes more
and more disoriented,

564
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,053
he might forget
where his cell is

565
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:08,489
and the bathroom.

566
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,883
You know, he'll likely
become incontinent.

567
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,798
I mean, I've literally
seen patients

568
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,976
in Mr. Green's predicament
urinating on prison walls.

569
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:18,630
He won't be able to
feed himself anymore.

570
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,283
He will forget to wash.

571
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,416
And all in an environment

572
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:23,983
that punishes for noncompliance,

573
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:26,159
an environment
that will hurt him.

574
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,031
Can't we recommend he
be kept out of gen pop

575
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,337
and put in the infirmary?

576
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:31,860
But all they'd
really do is just,

577
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,340
you know, strap him to a bed.

578
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:34,515
At least he won't get beat up.

579
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,864
Yeah, my point is, it's just not

580
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:37,910
a long-term solution, Mitch.

581
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:39,433
It sucks, right?

582
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:42,044
But the system
simply is not set up

583
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,351
to deal with prisoners
like Mr. Green.

584
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:47,572
Okay, so what would
you like me to do?

585
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:53,012
I suppose I could petition
for compassionate release.

586
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,536
Actually, that would be great.

587
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,583
Unfortunately, as a prisoner
who is not terminally ill,

588
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,541
he simply won't get it.

589
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,238
Okay.

590
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,502
I do know the attorney general.

591
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:09,158
It's a long shot, but
I could give her a call

592
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:11,726
and see if she can
get him remanded

593
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,902
to a state mental institution.

594
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:15,034
Wow.

595
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,862
That absolutely is worth a shot.

596
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:19,255
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.
- Yes. Thank you, Ms. Goodwin,

597
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,432
I really appreciate
you making the effort.

598
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,001
I'm sorry.

599
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,351
I know you didn't
need this today.

600
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,792
Dr. Archer?

601
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,577
Please.
- All right.

602
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,058
Margo?

603
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,018
When did this start?

604
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,586
- A couple minutes ago.

605
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,935
What's happening?

606
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,981
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

607
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:52,027
I swallowed the dope.

608
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:53,115
What were you thinking?

609
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:54,596
Sean, give us some air, okay?

610
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,213
- Is that the pylorus?
- Yeah.

611
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:06,738
It's obstructing the
stomach from emptying.

612
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,000
Bag won't make it out.

613
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,436
All right, we'll
have to go get it.

614
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,133
Can you order up an
endoscopy, please?

615
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:12,439
How could you, man?

616
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,006
All those nights we
stayed up talking.

617
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:17,662
I know. I know.

618
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,054
All right, Sean. Let's go.

619
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:20,926
Let's go.

620
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:24,538
What if I don't
want it pulled out?

621
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,758
Well, you don't have a choice.

622
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,368
I don't wanna get in trouble.

623
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:30,457
Dustin, you can't
leave it there.

624
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,765
Could burst in your
stomach and kill you.

625
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,078
Oh. Daniel.

626
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,604
The AG was apologetic but
said this isn't something

627
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,518
she could deal with quickly.

628
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,567
Frankly, I think she's just
afraid of looking soft on crime

629
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,656
in an election year.

630
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,006
Discharge him.

631
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,488
Sorry, pal.

632
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:04,230
That's it?

633
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:06,885
We're just...

634
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:08,756
we're just gonna throw
this guy to the wolves?

635
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,498
Unfortunately, there
are no good moves.

636
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:14,588
- That sounds like a cop-out.
- Really?

637
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:15,894
I guess I'm just confused

638
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,547
why Ms. Goodwin
seemed more willing

639
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,201
to try to help this
guy than you were.

640
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,682
I think it's probably because
she was indulging you a bit,

641
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,379
because she saw
how much you cared.

642
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,382
Mitch, I've been advocating for
prisoners with mental health...

643
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,080
Like you advocated for me?

644
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:29,734
Seriously?

645
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,779
We're going back there again?

646
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,781
I did the best I could. I
don't know what else to say,

647
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:36,697
except for maybe I'm
tired of apologizing.

648
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,307
And frankly, I've been
advocating for you

649
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,658
ever since you got here...
protecting you too.

650
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,269
And you know what?
I'm sick of it.

651
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,663
I'm done.

652
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:50,972
All right. Swallow.

653
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:53,279
Swallow. Okay. Come on.

654
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,107
Easy, deep breaths.

655
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,369
You got it.

656
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,588
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

657
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,155
Good. Breathe.

658
00:28:00,156 --> 00:28:03,637
And we're in the stomach,
and there's the bag.

659
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:06,379
Okay. Sarah, grab
this, will you?

660
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,599
All right.

661
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,298
Okay, I'm gonna snag
it with the snare.

662
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,693
Good.

663
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,738
All right, got it.

664
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,740
All right. Endoscope's
coming out.

665
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:23,526
Keep breathing. Sarah,
take that, will you?

666
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:24,919
There we go.

667
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,268
Yeah.

668
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:29,184
All right. Breathe. Breathe.

669
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:31,534
Good work.

670
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,319
All right. Good. Almost.

671
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,061
Okay.

672
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:39,281
All done.

673
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:40,719
Should I call security?

674
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:44,200
No.

675
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,345
Ah.

676
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:00,912
The bag is removed.

677
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,044
He's gonna be fine, at
least in that regard.

678
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,089
Where is it?

679
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,351
The baggie?

680
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:06,744
I disposed of it.

681
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,093
Well, you need to get it back.

682
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,137
Get it back?

683
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:10,356
We need to give it to the cops.

684
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:11,574
What?

685
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:13,228
- He needs to be arrested.
- Why?

686
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,882
'Cause that's the only way
he's gonna stop doing this.

687
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:17,624
Hey, this is not the place.

688
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,060
All right, let me
finish up with Dustin,

689
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:21,977
and I'll see you guys outside.

690
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:25,806
Hey, Maggie.

691
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,242
I forgot I have an
appointment at the DMV.

692
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:29,288
Shouldn't take too long.
Zach's covering for me.

693
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:30,419
Sure.

694
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,119
- Come in.

695
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,424
Ms. Goodwin?

696
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:36,599
Oh.

697
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,037
Ah, Dr. Marcel.

698
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,868
I was told you took
yourself out of a surgery?

699
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,175
Now, that's not like you.

700
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,442
I learned that Colin Stewart,

701
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:56,097
you know, the young boy who
needed that liver transplant,

702
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:57,969
he died.

703
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,800
And then his...
his father, Bill...

704
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,411
Killed himself.

705
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:09,197
Oh, no.

706
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:12,287
Oh, Dr. Marcel,

707
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:15,116
I am so sorry.

708
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:19,686
I know this is a terrible blow.

709
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:23,082
Take all the time
you need. Please.

710
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,173
Thank you.

711
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:37,530
The procedure went well.

712
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:40,228
We successfully deployed a
tiny balloon as a temporary fix

713
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:42,404
until the baby is
delivered and we can do

714
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:43,928
a permanent hernia repair.

715
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,581
Thank you. Thank you so much.

716
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:46,887
Mm-hmm.

717
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,976
Guess I'd better get
used to hospitals.

718
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:51,892
What's with you and hospitals?

719
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:54,025
I, uh, kind of had
a bad experience

720
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:57,463
when I was living in India
and my appendix burst.

721
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:58,507
India?

722
00:30:58,508 --> 00:30:59,813
Her dressings look good.

723
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:01,728
Only a little strike-through.

724
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:03,077
Okay.

725
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:05,166
Katherine, can you
wiggle your toes?

726
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,995
Nice. All right.
Pulse is strong.

727
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,606
Color of the foot looks good.
Any tingling or numbness?

728
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,130
No.

729
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:14,784
Why were you living in India?

730
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:18,701
I was working for
a tech startup.

731
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,356
Okay. Everything
here looks good.

732
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,315
Thank you again.

733
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,230
Why didn't you tell
me about any of this?

734
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:28,363
We're gonna give you
guys some time to rest.

735
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:30,149
Any other countries?

736
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:33,847
Those two don't seem to
know much about each other.

737
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,893
Yeah, that's for sure.

738
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,895
Oh, man. What are we doing?

739
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,897
What... where are
we going? What?

740
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,334
Come on, man. What's
happening? What... what...

741
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:43,683
that's my lawyer!

742
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:44,902
That's my lawyer!

743
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,381
I have a right to
talk to my lawyer.

744
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:48,297
Let me talk to my lawyer!

745
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,433
I think it's time, Daniel.

746
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:59,394
This man can't get the
help that he needs.

747
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:02,397
But Bert can.

748
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:04,747
I agree.

749
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:06,968
I'm gonna go call the kids.

750
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:19,545
Sean, listen.

751
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,982
Uh, drugs are gone.

752
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,897
I disposed of them properly.

753
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:26,030
And in any event,
the cops won't bother

754
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:27,727
with such a small amount.

755
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:30,512
Well, that's beside the point.

756
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:32,210
I mean, Dustin doesn't
need incarceration.

757
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:33,385
That wouldn't help him.

758
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,952
Helped me.

759
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,345
Never would have gotten
straight otherwise, right, Dad?

760
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,217
You? Okay.

761
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:41,219
But everyone is different.

762
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,570
And for some, it would only
make the problem worse.

763
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:47,181
Dad, why aren't you
saying anything?

764
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:48,617
What do you want me to say?

765
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:51,577
Zero tolerance is what
you always told me.

766
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:54,319
Well, maybe I look at
things differently now.

767
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,582
Because of her?

768
00:32:56,583 --> 00:33:00,934
So Dustin gets a
pass, and I didn't?

769
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:03,981
- It's not like that.
- No?

770
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,026
You kicked me out of the
house, told me you never wanted

771
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,593
to see me again
unless I cleaned up.

772
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:10,248
I told you, I'm
not proud of that.

773
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:12,119
People can change, Sean.

774
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,208
Junkies cheat.

775
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:15,775
They lie.

776
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,820
And the only way they'll
change is if you lock them up.

777
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,997
Okay, I understand that you
feel betrayed by Dustin.

778
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,260
Yeah.

779
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:24,088
And by you.

780
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,568
Sean.

781
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:33,445
- Hey, Mags?
- Yeah.

782
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:35,969
Do you know what's
going on with Crockett?

783
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,275
Oh.

784
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:39,843
Leave it alone. Trust me.

785
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,457
Doris?
- Hmm?

786
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,328
- Cover for me?
- Sure.

787
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:49,505
- Thank you so much.
- Mm-hmm.

788
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:03,476
Did you hear how Bill did it?

789
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,915
Paramedics said
it was a handgun.

790
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:20,406
I know how he felt.

791
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,322
I didn't have a gun.

792
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,541
What?

793
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:30,502
I, uh...

794
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:33,679
I lost a child too.

795
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,813
Oh, my. I had no idea.

796
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:39,728
Yeah.

797
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:42,905
Harper.

798
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:45,517
Leukemia.

799
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:47,476
She died just after
her first birthday.

800
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:52,481
I'm so sorry.

801
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:00,576
What saved me was my work.

802
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:04,927
Work kept me going.

803
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:07,105
Has all along.

804
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:13,371
So when I sent Colin home

805
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,460
knowing he was gonna die,

806
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:20,118
it just put me right
back there again.

807
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:27,037
I felt that same
sense of helplessness.

808
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:31,172
Nothing I could do.

809
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,134
Death was coming,
and there was...

810
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,615
nothing I could do.

811
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:45,751
I guess it made me realize
the way I've been living,

812
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:48,798
working full-on for years now...

813
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:54,587
I never really took
the time to grieve.

814
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,071
Grieve for my baby girl.

815
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:14,563
I don't know what
to say, Crockett.

816
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:31,710
I appreciate you, Maggie.

817
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,670
And I appreciate you.

818
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:47,987
See you tomorrow?

819
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:49,468
Yeah.

820
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:04,482
Lots of old folks.

821
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:07,354
Well, we're not so
young ourselves, Bert.

822
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,573
- Yeah.

823
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:10,836
What are we doing here?

824
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:12,794
This is gonna be
your new home, Dad.

825
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,579
Home?

826
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,581
I have a home.

827
00:37:16,582 --> 00:37:17,799
No.

828
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,324
There was a fire, remember?

829
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:23,979
And then you moved in
with me for a while.

830
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,286
Mr. Goodwin, we're
so glad to see you.

831
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,202
Can we show you your room?

832
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:32,336
I wan... I wanna go home.

833
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:35,339
They'll take really good
care of you here, Bert,

834
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,689
in ways that we just can't.

835
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,038
They'll cook for you.

836
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,083
They'll clean for
you. Everything.

837
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:43,303
Ms. Goodwin says
you like to swim.

838
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,826
We have an indoor pool.

839
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:48,395
You can... you could
use it all year long.

840
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:49,875
We also hear you love chili.

841
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:52,356
That's what we're
having for dinner.

842
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:54,053
Chili...

843
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:57,361
I think you'll
like it here, Bert.

844
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:58,666
Give it a try, Dad.

845
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,364
I... I... I don't think so.

846
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:01,626
Don't worry.

847
00:38:01,627 --> 00:38:04,150
He's gonna be fine.

848
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:05,934
Uh, let us show you your room.

849
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:08,242
I'm sure you're
gonna like the view.

850
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:14,378
Are you coming?

851
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,901
We'll see you soon.

852
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,642
Michael's picking up
David at the airport,

853
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:19,209
and then they're on their way.

854
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,345
Your sons are coming.

855
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:46,976
I know.

856
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,549
I'll drop by the house later.

857
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,073
Please.

858
00:38:58,074 --> 00:38:59,379
Love you.

859
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,947
I love you.

860
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:10,870
Thank you for coming.

861
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,612
Thank you for asking.

862
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,584
- Dr. Ripley, we have incoming.

863
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,804
Naomi, with me.

864
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:34,762
Juliette, talk to me.
You're going to Baghdad.

865
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:36,938
55-year-old male,
Pawel Wapniarski,

866
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:39,288
facial contusion, significant
trauma to the left knee.

867
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,421
Gave him 4 milligrams
of morphine in the ambo.

868
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,944
Emergency contact's on her way.

869
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:44,685
Said he'd been assaulted
by a masked assailant

870
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:46,339
with a baseball bat.
- I was attacked.

871
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,993
<i>Dran!</i>
- X-ray.

872
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:50,865
Mitch, you can't treat
him, not with your history.

873
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:52,780
- I can do the intake.
- Thank you.

874
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,173
Uh...

875
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:57,263
yeah, give me an AP on his knee.

876
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:58,526
Clear.

877
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,877
X-ray.

878
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:04,792
Yeah, it looks like the
patella is comminuted.

879
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:06,272
We're gonna take you to CT,

880
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:07,882
then the orthopedic
surgeons will most likely

881
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:08,883
take you to surgery.

882
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:09,928
You'll be okay.

883
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,146
Yeah, I'll never be okay.

884
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:12,670
Maggie, let CT
know we're coming.

885
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:15,063
You got it. Let's
go. Let's go.

886
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:17,109
<i>Boze.</i> What happened?

887
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,807
He did this.

888
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,330
What?

889
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:23,681
'Cause I win the case.

890
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:25,683
- Did you?
- No.

891
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:27,859
You did. Didn't you?

892
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,122
- Lili.
- Look, he's not a good person.

893
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:31,689
Let's take a beat, okay?

894
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,518
You always take
his side, not mine.

895
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:41,438
Dr. Ripley.

896
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,962
You got anything to say?

897
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:56,541
Why didn't he say anything?
