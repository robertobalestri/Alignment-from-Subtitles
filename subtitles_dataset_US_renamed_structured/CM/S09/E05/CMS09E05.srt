1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,399
Ben and I are getting a divorce.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,491
I really just wanna move on.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,221
I'll be around the ED more
often if I can ever help out.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,806
Are you flying anywhere today?

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,225
- No, shift just ended.
- Treatment seven.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,020
Welcome to the
team, Dr. Johnson.

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,147
Something's wrong with Dad.

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,149
He's forgetting things.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,358
It's getting worse.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,694
He doesn't know where he is.

11
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,030
Damn.

12
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,948
You've already flamed
out of two hospitals,

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,117
and you're doing your best
to flame out of a third?

14
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,618
So I'm not fired?

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,995
Medical ethics course.

16
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,913
If I were you, I'd take notes.

17
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,959
Wow.

18
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,628
How does that make you feel?

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,047
I'm not sure.

20
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,715
It is what it is.

21
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,885
- Good morning, Peter.
- Morning, Maggie. Dr. Ahmad.

22
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,845
Do we have a notary in house?

23
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,055
I have some papers to sign.

24
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,389
Yeah, Edward.

25
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,071
I'll send him down at
the end of the day.

26
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,684
You need some help?

27
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,561
- Are you a doctor?
- I am. What happened?

28
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,563
I don't know. I've never
seen this man before.

29
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,357
He was wandering a
couple blocks from here.

30
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,150
He kept saying, "Help Betty."

31
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,318
He's really cold.

32
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,861
Okay, let's get him inside.

33
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,446
Betty.

34
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,408
Dr. Sorensen.

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,077
No, I'm Dr. Ripley.

36
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,411
Nancy, he's hypothermic.

37
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,513
I need blankets
and warm IV bags.

38
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,872
On it. You're going to five.

39
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,333
Okay.

40
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,877
Help Betty.

41
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,919
Betty?

42
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,256
Hey, Daniel.

43
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,425
- Morning.
- Good morning.

44
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,177
When was the last
time you saw Bert?

45
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,137
Not for a while.

46
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,281
I mean, come to think of it,

47
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,265
I did call him a
couple weeks ago,

48
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,476
and he was in a hurry.

49
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,663
Said he'd call me back, and
I'm now realizing he never did.

50
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,980
Yeah, and is that
something you've noticed

51
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,565
- his memory?
- Not really.

52
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,776
I mean, that could
happen to any of us.

53
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,444
I mean, I do that
stuff all the time.

54
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,546
Why? Are you worried about him?

55
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,739
I don't know, but Tara is.

56
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,116
And he was here.

57
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,993
He fell when he was
watching Isaiah.

58
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,370
He fell?

59
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,498
Yeah, nothing serious,
but he did twist his knee.

60
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,375
He just seemed a
little confused,

61
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,960
and I wouldn't be concerned,

62
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,463
but Bert does have a
family history of dementia.

63
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,716
We should probably
have him checked out.

64
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:16,928
To get Bert to see a doctor
for anything is an ordeal.

65
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,930
- You know that.
- Right, tell me about it.

66
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,475
But he's coming here today
for a follow-up on his knee.

67
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,561
Oh, well, why don't
I just, you know,

68
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,480
spontaneously stop by,
have a little chat?

69
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,065
That would be great.

70
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,984
Thank you.

71
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,029
Hi, Alex.

72
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,156
- Hi.
- I'm Dr. Ahmad.

73
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,324
Emily. My husband, Mark.

74
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,369
So I see that your
heart rate is fast.

75
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,121
I don't feel it.

76
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,956
But his watch says it's at 140.

77
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,292
It's probably nothing, but
that's why we brought him in.

78
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,211
Well, your watch
isn't lying, 140.

79
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,213
Rest of your vitals are good.

80
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,357
Is there anything bothering you?

81
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,507
No, I feel fine.

82
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,092
Normally, he eats like a horse,

83
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,511
but the last couple of days,
he's hardly had anything.

84
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,347
I just wasn't hungry.

85
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,477
Lungs sound good.

86
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,731
Lymph nodes aren't swollen.

87
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,191
Any tenderness?

88
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,859
Mm-mm.

89
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,860
What about here?

90
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,072
Yeah, a little bit.

91
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,573
What does that mean?

92
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,409
I'm not sure, but I'd like
to order a CT to find out.

93
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,455
- Okay.
- I'll put the order in.

94
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,956
I'll be back to
check on you soon.

95
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,999
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

96
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,168
Thank you.

97
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,711
- Loren?
- Maggie.

98
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,297
Kaitlin Neeley,
28, septic shock.

99
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,883
Leukocytosis and hypotensive.

100
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,220
BP 80/43, temp 103.5.

101
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,429
She was pregnant.

102
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,139
Water broke at 15
weeks pre-viability.

103
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,557
That was two weeks ago.

104
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,226
It's not there. It's not there.

105
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,435
No, don't say it.

106
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,604
- No, no.
- Honey, everything's okay.

107
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,624
We're at the hospital. They're
gonna take care of you.

108
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,917
They were driving here,
but she got so sick,

109
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,442
they had to pull over.

110
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,836
Rural clinic didn't have the
capabilities to care for her,

111
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,779
- so they called me.
- Okay.

112
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,239
Can I help?

113
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,240
No, unfortunately, this is OB.

114
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,616
- Hannah.
- Yeah.

115
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,660
Kaitlin Neeley, 15
weeks, water broke.

116
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,078
White blood count is high.

117
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,454
This is her husband, Eric.

118
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,289
All right, Maggie,
start a second IV.

119
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,976
- You got it, Doc.
- Did they perform a D&E?

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,501
No, the doctor said
they had to wait

121
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,937
for her to pass the
remains on her own.

122
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,131
Okay, CBC, CMP, lactate,
and blood cultures.

123
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,924
Oh, honey!

124
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,426
Honey!

125
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,820
I need to start your wife
on antibiotics immediately.

126
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,154
Do you know if she's
allergic to any?

127
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,513
- She isn't.
- Okay.

128
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,016
Triple up... ampicillin,
clindamycin, gentamicin.

129
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,058
Copy that.

130
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,143
Your wife is very sick,

131
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,495
but we're gonna take
good care of her.

132
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:45,587
She's been carrying fetal
remains for two weeks.

133
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:47,370
- Oh, my God.
- And she couldn't get a D&E?

134
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,997
No, her doctor wouldn't do it.

135
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,665
Why?

136
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,045
How's our patient?

137
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,087
Better.

138
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,340
Temp's come up to 95.

139
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,674
How is his cognition?

140
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,763
Sir.

141
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,767
Can you tell us your name?

142
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,894
Jimmy.

143
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,312
Did you hurt yourself?

144
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,689
- Maybe hit your head?
- No.

145
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,815
Betty.

146
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,400
Who's Betty?

147
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,985
My sister.

148
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,905
No ID, but he had this
Post-it in his pocket.

149
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,239
It's a telephone number.

150
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,116
- What happened to Betty?
- Where is she?

151
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,786
Home. She got sick.

152
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,705
Get Dr. Sorensen.

153
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,499
Is... is that her
doctor or your doctor?

154
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,210
Dr. Sorensen.

155
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,628
Does he work at this hospital?

156
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,963
- Yes, here.
- Okay.

157
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,216
Okay, see if you can
find this Dr. Sorensen

158
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,509
and try that number.

159
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,698
We're gonna take good
care of you, Jimmy.

160
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,473
Okay?

161
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,475
Oh, thank you.

162
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,067
Dr. Charles?

163
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,277
I've got an elderly patient,

164
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,071
severely hypothermic.

165
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,032
No visible injuries, um,

166
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,784
but he's pretty out of it.

167
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,828
No ID other than a phone number.

168
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,706
I'm thinking he's got dementia
or maybe wandered away

169
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,874
- from a care facility.
- Oh.

170
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,251
You wanna give me your take?

171
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,086
Sure.

172
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,005
His name's Jimmy.

173
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,132
- Shoot me his chart.
- Give me a couple minutes.

174
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,967
Yeah.

175
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,012
Hi, Alex. Mr. and Mrs. Foster.

176
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,614
- This is Dr. Marcel.
- He's one of our surgeons.

177
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,181
I've asked him to consult.

178
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,975
Surgeon? Why?

179
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,145
Well, Radiology said that
Alex's CT was equivocal,

180
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,564
meaning it was inconclusive.

181
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,109
But what it did show is
a possible appendicitis.

182
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,988
And from my experience, with
Alex's elevated heart rate

183
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,031
and loss of appetite,

184
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,699
I believe that is,
indeed, the case.

185
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,617
So I'd like to operate.

186
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,453
Wait, so you're not
sure it's appendicitis?

187
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,662
No.

188
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,164
Why do I have to
have an operation?

189
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,916
Because if it is appendicitis
and your appendix bursts,

190
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,419
that would put you at risk
of an infection in the belly,

191
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,005
and that could be
life-threatening.

192
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,757
Oh.

193
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,051
But we can avoid that
with a minimally invasive

194
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,803
laparoscopic surgery
done with a camera

195
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,805
through several small incisions

196
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,807
what we call a Band-Aid surgery.

197
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,351
I agree with Dr. Marcel.

198
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,355
A laparoscopic appendectomy
is the best course of action.

199
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,076
Most likely, he'd be
done in half an hour.

200
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,734
Mom? Dad?

201
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,947
Yeah, okay.

202
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,532
Okay.

203
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,742
- All right.
- Thank you.

204
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,243
I'll see you after.

205
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,370
- All right.
- Thank you.

206
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,914
Thank you.

207
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,416
- You okay?
- It'll be fine. Mm-hmm.

208
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,382
Is she doing any better?

209
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,550
About the same.

210
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,903
You know, I don't have
any more flights today,

211
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,488
so I think I'll stick
around, if you don't mind.

212
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,971
Mm.

213
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,433
Maybe I can give Eric
some moral support.

214
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,685
That's a good idea.

215
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,897
Are you gonna do that operation?

216
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,067
I recommend we try to
induce instead of a D&E.

217
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,570
Surgery can be much
riskier if she's septic.

218
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,659
Tell me what happened.

219
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,202
Kaitlin's water broke.

220
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,122
Everybody said the fetus
couldn't survive at 15 weeks,

221
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,915
but it was still alive,

222
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:23,420
so doctors were
afraid to do the D&E.

223
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,754
She didn't wanna get arrested.

224
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,384
Where we live,
that could happen.

225
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,511
They sent us home.

226
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,596
Kaitlin got sicker and sicker.

227
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,557
And I kept calling, and
they kept telling me

228
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,768
it wasn't a
life-threatening emergency.

229
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,313
Finally, I just gave up
and started driving here.

230
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,357
Kaitlin's from Chicago.

231
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,569
When we got married, we
moved to my family's farm,

232
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,321
where I grew up.

233
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,742
We were so excited when
Kaitlin finally got pregnant.

234
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,748
She's been so worried she's
not gonna be able to again.

235
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,295
Eric, I'm gonna do
the best that I can.

236
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,548
But I don't know.

237
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,549
I don't know.

238
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,226
Okay, staple line looks good.

239
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,603
No bleeding.

240
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,107
Nice and easy.

241
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,947
Appendix is in the bag.

242
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,283
Gently wiggle the
bag circularly,

243
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,535
and then pull it up and out.

244
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,582
Hold on.

245
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,171
This feels unusual.

246
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,757
Go ahead and send that for a
stat frozen section, please.

247
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,686
Definitely some
cognitive impairment,

248
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,396
though I'm not quite sure why.

249
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,857
Tox screen's negative,
no sign of head trauma.

250
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,068
The childlike affect, it's
not what you normally see

251
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,362
with Alzheimer's or
vascular dementia,

252
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,988
though you can't rule it out.

253
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,867
I'm thinking some kind
of intellectual deficit.

254
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,703
So I'm thinking we
should get a head CT.

255
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,995
Definitely.

256
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,664
We have no more
information on the guy?

257
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:23,873
You reach out to CPD?

258
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,458
Yeah, there's no missing persons

259
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,003
matching his description, and
no one's come looking for him.

260
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,797
He can't stop talking about
his sister, Betty, right,

261
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,341
how he is just very
concerned about her.

262
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,968
She's sick. She needs our help.

263
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,469
Yeah, but given
his mental state,

264
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,179
is that even a real person?

265
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,865
You know, maybe it's
someone from his childhood

266
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,058
- or a show he saw on TV.
- Yeah.

267
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,768
I tried the number he had again

268
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,936
still no answer.

269
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,397
- I left another message.
- Okay.

270
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,899
Let's say that is actually
Betty's number, right?

271
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,735
Maybe she's not answering
because she can't

272
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,738
because she is, in
fact, incapacitated.

273
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,866
How about we ask CPD
to run a reverse trace?

274
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,659
That way, at least,
we'll get an address.

275
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,827
Okay.

276
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,380
Dr. Archer, incoming.

277
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,482
You're going to trauma four.

278
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,758
Damon Adams, 28,

279
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,510
shortness of
breath, diaphoretic.

280
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,221
BP 130/90, heart
rate 125. Sats 89.

281
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,432
- Need help.
- It's right there.

282
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,808
Sean.

283
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,910
He lives at the
center where I work.

284
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,604
I've been counseling him.

285
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,439
All right, wait here.

286
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,566
All right, on my count. Ready?

287
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,027
We good? One, two, three.

288
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,238
All right, Damon,
I'm Dr. Archer.

289
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,073
What's going on?

290
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,241
- Real sick.
- Yeah?

291
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,201
When did this start?

292
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,828
A couple days ago.

293
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,181
- I can't catch my breath.
- Well, we can help you.

294
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,790
Come on, let's get him up here.

295
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,459
Lift him up. Start
him on 100% O2.

296
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,710
AP chest stat.

297
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,172
I need a CBC, BNP, and an ABG.

298
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,469
- X-ray.
- Clear.

299
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,929
Pulmonary edema.

300
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,098
Fluid in the lungs.

301
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,891
Call Cardiology for a stat echo.

302
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,644
Yeah, got it.

303
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,604
Okay.

304
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,855
Better?

305
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,442
You okay if I share
some things with Sean?

306
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,445
All right, I'll check back soon.

307
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,659
So...

308
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,160
Your friend's in
pretty bad shape.

309
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,414
Pulmonary edema suggests
that he's in heart failure.

310
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,225
We shouldn't be seeing
that in somebody so young.

311
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,209
Oh, man.

312
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,837
You say that he's living
at the rehab center.

313
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,296
- Is he an addict?
- Recovering,

314
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,215
but I'm pretty sure he's
clean. We talk a lot.

315
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,842
He's really been
working the program.

316
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,177
It's possible
whatever's going on

317
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,321
with his heart might
have something to do

318
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,972
with IV drug use.

319
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,366
Well, you'll be able
to help him, right?

320
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,034
I'll do what I can, but
you need to understand,

321
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,562
Sean, his condition is serious.

322
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,898
Well, if anybody can
help him, you can, Dad.

323
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,692
I know you can.

324
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,152
Is Alex all right?

325
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:07,876
Yes.

326
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:09,639
He handled the
surgery like a champ.

327
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,017
And it's a good thing
you brought him in.

328
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,601
His appendix really
needed to come out.

329
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,836
Yeah, the pathology
report showed a contained

330
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,087
appendiceal cancer.

331
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,380
- Cancer?
- Cancer?

332
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,798
Wait, he's only 15.

333
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,091
No need to worry.

334
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,319
It was small, just
one centimeter,

335
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,469
and we got it all.

336
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,179
Good thing he was
wearing that watch.

337
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,430
Oh.

338
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,931
Wow.

339
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,850
And we don't need to
talk to an oncologist?

340
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,536
Well, when you come
back for a follow-up,

341
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,103
we could talk about that.

342
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,540
But the treatment is to remove
the appendix, and we did that.

343
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,816
Mm, okay.

344
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,943
- When can we see Alex?
- Now.

345
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,779
Dr. Ahmad will take
you to recovery.

346
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,905
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

347
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,615
You got it.

348
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,035
No, no, no, no, I'm just here
to have my knee looked at.

349
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,013
When was the last time
you had a physical, Bert?

350
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,121
I don't know.

351
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,623
They did some scans
when I was here.

352
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,458
That is not a physical.

353
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,542
You're already here.

354
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,002
The doctor will make it quick.

355
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,588
Daniel will come
in and say hello.

356
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,216
You owe it to your
children and your grandson

357
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,469
to look after your health.

358
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,805
All right. All right.

359
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,391
Thank you.

360
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,559
I'm seeing pericardial effusion.

361
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,478
That means that there's
a buildup of fluid

362
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,331
in the sac around the heart,
and that puts pressure

363
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,483
on the heart so that it
doesn't pump effectively.

364
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,169
Would you please let me
know when the attending

365
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,545
- has looked at this?
- You got it.

366
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,487
Okay.

367
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,031
So I'm not sure what's going on.

368
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,950
So I'm gonna start
you on antibiotics,

369
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,952
in case it's a
bacterial infection.

370
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,037
We're gonna treat the
pericardial effusion

371
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,373
with steroids and
anti-inflammatories.

372
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,874
Sats are at 83,

373
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,418
and blood pressure's dropping.

374
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:39,796
Dad?

375
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,025
Okay, I think we need
to put you on a machine

376
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,634
that breathes for you.

377
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,969
- Okay.
- All right?

378
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,154
In order to do that, we
need to put you to sleep.

379
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,347
Is that all right?

380
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,348
All right.

381
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,142
Call respiratory.

382
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,519
All right, 20 of
etomidate and 100 of sux.

383
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,438
On its way.

384
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,535
Okay, I'm in.

385
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,037
Bag him.

386
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,292
All right, this will
let his body rest,

387
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,086
and hopefully, it'll help push
the fluid out of his lungs.

388
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,338
Thanks, Dad.

389
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,922
Put a foley in,
and let's start him

390
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:27,260
on 125 milligrams of Solumedrol
and 10 milligrams of Lasix.

391
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,430
We won't see any changes for
a while, so I'll check back.

392
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,225
- Dr. Archer.
- Yeah?

393
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,061
- Have you got a minute?
- Yeah.

394
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,730
My ex-husband, Bert,
is here for a follow-up

395
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,815
on a knee injury.

396
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,609
He hasn't had a
physical in ages,

397
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,362
and he has finally
agreed to get one.

398
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,198
Would you mind giving
him a quick look-see?

399
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,616
- Just the basics.
- No problem.

400
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,742
He's in two.

401
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,578
Oh, and um, Dr. Charles,

402
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,913
he might stop by.

403
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,247
He and Bert are old friends.

404
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,457
- Okay.
- Thank you.

405
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,417
Sure.

406
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,127
Hey, Nancy?

407
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,463
- Is Jimmy's CT back?
- Not yet.

408
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,341
Uh, how's CPD doing
on that reverse trace?

409
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,759
They have an address.

410
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,028
They're sending a car over now.

411
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,970
I hope they find a contact.

412
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,682
Jimmy started running a fever
and his chest is congested.

413
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,601
I put him on antibiotics
in case of pneumonia.

414
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,329
Listen, I don't know
if this means anything,

415
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,856
but I did, in the archives,
find a Dr. Sorensen

416
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,191
who worked here.

417
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,943
Great, can we...
can we get in touch?

418
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,653
Unfortunately, no.

419
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,113
He died 50 years ago.

420
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,578
Well, he's not
gonna be any help.

421
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,625
How long is this gonna take?

422
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,502
Longer if you don't keep still.

423
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,173
I heard I had an old pal
in here, making trouble.

424
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,426
Sharon twisted my arm.

425
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,052
- How we doing?
- Where are you guys at?

426
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,971
I took his vitals, got blood.

427
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,806
Treated me like a pincushion.

428
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,266
I have a proposal for you.

429
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,643
What do you say I take
over before this old crank

430
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,936
bites your head off?

431
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,105
I will absolutely take
you up on your offer.

432
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,818
Okay.

433
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,779
Let us see what we have here.

434
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,115
Uh, look up for me, buddy.

435
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,845
So you know we've got
Celtics-Bulls tomorrow night,

436
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,579
- right?
- Right.

437
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,331
I was actually thinking about
putting down a little action.

438
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,542
- You? Action?
- Why not?

439
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,312
Celtics heavily favored,
all right, but I'm just...

440
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,504
I'm really feeling the upset.

441
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,841
If I take the Bulls,
I get 6-to-1 odds.

442
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,134
Hmm.

443
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,345
Yeah?

444
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,057
Okay, now follow with
your eyes, not your head.

445
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,059
Here you go.

446
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:45,607
So if I put down 20 bucks,

447
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,816
that would get me,

448
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,735
when it's 6 to 1 odds,
that would get me...

449
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,237
Uh, 110?

450
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:53,865
120, isn't it?

451
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:54,908
I think it's 120, yeah.

452
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,202
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 120.

453
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,788
Not bad, huh?

454
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,873
No. No, not bad.

455
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,541
Mm.

456
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,378
You know, we haven't
been to Al's for a while.

457
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,813
You wanna grab some
lunch on Friday?

458
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,506
You got it.

459
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,715
Okay.

460
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,223
Hey, Alex. Can you hear me?

461
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,632
Can you open your eyes for me?

462
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,064
Can you squeeze my hand for me?

463
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,400
Can you do that?

464
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,901
Is something wrong?

465
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,612
No, his body is just
taking longer than expected

466
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,572
to clear the muscle
relaxant that we gave him,

467
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,758
which was part of
the anesthetic.

468
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,117
Is that a problem?

469
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,053
No, we can give Alex a
medication that will help

470
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,329
reverse the muscle relaxant
and help him come back to us

471
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,622
a little bit faster.

472
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,250
- We do this all the time.
- Okay.

473
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,794
Let's give him 0.2 of Exsomadex.

474
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:48,837
On its way.

475
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,423
This should act fast.

476
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,761
Sinus tachycardia.

477
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,263
BP 80/50.

478
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,681
Oh, what's happening to him?

479
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,807
Let's get him upright.

480
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,475
He's having an
anaphylactoid reaction,

481
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,786
which is like an
allergic reaction.

482
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,770
Oh, God!

483
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,105
Epi 0.3 milligrams IM.

484
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,314
On its way.

485
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,625
You said you do
this all the time.

486
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,942
We do.

487
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,278
BP now 72/45.

488
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,740
Solumedrol 125,
diphenhydramine 50,

489
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,324
Famotidine 20.

490
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,118
Oh, my God. My baby.

491
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,828
Oh, my baby.

492
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,624
Okay, BP's coming up.

493
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,627
87/55.

494
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,796
93/60.

495
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,340
Oh.

496
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,302
He's gonna be okay.

497
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,261
Really, he's gonna be fine.

498
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,971
But why?

499
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,723
Why did this happen?

500
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,439
Dr. Asher, we need you in here.

501
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,317
Her BP keeps dropping.

502
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,986
Okay, up her Levophed to 20.

503
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,239
Oh, God! Oh, God!

504
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,283
Brisk VB.

505
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,555
- She's not dilating.
- What does that mean?

506
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,040
It means that the medication
we used to induce labor

507
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,124
isn't working fast enough.

508
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,459
BP's still low.

509
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,169
Transfuse 2 of red
and 2 of plasma.

510
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,420
Call for 6 and 6.

511
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,797
We need to operate now.

512
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,358
You said it was risky
while she was septic.

513
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,841
We can't wait. Call the OR.

514
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,260
Let them know we're coming
up for an emergent D&E.

515
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,143
Don't let her die.

516
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,812
Please don't let her die.

517
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,528
Can I ask you for
a little favor?

518
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:38,630
All right?

519
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,383
Just because your blood
pressure is a little high,

520
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,117
do you mind hanging around

521
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,177
till I get your blood work back?

522
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,619
Just for my own peace of mind.

523
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,830
Go to the café. Have
a nice cup of coffee.

524
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,248
It won't be long.

525
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,249
I'll text you one
way or the other.

526
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,959
Okay.

527
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,211
Looking forward to Friday.

528
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,130
Friday?

529
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,798
Lunch. Lunch at Al's.

530
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,967
- 1:00.
- Right.

531
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,136
Right. Lunch at Al's.

532
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,179
1:00. See you, Dan.

533
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,140
See you, pal.

534
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,021
Give me suction.

535
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,777
Marty, how's she looking?

536
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,405
BP's better than pre-op, 100/60.

537
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,656
Good.

538
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,408
Good, good, good, good.

539
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,745
Uterus feels clear.

540
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,621
Marty, how much IVF did she get?

541
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:33,209
2 liters of NS, 2
PRBC, 2 of plasma.

542
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,753
Urine output is at 300 CC...

543
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,629
Dr. Asher.

544
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,007
She's hemorrhaging!

545
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,676
BP 70/30, heart rate 150.

546
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,636
Start the MTP and
give her 1 gram TXA,

547
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,806
0.2 milligrams methergine IM
now and 1,000 misoprostol.

548
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,975
- Should we open?
- No, get me a Bakri balloon.

549
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,143
Retractor.

550
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,524
Inflating.

551
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,860
The bleeding's slowing.

552
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,320
BP coming up.

553
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,917
How's he doing?

554
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,168
Not great.

555
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,961
He feels helpless.

556
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,603
Is she gonna be able
to keep her uterus?

557
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,382
I don't know.

558
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,759
Right now, it's all
about saving her life.

559
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,386
Yeah.

560
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,390
So you have kids?

561
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,474
One.

562
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,434
She's grown.

563
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,687
My ex and I, we tried to adopt,

564
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,357
but it didn't work out.

565
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,900
What about you?

566
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,151
No.

567
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,695
No, I, um...

568
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,613
I was married young

569
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:44,989
before I went into the service.

570
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,742
And after I got back
from deployment,

571
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:51,996
we both agreed that
there was nothing there.

572
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,374
It's all so hard.

573
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,543
And to have this?

574
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,217
Dr. Ripley.

575
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,385
Yeah.

576
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,554
Jimmy's CT.

577
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,973
It doesn't look like
Alzheimer's, does it?

578
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,099
No.

579
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,685
No, brain's not
globally atrophied.

580
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:17,355
It looks like a lot of
scarring in the frontal area.

581
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,732
Yeah.

582
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,067
So traumatic brain injury?

583
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,993
In a manner of speaking.

584
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,704
I read about this
in medical school.

585
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,084
Dr. Charles.

586
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,210
Hey.

587
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,379
So what do you think?

588
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:45,759
I think that we could be
looking at some issues.

589
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,220
So he's gonna need
a thorough workup.

590
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,513
It's a good idea.

591
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:54,684
Convincing him is
not gonna be easy.

592
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,269
Help me out with that?

593
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,730
Actually, I made up a
little excuse about his labs

594
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,441
in order to keep him here.

595
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,526
Tell him together
after I get him back?

596
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,028
Text me.

597
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,070
Thanks.

598
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,582
- How's the kid?
- He's fine.

599
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:18,875
It was scary.

600
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,335
Yeah.

601
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,337
I think the hospital
should pull Exsomadex.

602
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,547
Whoa. Why?

603
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,091
The anaphylactic
reaction happened

604
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,342
after we administered it.

605
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,344
Temporal connection
doesn't mean anything.

606
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:30,970
That kid's on 15
other medications.

607
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,847
They could have
a delayed effect.

608
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:35,308
More likely, it was the
antibiotic or the anesthetic.

609
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,144
I considered that,
so I pulled ADR data.

610
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,814
There have been several similar
reactions to Exsomadex here.

611
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,607
Get this... the
manufacturer report

612
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,652
claims 1 out of 2,500.

613
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,697
Med data shows 1 out of 200.

614
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,907
That's 10 times what
the manufacturer claims.

615
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,452
Well, you might have a case,

616
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,496
but this data is retrospective.

617
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,540
It's not any kind
of clinical study.

618
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,501
So pull Exsomadex
until we have one.

619
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,878
Hold on. It's a
popular medication.

620
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,505
I've used it and
never had a problem.

621
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,841
It doesn't mean that you won't.

622
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:13,882
Crockett, that boy
almost died today.

623
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,348
All right.

624
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,850
I'll, uh...

625
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,144
I'll bring this up at the
drug and formulary meeting.

626
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,270
Best I can do for now.

627
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,789
In the meantime, make
sure that the nurses

628
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,607
submit an adverse drug
reaction report, okay?

629
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,192
Thank you.

630
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,072
To begin the
transorbital lobotomy,

631
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,200
the orbitoclast is inserted
under the left eyelid

632
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:36,995
and up against the
top of the eye socket.

633
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,997
The neurosurgeon
drives the point

634
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,541
through the orbital plate
into the frontal lobe

635
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,210
to a depth of 5 centimeters.

636
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,213
He then swings the
handle far laterally.

637
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:50,550
He now drives the instrument
another 2 centimeters...

638
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,108
Here's Jimmy's CT.

639
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,612
I think we can rule
out Alzheimer's.

640
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,615
Identical scarring on

641
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:16,576
oh, my God.

642
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,994
He had a lobotomy?

643
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:20,205
Yeah.

644
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,749
They haven't done those
for, like, 60 years.

645
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,085
I mean, he must have been a kid.

646
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:28,213
They did the procedure
on difficult patients.

647
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,757
Jimmy was probably a
discipline problem,

648
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,217
hard to control.

649
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:36,221
So Dr. Sorensen stuck
a skewer into his brain

650
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,849
and... took care of that.

651
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,438
Awful.

652
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,979
Dad said he's getting more
oxygen now, so that's good.

653
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,870
Hey. This is Dr. Collins.

654
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,206
- She started our center.
- Oh, Margo. Please.

655
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,809
I think I've seen you
around the hospital.

656
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,102
Yeah, I recently got privileges.

657
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,836
I'm sorry I couldn't
get here earlier.

658
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,587
Several new residents
were checking in.

659
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,131
So how is Damon doing?

660
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,258
Well, he's sedated.
He's on a ventilator.

661
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,819
Dad's been taking
really good care of him.

662
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,052
I'm sure he has.

663
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,655
Well, we're by no
means out of the woods.

664
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,055
Can I see his chart?

665
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,224
Sure.

666
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,059
Endocarditis.

667
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,061
We're hoping the
antibiotics knock it out.

668
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,563
Listen, if you need to get back,

669
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:28,106
I can call you if
there's a change.

670
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:32,986
Uh, no, I'd like to
stay, see how he does.

671
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,821
Is it all right
if I sit with him?

672
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,240
- Of course.
- Thank you.

673
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:39,117
Hey, just so you know,

674
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:41,244
your son, he's been
a real godsend.

675
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,662
That's nice to hear.

676
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,724
It's so helpful to have
people around our residents

677
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,708
who understand their challenges.

678
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,634
Kaitlin?

679
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,970
Kaitlin, can you hear me?

680
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,805
Hi.

681
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,599
I got good news.

682
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,268
We were able to
save your uterus.

683
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,438
So if you decide
to conceive again,

684
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
you should be able to.

685
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,485
Honey, did you hear?

686
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,736
No.

687
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,279
No, I can't.

688
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,406
I can't do it again.

689
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,450
Please. I'm sorry.

690
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,744
It's okay. It's okay.

691
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,037
Nobody would help.

692
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,246
I know.

693
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:28,792
They made me feel
like I didn't matter.

694
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,420
I was thinking,

695
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,339
if you agree,

696
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,840
maybe we should move.

697
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,717
But your home, the farm.

698
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,552
I can't go back there.

699
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,346
How could I?

700
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,349
Oh, God, Kaitlin,

701
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:48,103
I don't think I could stand to
see you suffer like that again.

702
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:52,774
I know how much you
wanted a family, so

703
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:57,028
if you decide you
want us to try again,

704
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,155
you don't have to be afraid.

705
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,408
We'll leave you two alone.

706
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,289
Well, it's good to know

707
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,251
there's some good
guys in the world.

708
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,335
Yeah.

709
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,841
How is she?

710
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,436
They're not gonna
pull Exsomadex.

711
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,229
They're submitting
the data to the FDA,

712
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,732
and they'll, uh, follow
their recommendations.

713
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,234
That could take forever.

714
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,069
We need to pull it
now. I'll talk to them.

715
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,946
Hold on. I made the case.

716
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,449
- It's been decided.
- I can still try.

717
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,076
Drop it, Zola.

718
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:48,246
It's not how things work here.

719
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,622
Of course.

720
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,759
You feeling better, Jimmy?

721
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,968
Uh-huh.

722
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,470
What about Betty?

723
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:06,139
Dr. Ripley, CPD is here.

724
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,141
I'll be back in a minute.

725
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,852
- Dr. Ripley?
- Hi.

726
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,204
We did a well-being
check on the address

727
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,855
associated with that number.

728
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:17,650
We found an elderly
woman... deceased.

729
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,277
Medical examiner
is investigating,

730
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,196
but it looks like
natural causes.

731
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,490
I took this off the credenza.

732
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,119
That's my patient.

733
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,788
And that's the woman we found.

734
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,141
I talked to a neighbor who said
they were brother and sister.

735
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,793
And she was her
brother's caregiver.

736
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,962
Sorry I don't have better news.

737
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,130
She must have collapsed,

738
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,341
and Jimmy went looking for help.

739
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:47,472
Better call social work.

740
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:48,556
He's not going home.

741
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,486
I thought you'd be more
comfortable waiting in here.

742
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:04,239
I haven't been in your
office for a long time.

743
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,407
Very nice.

744
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,659
Please. Can I get you anything?

745
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,619
Nah.

746
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,330
- Come on in.
- Daniel.

747
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:13,665
Go ahead.

748
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:15,917
Tell her what
great shape I'm in.

749
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,669
Well, I mean, by
and large, you are.

750
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:20,088
There you go.

751
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,841
Yeah, I noticed a

752
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,259
a minor balance issue.

753
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,219
I hurt my knee.
What do you expect?

754
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,805
And some short-term
memory issues.

755
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,516
Memory?

756
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:32,684
What do you mean?

757
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:33,995
Well, you're forgetting
things, Bert.

758
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,438
Well, who doesn't forget things?

759
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,023
What's this about?

760
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,526
Really just about your

761
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,945
your friends and your family
being a little bit concerned.

762
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,655
That's all.

763
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,157
Concerned.

764
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:50,577
We'd like you to take
some more tests, Bert.

765
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:53,079
What tests?

766
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,582
Oh, to see if I'm all
there, compos mentis.

767
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,375
Is that what you're
talking about?

768
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,085
Well, I mean, if
there is an issue,

769
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,629
and trust me, big if

770
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:02,714
don't you wanna know?

771
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:03,715
I mean, I certainly would.

772
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,258
There isn't.

773
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,218
Well, just in case,
let's make an appointment

774
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,803
with the neurologist.

775
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:09,846
Oh, yeah.

776
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,056
I get it.

777
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:12,390
This is a setup.

778
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:13,892
It was a setup
from the beginning.

779
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,268
Look, I apologize, Bert,

780
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,771
but I knew you wouldn't
come here on your own.

781
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:19,898
And Tara has been so worried.

782
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,733
Uh-uh. Don't put this on Tara.

783
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,651
This is... this is you.

784
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,570
Yeah, y-you're trying
to put me away.

785
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,323
You wanna put me away so
you can get your hands on

786
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,367
- on my... on my pension!
- Oh, Bert!

787
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,369
And... and you're
in it with her.

788
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,090
The two of you are
cooking up this nonsense

789
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,872
so you can get my money!

790
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,374
Couple of crooks!

791
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:38,416
Bert.

792
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:39,542
Bert.

793
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:41,211
How long have we been
friends for, huh?

794
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,421
- 40 years?
- 40 years, but not anymore.

795
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:44,940
A-and what was that
power I gave you?

796
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,091
That law power?

797
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,133
Power of attorney.

798
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:48,134
Well, you don't have it anymore.

799
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:49,386
You ought to be ashamed!

800
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:50,887
Bert!

801
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,727
Dr. Ahmad, they discharged Alex.

802
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:06,169
Great.

803
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:08,117
Yeah, like you
said, no big deal.

804
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:10,257
I'm sorry for what happened.

805
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,659
No. Please, it
wasn't your fault.

806
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,327
And Alex is doing fine.

807
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,995
You caught his cancer.

808
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,455
My God.

809
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,666
We are so grateful to
you and Dr. Marcel.

810
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:23,420
We can't even begin
to thank you enough.

811
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:25,296
Thank you, guys. Good luck.

812
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,132
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

813
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,550
Thank you.

814
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,556
No pulse.

815
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,183
He's fibrillating.

816
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:38,727
I'll get on his chest.

817
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:40,562
Milligram of epi.

818
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:41,521
Charge to 200.

819
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:42,689
Charging.

820
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:44,024
Clear.

821
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,110
Still no pulse.

822
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,153
Epi's in.

823
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,195
Again, charge to 200.

824
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,613
Charging.

825
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:53,116
Clear.

826
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,996
Huh, nothing.

827
00:33:58,038 --> 00:33:59,664
He's asystole.

828
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:06,963
No.

829
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,256
No.

830
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,845
Damn it.

831
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,142
Time of death, 1703.

832
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:34,699
All right, Jimmy, let's get
you into this wheelchair.

833
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,205
That's it.

834
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,625
Now, you see that nice woman?

835
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,171
She's gonna take
you to a new home.

836
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,342
Did you help Betty?

837
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:54,594
Some very good people
went to help her.

838
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:59,683
Where I'm going, is Betty there?

839
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,312
No, she isn't.

840
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,483
I-I want Betty.

841
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:14,781
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

842
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,282
She can't be there.

843
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,451
But she'd want you to go,

844
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,871
and she'd want you to be happy.

845
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:26,626
I... I want Betty.

846
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,003
Yeah.

847
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:31,256
Yeah, I know.

848
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,091
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

849
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,223
Here.

850
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,521
That's Betty

851
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,148
and me.

852
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,357
Yeah.

853
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,987
I love Betty.

854
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:02,495
It's gonna be all right, Jimmy.

855
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:04,164
I'll come see you, okay?

856
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,915
And we'll talk about Betty then.

857
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:11,421
I was cold.

858
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,298
Now I'm warm.

859
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:16,551
Thank you.

860
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:19,929
You're welcome.

861
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,685
Hi, Jimmy.

862
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,228
I'm Madeline.

863
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:36,029
Hi, Madeline.

864
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:51,586
That's a... a tough one, huh?

865
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,174
I just keep wondering

866
00:36:56,216 --> 00:37:00,053
what his life
might have been if,

867
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,305
you know...

868
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:06,893
If they hadn't given up on him?

869
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,353
Yeah.

870
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:13,608
You know, I've been
meaning to ask you,

871
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,902
were you ever able to
reconnect with your mom?

872
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:18,822
No.

873
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,199
I heard she's been
in and out of rehab,

874
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,909
in and out of custody.

875
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,286
Well,

876
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:27,038
I'm sorry to hear that.

877
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,211
And I'm also...

878
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:37,132
I'm just so sorry if I

879
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,718
turned out to be
yet another person

880
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:42,929
that made you feel
abandoned in this life.

881
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:46,474
You know, I just... I
genuinely regret that.

882
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:50,520
And I... I hope you'll
accept my apology.

883
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,337
It's real.

884
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,422
I'm sorry.

885
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,966
Yeah.

886
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,260
Thank you for not saying,
"Now you can move on,"

887
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:24,387
or something
ridiculous like that.

888
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:25,972
I mean, I was tempted.

889
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,265
Me too.

890
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,278
I'm not ready.

891
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,780
Hmm?

892
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,997
Why?

893
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:54,209
Why?

894
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,752
Until there's an autopsy,

895
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,021
there's no way to know for sure.

896
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,005
But whatever that infection was,

897
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:03,677
it just weakened his heart
until we couldn't save him.

898
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:05,387
Because he used drugs?

899
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:08,348
Well, we might have a better
idea after the autopsy.

900
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,058
But it's possible.

901
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,060
Street drugs, dirty needles.

902
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,357
Oh, man.

903
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,275
Sean,

904
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:22,153
I'm sorry I couldn't save him.

905
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,454
You did everything you could.

906
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,832
In my world, you
see a lot of loss.

907
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,667
And no matter how hard you try,

908
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,253
sometimes it's
just never enough.

909
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,839
I can guess how Sean is feeling.

910
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,216
He came to the
center full of hope,

911
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:44,551
wanting to make a difference.

912
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:49,014
I'll talk to him.

913
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:00,358
Bert?

914
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,737
I'll, uh, get tested, just to

915
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:05,447
just to get you off my back.

916
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:08,575
Okay.

917
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,660
Satisfied?

918
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:25,759
Oh.

919
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,844
- Hey.
- Hey.

920
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:32,265
You, uh, pulling another shift?

921
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,434
Yeah.

922
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:37,854
I thought I was the only
one into self-flagellation.

923
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:41,274
No, I'm pretty good at it too.

924
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,572
Rough day?

925
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:49,282
Yeah.

926
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:51,451
You?

927
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:53,119
Yeah.

928
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:03,254
Get some rest.

929
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,303
You too.
