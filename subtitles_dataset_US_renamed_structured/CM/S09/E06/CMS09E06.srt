1
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:07,374
<i>That boy almost died today.</i>

2
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,289
I think the hospital
should pull Exsomadex.

3
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,638
It's not how things work here.

4
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:13,250
<i>This is bigger than
just one patient.</i>

5
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:16,122
I am impressed with how you
turned your life around.

6
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:18,472
Top of the list,
maybe county juvenile.

7
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:20,692
<i>He had a lot to overcome.</i>

8
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,433
<i>You're forgetting things, Bert.</i>

9
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:25,218
Let's make an appointment
with the neurologist.

10
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:26,828
The two of you are
cooking up this nonsense

11
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:29,440
so you can get my money!

12
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,181
I'll get tested,

13
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:33,555
<i>just to get you off my back.</i>

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,672
Oh, good.

15
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:45,717
You made it.

16
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,632
Are you spying on me?

17
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:50,243
You have an appointment
at my place of employment.

18
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:54,073
I thought I'd make
myself available to you.

19
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:57,250
Look, I understand
if you're nervous.

20
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,035
I'm not nervous. I told
you, I'm fine, Sharon.

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,820
I don't need a damn babysitter
watching my every move.

22
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:03,126
You know what?

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,953
If you feel that strongly
about it, I'll back off.

24
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:07,458
Just let your children
know what the doctor says.

25
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:11,612
Thanks.

26
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:14,833
- Hey. I'll do a...
- Good morning.

27
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:15,964
Hey, good morning.

28
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:17,531
- Get you anything?
- Oh, no.

29
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,056
I make my coffee at home.
I'm bougie about my coffee.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,274
Oh, is that so?

31
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,885
I'll do a medium
drip, black, please.

32
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:24,930
Thank you.

33
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:26,540
I'm decidedly unbougie.

34
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:29,065
No, I hear you reserve
your refined taste

35
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,284
for weird cocktails.

36
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:33,199
You're referring to my Sazerac?

37
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:35,158
Go to New Orleans and say that.

38
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,638
There you go. Keep
the change. Thank you.

39
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,075
You were saying.

40
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,729
Ah, Dr. Ahmad, Dr. Marcel.

41
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:45,211
I have some news I'm sure
you'll be glad to hear.

42
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,605
The hospital has
put a temporary hold

43
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:52,827
on the use of Exsomadex pending
a thorough safety review.

44
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:55,178
That's amazing.

45
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:56,527
I thought the drug
and formula committee

46
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,963
weren't gonna take action.

47
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,225
They weren't, but at the urging

48
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:01,401
of one of our board
members, Everett James,

49
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,187
the committee decided to
reverse their decision

50
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,276
until the FDA sorts it out.

51
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,147
Great. Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

52
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,279
You're welcome.

53
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:10,715
Look at you.

54
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,412
I always thought
institutional inertia meant

55
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,414
we were dead in the
water, but we did it.

56
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:18,157
You did it. Congratulations.

57
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,854
On my count, three, two, one.

58
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:22,118
- Oh, it hurts.
- Okay, Lucas, we got you.

59
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,250
I need an X-ray. Single GSW.

60
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:25,773
As far as I could tell,
I didn't see anything

61
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,427
on his back, but I
couldn't stop the bleeding.

62
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,212
BP's falling. Rate's 110.

63
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,300
Hang a unit of O-neg.

64
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,997
Mike, chest X-ray.

65
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,433
- Yep.
- Okay, on my count,

66
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,546
let's swap places.
Three, two, one.

67
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:40,136
Yeah, that's the
subclavian artery.

68
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,813
Thanks, Courtney, we got this.

69
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,340
Clear.

70
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:51,451
Yeah, bullet's retained
behind the clavicle.

71
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:53,758
- I-I can't breathe.
- Okay, just stay with us.

72
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:55,629
We gotta get this
bleed under control.

73
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:56,848
Clamp.

74
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,371
We won't be able to
get an angle on it.

75
00:02:58,395 --> 00:02:59,503
Get me a Foley cath.

76
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:01,355
- For a gunshot?
- Come on.

77
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:07,206
I'll insert the Foley
to capture the bleed.

78
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,971
It'll let me
inflate the balloon.

79
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,559
It'll temporize,
buy us some time.

80
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,995
Yeah.

81
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,214
BP's still low but stable.

82
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:16,824
Page Trauma, have
them open an OR.

83
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:17,893
Let's go.

84
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,049
Little pick-me-up?

85
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,877
Oh, no. I already
have one. Thank you.

86
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,531
It's prophylactic.

87
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,185
Figured you'd need a second run
after spending another night

88
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,229
in the on-call room.

89
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,752
How'd you know I slept here?

90
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:33,580
You're brushing your bed hair.

91
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,495
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,931
You've been spending a
lot of time in the ED

93
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,368
since the divorce.

94
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,239
Because the house doesn't
feel like home anymore

95
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,980
and I feel like
a stranger there.

96
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,329
Maggie, I need an assist.

97
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:44,809
Yep, right behind you.

98
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,028
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Yeah.

99
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:48,334
Hello, I'm Dr. Archer.

100
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,118
- This is Nurse Lockwood.
- Morning, morning.

101
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:53,252
I hear you're having some
trouble with your ileostomy.

102
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,993
Deb. That's my son, Caleb.

103
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:56,908
- Hey, Doc.
- Hi.

104
00:03:56,932 --> 00:04:00,216
I'm pretty sure it's
a prolapse again.

105
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,434
Do you mind?

106
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,523
Sorry, I know it's nasty.

107
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,351
Don't worry. We're
not squeamish here.

108
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,615
Yeah. Yeah, it's
definitely prolapsed.

109
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,356
You say this has
happened before?

110
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,576
Every time he sneaks
off to play basketball.

111
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,839
You took me to
Chicago in the winter.

112
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,667
What else do you expect
me to do for fun?

113
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,823
Not run off and hurt yourself.

114
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,889
We're visiting from Oakland.

115
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,805
Well, it's still too inflamed
to manipulate right now.

116
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,720
We can reduce the
swelling with some...

117
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:28,026
Sugar.

118
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,462
I figured that was the case.

119
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,856
Yeah, miracles of
modern medicine.

120
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,947
I also want to order some labs,
a CBC, BMP, and abdominal CT.

121
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,165
You got it, Doc.

122
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,734
Can I ask, I see some
other scars here.

123
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:43,868
Some are surgical,
but the others?

124
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:46,808
Caleb was shot two
times in the fall.

125
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,569
Oh, my God.

126
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,615
A lot of car break-ins
where I'm from.

127
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,920
One turned into a shootout,

128
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,618
and I caught a couple of strays.

129
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,272
Sorry to hear that.

130
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,925
You seem to be doing well.

131
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,449
He's a tough kid.

132
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,928
Tough on the court too.

133
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:03,801
One of the best guards in
California before this.

134
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,585
Well, after the
reversal procedure,

135
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,152
you'll be back on
the court in no time.

136
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:08,849
Won't matter.

137
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,634
Dr. Davis, our pediatric
surgeon back home,

138
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:14,594
said Caleb has to wait
another 10 months.

139
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:15,856
By then, the summer's gone,

140
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,597
and so are all the
college scouts.

141
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,338
Why don't we focus on
getting through this

142
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,233
for now, okay, hon?

143
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:25,475
Do we have your permission
to contact your surgeon

144
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,738
- to get Caleb's medical records?
- Of course.

145
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:28,782
Okay.

146
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,915
Well, in the
meantime, sit tight.

147
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,656
We're gonna get
these tests going,

148
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,441
and then I'll be back
to check on you shortly.

149
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:36,858
Thank you.

150
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:40,446
Mr. Sullivan, a doctor
will be with you soon.

151
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,056
We just need you
to get in the bed.

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,017
Fine, just both of
you, give me 6 feet.

153
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,932
Okay. Okay, sir. Okay.

154
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,629
I'm giving you space. It's fine.

155
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,371
Morning, Anita. Early
start to the madness?

156
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,894
Got a call about a bar fight,

157
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,767
picked up this charmer,
Robert Sullivan.

158
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,334
I don't want any vitals.

159
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,813
I don't want
anything. I don't...

160
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:02,120
He's still intoxicated
and wouldn't settle down.

161
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:04,340
So I told him, it's either
the hospital for his injuries

162
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,602
or the drunk tank.

163
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,386
- Hmm. He's no idiot.
- Yeah.

164
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,214
He was adamant about
being brought to Med,

165
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:10,998
said he knows a doctor here.

166
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:12,391
He say which one?

167
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,828
He kept asking for Rip.

168
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:16,569
- For Rip?
- What are you gonna do?

169
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,658
I don't want any BPMs.
I don't want nothing.

170
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,399
Hey, Mr. Sullivan,
how you doing?

171
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,140
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dr. Charles.

172
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,794
You know, Nancy's just
trying to get your vitals,

173
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:24,969
make sure you're okay,
take two seconds.

174
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:27,275
No, I'm already
good. I feel good.

175
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:29,539
Where's Rip? I
wanna talk to Rip.

176
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:32,193
Do you mean Dr. Ripley?

177
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,543
Just get him.

178
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,807
Nancy, let's give
Mr. Sullivan a little space

179
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,853
- and page Dr. Ripley.
- Okay.

180
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:41,401
Thank you.

181
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,392
Hey. Trauma called.

182
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,697
Subclavian repair went smoothly.

183
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:00,439
- Patient's doing well.
- Good. Thanks, Trini.

184
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,615
Hey, I got your page. What's up?

185
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,443
Oh, are you, uh,

186
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,403
are you familiar with this
gentleman in five here?

187
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,232
Mr., uh... Mr. Sullivan,
Robert Sullivan.

188
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:12,364
Yeah.

189
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,235
Gentleman is pushing
it. What happened?

190
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,585
He got banged up in a bar fight,

191
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:18,849
insisted on being brought
to Med because of you.

192
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:20,198
Won't let anybody
else treat him.

193
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,460
No!

194
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,461
At the very least, I
need your temperature.

195
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,723
No! No.

196
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:24,942
Great.

197
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:27,925
Yeah, keeps on asking for Rip.

198
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:35,039
Yeah, uh, Sully and I used
to run the streets together

199
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:36,649
before I left Chicago.

200
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,042
Oh, yeah?

201
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,609
You... you okay
treating an old buddy?

202
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,219
I can find somebody else.

203
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,482
We're not that close, so
it shouldn't be a problem.

204
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:44,986
Thanks.

205
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,268
Okay.

206
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,314
I won't have this
conversation with you.

207
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:50,750
Hey!

208
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,012
There he is.

209
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:53,100
All right, let's
keep it down, Sully.

210
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,145
I told you I knew him.

211
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,605
I got this. Thank you.

212
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,629
Thank God.

213
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,655
I can finally relax.

214
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:06,529
Don't even think about it.

215
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,640
Jeez.

216
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:12,163
Cop might as well have
dropped me off at jail.

217
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,991
Still an option if you
keep acting this way,

218
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,167
showing up here, giving
everybody a hard time.

219
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,734
And a bar fight at
the crack of dawn?

220
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,083
What the hell, Sully?

221
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,259
Hey, some guys were
talking down on my Bulls,

222
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,043
and I retorted, and they
couldn't take a joke,

223
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,349
so we handled it outside.

224
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:25,785
Yeah, looks like
they handled you.

225
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:26,873
Where else they get you?

226
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,136
Couple cheap body shots.

227
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,138
Not to mention your jaw.

228
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,358
I'm still a sex symbol, though.

229
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:35,186
I can't say the same
for him and his boy.

230
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,362
They were on the
receiving end of this.

231
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:40,147
Looks like what we call
a boxer's fracture.

232
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,888
Hmm, I like the sound of that.

233
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,150
I gotta say, I'm impressed

234
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,543
you finally learned
how to use your hands.

235
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,458
Could have used
them back in the day

236
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,199
while I was busy saving you
from getting your ass kicked.

237
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:51,811
Still got jokes.

238
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,205
Fancy white coat and
a pretty-boy haircut,

239
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,926
but at least you kept
your sense of humor.

240
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,408
Little short of breath there?

241
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:02,933
Ugh.

242
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,591
Just a little cough I
picked up over the holidays.

243
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:08,786
Let me take a listen.

244
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,853
Deep breath.

245
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,139
All right, I'm gonna
order bloodwork

246
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,488
and an X-ray to be safe.

247
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,707
I just wanted my hand looked at.

248
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,361
Now you're trying to up sell me?

249
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,233
Just put the gown
on and stay put.

250
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,452
Someone'll be by soon to
image your chest and hand.

251
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,653
And don't give them a hard time.

252
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,468
Throat doesn't look that bad.

253
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,688
How long have you been
feeling this way, Adriana?

254
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,472
A few weeks, hard to say.

255
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,563
Been traveling a lot, so my
sense of time is out of whack.

256
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,347
Anywhere fun?

257
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,436
Grand tour of the Midwest
Hotel Convention circuit.

258
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,744
I organize tabletop
and board game cons.

259
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:57,616
Anyway, I thought this was
just another con cough,

260
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,400
you know, something you
pick up when you're stuffed

261
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,751
in a ballroom full
of gamers, but...

262
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,733
Can you breathe for me?

263
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,217
Ow, that hurt.

264
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,632
Your lungs do sound
a little junky.

265
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,416
Just means that there's
a lot of phlegm.

266
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,942
Could be from flu,
COVID, or pneumonia.

267
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:22,032
But we won't know until we
run a few tests to be sure.

268
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:24,643
I just got my shots,
but pneumonia?

269
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,818
Wow.

270
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,191
We'll take good care of you.

271
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:34,044
Let's start with a
chest X-ray, CBC, BMP,

272
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,220
swabs for COVID, flu, and strep,

273
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:38,657
and put in a CT
for chest and neck.

274
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,006
Okay.

275
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,510
I'll be back to
check on you soon.

276
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:48,145
Hey, I just wanted to double
check on those CAT scans.

277
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:50,103
Shouldn't we wait for
the chest X-ray first?

278
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,496
It seems aggressive.

279
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,715
Honestly, I'm not even sure that

280
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,151
this is just an infection.

281
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:55,848
But page me when
those tests are back.

282
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,265
You got it.

283
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,703
There you go.

284
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,554
You're a real pro at this.

285
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:09,688
It's not a skill I planned
on mastering, but thanks.

286
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,038
Caleb, Deb, good news.

287
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:13,344
Your labs came back normal.

288
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:15,370
Oh, that's great, hon.

289
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,306
Well, looks like your prolapse

290
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,439
hasn't reduced as
quickly as we'd like.

291
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,074
It's probably because of
persistent congestion.

292
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:29,621
So based on what I'm seeing
here and Caleb's latest CT,

293
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,492
I think it would be
better if we went ahead

294
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:32,929
with your reversal surgery.

295
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,452
- Excuse me?
- Wait, what?

296
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,672
Truthfully, my recommendation
would be to do this

297
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,369
as soon as possible.

298
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:41,894
You're telling me I can get
rid of this thing, like, today?

299
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,330
I should be able to
get you on the schedule

300
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,505
in a few hours, yeah.

301
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:45,506
Let's go!

302
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,465
Mom, we can call Coach Mark,

303
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,729
tell him I'm running with
the soldiers this summer.

304
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,102
This is good news.

305
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:57,368
Can I speak with
you for a moment?

306
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,612
I don't understand.

307
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,266
You can't reduce the
prolapse bedside?

308
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,399
Well, I probably can,
but I think surgery

309
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,836
is the better long-term
solution at this point.

310
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,229
Caleb is several months out,

311
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,665
and his recovery is going great.

312
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,798
His labs indicate that
he's healthy, strong.

313
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,061
All due respect,
Dr. Davis has been

314
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:19,845
with us since day one.

315
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,239
We've known you,
what, two hours?

316
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:25,068
Dr. Archer has a lot of
experience with this.

317
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,766
Our doctor was adamant we wait,

318
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,550
that with all of
Caleb's surgeries,

319
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,205
the adhesions needed
time to break down

320
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:33,772
before we can do the reversal.

321
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,078
That was a solid plan.

322
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:37,602
However, Caleb's
recurring prolapses

323
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:40,126
could make it more likely
for him to prolapse again.

324
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,912
And possibly make
the eventual repair

325
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:43,956
more challenging.

326
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,742
You don't know for sure.

327
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,787
I won't trade my
son's health for that.

328
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,050
I know you wanna hold
off until you get home,

329
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,096
but I'd be happy to speak
with your pediatric surgeon.

330
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,794
Like I said, Dr. Davis believes

331
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,274
Caleb is better off waiting.

332
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:58,884
So until he says otherwise,

333
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,302
I'm not discussing
surgery any further.

334
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,075
Can I get your
eyes on something?

335
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,753
Of course.

336
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,298
Skipped right to CT scans, huh?

337
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:23,474
Patient came in with classic
signs of an infection,

338
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,824
but with the shortness
of breath and chest pain,

339
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,914
I was afraid that it was a
septic pulmonary embolism.

340
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,308
- I know that's a long shot.
- No, you were on the money.

341
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:34,814
Look... definitely a small PE.

342
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,794
Check out this next CT.

343
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,124
I'm not exactly sure
what I'm looking at.

344
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,278
Peritonsillar abscess

345
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:47,846
with infiltration
to the jugular vein.

346
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,413
What'd the swab come back as?

347
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,154
Strep.

348
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,851
Hmm.

349
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,548
This is Lemierre
syndrome, isn't it?

350
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,813
I've only read about it.

351
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,859
Effective blood clot
in the neck, yeah.

352
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,514
Very rare, very dangerous.

353
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:05,733
Explains a lot... infection
starts in the throat,

354
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:08,693
spreads to the jugular, starts
throwing clots downstream.

355
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:09,999
Okay, we

356
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,870
we need to anticoagulate
your patient ASAP.

357
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,698
So go ahead and start
her on a heparin drip,

358
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,221
prevent the existing
clot from propagating,

359
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:18,224
and I'd also start her
on antibiotics, okay?

360
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:21,097
Why wait when we can go after
the clot with the thrombectomy

361
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,273
and eliminate the risk entirely?

362
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:24,752
We're not there yet.

363
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,972
Let's give the meds some
time to get the fever down.

364
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,452
But if she doesn't
turn the corner soon,

365
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:29,757
I think you're right.

366
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,847
Surgery may be our
best bet, okay?

367
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,935
I'll get Adriana up to speed.

368
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,893
Good. And I'll call ENT.

369
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,503
They'll need to
scope her, all right?

370
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,789
Mm-hmm.

371
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,900
Oh, Mr. Sullivan...

372
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,729
Sully, Sully, I'm so sorry.

373
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,078
Buddy, we can't
really have patients

374
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:47,558
wandering around out here.

375
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:49,125
We just have too much
foot traffic out here.

376
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,735
It's a hospital policy
thing. I hope you understand.

377
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,129
But I just wanna find
a place to smoke.

378
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:54,652
I just can't be in that room.

379
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:55,696
Totally get it.

380
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,133
It's such a drag having to wait.

381
00:14:57,157 --> 00:15:00,919
But I promise you, Dr. Ripley
will be by any second.

382
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,660
Oh, speak of the devil.

383
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,227
Hey, hard to believe it's
the same guy who had us

384
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,011
stealing candy
when we were kids.

385
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,708
Where the hell were you?
I told you to stay put.

386
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:10,581
I'm sorry, Dr. Ripley.

387
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,954
Won't happen again.

388
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,179
I got this. Thanks.

389
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,985
Time for a bedtime story?

390
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,856
I'm tired as hell.

391
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,118
Actually, I think
you're gonna want

392
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:29,817
to sit up for this, seriously.

393
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,496
Okay, okay, what?

394
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:37,390
I got the results
from your chest X-ray.

395
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:40,611
They show a nodule in your
left lung that concerns me.

396
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:43,483
And your white blood
cell count came back low.

397
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:47,792
So you'll... you'll need a
chest CT as well as a biopsy.

398
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:50,490
Can you explain it
to me in English?

399
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,995
You got early signs
of lung cancer.

400
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,976
Wait, what?

401
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,414
Look, I know it sounds scary.

402
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:04,678
But some lung cancers
are very treatable.

403
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,028
I'll refer you to an oncologist.

404
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,638
That's a cancer specialist.

405
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,205
No, no, no.

406
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:13,774
I only came here to avoid jail
and get my hand patched up.

407
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:15,124
Now you're throwing
the C-word at me.

408
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,386
Like I said, I'll have
an oncologist talk...

409
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,474
I feel fine.

410
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,433
The way I see it,
this convo's over.

411
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,087
I want out.

412
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,002
You need a thorough
evaluation and treatment plan.

413
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,788
No! I'm done.

414
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,007
Where do I sign?

415
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,096
All right.

416
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,576
At least let me
get ortho in here

417
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,969
to splint that broken hand.

418
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,492
The bandage is just temporary.

419
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:36,797
It shouldn't take long.

420
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,650
Fine, but that's all.

421
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:48,853
Excuse me.

422
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,420
Can you point me
to your cafeteria?

423
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,639
I'm trying to find
something Caleb can eat.

424
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,424
Absolutely.

425
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,034
Right this way.

426
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,819
I have to say, you've really
got a handle on Caleb's care.

427
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,560
Must be reassuring for him.

428
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,259
Thank you, though I
suspect Caleb wishes

429
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,652
he could see a
little less of me.

430
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:06,871
I'd take that as a good sign.

431
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,351
It means he's a normal teenager.

432
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,787
Normal?

433
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,398
It's been a long road to
get here, for both of us.

434
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:13,791
Yeah.

435
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:16,576
You know, after Caleb
was shot, I was a mess.

436
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,362
The emergency room, the
ICU, in and out of surgery,

437
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:21,842
I felt like I basically
lived at the hospital.

438
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,409
I can't imagine
how rough that was.

439
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,716
It was the waiting, you know,

440
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,153
the not knowing
that wore me out.

441
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,155
But we finally made it home.

442
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,636
We figured out a
routine together,

443
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,334
the bag changes, the
diet, the cleaning.

444
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:39,425
Caleb hates it, but it's
a version of normal.

445
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,210
Yeah.

446
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:43,299
Oh, the cafeteria is down
the hall to the right.

447
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,562
Just follow the signs.
You can't miss it.

448
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:47,240
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

449
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,915
All right, Caleb.

450
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:53,028
I think we're ready
to reduce this.

451
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,573
Okay, I'm sorry.

452
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:58,096
Okay, Caleb.

453
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,619
You're gonna feel a
little bit of pressure.

454
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,360
Are you ready?

455
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:02,709
Okay.

456
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,276
So Oakland.

457
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,931
I know of some Hall of Famers
at your position from there.

458
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:10,500
Gary Payton, Jason
Kidd... before your time.

459
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,458
I studied them both.

460
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:14,267
- But Dame is my guy.
- Ah.

461
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,986
So if I get this surgery,

462
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,771
what kind of recovery
time am I looking at?

463
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,381
That depends.

464
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:25,080
Probably a question for
your pediatric surgeon.

465
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,256
You've gotta have
an idea, right?

466
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,171
I mean, we talking days, weeks?

467
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,129
How long I'ma have to wait
to get back on the court?

468
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,739
Yeah, I think that's
a conversation

469
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:34,393
we can have with your mother.

470
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,352
When your mother comes back
from the cafeteria, we can...

471
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,658
She already made up her mind.

472
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:41,270
But it's my life.

473
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,923
There's a chance that
I could still salvage

474
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,969
my high school career, I
could still get a full ride

475
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,971
from a big-time D-I school.

476
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:49,780
And I could make a
play for the NBA.

477
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,002
You said you could
do this today, right?

478
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,938
Come on, Doc, you
did, didn't you?

479
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,616
Yes, I did.

480
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:07,015
Dr. Archer, may I speak
to you for a second?

481
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,151
All right, your stoma's all set.

482
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,873
What can I do? He
backed me into a corner.

483
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:22,267
He's a minor, and his mother
made her wishes very clear.

484
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,095
All right, listen, now,

485
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,315
I don't need a tutorial
on medical ethics.

486
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,405
Caleb has the right to
know what his future holds.

487
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,537
And I feel for Caleb too.

488
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:33,278
But they just got
their lives back

489
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:35,367
after a horrific experience.

490
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:36,890
Right, one I wanna
help him move on from.

491
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,370
You can't just move on

492
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,416
after your life's been
turned upside down.

493
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,113
Deb is just trying to
hold on to something

494
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,897
that is normal for them.

495
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,464
That's the problem, okay?

496
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:47,858
She's clinging to a normal
that does not exist.

497
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,251
So instead of moving forward,

498
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,513
she's not doing anything at all,

499
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:52,297
even when her son
clearly wants to.

500
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,367
What-what does my son want?

501
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,477
Caleb reiterated to me

502
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,045
that he wants the reversal
procedure, but I told him...

503
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,089
I thought I made
myself clear earlier.

504
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,482
Yes, you did, but...

505
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:05,528
Has my son's prolapse
been resolved?

506
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:06,746
Yes, it has.

507
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,555
Then I would like
him to be discharged.

508
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:23,676
Bert, how'd it go?

509
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,721
Bert.

510
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:27,332
You got what you wanted, okay?

511
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:29,029
What did the neurologist say?

512
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,206
I was doing fine till you had
to go and screw everything up.

513
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,729
Well, I'm just
concerned for you, Bert.

514
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:35,582
We're divorced.
Stay out of my life.

515
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,830
Dr. Charles, can you
do a capacity check

516
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:48,266
on Sully for me?

517
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,051
Why, have you noticed
some kind of behavioral

518
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,140
or cognitive change since
you last connected with him?

519
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,272
He's being irrational.

520
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,491
He probably has lung cancer,

521
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:57,057
but he's refusing
further testing.

522
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,843
Oh, boy. I'm sorry to hear that.

523
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,540
If I let him walk
out of here AMA,

524
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,020
I'm basically handing
him a death sentence.

525
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:05,065
Unfortunately, refusing
further testing

526
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:07,633
is not really grounds for
questioning somebody's

527
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,374
decisional capacity.

528
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:12,421
He's got a terminal illness
and won't get treatment.

529
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:13,596
Sounds like he's got a problem

530
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,902
with his decisional
capacity to me.

531
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:18,035
Okay, so this is where
I have to ask you,

532
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,515
would you be pushing for this

533
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,715
if this were just
a regular patient?

534
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,351
It's the only way I can
see to save his life.

535
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,092
I mean, unfortunately, if he
doesn't wanna pursue treatment,

536
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,398
there's just...

537
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:34,617
I mean, there's nothing
we can do about it.

538
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,749
I'm sorry.

539
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:38,558
Yeah, me too.

540
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,280
Dr. Marcel, Dr. Ahmad.

541
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,325
Her blood pressure
just dropped 20 points,

542
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,892
90/60 and still falling.

543
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,198
Where am I?

544
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:52,417
She's disoriented.

545
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,419
And hypotensive.
Must be septic shock.

546
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,595
Zola, start a central line
and get her on pressors.

547
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,336
Need to get her BP back up.

548
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,165
Get a bag on her. Dial
up the O2 to 15 liters.

549
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:02,471
And bolus a liter of crystalloid

550
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:03,895
- and set up a norepi drip.
- On it.

551
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,606
Adriana, slow, deep
breaths for me, okay?

552
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,955
Pressure's still down.

553
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,285
Need to get that line in.

554
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,069
Got it.

555
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,224
Wire.

556
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,248
Go ahead.

557
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:22,055
We're in.

558
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,319
Okay, start the norepi at 10
and titrate up to a MAP of 65.

559
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,755
Norepi's on.

560
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,607
Okay, cycle the BP cuff.

561
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:34,459
Blood pressure's
coming back up, 95/65,

562
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,591
and sats are climbing as well.

563
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:36,940
- She's stabilizing.
- Good.

564
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:38,637
Let's draw a culture,
start her on vanc,

565
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:40,987
and let's get an A-line set up.

566
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:43,381
- Let's get a blood gas too.
- Page us when she's lucid.

567
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,643
You were right.

568
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,800
She's gonna need a thrombectomy.

569
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:56,307
- Here.
- What's this?

570
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:58,440
A little light reading a
critical care committee

571
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,006
just drafted.

572
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,791
"Revised post-operative
muscle relaxant

573
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:03,140
reversal agent protocol."

574
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,360
See, I heard getting
Exsomadex pulled

575
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,187
was your little crusade.

576
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:10,408
Thought you might be eager to
learn about its replacement.

577
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,803
"The new recommended
reversal agent is Gamaverse."

578
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,326
There a problem?

579
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,981
No, except it's ten times
the cost of Exsomadex,

580
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:20,244
which gets pushed
on to the patients

581
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:22,420
when their insurance
won't cover it.

582
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,813
That... there has to be

583
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,292
cheaper therapeutic
alternative options.

584
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,904
No. Nope. No. Not
according to the committee.

585
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:30,472
So the next time you think
about sounding the alarm

586
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:32,628
off limited data, think twice.

587
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,265
Mom, I got it.

588
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,290
Okay.

589
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:46,966
Um, Deb, I've got your
discharge paperwork,

590
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,316
and I'll have someone
by to walk you out.

591
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,579
Thank you.

592
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:51,778
Okay.

593
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:56,976
Caleb, I know this is hard.

594
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,110
But your life is more
important than some game.

595
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:02,223
Not much of a life anyways.

596
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:08,553
I'll go pull the car around.

597
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,599
Deb, wait, please.

598
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,276
- What?
- I just...

599
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:16,082
I'm sorry that you're leaving.

600
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,563
But Dr. Archer is an
excellent surgeon.

601
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,826
And he just wants to do
what's right by your son.

602
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,872
I really don't want
to discuss this again.

603
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,439
I know you're afraid.

604
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,353
And it makes sense
with everything

605
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:27,398
that you've gone through.

606
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,574
What we're still going through.

607
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,228
Of course.

608
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:33,360
It's understandable that
you would want to hold on

609
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:35,406
to what's familiar
while you can,

610
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,042
while your world has
been turned inside-out.

611
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:45,416
It has taken everything I've
got just to make it this far.

612
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,050
Deb.

613
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,901
I don't know if I can go
through this again right now.

614
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:54,730
What if it goes wrong?

615
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,210
I don't think I can handle that.

616
00:24:57,234 --> 00:25:02,041
At least this way, I know
what tomorrow looks like.

617
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,806
I understand.

618
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:08,918
But this life now,

619
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:11,181
is it worth holding on to,

620
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:14,208
knowing that there's a
possibility of another way?

621
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:27,110
Dr. Malone, good afternoon.

622
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:28,831
Ms. Goodwin, come in.

623
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,984
Bert just left, so
I have to assume

624
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:34,421
your visit is not a coincidence.

625
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:37,468
Well, I know given
HIPAA regulations,

626
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:40,602
it's not my place to come here
and ask about your patients,

627
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,604
but my family's worried.

628
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:43,953
I understand.

629
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:46,651
And there is no
privacy issue here

630
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:50,437
as you're listed as Bert's
primary emergency contact.

631
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:53,876
I'm listed as his
emergency contact?

632
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,424
Yeah, it's what's in his file.

633
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:01,405
I'm sorry to have
to tell you, but...

634
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,562
I've diagnosed Bert with
Alzheimer's dementia.

635
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:07,193
Alzheimer's.

636
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:09,979
Now, there are treatments
available to him.

637
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:12,329
But as you're well
aware, this diagnosis

638
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:15,245
can be a long and rough
road for everyone involved.

639
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,401
You likely know most of this.

640
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,250
But here's some
information your family

641
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,818
can anticipate moving forward.

642
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,036
Yeah.

643
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,996
I offered them to
Bert, but he, um,

644
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,912
he left them behind.

645
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:31,566
He didn't take the news well?

646
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,940
Well, in my experience,
few people do.

647
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:42,533
My door is always open.

648
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:44,404
To you or your children,

649
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:47,582
if you have any more
questions or concerns.

650
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,651
Thank you.

651
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:10,629
All right, Caleb, game time.

652
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:30,581
Mr. Sullivan, I assure you,

653
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:32,061
they're just printing
your paperwork.

654
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:33,715
Keep it. I don't care.

655
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:34,977
I'm leaving.

656
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,065
I'm out of here.

657
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,283
Excuse me. Excuse me, lady.

658
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:38,850
Sully, Sully, come
on. Knock it off.

659
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:40,591
- Get back in bed.
- I got my splint.

660
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:41,810
I'm leaving.

661
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,072
You need to see an oncologist.

662
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,290
Shut up already.

663
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:45,683
You got your little
iPad and your name tag,

664
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:46,989
you think I'm supposed
to do what you say?

665
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,817
I'm trying to help you, man.

666
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,862
And I'm trying to leave, man.

667
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,366
Move.

668
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,913
If you walk out of
here, this will be

669
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,044
the dumbest thing
you've ever done.

670
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:01,090
- You can't leave.
- Out of my way.

671
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:02,439
No.

672
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:03,832
Rip, I'm gonna tell
you one more time.

673
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,640
- Move!
- Can't do it.

674
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:09,620
Security!

675
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:11,622
Hey! Security!

676
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:13,929
Dr. Ripley.

677
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:15,563
Dr. Ripley!

678
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,070
Calm down. Calm down.

679
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:27,682
Hey, calm down. Settle down.

680
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,031
You all right?

681
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:30,685
Yeah.

682
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,232
Should I call Dr. Archer?

683
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,193
Um, no, give me a
couple minutes, okay?

684
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:50,052
No. No. I'm not... I'm not...

685
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:51,749
I'm not in the
mood for a lecture.

686
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,751
You don't... you
don't know Sully.

687
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,710
There's only one way
to deal with him.

688
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,886
By tackling him to the ground?

689
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,236
I was just trying to get
the situation under control.

690
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,848
Mm, looked kind of like
you lost control to me.

691
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,503
So file a complaint.

692
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:07,678
Let's go see Archer
and Ms. Goodwin.

693
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:08,810
Come on. Let's get it over with.

694
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,463
So... so you can lose your job?

695
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,228
Is that what we wanna do now?

696
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,687
Yeah, I screwed up.

697
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:19,105
I screwed up, okay? I know that.

698
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:25,261
I'm just trying to... just
trying to look out for the guy.

699
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:26,653
I get that, but ideally,

700
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:30,266
you don't wanna risk
your job in doing so.

701
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,182
If I'd never left Chicago,

702
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,445
I'd probably have been right
there with him, at that bar,

703
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:38,143
throwing down beside him.

704
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:39,560
That's how tight we were.

705
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:44,149
But I wanted out of that
life, and I got out.

706
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:46,543
And that's a good thing, right?

707
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,545
But it can be a little more
complicated for the people

708
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:50,199
who feel, you know, left behind.

709
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:53,158
You know, having said
that, I think he came here

710
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:56,031
looking for you
because he trusts you.

711
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:57,859
Then why won't he listen to me?

712
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:01,297
Maybe he wasn't looking for

713
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,734
some guy in a white coat
with a fancy degree.

714
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:06,152
Maybe he's just
looking for his friend.

715
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,311
So

716
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:17,052
You tolerated surgery well.

717
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:21,578
And from what I'm seeing,
you're gonna be fine.

718
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,319
- For real?
- Thank God.

719
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,190
A few days here, a
few weeks at home,

720
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:26,888
and you'll be back on your feet.

721
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,672
Then I can hoop again?

722
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:33,459
Maybe in about eight weeks,
but only if you take it easy.

723
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,876
That's cool.

724
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,247
I appreciate you, Doc.

725
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,727
Well, save me some tickets
when you make it to the NBA

726
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,642
floor seats, preferably.

727
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,277
Thank you, Dr. Archer.

728
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:52,000
And thank you for pushing me.

729
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:55,331
I'm just glad that you and
Caleb get to move forward.

730
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,142
Sharon, I'm just so sorry.

731
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:07,276
Well, I guess the upside is,

732
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,800
now I know what
I'm dealing with.

733
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,454
Exactly.

734
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:12,890
And you know what?

735
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:16,285
I mean, there are some very
promising clinical trials

736
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:17,895
happening right now.

737
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,290
Some exciting new medications
are being developed.

738
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:23,509
And I'm just... I'm confident if
we get the right kind of help,

739
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,771
that we're

740
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:25,903
we're gonna be able
to navigate this.

741
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,600
We?

742
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:30,299
You mean me.

743
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:32,692
The decisions that
will have to be made,

744
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,956
the appointments,
the treatments,

745
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,002
that's all gonna
fall on me, Daniel.

746
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:40,265
What about the kids? I mean,
the kids will be there.

747
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:43,312
No. They've got their own lives.

748
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:47,316
I don't want them to have
to deal with this, either.

749
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,840
And how am I gonna do it?

750
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,973
I've got a hospital to run.

751
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:55,672
I got a new relationship that

752
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:58,501
is really going well.

753
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:01,373
And then what?

754
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:05,053
I have to take care
of my ex-husband.

755
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,947
I know it's selfish just to
think about myself, but...

756
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,800
No, it is not, not at all.

757
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,760
I can't do it, Daniel.

758
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:21,940
I can't.

759
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:31,969
Hi, Adriana. How
are you feeling?

760
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,536
Been better.

761
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,930
Well, look, we wanna talk
to you about next steps.

762
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,541
So given the state
of your infection,

763
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:41,936
it's our recommendation that
we progress with a procedure

764
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,415
called a thrombectomy.

765
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,591
Dr. Ahmad said
something about that.

766
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:48,333
Yeah, so myself and an
interventional radiologist

767
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:51,075
would pass a wire up
your arm, into your neck,

768
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,556
and basically extract the clot.

769
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,861
Oh, God.

770
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:56,385
The procedure is
minimally invasive,

771
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,039
and it would eliminate
any risk posed

772
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,910
by the clot, set
the antibiotics up

773
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,216
for success moving forward.

774
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,044
We'll have you
home in a few days.

775
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:06,351
This procedure, I
really have to do it?

776
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,787
There's no other option?

777
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,441
Yes, that would be
my recommendation.

778
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:10,466
Well, there might be.

779
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,838
- We could wait.
- What do you mean?

780
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:17,275
Give the antibiotics a chance
to fight off the infection.

781
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,582
And the blood thinners
haven't had that long

782
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:22,106
to break up the primary clot.

783
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,413
Which means it would still
pose a serious threat, no?

784
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,241
But if we give the
medications a chance,

785
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:28,069
then maybe we can
bypass the need

786
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,461
for a thrombectomy altogether.

787
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:30,767
Really?

788
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:33,726
Very unlikely is how I'd put it.

789
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,883
Dr. Ahmad, could
I speak with you?

790
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:45,216
Now, what was that?

791
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,610
You undermined me in
front of the patient.

792
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:50,874
And this procedure was your
plan from the start, right?

793
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:53,616
We both know that going after
an unstable clot is risky.

794
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,967
Same is true if we just sit
on our hands here, right?

795
00:33:56,991 --> 00:34:00,449
Now, IR is the only real
path forward for Adriana.

796
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,451
You knew that hours ago.

797
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,279
So what's changed?

798
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,846
Everyone keeps saying
that I'm impulsive,

799
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,587
that I make rash decisions.

800
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:10,241
And I think they're right.

801
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:12,113
I've been here a
month, and already,

802
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,289
I've been assigned
an ethics course,

803
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:18,902
pissed off the board, and now
this disaster with Exsomadex.

804
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,251
Maybe I should
keep my mouth shut.

805
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,296
Stop.

806
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,539
She needs this
procedure, period.

807
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:31,480
All right, go clear your head.

808
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:33,549
Go on.

809
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,709
Okay, I'm off.

810
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,537
To the on-call room or...

811
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:48,758
No, I'm heading home.

812
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:50,673
Oh.

813
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:54,720
I think it's time
that I move on.

814
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,094
Yeah.

815
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:17,482
Uh...

816
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,267
Tara, hey, sweetie.

817
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,965
How's it

818
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,836
no, wait, wait, wait.

819
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,908
Slow down, sweetie, slow down.

820
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:33,759
Hey. What are you doing?

821
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:37,459
Tara called and said Bert's
not answering his phone.

822
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:40,853
And I called, and it went
straight to voicemail.

823
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:43,682
You know he's tried to
take his life once before,

824
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,555
so I'm just gonna head
over to his place.

825
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,426
- I'll come with you.
- You don't have to.

826
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,800
- No, I'm coming.
- Okay.

827
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,219
Still nursing that
bougie coffee?

828
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,525
How's Adriana?

829
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:03,093
The procedure went
well, no complications.

830
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:05,878
She's back in the ICU,
awake and talking, okay?

831
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:08,644
- That's great. Thanks.
- Sure.

832
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:11,188
Hey.

833
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,320
Yeah?

834
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:14,041
Do you know who that guy is?

835
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:16,889
Everett James? Yeah.

836
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:19,109
We sit on the board together.

837
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:22,373
He's a bigwig at
Ward and Bancroft.

838
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:25,637
Yeah, the pharma company, so?

839
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:28,379
So I did some research
while you were in surgery,

840
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,816
and guess who manufactures

841
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,038
our new expensive reversal
medication, Gamaverse?

842
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,866
Ward and Bancroft?

843
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,085
Yeah.

844
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:40,739
Huh.

845
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:44,090
So this board member sells
his product to the hospital.

846
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:45,657
Must have used
our recommendation

847
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:47,616
to get himself a
sweetheart deal.

848
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,706
That... that's a
conflict of interest.

849
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,055
That can't be legal.

850
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,317
Look, I don't agree
with it, either,

851
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,450
but it's not illegal.

852
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:58,757
This is all happening
because of my recommendation.

853
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:02,220
Hold on, are you... are
you blaming yourself?

854
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,982
Before you spiral
out any further,

855
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:09,246
let me remind you what's
actually important

856
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,596
your patient,

857
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,685
who's alive and
well in large part

858
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:16,103
because you listened
to your instincts.

859
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:21,954
You knew thrombectomy was the
right call from the get-go.

860
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:26,350
Now, you might not
be able to take down

861
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:29,353
the medical-industrial complex.

862
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:32,965
But you saved a life today.

863
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:37,796
And, Zola, if that's
not good enough, then

864
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,735
maybe you should think
about another career.

865
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:04,736
Bulls snap that losing streak?

866
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,349
Lost it by 2 in OT.

867
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:09,611
Old fashioned, neat.

868
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:11,637
- Thanks.
- Yep.

869
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:16,095
Fancy drink.

870
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,706
Well, it's a lot
smoother than the rotgut

871
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,906
you got in your glass.

872
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:33,548
Some kind of mouse trap?

873
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:36,812
I use this and I wake
up under a knife?

874
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:40,361
Just a little something to
help out with that cough.

875
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:50,066
Look...

876
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:55,439
If you need anything,

877
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,572
anything at all,

878
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,835
you know where I'm hiding.

879
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:03,491
Doesn't matter where or when.

880
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:05,821
I got you.

881
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:32,761
I'll see you around, Rip.

882
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:35,764
Hope so.

883
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,019
- Bert!
- He's gotta be in there.

884
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:56,631
His car's out front.

885
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,266
- Bert!
- I got it. I got it.

886
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:03,159
Bert.

887
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:05,074
Bert, you home?

888
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,621
Bert?

889
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:21,157
Bert?

890
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,924
I don't know what's
going to happen to me.

891
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:34,040
Well, whatever comes,
we'll deal with it.

892
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:38,890
I... I don't wanna make
this anyone else's problem.

893
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:42,067
I... I have to deal
with it on my own.

894
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:43,765
No.

895
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:46,463
No, you don't,

896
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,640
because I'm here.

897
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,362
And it's all right.

898
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,889
It's gonna be all right.
