1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,011
Pavel's suing you
for malpractice.

2
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,660
Guy's a frickin' menace!

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,836
Never been one to walk
away from a fight.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,641
Maggie, I need you
to brace yourself.

5
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,928
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:18,888
You're bleeding into your chest.

7
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,063
You know, I kept waiting

8
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:22,326
for this right moment
to ask you out.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,372
I shouldn't have waited.

10
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:25,677
Sully has lung cancer,

11
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:27,418
but he's refusing
further testing.

12
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:28,767
Why won't he listen to me?

13
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:31,118
Maybe he's just
looking for his friend.

14
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:34,338
If you need anything, I got you.

15
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,082
Wow. Oh, my goodness.

16
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:41,693
Look at you.

17
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,617
Never would've pictured
you being a chubby baby.

18
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,306
- Okay. Don't make fun.
- I'm not.

19
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:46,698
It's just... it's
an observation.

20
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:49,092
Well, what about you?
Let's see baby Ripley.

21
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:50,876
Ooh. Uh.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,313
I think... I think those photos

23
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:55,838
all got lost in the, uh,
Great Chicago Fire of 1871.

24
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,187
- Oh. Pity.
- Yeah.

25
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:59,276
Well, uh, what
about you as a kid?

26
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,973
Same sad story.

27
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,193
- Dr. Ripley. A word?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:05,587
Your sparring partner,
Sully? He's back.

29
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,910
Do you want me to call security?

30
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,242
Uh, no need.

31
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,330
I got this.

32
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,635
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

33
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:14,726
Thank God you're here.

34
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,771
That nurse was giving
me the side-eye.

35
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,576
Can you blame her after
what happened last time?

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,081
Hey, you... you were
no Boy Scout, either.

37
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,386
So what's going on?

38
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,929
You, uh, back to get
your lungs checked out?

39
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:25,346
Dude, chill.

40
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:29,567
Lynne?

41
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:30,699
No way.

42
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:32,396
You gotta be kidding me.

43
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,876
Well, I know my belly got big,

44
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:36,574
but I'd like to think my
face hasn't changed too much.

45
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:38,533
20 years hasn't
changed you at all.

46
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,229
God, you look the same too.

47
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,234
Oh, no, don't tell me...

48
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:46,497
Yep. Yeah, I know.

49
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,084
Come on. Get it all
out of your system.

50
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,544
I had such high hopes for you.

51
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:51,174
You got straight A's all
the way through high school

52
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,610
just to wind up with the loser
from the back of the class?

53
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,157
Mm-hmm.

54
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,917
Well, it took him a while,
but he finally wore me down.

55
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,658
Yeah, well, Sully always
did have a crush on you.

56
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,423
Oh, save it.

57
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,382
But enough about me.

58
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,123
I told Lynne how we
ran into each other

59
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,950
at a bar a few weeks back.

60
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,430
Grabbed a drink.

61
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,650
That's right. We... we
caught that Bulls game.

62
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,741
So what seems to be the issue?

63
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,046
She's in pain.

64
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,266
I've... I've been
experiencing some cramping.

65
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,268
My OB's out of town
for the next few weeks,

66
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:20,444
and Sully said you worked here.

67
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,054
So I hope that's not a problem.

68
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:24,231
Not at all. I'm glad you came.

69
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:25,406
Uh, follow me.

70
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,453
Thank you for the coffee.

71
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,281
How much do I owe you?
- It's on me.

72
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,543
Least I can do, seeing
as you saved my life.

73
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:36,460
Ooh, well, if you're gonna
be paying me in coffee,

74
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:38,245
it's gonna take a while.
- That's true.

75
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,334
Mm.

76
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:43,554
So that was quite the
experience in the woods.

77
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,730
Yeah.

78
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:48,516
Anything you wanna talk about?

79
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:49,603
No.

80
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,997
You?

81
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:52,998
No.

82
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,261
Maybe not.

83
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,805
It's good to see you back
on your feet, though.

84
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,788
Yeah, those days off
actually did me some good.

85
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,679
Gave me a chance to brush up
for the trauma fellowship.

86
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:03,159
You were supposed to
be taking a break.

87
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,377
I know, but I'm a restless soul.

88
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,509
What can I say?

89
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,751
Oh, my God.

90
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,189
I'll call 911.

91
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:10,668
Yeah.

92
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:12,017
Hey.

93
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,849
You okay?
- Help me, please.

94
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,827
You're gonna be okay. My
name is Loren. I'm a doctor.

95
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,438
We're gonna get you
out of here, all right?

96
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,203
Hi, I need a bus
on the corner of...

97
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,640
Could you unlock your doors?

98
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:27,032
Hey, I need you to stay with me.

99
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,382
Stay with me.

100
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:30,688
CFD is on their way.
ETA five minutes out.

101
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,231
Yeah, I don't know if we
have that kind of time.

102
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,972
- She's losing consciousness?
- Yeah, she looks shocky.

103
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,539
You know, must've hit her
head, or she's bleeding out.

104
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:36,520
But either way...

105
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:37,584
We gotta get her out of there.

106
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:39,001
Okay, ma'am?
- Ma'am?

107
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:40,263
- Look at us!
- Ma'am!

108
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:41,525
Hey, stay with us, okay?

109
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,744
Right here. Stay with us.

110
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:53,863
Okay, she's barely holding on.

111
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,236
Here. Look at me,
ma'am. Look at me.

112
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,673
I need you to stay
with me. Stay with me.

113
00:03:58,716 --> 00:03:59,761
Keep your eyes open.

114
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:01,153
Do not go to sleep!

115
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,851
Do not close your eyes!

116
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:05,027
Hey, if you can hear me,
I need you to look away.

117
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,463
Ma'am, lean over here.

118
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:07,464
Lean towards the window.

119
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:08,857
Lean over.

120
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,473
You got it?

121
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:24,438
Hey, can you hear me?
- I can't feel my legs.

122
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:26,570
Anything else hurt?

123
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:29,660
Look, we're running out of time.

124
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,116
Well, we can't move her,
not without a backboard.

125
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,683
Pulse is thready. Look,
just keep her talking.

126
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,319
Can you tell me your name?

127
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:37,277
Whitney.

128
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,366
Whitney Poole.
- Hi, Whitney.

129
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,584
I'm Maggie Lockwood.

130
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:41,977
I'm a nurse.

131
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,239
We're gonna help you, okay?

132
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,894
Nothing's obstructing her legs.

133
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:48,070
Am I gonna die?

134
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:50,028
No. No. Okay, just focus on me.

135
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:51,552
Right here.
- Court!

136
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,162
Maggie, what do we got?

137
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:56,207
Whitney Poole, restrained
MVC, no sensation in her legs.

138
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,949
Copy. Let's get
her on the board.

139
00:04:57,993 --> 00:04:59,908
Whitney, I'm gonna
lower your seat, okay?

140
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,213
All right, on my count.

141
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,694
One, two, three.

142
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,655
Okay. There you go.

143
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:09,352
Just gonna slide this here.

144
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:11,615
There you go.

145
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,703
Collar's on.

146
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:16,968
I got her head. I got her head.

147
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,666
You're doing great, Whitney.

148
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,842
We'll see you at the hospital.

149
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,191
Let's get out of here.

150
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,032
- Okay, enough. Enough already.
- Sit back...

151
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,270
- Just trying to make you...
- Go sit over there.

152
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:39,643
Trying to make you comfortable.

153
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:40,968
No, you're trying to
show off in front of Rip

154
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,429
and this beautiful doctor.

155
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:44,474
- Oh.
- This is Dr. Asher,

156
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:45,997
and she's a great OB.

157
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,086
It's very nice to
meet you, Lynne.

158
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,740
So I hear you're
experiencing cramping?

159
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:52,874
Yeah, and a little burning
when I use the bathroom.

160
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,547
Okay, well, how many
weeks along are you?

161
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:57,139
And are there any complications
I should know about?

162
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:59,620
I am 29 weeks, and
I got that thing

163
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,796
where they sew your cervix
shut so the baby stays in.

164
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,797
A cerclage.

165
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,972
Cerclage, yeah.

166
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:05,079
I had that a few months ago.

167
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,322
Was pretty painful.

168
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,109
I would love to inspect your
cervix and the cerclage,

169
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:12,328
if that's okay?

170
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,112
Yeah. Yeah.

171
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,723
You know, the real pain has been

172
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,440
trying to get my boyfriend to
take me to these appointments.

173
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:19,422
Hey, your OB is the
one who's been MIA,

174
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,468
so I made something
out of nothing.

175
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:22,599
I'm your man.

176
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:24,079
Oh, yeah, apple of my eye.

177
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,168
And don't get me
started on that cough.

178
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:27,735
It's just a cold.

179
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:29,563
It'll clear up. Tell her, Rip.

180
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,042
You're on your own, pal.

181
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,914
I know better than to
get on Lynne's bad side.

182
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:36,483
I will be outside.

183
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:37,919
No, no, no, stay.

184
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:40,269
Just keep on this
side of the curtain.

185
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,312
Okay.

186
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:45,468
All right, Lynne,
you're going to feel

187
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,580
a little bit of pressure.

188
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:51,715
Okay.

189
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,457
So the cerclage is intact.

190
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:58,374
The cervix is closed.

191
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,682
You're not having
contractions on the monitor.

192
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:07,209
Okay, my guess is, you
are experiencing a UTI.

193
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,864
So I'd like to order some
labs just to confirm,

194
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,519
and we'll get you started on
antibiotics if that's the case.

195
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:13,694
Shouldn't take too long.

196
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,391
Thank you, Dr. Asher.

197
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,740
Mm-hmm.

198
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,438
You are the best, Doc.

199
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,222
Don't mention it.

200
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,442
- We'll be back.
- Thanks.

201
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:28,360
Well, that was fun to meet
some people from your past.

202
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:29,884
You three haven't
skipped a beat.

203
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:32,234
Yeah. Yeah, it's been 20 years.

204
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,236
And you guys must have
some crazy stories

205
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,238
from back in the day.

206
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:39,894
Uh, it was a pretty
normal childhood.

207
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:42,723
Nothing too crazy.

208
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,942
I should, uh... yeah.

209
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:47,945
Ready? One, two, three.

210
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,906
Dr. Johnson and Maggie
are right behind us.

211
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:53,473
They assisted in
the extrication.

212
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,561
Thanks.

213
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:56,040
My legs.

214
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,520
You're doing great.

215
00:07:57,564 --> 00:08:00,044
Need X-ray in here!

216
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:01,239
You're the new
med student, yeah?

217
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:02,873
Uh, yes. Naomi Howard.

218
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:05,876
BP's soft. 87/58. Rate's 122.

219
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,811
All right, give her 2 and
2 on the rapid transfuser.

220
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:10,315
It's on its way. Hey, Kayla!

221
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,578
Mike.

222
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:14,711
Chest and pelvis.

223
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:15,843
Come on, Howard. In or out.

224
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,235
It... it's my first day.

225
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,559
I didn't know where I should go.

226
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,629
Sats are dropping. 85.

227
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:20,911
- We need to intubate her.
- Yeah.

228
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:23,459
I'm on it.
- Oh! So sorry.

229
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,244
Hey, Whitney. It's
Loren. Remember?

230
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:27,613
We're gonna give you
something to put you to sleep,

231
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,160
insert a tube to
help you breathe.

232
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:32,990
Too late, kid.

233
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,470
- But I just...
- You're out.

234
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,217
Come on. What's happening here?

235
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,566
Okay, I'm in.

236
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,610
Let's bag her.

237
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:48,658
X-ray. Clear.

238
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,401
Yeah,
multiple rib fractures.

239
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,621
Sats are coming up. At 94.

240
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:57,145
Mike, get the pelvis
too. We get a FAST yet?

241
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,508
Yeah, that's next on the agenda.

242
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
Doris, please?
- X-ray. Clear.

243
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,804
Pelvis looks good too.

244
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,985
All right, negative FAST.

245
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,464
No free fluid.

246
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:13,988
BP's transiently improving.

247
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:17,339
Too unstable for a CT, but
let's keep transfusing her.

248
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,167
At least we can spare
her the OR for now.

249
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,560
I do appreciate the validation.

250
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,603
I got this.

251
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,090
It's almost like... seems
like everywhere we go,

252
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,657
calamity follows.

253
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,443
Yeah, at least no one can
accuse us of being boring.

254
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:37,054
Dr. Johnson, a minute, please.

255
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:44,018
I understand you applied
to our trauma fellowship?

256
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:45,628
Yes, sir.

257
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:48,849
Okay, well, give me the Cliff
Notes of your experience.

258
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:52,592
Um, med school and gen
surgery residency at Emory.

259
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:56,639
Before that, eight years 67J
aeromedical evacuation officer.

260
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:59,555
Two tours, Iraq and Afghanistan.

261
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,948
So why trauma?

262
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,558
You looking for adrenaline?

263
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,300
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't.

264
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,911
I mean, I love the
ED, the energy.

265
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,260
Something new every day.

266
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:11,567
All right, well, then
today's your interview.

267
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,658
And Whitney is your
patient, door to discharge.

268
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:17,399
That is, assuming
you're all healed up

269
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,270
from last week's adventure?

270
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,271
Ready to serve.

271
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:21,577
All right.

272
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,665
Get changed.

273
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,889
This deposition is under oath.

274
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,065
So please, just tell the truth.

275
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:33,589
When you respond,
don't talk too fast.

276
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,810
And by all means, remain
polite and professional,

277
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,202
even if Pawel's lawyer isn't.

278
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:40,596
Don't fall for the bait. Got it.

279
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,381
And remember, Dr. Ripley,
we are completely behind you

280
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:44,687
during this process.

281
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,690
Med will bear the
brunt of this lawsuit.

282
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:50,084
Yes, it never
falls on employees.

283
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:52,042
Just the institution.

284
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,435
Good to know.

285
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:56,568
And, uh, speaking of suits,

286
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:58,092
wouldn't hurt you to wear one.

287
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,746
First impressions matter.

288
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,705
I got one in my locker.

289
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,794
Well, I better get back to work.

290
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:05,882
Excuse me.

291
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,106
Student Doctor Howard?

292
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,282
- Uh, Naomi.
- Yes, Naomi.

293
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:15,607
I'm Maggie Lockwood,
charge nurse.

294
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,024
I'm sorry about earlier.

295
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,741
I should've jumped in.
- No, no, no. You're fine.

296
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,767
How about we ease
you into something?

297
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,855
Okay.

298
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:24,205
Come on.

299
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,167
How long is this gonna take?

300
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,734
I wanna get out of here.
- Not long.

301
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:34,084
Likely a sprain, but
we will need X-rays

302
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,216
before we splint it.

303
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,913
Why don't you lean back, Jay?

304
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,655
Uh, no, no, no. I'm good.

305
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,763
It's my ankle
that's the problem.

306
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,789
This is just a precaution, Jay.

307
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,486
Standard procedure.

308
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,836
So how did this happen?

309
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,533
I fell off the
ladder in my studio.

310
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,033
Probably 'cause I haven't
been sleeping much.

311
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,449
I'm sorry to hear that.

312
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,340
I'm just trying to get
these pieces done, you know?

313
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,105
I'm in the groove. I
don't wanna waste it.

314
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,542
You're an artist? That's cool.

315
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,806
Yeah, I've just been
painting since I was a kid.

316
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,697
Ms. Howard, don't you think
we should hang some fluids?

317
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,070
Uh, right.

318
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:05,507
Uh, Jay, we're going to
give you a liter of fluid

319
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,117
to make sure you
don't get dehydrated.

320
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,250
And some blood work.

321
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:10,381
Mm-hmm.

322
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,382
I really gotta get back to work.

323
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:12,688
You got a pen and paper?

324
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,405
Might as well sketch
while I'm stuck in here.

325
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:15,560
No problem.

326
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:17,127
Give us a minute, okay?

327
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,389
Okay.

328
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,959
Okay.

329
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,004
Thoughts?

330
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:25,570
Whoa.

331
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,747
I'm thinking the ankle
isn't his main problem.

332
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,965
Mm-hmm.

333
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,706
I mean, this is an
unusual presentation

334
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,577
for someone who's
just drunk, right?

335
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,231
Mm-hmm.

336
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,383
Do you think he could be on
something other than alcohol?

337
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,932
Maybe an amphetamine?

338
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:40,585
Possibly.

339
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:43,066
Why don't you add a tox
screen to the blood work?

340
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,330
And just to cover our bases,
let's page Dr. Charles.

341
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:49,116
- Okay.
- Good job.

342
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,732
Hey.

343
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,777
Sully.

344
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,955
- Hey, I was just...
- Stop.

345
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,609
I've already said what I needed
to say about your smoking.

346
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:08,918
How you doing?

347
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:11,747
You good?
- Yeah.

348
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,055
If you're really not
gonna treat your cancer,

349
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:17,971
you gotta let Lynne know
what's going on, man.

350
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,687
She's got enough on her
plate with the pregnancy.

351
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:22,410
I don't wanna give her
anything else to worry about.

352
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:23,759
Come on.

353
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,084
You and I both know
you're not telling her

354
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,433
'cause she's gonna force
you to get treatment.

355
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:29,417
Look, I'm handling it, okay?

356
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,332
Just keep this to yourself.

357
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:45,563
Jay, this is Dr. Charles.

358
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,914
Jay, how are you doing?

359
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:51,656
You, uh... you
drawing something?

360
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,875
Still working it out.

361
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,572
Look, I don't need
a psychiatrist.

362
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:55,965
Okay.

363
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,464
You're just gonna tell
me what I already know,

364
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,882
that I have depression.

365
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,362
So you've had a
formal diagnosis?

366
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:04,321
Yeah. Six... eight months ago.

367
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:06,628
Okay, and were you
prescribed anything?

368
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,892
They put me on an SSRI.

369
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,851
Fluoxe... something.

370
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:12,958
- Fluoxetine, right?
- Yeah.

371
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,462
- Yep.
- And it works.

372
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,550
It works great.

373
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:18,248
Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that.

374
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,382
Listen, Dr. Charles, I
gotta get out of here, okay?

375
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,992
I'm just starting
to gel as an artist,

376
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,491
and people are starting
to finally notice.

377
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,256
I mean, this is a big
week in my career.

378
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,147
I've got a meeting with
a very important gallery.

379
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,607
They wanna lock down a show.

380
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,783
So just tell me what I
gotta do to get out of here.

381
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:32,891
Okay? What do I gotta sign?

382
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,177
I hear you.

383
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:36,136
Only thing I need is
an X-ray of that ankle

384
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,746
to make sure it's not broken.

385
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:38,897
Once we get that,
you're on your way.

386
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,444
So why don't I get that rolling?

387
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,620
And, um... and I'll
check back with you.

388
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:45,623
Yeah, okay.

389
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,929
I'm sorry.

390
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,341
He didn't report his
depression earlier.

391
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:49,865
Should I have asked?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

392
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,065
Would have been very
difficult to spot

393
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,588
given the state that he's in.

394
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,850
Jay's test results are in.

395
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,634
And we also
contacted his father.

396
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:57,897
Should be here in 30.

397
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,028
Huh.

398
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:00,638
Blood alcohol, 0.04.

399
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:01,944
I mean, that's, you know,

400
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,772
technically impaired,
but nothing extreme.

401
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:07,341
Mixing alcohol with his meds
should have a sedating effect.

402
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:09,299
- Correct.
- Not the opposite.

403
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,954
And his tox screen is clear.

404
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,303
No cocaine.

405
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:14,304
No amphetamines.

406
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,566
I don't get it.

407
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,066
Can't really say his
behavior is in line

408
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,482
with a depressive disorder.
- Yeah.

409
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,199
Pretty sure that depression
is not the only thing

410
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:21,355
we're looking at here.

411
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:23,792
Mags, page me when
Dad gets here.

412
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:24,967
Yes, of course.

413
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,316
Howard, with me.

414
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,728
Hey, good luck with
the deposition.

415
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,406
Let me know how it goes.

416
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,278
Yeah. Sure thing.

417
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,368
Hey, Lynne?

418
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:37,066
So I can confirm
that it is a UTI.

419
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,633
I've called in some
Macrobid for you.

420
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:41,418
You'll take that twice daily
with meals till it runs out.

421
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,464
Nothing too taxing
for you or Sully.

422
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,074
Oh, yeah.

423
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:47,438
Last thing I'd want is to make
anything too taxing for him.

424
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,949
Yeah, some guys can shy away

425
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,168
from this kind of
stuff in the beginning.

426
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,692
He's probably just nervous.

427
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:55,867
Yeah, maybe.

428
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:58,218
But Sully is so tight-lipped.

429
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,175
And Rip.

430
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,916
Just like the old neighborhood.

431
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,527
Can never let 'em see weakness.

432
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:06,661
Mitch doesn't ever really
talk about where he's from.

433
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:09,316
Yeah, him and Sully went
through a lot growing up.

434
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:12,232
Really? What do you mean?

435
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,016
It's probably not my place.

436
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,019
But I am really proud of Rip.

437
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,979
Yeah, he's overcome a lot.

438
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,769
Thanks, Mike.

439
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:30,032
Hey, Mike.

440
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:33,253
You X-rayed yourself?

441
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:35,559
Look, Archer's pulled
me in for trauma today,

442
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:38,998
so I just, you know, wanted
to give myself a once-over.

443
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,062
Loren, I've been where you are.

444
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:41,217
So has Dr. Archer.

445
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:42,412
He'll understand
if you're not ready

446
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:43,828
for trauma services just yet.

447
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,763
Look, I have flown through
rougher skies than this.

448
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:48,920
Oh, remind me how
the last flight went?

449
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,115
Look, Archer called my number.

450
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,662
I just... I wanna deliver.

451
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:55,057
- Yeah.
- Johnson, let's get moving.

452
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,627
I'm good.
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:02,412
So where are we at?

454
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,781
Well, I just gave
Whitney another 2

455
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:04,935
of blood and plasma.

456
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,808
Base deficit's 11.

457
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:08,592
Mile marker one.

458
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,420
Excuse me?

459
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,118
Trauma is all about
knowing your mile markers,

460
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,574
all right, when to
resuscitate or go

461
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,686
to surgery, when
to keep stitching

462
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,340
or to pack and bail out.

463
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:20,691
Whitney's had all that volume,

464
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:23,564
but she's still got an oxygen
debt and is hypotensive.

465
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,087
So what's that tell you?

466
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,002
That she's probably
still bleeding somewhere.

467
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,092
BP's back to the
80s, and she's tachy.

468
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,354
Okay.

469
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:37,099
FAST is still negative.

470
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,753
I don't get it.

471
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:39,928
Her X-rays are okay.

472
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,843
She's not bleeding
into her belly.

473
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:43,975
But vitals say she's shocky.

474
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,282
Well, don't discount the
retroperitoneal structures,

475
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,850
but it could be something else.

476
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:52,158
Well, her skin's flush, warm.

477
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,726
Neurogenic shock.
Her cord injury.

478
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,120
A loss of vascular tone
dropped her pressure.

479
00:17:58,164 --> 00:17:59,643
Just like an active bleed would.

480
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,384
Now you're thinking
like a trauma surgeon.

481
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:02,622
You know, I should have seen it.

482
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,102
She wasn't moving her
legs at the scene.

483
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,346
Shock's always hemorrhagic
until proven otherwise,

484
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:07,564
and we just proved otherwise.

485
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:10,350
Start her on neo,
get her MAP to 65,

486
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,482
and we gotta get her to CT stat.

487
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:18,619
Mr. Keene?

488
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,969
I'm Dr. Charles.
This is Ms. Howard.

489
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,840
She's a student
doctor who helped

490
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:23,991
with Jay's intake this morning.

491
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,582
How's he doing?

492
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,343
He's stable, resting
comfortably just inside there.

493
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,108
We'd like to have a
little chat with you

494
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,042
before we take you to see him,
though, if that's all right.

495
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,589
Do you mind if we sit?

496
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,591
Okay.

497
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,509
Psychiatry?

498
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,555
Is this about his depression?

499
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,165
His drinking?

500
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,056
Is that something he's been
struggling with for a while,

501
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,473
his drinking?
- No.

502
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,518
It started a few months
ago, not long after

503
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,085
he was diagnosed
with depression.

504
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,695
Is there any family history

505
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,958
of substance abuse
or mental illness?

506
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:56,700
No... not on my side or his
mother's, as far as I know.

507
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,702
We're divorced.

508
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:01,140
After he was diagnosed and
he started taking his meds,

509
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,924
right, did you notice any

510
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,447
any changes in his behavior?

511
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,145
I mean, other than the drinking.

512
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,929
At first, the meds
were a godsend,

513
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:09,583
helped him focus, be productive,

514
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:12,368
like it brought
him back to life.

515
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:15,676
But then it was as if the
dial got turned up to 11.

516
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,156
How do you mean?

517
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,159
He'd stay up all night
working, call me at all hours,

518
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,031
sleeping only when he drank
enough to knock himself out.

519
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:27,078
I tried getting him to quit,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

520
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:28,079
Yeah.

521
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,864
I'm at a loss.

522
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,909
These details are
actually very helpful.

523
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:36,653
And I think I know what's
going on with your son.

524
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,353
Hey. Hey! Something's
happening in here.

525
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:43,138
I think her water just broke.

526
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,183
Um...

527
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,057
Okay, I'd like to
check you out again.

528
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,580
Okay. Okay.

529
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:51,731
This isn't supposed to
be happening, right?

530
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:52,974
No, no, no. It's too early.

531
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:54,256
I can't... I can't
deliver the baby.

532
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,194
It's too early.
- You're okay.

533
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,412
You're gonna be okay.

534
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:57,781
Take a deep breath
for me, all right?

535
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,349
All right, I'm
seeing excess fluid.

536
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:01,896
Nitrazine swab?

537
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,332
What's she doing?

538
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:06,117
It's a test to indicate if
Lynne's water has broken.

539
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,423
Okay, test is positive.

540
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,251
No, no, no. I'm only 29 weeks.

541
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,924
That's why I'd like to do an
ultrasound, just to be sure.

542
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:11,906
Mitch?

543
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,560
Okay.

544
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,263
What? What's wrong?

545
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:23,961
The ultrasound is
showing normal levels

546
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,051
of amniotic fluid, which
is surprising to see

547
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,314
if your water ruptured.

548
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:29,924
So what is all this?

549
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,380
Could be discharge
from your cerclage.

550
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:32,642
But we'll need to do a different

551
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,928
swab, an AmniSure, to confirm.

552
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:36,060
All these swabs and
tests...

553
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:37,323
Hey, you okay?

554
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:40,195
I got him. Let's step outside.

555
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,589
Okay. Okay, take a seat.

556
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:43,992
Just try to...
just try to breathe

557
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,331
through your nose, okay?

558
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:46,984
Breathe through your nose, okay?

559
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,295
Well, that's not good.
- Okay.

560
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,993
Okay, let's get you
into bed, Sully.

561
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,299
Hey.

562
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,996
Hey, hey. Hey, Sully?

563
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,259
Okay. Okay.

564
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,435
Come on.

565
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,915
Sully? Sully, stay
with me, okay?

566
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,090
I need a hand in here!

567
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:07,222
Sully.

568
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,702
Sully, you with me?

569
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,543
Hey, bud.

570
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:25,632
Where's Lynne? Is she
okay? She's in labor?

571
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,547
She's fine.

572
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,679
I'm more worried about you.

573
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,160
Got an X-ray while you were out.

574
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:35,381
All that coughing has torn
the lining of your throat.

575
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:38,297
We gotta get you upstairs so
pulmonary can get a look at.

576
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,560
If they can stop
the pain, let's do it.

577
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,344
Yeah. Okay.

578
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,564
We'll talk about how to
knock it off my bill later.

579
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,742
Right, bud?

580
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:51,614
Hey.

581
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,268
What happened with him?

582
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,009
Uh...

583
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,188
Uh, significant
lesion on the lungs.

584
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:02,949
Do you think it's cancerous?

585
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,497
Pretty certain.

586
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,380
I tried to get him worked
up and into treatment

587
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:10,372
a few weeks back, and let's
just say it didn't go well.

588
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,375
I'm surprised Lynne
didn't mention anything.

589
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,206
Wait. She doesn't know?

590
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,903
Sully doesn't
wanna say anything.

591
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:23,646
I... I told him to tell
her, but he kept dodging,

592
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,909
so I... I backed off.

593
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,215
So let me get this straight.

594
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:29,478
He's your old friend,
but you can't sit down

595
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:32,438
and have an honest
conversation with him?

596
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:35,005
Hannah, what else can
I do? He's my patient.

597
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,529
I have to honor his wishes.

598
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,925
Look, I gotta get him upstairs.

599
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,100
Yeah. Go.

600
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,237
Right there.

601
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,109
It's a burst fracture at the T3

602
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:54,373
and a cord hematoma
ascending to T11.

603
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,896
That's what dropped
her pressure.

604
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:57,090
You're missing the
main attraction.

605
00:22:57,114 --> 00:23:00,030
Check out the left kidney.

606
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:01,945
Grade 3 renal lac
and a pneumatosis

607
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,773
around the abutting colon.

608
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,949
That'd be another mile marker.

609
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,690
Better get her to the OR.

610
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,388
Yep.

611
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,262
What are you saying?
I'm not depressed?

612
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:15,979
I think there's a really good
chance that you're suffering

613
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,961
from bipolar disorder.

614
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,441
Isn't that the same thing?

615
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,138
It's not.

616
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:24,185
Bipolar is a mood disorder
that makes people vulnerable

617
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:27,318
to extreme swings in mood,

618
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:31,714
cycling between depressive
states and manic states.

619
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,934
Manic?

620
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:35,457
What does that even mean?

621
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,633
Well, the beginning
of a manic state

622
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:43,030
is characterized by intense
energy, confidence, creativity.

623
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:45,119
Problem is, they're
invariably accompanied, also,

624
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:47,295
by severely impaired judgment,

625
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,558
which can even
evolve into delusion.

626
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:51,560
And that's when they
become really dangerous.

627
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,823
So you're saying my
doctor got it wrong.

628
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,522
I think that what happened is
that your doctor diagnosed you

629
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:59,002
when you were in a manic state
and thought that that was just

630
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,700
the extent of the problem.

631
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,919
So, uh, what?

632
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:06,270
My meds, the Fluoxetine, they
don't... they don't do anything?

633
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:07,750
Quite the opposite, right?

634
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:10,884
The problem with SSRIs is
when they are misprescribed

635
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:14,583
to a patient with
bipolar, they can induce,

636
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:17,673
enhance, increase the
frequency of manic episodes.

637
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:20,043
Yeah, Dr. Charles was telling
me it's not uncommon for people

638
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:21,677
to self-medicate with alcohol.

639
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:23,394
I told you, it was just
to take the edge off.

640
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,899
I understand it feels
like a short-term fix.

641
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,727
The problem is,
alcohol exacerbates

642
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,121
not only manic episodes but
depressive states as well.

643
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:32,732
Son, listen.

644
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,516
Dr. Charles says
this is treatable.

645
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,952
By doing what?

646
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:37,519
Well, what we do
is, we would slowly

647
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:40,000
titrate you off your SSRI

648
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,456
and switch you onto
a mood stabilizer.

649
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,046
Well, then what about my art?

650
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,265
What do you mean?

651
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:46,485
I'm actually selling now.

652
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:49,400
Whatever's going on
with me, it's working.

653
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,272
I won't let you take
that away from me.

654
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:54,188
Jay, your health is what's
important, not the art.

655
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,537
Of course you'd say that!

656
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,974
Because you didn't
support me as an artist.

657
00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,323
That's not fair.

658
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,518
I only wanted
what's best for you.

659
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,172
No, you wanted what
you thought was best

660
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:03,565
because you didn't
think I'd succeed!

661
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,068
Jay, look at me. Look at me.

662
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:07,506
We're gonna figure this out.

663
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,048
You've been given a
lot of information.

664
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,310
I'm gonna give you
time to process it.

665
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:11,640
I don't need to process.

666
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,076
I don't need other drugs.

667
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,165
I just need to leave.

668
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:16,819
I hear you.

669
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,667
And I sincerely apologize for
how backed up ortho is today.

670
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,388
- Just tell them to hurry up.
- Okay.

671
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:22,584
Well, let me go see if I can
shake somebody loose, okay?

672
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,349
In the meantime, I want you to
try and stay calm, all right?

673
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:31,051
Oh, my God.

674
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,748
You know, I would
really encourage you

675
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,577
to try not to take anything you
heard in there too personally.

676
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:37,753
You know, he's still in
a manic state, and...

677
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,581
But he's right.

678
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,802
I never really supported
him as an artist.

679
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:45,631
I'm an actuary, a numbers guy.

680
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:50,070
But art, I thought it was
a reckless career choice.

681
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:52,594
I tried talking
him out of it, but

682
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,659
what if he's putting himself
through all this misery

683
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:56,076
just to prove me wrong?

684
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,079
Is it my fault?

685
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:01,516
Mr. Keene, your
son has a disease,

686
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,779
and that is absolutely
not your fault.

687
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:07,740
I should call his mother,
let her know what's going on.

688
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:13,963
I can give ortho a call.

689
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,618
Okay. But you know what?

690
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,098
Don't rush it.

691
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,622
I wanna give Jay a little
time to maybe cool down a bit

692
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:21,947
before I have another
chat with him.

693
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,494
Okay.

694
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:27,281
Um, okay, but, um, how are
you gonna get him to comply?

695
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:30,980
Honestly, I don't know yet.

696
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:32,547
Okay.

697
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,509
Did you pull in this
specific direction

698
00:26:38,553 --> 00:26:40,947
when you reduced
Mr. Wapniarski's shoulder?

699
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,991
Yes.

700
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:44,037
Exactly like that picture.

701
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,473
And how many shoulder reductions

702
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,780
have you actually
done, Dr. Ripley?

703
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,433
Uh, too many to remember.

704
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:52,175
Can you give us a
ballpark figure?

705
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,220
Hundreds.

706
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,656
Without any issues.

707
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,093
Dr. Ripley, where were you born?

708
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:59,008
Chicago.

709
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,837
I see you graduated from
Columbia on a full ride.

710
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:03,752
That's very impressive.

711
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:07,669
I did notice, however, a
huge gap in your education.

712
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:10,803
Your last two years of high
school are unaccounted for.

713
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:13,719
And no record to
explain the absence.

714
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:15,677
So?

715
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:18,811
Well, in my
experience, Dr. Ripley,

716
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:20,769
a complete lack of
educational records

717
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:23,424
typically only leads
down a few roads

718
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:26,209
one of those being incarceration

719
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:28,864
and the other,
institutionalization.

720
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:31,214
Given that both of your parents
were out of the picture...

721
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:32,694
Objection.

722
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,740
I'm not hearing a
question here, counselor.

723
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:37,873
None of this has any
relevance to the case.

724
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:40,528
I'll move on.

725
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:57,545
Heard the, uh,

726
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:00,243
deposition was a little rocky.

727
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,772
It was fine.

728
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:12,342
It was, um... the lawyer...

729
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:17,957
The lawyer started
getting personal.

730
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,480
Personal? How do you mean?

731
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:26,008
Trying to use my
past against me.

732
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:27,706
I'm sorry to hear that.

733
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,576
Look, forget it.

734
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:33,189
I'm... I'm... I'm actually good.

735
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:37,803
Look, I know you know exactly
what you're doing here, but...

736
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,414
I don't know... maybe, um

737
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:42,261
maybe settling isn't the
worst idea in the world.

738
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:44,026
Listen, I'm...

739
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,552
I'm not gonna let some
shyster lawyer get in my head.

740
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:51,730
I'm good.

741
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,949
All right, what's the game plan?

742
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,613
Get eyes on the left colon,
take down the flexure,

743
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,441
and decide if the
kidney stays or goes.

744
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:10,574
Scissors.

745
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,578
Ribs are holding up?

746
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:16,145
Yeah, I'm good.

747
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,800
You know, the colon's avulsed
with a big mesentery gap.

748
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,454
Doesn't look salvageable.

749
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:22,282
But the kidney is okay.

750
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:24,719
Hemostatic. Hey,
Marty, what's our temp?

751
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,808
35.5 Celsius.

752
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,942
Well, then quit chatting.
Get that colon resected.

753
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:35,948
Well, I've seen
worse depositions.

754
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:38,341
Well, it sounds like
the plaintiff's attorney

755
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,387
is going for character
assassination.

756
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:42,824
Yeah?

757
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:45,392
Daniel?
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

758
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:48,438
Sharon, can I just grab
you for a quick sidebar?

759
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:49,483
Sure.

760
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:50,701
Peter, give us a minute?

761
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:53,052
Of course. I got
some calls to roll.

762
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:54,836
- Thank you, Peter.
- Sure.

763
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:57,839
What's going on?

764
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:03,062
I was wondering if
you wouldn't mind

765
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:06,979
talking to Dr. Ripley
about settling the lawsuit.

766
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:10,156
Why? What's changed?

767
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:12,332
Well, I'm the one, you know,

768
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,135
who brought Pawel in
here in the first place,

769
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,379
asked Mitch to look at him.

770
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,642
I kind of feel responsible

771
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:20,098
the way the whole
thing's shaken out.

772
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:22,472
Well, you know it's not
your fault, right, Daniel?

773
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:26,085
I mean, Pawel was going
to sue the next hospital

774
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:29,001
he walked into, even
if he stubbed his toe.

775
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:32,874
But what I do have to
ask is, why is it you

776
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:35,703
bringing this to me
and not Dr. Ripley?

777
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:40,012
It's complicated between us,

778
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,797
and I'd rather not go into it.

779
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,539
Complicated?

780
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:47,715
Look, here's what I
know about Mitch, okay?

781
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:50,761
At his core, he's a fighter.

782
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:53,025
And the thing about
fighters is that

783
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:55,592
they don't always know
when to back down.

784
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:57,856
I actually think it's
the best idea if you just

785
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,770
make the decision for him.

786
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:02,948
Okay.

787
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:10,645
But why do I sense there's
more to this story?

788
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,050
Where's Sully? Is he okay?

789
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:19,921
Uh, Dr. Ripley's taking
good care of him.

790
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,489
But I want to talk
next steps for you.

791
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:24,883
So the AmniSure swab
came back negative,

792
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:27,015
but because I'm still
seeing excess fluid,

793
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,192
I want to do an even more
conclusive test to confirm

794
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:31,933
that your water's not broken.

795
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,258
Well, if this test
is conclusive,

796
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:34,520
why didn't we do it
in the first place?

797
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:37,156
Because unfortunately,
it is more invasive.

798
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,854
I'll need to inject blue
dye into the amniotic fluid

799
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,508
around your baby... may I?
- Yeah.

800
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:43,075
While you wear a tampon.

801
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:45,773
Now, if your membrane
is still intact,

802
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:47,253
then the fluid
can't pass through,

803
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:50,256
and the tampon does
not change color.

804
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:53,694
But if your water is broken,
then the dye will pass through

805
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:55,261
and change the tampon blue.

806
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:58,003
Are you really not gonna
tell me anything about Sully?

807
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,092
It is more serious
than a cold, isn't it?

808
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:02,398
I can't share his private
health information.

809
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,139
Well, he's the
father of my child!

810
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:05,445
I know.

811
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:07,162
I knew that he was
hiding something from me.

812
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:08,990
Every time I told him to
get this cold checked out,

813
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,667
he just brushed me
off, and I knew it.

814
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:13,148
Why can't a man ever just
be straight with you?

815
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,325
How long? How long?

816
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,848
I promise you,
ortho is on the way.

817
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:19,043
That's what you
said 20 minutes ago!

818
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,479
- Jay, please.
- No, I'm out of here.

819
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,741
No, please. Just give me,
like, five more minutes.

820
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:23,178
- Stop. I'm done! I'm leaving.
- Just five.

821
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:25,900
So you can get back to work?

822
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,573
I gotta keep grinding,
keep pushing through.

823
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:29,469
Yeah, see, that's
what worries me.

824
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:31,732
What do you know about
art? This is my process!

825
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,864
Yeah, well, your process
landed you right here

826
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:35,344
in the hospital.

827
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:37,018
I mean, how long do you
think you can keep this up?

828
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:40,045
As long as I have to,
until I get a gallery,

829
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,830
until I prove to my
dad that I can do this.

830
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:44,397
I mean, look at...
look at history.

831
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,331
All the great artists, they
suffered for their work.

832
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:50,055
Look, this idea that
great art can only be born

833
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:55,016
from emotional chaos and
misery, it's just not true.

834
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:59,020
People like Renoir,
Vermeer, Hockney

835
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:03,024
by all accounts just, you know,
relatively well-adjusted people

836
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,809
whose names we know because
they were really talented

837
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,526
and they worked really hard.
- What about Van Gogh?

838
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:12,729
Van Gogh was a brilliant
painter, right, who, um,

839
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,689
by all accounts, sadly,
very likely suffered from

840
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:18,431
bipolar disorder well
before it was understood,

841
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:21,434
self-medicated with alcohol
until it didn't work anymore,

842
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:24,959
and blew his head off
when he was 37 years old.

843
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,225
Look, I really get how scary
this idea of changing up

844
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:31,879
your meds is right now to you.

845
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,185
But you gotta trust me, man.

846
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:35,796
It's, like, these...
these SSRIs,

847
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,755
they're not what's gonna
make you a successful artist.

848
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,062
It's your talent.

849
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:42,368
And I'm just really worried

850
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,283
that if you don't
make this change,

851
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,546
you're not going to
be around to share it.

852
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:55,207
Kidney just started
bleeding heavily.

853
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,488
Lac's bigger than the CT showed.

854
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:58,297
Damn it. Kidney's gotta go now.

855
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,602
Hey, Marty, where are we at?

856
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:01,909
Given six units and
she's maxed on pressors.

857
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,563
Temp is down to 34.5.

858
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:05,758
We're in damage control now.
Let's get this kidney out.

859
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:08,871
I'm on it.

860
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:09,936
If you need me to step in...

861
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Almost got it.

862
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:13,355
Don't have time for almost.

863
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,053
Metz.

864
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,271
Come on.

865
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:17,664
Get a tie on it. Let's go.

866
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,328
- Hey.
- Hey.

867
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:32,679
Okay, now you're taking this
pretty boy thing too far.

868
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,292
Yeah, not my usual threads.

869
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:39,077
I had to give a deposition.

870
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,730
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

871
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:44,212
Some... some guy
trying to sue me

872
00:34:44,255 --> 00:34:46,562
to make a quick buck
off of the hospital.

873
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:47,911
Sue you?

874
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,956
You want me to
straighten him out?

875
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,784
Nothing a phone
call won't solve.

876
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:53,612
Dude, chill.

877
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:55,658
It's not that deep.

878
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,573
Besides, you can't be
doing anything stupid.

879
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,967
You're about to be
a dad, remember?

880
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:04,363
So how long do you
plan to avoid Lynne?

881
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:08,628
Rip, I'm serious,
not with this again.

882
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:10,717
Look where you are
right now, man.

883
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:15,156
How the hell do you plan
on explaining this to her?

884
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,597
You remember my old man?

885
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,426
When he went off to the pen,

886
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,472
it was the happiest
day of my life.

887
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:30,650
All his drinking and
staying out late.

888
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,481
Now look at me.

889
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:38,092
Maybe Lynne and the kid
would be better off...

890
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,703
- Stop.
- Without me.

891
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:47,841
You are so much
better than your dad.

892
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:50,060
Hell, both of ours.

893
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:51,975
You're here, aren't you?

894
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,281
So what?

895
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:56,066
I get a gold star
for attendance?

896
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,460
What's wrong with that?

897
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:05,728
I know you wanna be
there for your kid too.

898
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:07,948
That's why.

899
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:10,124
That's why you
gotta get treatment.

900
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:21,048
I don't know, but
it sounds to me

901
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:24,182
like Jay could be open to
changing his medications.

902
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,748
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

903
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:28,098
Well, that's encouraging.

904
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:31,754
Honestly, I can kind
of relate to him,

905
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,974
not wanting to let
your parents down.

906
00:36:34,017 --> 00:36:36,019
Huh.

907
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:40,023
Well, I'm... I'm sure a lot
of people feel that way.

908
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:42,678
I think you're probably
right about that.

909
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:54,299
Glad to see Lynne's
doing better.

910
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:55,735
Yeah.

911
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:57,693
It turns out her water
didn't break after all.

912
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,149
The excess fluid was
from the cerclage,

913
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:02,263
and baby and mom are doing fine.

914
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,351
That's great to hear.

915
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,571
Mm-hmm.

916
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:08,487
Looks like he told
her about the cancer.

917
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,140
He did.

918
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:16,277
You know, Lynne told me a
few things about you too.

919
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:19,062
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

920
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,629
Like what?

921
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:24,546
Well, mainly that you had
questionable hair as a kid.

922
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:29,638
Hopefully, one day, you'll
tell me a little more.

923
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:36,819
I gotta get Sully
up to oncology.

924
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:42,564
Hey, um

925
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:45,611
thank you for today.

926
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:51,399
No problem, Rip.

927
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:02,758
Oh, hey.

928
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:04,456
I just saw Whitney.

929
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,762
She's got sensation returning
to both of her legs.

930
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,721
Cord injury is
incomplete. That's good.

931
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:11,027
Yeah, we should be able
to close her up tomorrow,

932
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:13,552
and then neurosurgery
can work up her spine.

933
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,293
Mm-hmm.

934
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:18,339
Well, I'm gonna complete
Whitney's surgery tomorrow.

935
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:19,775
You're off the case.

936
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:22,343
Whatever happened to
door to discharge?

937
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:23,736
All right, sit down.

938
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:24,954
Sit down before you keel over

939
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:26,652
in front of
everybody, all right?

940
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:32,135
Okay.

941
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:35,095
I know I may have overdone
it just a little bit.

942
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,749
But I never put my
patient at risk.

943
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,490
Oh, well, that's
a comfort, yeah.

944
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,492
She's alive and stable.

945
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:41,773
I mean, that's
the job, isn't it?

946
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:43,799
No... the job is to be
there for your patient

947
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:45,410
throughout their care.

948
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:47,455
You're the first one they
see when you get here

949
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:48,737
and the last when they go home.

950
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,153
That's trauma.

951
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,112
You saw all of your
patient's mile markers,

952
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:53,916
but you ignored your
own, and because of that,

953
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,463
you can't be there
for her tomorrow.

954
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:57,441
Okay, but I was just trying
to do right by Whitney.

955
00:38:57,465 --> 00:39:00,903
All right, look, I've
been where you are.

956
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:04,080
Yeah, the same
instincts, push through.

957
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:07,693
But this job, I mean, you
gotta know your limits.

958
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,524
All right, you're...
you're a competent surgeon.

959
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:15,004
May even be a good one.

960
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,658
But you want back on my service,

961
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:19,400
you get those ribs plated.

962
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:37,897
I, uh...

963
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,507
I heard that Sully got admitted.

964
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:40,900
He, uh... he all right?

965
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,380
Yeah. Yeah.

966
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:43,729
He's, uh... he's good.

967
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:46,732
He's stable.

968
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:48,057
I'm waiting for
him to get out of

969
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,735
Dr. Washington's
office, actually.

970
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,519
Oh, excellent. That's a relief.

971
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:52,563
Yeah.

972
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:59,397
So I just got done
talking with Ms. Goodwin.

973
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,748
Yeah?

974
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:05,403
She now seems to think that
the best option for everyone

975
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:09,668
is to settle the lawsuit
and not go to trial.

976
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:11,017
Huh.

977
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:21,549
Does she know about
my past... our past?

978
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:25,335
No, nothing.

979
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:26,728
But you said something to her,

980
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:28,730
didn't you, about settling?

981
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,087
You didn't have to do that.

982
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:39,480
I would've fought this case.

983
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:41,090
I know.

984
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:49,490
I just think that your
history belongs to you.

985
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,405
You know, I mean, that
is your story to tell.

986
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,756
And if you ever decide
that you wanna do that,

987
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,890
I would just hope that it
would be on your own terms.

988
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,503
That's all.
