1
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:07,287
<i>When I invited you
over to my apartment,</i>

2
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:09,594
I was thinking that
maybe we were...

3
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:10,836
Is this okay?

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,295
Sully, you with me?

5
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,471
Cancer's getting
worse, isn't it?

6
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,865
Maybe Lynne and the kid would
be better off without me.

7
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:23,173
Stop. You gotta get treatment.

8
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:25,305
<i>Alzheimer's is tricky to accept.</i>

9
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:28,482
I keep reminding myself of that.

10
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:30,441
I just wanna know what's
going to happen to me.

11
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:33,685
It's gonna be all right.

12
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:39,319
Take it easy. Watch your step.

13
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,017
You got him?

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,194
Yep? Okay.

15
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:47,936
Bert, are you okay?
Oh, my goodness.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,678
What? How is he?

17
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:52,985
Just mild inhalation
injuries, a bit confused.

18
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,508
We're gonna take him to
Med to get checked out,

19
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:56,075
but we don't think it's
anything too serious.

20
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:57,511
Okay.

21
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:59,383
Make sure the dog gets out.

22
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,341
Don't worry. I'll get it.

23
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,777
We didn't see a dog.

24
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,823
He doesn't have a dog.

25
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,086
What do we know about
how this happened?

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,870
Uh, the guy next
door saw the smoke.

27
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:10,829
By the time he got over here,
the stove top burner was on

28
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:12,874
and the kitchen had
gone up in flames.

29
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:15,007
So he did this?

30
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:16,206
Looks that way.

31
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:22,275
Ms. Goodwin, as a friend

32
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,190
in my years, I've been
on countless calls

33
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:26,236
involving forgetful older folks.

34
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,107
I don't think I need
to tell you this,

35
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:32,198
but we got pretty lucky here.

36
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,050
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:36,724
Hello, hello.

38
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:39,118
There he is. Today's
the day, my man.

39
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:40,554
It's really happening, huh?

40
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,252
Oh, yeah, donor team's
made the delivery.

41
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:43,905
Brand-new liver is all yours.

42
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,951
What do you say?
You ready, Colin?

43
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:48,171
Dad said I could have
all the ice cream I want

44
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,433
when I get to the recovery room.

45
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:50,956
Oh, did he now?

46
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,653
Within reason, of course.

47
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:54,568
Ice cream, huh? What's
your favorite flavor?

48
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:56,614
Mm, I think cookies and
cream is the best one.

49
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:58,877
Good choice.

50
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,575
So as discussed, the
liver's a perfect match,

51
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,925
but the donor is an adult.

52
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,188
It will work, right?

53
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,711
Yeah, after we do
a bit of resizing

54
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,278
on some of the
anatomy, absolutely.

55
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:09,714
I've already convened
the transplant committee

56
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:10,629
to review my plan.

57
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,151
Okay? It's merely a formality.

58
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,761
Hey, Colin, what do you say?

59
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:16,112
Get your pre-op labs
started and go from there?

60
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,939
Yes, sir. I'm ready.

61
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,028
- Okay, buddy. All right.
- Thank you, Doctor.

62
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:22,161
Yeah, you got it. I'll
see you later, all right?

63
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:23,336
- Dr. Marcel?
- Yeah.

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,817
It's Bert, Ms.
Goodwin's ex, incoming.

65
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,819
Hey, Zach, start
the boy's workup.

66
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,951
Yeah, you got it.

67
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,127
You're going to T4.

68
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,172
- What happened?
- Kitchen fire.

69
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:35,131
He inhaled a lot of smoke.

70
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,697
Hey, Violet, talk to me.

71
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,438
Some carbonaceous sputum but
no loss of consciousness.

72
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,441
15 liters of O2 on a face
mask, satting at 100%.

73
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:43,095
I told you I'm fine!

74
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,357
Hey, easy there, Bert.

75
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,838
We just wanna get you
checked out, buddy.

76
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,274
Nice and easy on my count.

77
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:50,146
Ready? One, two, three.

78
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,060
Easy, there you go.

79
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:53,279
Get him on the monitors, please.

80
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:54,826
Thanks, Violet.
- You got it.

81
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,981
All of us over at 51 have got
your back if you need anything.

82
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,854
- Thank you.
- You got it.

83
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,247
What happened?

84
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,857
Well, he got confused

85
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:10,122
and put an electric tea
kettle on the stove.

86
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:12,124
Take a deep breath for me, Bert.

87
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:15,171
There you go.

88
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,433
Okay, good.

89
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:18,435
Let me get a chest
X-ray in here.

90
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,827
Lungs are good.

91
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,655
Carboxyhemoglobin is down,
and he's satting fine.

92
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:24,180
I'm hopeful he escaped
any permanent damage.

93
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,791
Uh, Ms. Goodwin, we, uh

94
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,227
we got the transplant
committee meeting.

95
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,838
Oh, right. I totally forgot.

96
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,928
Yeah, I'd postpone, but
we've got the liver on ice.

97
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,321
- No, go.
- You guys, go.

98
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,844
I'll keep an eye on him.
- Okay.

99
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,194
Thanks, Dan. I'll see
you up there, okay?

100
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,958
Okay.

101
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:42,981
You all right?

102
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:45,897
I knew he was losing
a step, Daniel,

103
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:49,925
but I never imagined
anything like this.

104
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,571
Morning, Dean.

105
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:08,876
Uh, it was until

106
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,903
the albatross of med
student rotations.

107
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,187
Ah, there they go.

108
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:17,537
Seems the feeling's mutual.

109
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,017
Well, if they're avoiding me,

110
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,193
I must be doing something right.

111
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:24,742
Dr. Archer, you're up, and
you're going to Baghdad.

112
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,634
You don't scare me.

113
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:31,072
Donald Canter, 40 years
old. Severe chemical burn.

114
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,509
He was working with
some hydrochloric acid

115
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,206
when there was a spill.

116
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,991
- Oh. How bad are we talking?
- 90%-plus TBSA.

117
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,602
The burn unit doesn't
have any more beds,

118
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:42,345
so they're sending down one
of their nurses to run point.

119
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:43,413
It's not pretty.

120
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:50,222
Let's get him on a vent

121
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,248
and start calculating
his fluid requirements.

122
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,445
- Jackie?
- Hey.

123
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:56,924
Didn't you work last night?

124
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:57,883
Well, we're still shorthanded,

125
00:04:57,907 --> 00:04:59,405
so I picked up a double.

126
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,493
All right.

127
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:01,886
Dr. Archer, this
is Nurse Nelson,

128
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,322
Jackie, from the burn unit.

129
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:04,671
All right, working
on his fluids,

130
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,500
and we'll get in orders
for sedation and pain.

131
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,372
All right, infection
risk is sky-high,

132
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:12,070
so let's all get
into protective gear.

133
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:14,377
Wait. What is this?

134
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,359
Does the patient have
any more injuries?

135
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,320
Not that I could see.

136
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:25,866
- Jackie.
- Damn.

137
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,825
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I...

138
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,566
I caught my arm
on the door frame

139
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,784
as I was leaving the house.

140
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,090
The Band-Aid must
have fallen off.

141
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,483
I'll just... I'll
get another one.

142
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,833
- Want me to take a look?
- No, no, no, I'm fine.

143
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,095
Maggie, I'm fine.

144
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,817
- Okay.
- It's all right.

145
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,493
Nicely done.

146
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,233
I'll give Colin and
Bill the good news.

147
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,932
- All right.
- Okay.

148
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:50,543
Resize using a split-segment?

149
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,153
Seems like a bit of a leap,

150
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,025
even for a cowboy
like you, Marcel.

151
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:55,983
Yeah, well, I've done it before

152
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,942
and have no doubt the
boy's vessels are adequate.

153
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,770
If you're wrong,
you'll fry the liver

154
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,816
before he even
walks out the door.

155
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,296
And you can explain that

156
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,496
to the next patient on the
list who was passed over.

157
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:12,522
Well, as you know,

158
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:15,263
we're dealing with a
non-small cell lung cancer.

159
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,788
Plan is to shrink the
tumor before surgery.

160
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,180
We start with chemo today,

161
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:21,618
six infusions over the
course of six weeks.

162
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:23,054
Then we'll reevaluate.

163
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:24,664
It sounds like a
walk in the park.

164
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:27,972
Just try to relax.

165
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:28,973
I'll be back shortly.

166
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:30,259
Thank you, Dr. Washington.

167
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:42,029
Rip, baby on the way.

168
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,596
Tell me I didn't wait too long.

169
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,424
Hey, you're here now.

170
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,993
At least I'm not
the only dumb one.

171
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,212
What's your problem, anyway?

172
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:53,282
- What are you talking about?
- Asher.

173
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,174
I thought you two
were going out.

174
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:59,307
I don't know. We're colleagues.

175
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,308
Exactly.

176
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,702
She's a doctor, you're a doctor.

177
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,661
She doesn't know about

178
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:09,274
how I grew up, juvie,
my psych diagnosis.

179
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:11,189
Look, I can't imagine she'd
find that very attractive.

180
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,409
As much as I pee these days,

181
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,323
might as well live
in the bathroom.

182
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,499
So you get to the bottom of it?

183
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,326
Trying.

184
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,458
What's the matter with you, Rip?

185
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,634
She's a doctor, you're a doctor.

186
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,463
Ah, I see you guys
planned this ambush.

187
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,488
Well...

188
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,077
Oh! I... I felt a gush.

189
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:33,341
Um, maybe my water broke?

190
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:34,604
Yeah.

191
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,083
We've gotta get
you down to Hannah.

192
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:37,694
I'll take her. You're
not going anywhere.

193
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,086
Just sit down.

194
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,699
Just... just take
good care of her.

195
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,072
- Yeah.
- I got this.

196
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,883
Carboxyhemoglobin is improved.

197
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,362
Oh, thank goodness.

198
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:56,060
And Maggie wanted me to tell you

199
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:59,237
that room is his as
long as he needs it.

200
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:02,240
So what are you thinking?

201
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:03,807
Tara has offered to take him in,

202
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:07,071
but with the toddler, I... I
don't think that's happening.

203
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,639
David lives out of state.
Michael travels too much.

204
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:12,946
And to be honest, even if I
thought they could handle it,

205
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,601
I don't want to
burden them with this.

206
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,168
Just for the record,
old buddy of mine

207
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,517
runs a memory care
unit in Cook County.

208
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,693
I can't.

209
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:23,914
I'm sorry, I just haven't
had a second to think.

210
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,916
I get it.

211
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,942
Thank you.

212
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,577
You say a door frame did this?

213
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,274
I know. It's crazy.

214
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,797
I've been trying to get Carl
to replace the strike plate

215
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,277
for weeks now, but...

216
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,192
How is Carl? I haven't
seen him forever.

217
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,976
He's... uh, uh, yeah,

218
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,412
he's... he's doing...
he's g... he's okay.

219
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,414
He's still out of work.
- I'm sorry.

220
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:47,764
Yeah.

221
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,331
He had a thing lined up,
but, uh, it fell through.

222
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,508
And honestly, I just...

223
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,639
I try not to talk
to him about it

224
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,535
because he's always
in such a mood.

225
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,300
Uh, you know what, Maggie?
Thank you for the patch-up.

226
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:03,823
I... I gotta get
back to my patient.

227
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:04,782
- All right.
- Thank you.

228
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:06,023
Okay.

229
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:11,309
Hey, Colin.

230
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,571
How you doing, bud?

231
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,269
- I'm doing all right.
- Yeah?

232
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:17,489
Everything okay?

233
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,056
Yeah, Colin's white
blood cell count

234
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,058
came back as elevated.

235
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:23,756
And he appears to
have a slight fever.

236
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,931
What does that mean?

237
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,585
It seems he's
developed an infection.

238
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,456
I-infection from what?

239
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,284
Yeah, that's what we
need to determine.

240
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:31,982
Hey, Colin, have you
noticed a sore throat

241
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:34,114
or a cough by any chance?

242
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:35,681
Mm, not really.

243
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,379
Yeah, any pain or
discomfort anywhere?

244
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:41,165
Mm, nothing besides my toe.

245
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:42,688
Your toe?

246
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:45,082
He stubbed his toe on a
dresser a couple of weeks ago,

247
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:47,282
took off some skin.

248
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,025
- Nail's ingrown.
- Uh-huh.

249
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,831
Some bacteria must've gotten
trapped under the cuticle.

250
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:57,094
Is this... is this
gonna cause a problem?

251
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,139
You know, with his transplant?

252
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,358
Yeah, in some cases,

253
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:02,882
an infection can
impact eligibility,

254
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:05,145
but I don't see anything
here to worry about.

255
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,104
We'll get him started
on IV antibiotics,

256
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,193
and as soon as his fever breaks,

257
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,629
we'll get him back up
to the OR as planned.

258
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:13,327
That is, if you're
still up for it, Colin?

259
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,373
I'm ready. Okay, good.

260
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:16,896
All right, we'll get
those antibiotics going

261
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,464
and check in soon.

262
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,771
Pound. I'll see you, okay?

263
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:24,774
All right, let's start with
2 grams cefazolin, please.

264
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,210
Excuse me, Dr. Marcel?

265
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,865
- Yeah.
- Sorry. Um, I, uh...

266
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,476
I... I appreciate you putting
on a brave face for Colin.

267
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,610
But are... are you sure
there's nothing to worry about?

268
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,524
Look, Bill, I know how
you must be feeling,

269
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,875
especially since we've seen
Colin get passed over before.

270
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,834
If he doesn't get this liver,

271
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,836
I'm afraid he won't
be here long enough

272
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,882
to get the next one.

273
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:48,493
I'm gonna make sure your
boy gets that liver.

274
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,713
All right?
- Thank you.

275
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,042
Okay.

276
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:03,073
Dr. Charles, you have a moment?

277
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:04,335
What's up?

278
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,554
Do you remember Jackie
from the burn unit?

279
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:09,557
Yeah, she's in Baghdad
today with overflow, right?

280
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:12,343
Yeah, she showed up with a
cut on her arm this morning

281
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:15,041
and had some story that
didn't really add up to much.

282
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:18,958
And when I pressed her on it,
she insisted that she was fine.

283
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh.

284
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:21,657
She's been working a
ton of double shifts,

285
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,919
and I know that her
husband's been through a lot.

286
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:25,138
She's been so
distant these days.

287
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:30,448
There's just something
that feels off.

288
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:31,710
Are you worried about abuse?

289
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,407
I don't know.

290
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,540
The last thing I wanna do is to
sound the alarm unnecessarily.

291
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,716
Then let me see if I can
come up with an excuse

292
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,893
to, you know, sidle up
to her and check in.

293
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,503
- Thank you.
- Of course.

294
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:43,920
Yeah.

295
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:53,297
Okay, are you having any
pain or contractions?

296
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,559
No.

297
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,561
I mean, I don't think so.

298
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:59,129
To be honest, with Sully,
I've been a little distracted.

299
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:01,087
I get it. You've got
a lot on your plate.

300
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,915
Um, I'd like to check you out.

301
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:03,916
I'll give you some privacy.

302
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,918
No, can you stay?

303
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,833
Sully can't be here.

304
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:10,793
- Yeah.
- Great.

305
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,925
Okay, a little bit of pressure.

306
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,622
Yeah.

307
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,450
All right, well

308
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:17,800
the good news is,

309
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,193
is that your cervical
stitch is still in place,

310
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:24,676
but that gush that you felt was
definitely your water breaking.

311
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,591
Wait. Are you sure?

312
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:29,028
'Cause we thought that last
week, and I just had a UTI.

313
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,552
I see free flow, which
means the amniotic fluid

314
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:35,165
is gushing from your cervix,
and the blue confirms it.

315
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:38,516
So I'm... I'm in labor?

316
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,213
No, thankfully.

317
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:42,825
Your cervix does not
look effaced or dilated,

318
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,479
and we wanna keep it that
way for as long as possible.

319
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,960
So I will give you steroids to
help develop the baby's lungs

320
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:50,006
and magnesium to
protect his brain,

321
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,790
but we will need to admit you.

322
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,749
No, I can't.

323
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,011
I... I have to go
look after Sully.

324
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,752
Don't worry. I got him.

325
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,492
In fact, I told him
I'd keep him updated.

326
00:12:58,516 --> 00:12:59,972
No.

327
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,714
I don't want anything to
interrupt his treatments.

328
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:06,152
Okay, try and get some rest.
We'll check back on you soon.

329
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,309
Great.

330
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,245
What was Colin's last temp?

331
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,681
100.5.

332
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:14,726
We're already hitting it

333
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,075
with a high dose of antibiotics.

334
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,990
Dr. Morris is working
with the donor team.

335
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,600
They're asking what
we're going to do.

336
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:20,819
Nothing.

337
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,908
I told you, I'm...
I'm... I'm handling it.

338
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,170
Well, I don't doubt that,

339
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:26,042
but the liver's already
been supercooled

340
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,826
for close to 20 hours.

341
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,480
If we release it now,

342
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:32,309
we still have time for
it to help someone else.

343
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,181
There's gotta be
something that we can do.

344
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,661
All right, let me
talk to Morris.

345
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,706
I think there might be a
way to buy some more time.

346
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,080
Okay.

347
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:46,366
Hey, Jackie.

348
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,411
Dr. Charles.

349
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,629
I was just wondering,

350
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:51,676
do you have any kind
of ETA on the, um

351
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,267
on the patient's wife?

352
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,644
ETA?

353
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,298
Do you have any idea when the
patient's wife is getting here?

354
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:07,518
I just wanna make sure
that I'm here as well.

355
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:12,349
Oh, um, uh, maybe an hour.

356
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:16,266
So, uh, how you
been? You all right?

357
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,769
I'm fine.

358
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,627
- Here.
- Thank you.

359
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:33,500
Hey. So what do you think?

360
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:35,981
- Distant.
- Right.

361
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:39,463
Definitely. I mean,
barely there, right?

362
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:43,119
I mean I would say,
like, almost numb.

363
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,599
Which arm did you say
that the cut was on?

364
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,688
Um, the left one.

365
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:49,168
Right.

366
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,562
I thought I saw her pressing
on it before I left.

367
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:52,824
Really?

368
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,391
When you were bandaging her up,

369
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:57,437
did you notice any other
wounds or injuries on her arm?

370
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,135
No.

371
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,093
The thing is, like, cutting,
not necessarily the first thing

372
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,966
we see with abuse, right?

373
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,968
Cuts can, of course,
be self-inflicted.

374
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,796
Wait, you mean like, self-harm?

375
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,538
It... it... it kind of fits.

376
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,976
Yeah, but we're
talking about Jackie.

377
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,630
She's a powerhouse. She's
been in Med for years.

378
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:17,805
I...

379
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:18,937
I did my certification with her.

380
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,461
The burn unit is brutal.

381
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,420
I mean, every day, she's
taking care of people

382
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:26,989
who are in excruciating,
horrific pain.

383
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,599
Who wouldn't shut
down after a while?

384
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,775
You're saying that
she's cutting herself

385
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,124
to feel something?

386
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,604
Well, in her case,

387
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:37,110
it would be more like
distracting herself.

388
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,003
Okay, let's just assume
that you're right.

389
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,439
What do we do?

390
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,702
Well, I mean ideally,
we get her to open up.

391
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,399
And based on the evidence,

392
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:48,271
she's not that interested
in talking to me,

393
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:52,275
but a fellow nurse, friend,
could be a different story.

394
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,040
Yeah.

395
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:02,938
Can I help you?

396
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,113
Uh, sorry.

397
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,505
Don't mean to bother
you, Dr. Archer.

398
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,029
But I was just trying to
get a feel for the day.

399
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,987
And anyway, um,

400
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,989
treatment to Mr. Manofsky,

401
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:14,166
unexplained weakness,
B12 deficiency.

402
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,386
He recently just had
a dental procedure.

403
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,996
Perhaps the two
could be connected

404
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,520
if he has undiagnosed
pernicious anemia.

405
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:23,001
Huh.

406
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,743
All right, and how would
we test your theory?

407
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,658
We could check his homocysteine

408
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,703
and methylmalonic acid levels.

409
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:32,010
Dr. Archer, I need
you in treatment five.

410
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,099
His name is Paul
Talbot, 42 years old,

411
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:36,493
septic from kidney stones,
needs to be intubated.

412
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,277
All right, thank
you. Do me a favor.

413
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,845
Have the lab run an MMA on
our guy in treatment two.

414
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:41,889
You got it.

415
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,021
You're with me. Let's go.

416
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,631
Oh, wow. Oh, okay.

417
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:45,806
Thank you!

418
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,025
I've been so excited
for this rotation.

419
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,374
I'm a little nervous.

420
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,462
Yeah, I don't need
your life story.

421
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:52,639
Just keep up with
me and do as I say.

422
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,448
Meds are in.

423
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:58,906
All right, slugger.

424
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,604
You're up.

425
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:01,997
Me?

426
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,476
Well, I already
know how to do it.

427
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,980
Oh.

428
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,059
- Any day now.
- Right, okay.

429
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,043
He's desaturating.

430
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,588
Okay, you think maybe
you wanna get this done

431
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,242
before he suffocates?

432
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:34,420
Okay, sats are
down to 85, 84, 82.

433
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,639
He's starting to Brady down.
- Get out of here.

434
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,075
That's it. You're out.
- Wait. No, it's...

435
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,970
No, no, you're out.
That's it. Stop. Out.

436
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,412
All right, I'm in. Bag him.

437
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,415
Tough day?

438
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,025
Me? No.

439
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,201
I'm okay.

440
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,270
What happened?

441
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:22,207
That's the thing.
I'm... I'm not sure.

442
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,427
I mean, I know what
I'm supposed to do.

443
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:28,822
But before I could
even move, I just...

444
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:32,261
I start to doubt myself and
I worry about the patient.

445
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,784
I just freeze.

446
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:37,701
And you get a little
criticism from your boss.

447
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:41,574
Yeah. He kicked me
out of the room.

448
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,750
But he's right.

449
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,578
I screw everything up.

450
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:48,997
Look, this is your
first time in the ED.

451
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,697
It's a hard rotation for anyone.

452
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,461
It's gonna be okay.

453
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:00,289
Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

454
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:01,705
Chin up.

455
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,515
Dr. Archer.

456
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,909
Ah, Ms. Goodwin. I
heard about Bert.

457
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,432
I'm sorry.

458
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,576
Thank you, but we need to
talk about your med student.

459
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,307
Oh.

460
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:19,569
I...

461
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,832
the kid froze up, and
I called her on it.

462
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,486
It's not my fault
she's fallen to pieces.

463
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,009
Have you given any thought

464
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:27,185
of the pressure this
young lady is under?

465
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,665
I'm not here to
be her therapist.

466
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:30,667
I'm here to make
her into a doctor.

467
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,234
Well, she can't do that

468
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,845
if you make her regret she
ever went to medical school.

469
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,977
This is a teaching hospital.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,850
Dr. Archer, our
job is to nurture,

471
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,113
not to cull the herd.

472
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:45,203
Okay.

473
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,205
Excuse me.

474
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,251
My name is Joan Canter.

475
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:51,862
I'm looking for my
husband, Donald.

476
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,429
I'm Dan Charles and
this is Maggie Lockwood.

477
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:55,822
We've been helping to
take care of your husband.

478
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,868
Maggie is gonna take you in
to see him in just a sec,

479
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,348
but I just wanna prepare you.

480
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,219
His burns are severe.

481
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,526
He's on pain medication
and he's sedated,

482
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,050
but you can sit with him

483
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:10,097
and talk to him and let
him know that you're here.

484
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,317
- Ah!
- Okay, okay. Hey, hey.

485
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:13,579
Hey, what happened?

486
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:14,624
It's his toe. He just
started screaming.

487
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,234
Oh, God.

488
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,757
Looks like there's some
pus underneath the cuticle.

489
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:20,064
Give me a hemostat and
some ethyl chloride.

490
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:22,240
Can you put on your
brave face for me, Colin?

491
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,591
We're gonna get you
fixed up now, okay?

492
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,158
- Ow.
- It's okay, it's okay.

493
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,464
We're gonna do a
little numbing agent

494
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:30,074
on your... on your toe, okay?

495
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,250
It's gonna take the pain away.

496
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,512
Okay, that's good.

497
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,645
We're gonna relieve the
pressure, all right?

498
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,255
Take a deep breath
for me now, okay?

499
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,412
All right, it's gonna
all be over in a second.

500
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,829
There you go. You're
doing great, bud.

501
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,265
Just like that.

502
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,311
Almost there.

503
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,400
There you go.

504
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:54,359
Okay.

505
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,927
How's that? That feel better?

506
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:59,258
Yeah. Yeah? Good.

507
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,543
All right. Okay.

508
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,916
You did so good.

509
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,507
Dr. Asher, we need you.

510
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,943
- What happened?
- I don't know.

511
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,796
There's a pain in my belly
moving around to my back.

512
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:18,949
Squeeze my hand.

513
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,124
Okay Lynne, those pains

514
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,256
that you're feeling
are contractions.

515
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,692
You're in labor. I'd
like to take a look.

516
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,520
Yeah, but I'm only 30 weeks.

517
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:25,956
I know.

518
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,088
Just breathe. Breathe.

519
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:30,613
Okay, we've held off
as long as we could.

520
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,789
But you are dilated.

521
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:34,312
The stitch is beginning
to tear your cervix.

522
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,835
We need to remove it.

523
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,576
- Should I call up L&D?
- No, there's no time.

524
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,969
Let's get her to the hybrid OR.

525
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,014
No, I can't. My baby
needs more time.

526
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,451
Lynne, listen to me,
you're already bleeding.

527
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:43,669
If I don't remove that stitch,

528
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,323
the contractions are
gonna push the baby,

529
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,585
but he has nowhere to go.

530
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:47,760
It could tear your cervix

531
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:50,570
or also cause your
uterus to rupture.

532
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,942
Oh, my God.

533
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:59,511
No!

534
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:02,122
- What happened?
- He coded.

535
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,907
Was down ten minutes,
three rounds of epi.

536
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,324
Nothing we could do.

537
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:10,957
Oh, my God.

538
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,742
Mrs. Canter, I'm so
sorry. Sit over here.

539
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,786
Mags, can you get her
a bottle of water?

540
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,136
Yes.

541
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,747
- Here.
- Don, no!

542
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,140
Why don't you come
sit down over here?

543
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:21,099
No!

544
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:23,579
I got you, I got you.

545
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:26,364
No!

546
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,521
I'm so sorry.

547
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,444
Jackie?

548
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,365
Jackie, are you okay?

549
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,196
Jackie?

550
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,046
Jackie?

551
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,289
Oh, Jackie?

552
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:07,821
Oh, sweetie.

553
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:12,129
We need some help in here!

554
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:22,986
Hey, what the hell is this?

555
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,292
- She's in labor.
- Why didn't you come get me?

556
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,164
Shut up, Sully! I
told them not to.

557
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:30,341
I need to cut the stitch,
but I can't see anything.

558
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:31,690
It's too bloody. Sponge stick.

559
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:33,039
S-she's bleeding? What the hell?

560
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:34,389
What's happening to her?

561
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,520
Little help here, Mitch.

562
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,522
Oh, God.

563
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:41,681
Sit down, shut up,
and hold her hand.

564
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:45,922
Hey, hey, hey.

565
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,861
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

566
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,889
How's she doing?

567
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,587
She's stable, woozy.

568
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:00,806
She's, um, taking the fluids,

569
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,896
but she's already talking
about going back to work.

570
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,420
Oh, man.

571
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,813
So no mention of what... what
happened in the bathroom?

572
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:08,945
Nothing.

573
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:10,337
- Yeah, well...
- She's so defensive.

574
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,469
That's the denial.

575
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,992
What do we do?

576
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:14,690
Mags, there's a whole lot
of help for her out there,

577
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:15,908
but it just works so much better

578
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:18,302
if we can get her
to ask for it, okay?

579
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:20,565
So I say that we let
the IV do its work

580
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,828
and then maybe 15 minutes or so,

581
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:25,091
go in there and... and
have a chat with her.

582
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:27,466
Yeah.

583
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:34,797
Hey, Daniel, there's a bed in
the convalescent ward for Bert.

584
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:38,670
I'm gonna head up to see how
soon I can get him in there.

585
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:40,629
- Keep me posted?
- Yeah.

586
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,457
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

587
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,415
- Whoa.
- Come here, come here.

588
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:45,503
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

589
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:46,896
You have anything to eat today?

590
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,811
You're a diabetic, all right?

591
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,029
- Yeah.
- Not a good idea.

592
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:51,378
Excuse me.

593
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:52,597
Can you get Ms. Goodwin
orange juice, please?

594
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:54,294
I've got so much to do.

595
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,557
Right, and you're
gonna get to it.

596
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,123
But first, we're
just gonna sit here

597
00:24:57,147 --> 00:25:00,150
until we stabilize
your blood sugar, okay?

598
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,174
In through your nose and out.

599
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:05,478
- How's the head?
- I can see it.

600
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,419
Done. Stitch is out.

601
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:12,356
Okay, Lynne, you
are fully dilated.

602
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,314
I need you to give
me a big push, okay?

603
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:15,533
You're about to meet your baby.

604
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,993
- Okay.
- Here we go.

605
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,625
That's good. I see the head!

606
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:23,043
Okay, one more big
push, one more big push.

607
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,065
There we go. He's out.

608
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,351
I got him.

609
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,117
Shouldn't he be crying?

610
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:36,032
Huh? What?

611
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:38,382
- He's not breathing.
- Oh, God, no.

612
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,514
No, no, no.
- Do something.

613
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,645
Okay, start compressions.

614
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,995
We need a tube and surfactant.

615
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:44,519
No.

616
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,737
No, no.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.

617
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,173
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

618
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:48,088
Hey, hey. It's gonna be okay.

619
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:49,175
No, no, no.

620
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,394
Oh, my God.

621
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:51,743
No, what's happening?

622
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,943
What's happening? Is he okay?

623
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:57,207
Surfactant.

624
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:07,193
Please. Please, please, please.

625
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:08,217
Meds are in.

626
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,049
Come on.

627
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:17,116
Oh!

628
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,055
He's good.

629
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,909
We're parents. You did it.

630
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:30,632
You did it, baby.
- Thank you, thank you.

631
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:51,610
So what, you're just gonna
hide in here all day?

632
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,590
I didn't think you'd want
me back on the floor.

633
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,592
Well, you're no use to me

634
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,855
with your nose buried in a book.

635
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,727
I know, I'm... I'm
sorry. I was just...

636
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:05,556
I-I'm sorry. Never mind.

637
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,253
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, that's okay.

638
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,994
Go ahead. Tell me.

639
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:11,910
I, uh, I wanna hear.

640
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:14,086
It's just...

641
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,853
I'm so afraid that I'm
gonna do something wrong.

642
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:22,834
I'm the first one in my
family to go to college.

643
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,620
My parents took out loans.

644
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,186
They've sacrificed so much.

645
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,125
And you're afraid
you'll let them down.

646
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:37,501
Well, look, if I were to judge
you solely on your smarts,

647
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,591
I'd say you're gonna
be a good doctor.

648
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:45,465
It was the inaction
that is the problem.

649
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:47,685
What was it Gretzky once said?

650
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:51,689
You miss 100% of the
shots you don't take.

651
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,778
Who's Gretzky?

652
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,650
Who's Gre...

653
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,131
Never mind. The point
is, you're a student,

654
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,090
and mistakes come
with the territory.

655
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,788
And that's why the other
doctors and I are here,

656
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:06,573
to keep you from

657
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:09,446
killing someone.

658
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,342
But you've gotta
take those shots.

659
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:21,700
100.3.

660
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:27,227
Okay.

661
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:34,384
Hey, Bill, listen.

662
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,323
Temp's gonna break soon, okay?

663
00:28:38,804 --> 00:28:41,086
I'm not giving up.

664
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,958
All right?

665
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:45,961
- Okay.
- All right.

666
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:48,311
Thank you.

667
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,182
- Hey.
- Hey.

668
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:51,314
How's the boy?

669
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:52,881
Yeah, fever's
starting to plateau.

670
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:55,361
Well, unfortunately,
we're out of time.

671
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,972
I just spoke with Dr. Morris.

672
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:59,583
He's convening the
transplant committee.

673
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:02,218
He's insisting we
release the liver.

674
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,598
- Are you feeling any better?
- Yeah.

675
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:17,209
Can we, uh, can we
wrap this up now?

676
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:20,082
Yeah, um, you do realize
that you fainted?

677
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:21,257
I know.

678
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,867
Yeah, I've... I've
been really run-down,

679
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,782
you know, with my
diet and my schedule.

680
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,741
You of all people, you
should know about this.

681
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,438
Yeah, but you were bleeding.

682
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,701
I know, my... my cut from this
morning, it must have reopened.

683
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:32,945
Yeah, I saw the other cuts.

684
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:38,317
I don't know what you think
you saw, but I'm fine.

685
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:39,797
Jacks, I saw the other cuts.

686
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:44,802
And I think that you're
doing it to yourself.

687
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,325
All right, well, I'm
done talking about this.

688
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,850
Jackie, the only reason
we're here, we're just

689
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,373
we're worried about you.

690
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:52,070
So you put him up to this?

691
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:54,420
Jacks, because we are friends
and because I care about you.

692
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,857
That's why we're here.

693
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,796
Jackie, can I, um...

694
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:03,342
From my perspective,

695
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:04,996
I don't know how you do it,

696
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,607
the extraordinarily difficult
things that you're faced with

697
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:11,960
every day, the pressure you
must feel to keep it together.

698
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:13,352
You know, no wonder
you're looking for a way

699
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:17,269
to deal with all that pain
that you have to absorb.

700
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:19,271
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

701
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:21,273
The reason that Maggie and
I are so concerned about you

702
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:23,841
is that the coping
mechanism that you developed

703
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,670
has brought you to a
very dangerous place.

704
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:28,498
We can do this however
you wanna do it.

705
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:31,240
Like, we can just talk about
a little paid time off.

706
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,198
Nothing has to go
on your record.

707
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:35,461
How dare you, you
condescending prick.

708
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:36,811
You're gonna sit there

709
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,856
and you're gonna tell me
what's inside my head?

710
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,380
And you're gonna threaten
my job in the process?

711
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:43,774
I don't need your help.

712
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:45,254
I'm going.

713
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:46,603
Look, I'm sorry.

714
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:47,865
I'm sorry, Jackie. I...
I can't let you do that.

715
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,301
Jackie, Jackie.
- What? What?

716
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:50,781
I have determined that

717
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,261
you are a significant
danger to yourself

718
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,741
and I have no choice but
to hold you for 72 hours.

719
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,656
What?
- I'm... I'm very sorry.

720
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,919
- Jacks...
- No, no, no, no.

721
00:30:57,943 --> 00:30:58,963
You can't... you can't do that.

722
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,225
Jacks, you know it's true.

723
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,879
- No.
- Jackie, you know it's true.

724
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,576
- You can't do this to me.
- You know it's true!

725
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,926
Hold her.
- No, come on, guys.

726
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,450
No, get off... get
off me. Maggie.

727
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:08,625
Maggie!

728
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:10,932
- Jacks!
- Get off me. Get... stop it!

729
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,237
- Jacks!
- Maggie!

730
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,916
Maggie! You can't do this to me!

731
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:20,506
He has a fever. The
infection is systemic.

732
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,856
With a new liver,

733
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,099
his body will be strong
enough to fight it off.

734
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:28,166
You're wasting
everyone's time, Marcel.

735
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,864
We have another
candidate lined up,

736
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,213
and you refuse to acknowledge

737
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,171
that your patient is no
longer a viable option.

738
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:34,694
Colin won't survive
without this liver.

739
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:35,913
You understand that?

740
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,721
He very well may
not survive with it.

741
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:43,510
We're talking about a
young boy here, Justin.

742
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:48,360
He's got his whole
life ahead of him.

743
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:50,754
It's tragic.

744
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:53,017
But

745
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,977
it doesn't change the facts.

746
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,327
I'd like to know if anyone
else in the committee

747
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:59,787
has something to add.

748
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:06,422
Given that there is no consensus

749
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:08,554
and the liver has
already been allocated

750
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:11,949
to Dr. Marcel's patient,

751
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:15,474
the decision is yours
to make, Dr. Marcel.

752
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:19,720
Why did we even
bother with this?

753
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,410
So what'd they say?

754
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:40,480
What? Can the
surgery go forward?

755
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,897
Oh, my God.

756
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,420
Uh, wait.

757
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:51,989
No, no, you... you
have to go back.

758
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,034
You have to go back.

759
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,209
Bill.

760
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,601
You... you... you
have to go back.

761
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:56,646
You have to explain to
them that he needs this.

762
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,908
He won't survive without it.

763
00:32:57,932 --> 00:32:59,910
Bill.

764
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,980
I made the call.

765
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:08,049
What?

766
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,486
Why?

767
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,836
His infection, fever.

768
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,229
No, no, no, no.

769
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,492
He's not strong enough, Bill.

770
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:18,102
He won't survive the surgery.

771
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:19,147
You promised me.

772
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:21,497
You... you... you... you

773
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:23,412
you... there, you told
me, you promised me.

774
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:25,307
You said you could save him.

775
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,789
You said that.

776
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:31,835
I thought I could.

777
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,773
I'm so sorry, man.

778
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:39,471
You... you...

779
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,410
I'm sorry.

780
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:50,265
Lungs look good,
oxygenating well.

781
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:51,788
He'll be in the NICU
for a little bit,

782
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:54,965
but you have a strong
and healthy baby boy.

783
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:57,035
I've never seen
anything more perfect.

784
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:00,971
Okay, let's get you back.

785
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:04,583
You need to rest and
take care of yourself.

786
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,107
I'm gonna stay a little longer.

787
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:08,022
Okay.

788
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,004
Never too early to
teach him a right hook.

789
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,991
Hannah was incredible today.

790
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,819
Yeah. Yeah, she was.

791
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,671
You weren't so bad yourself.

792
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:31,219
Look, Rip, maybe becoming
a dad has made me soft,

793
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:34,091
but

794
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:38,356
you're not that kid anymore.

795
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,575
I mean, part of
him's still in there,

796
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,514
kicking my ass
whenever I need it.

797
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:48,062
All that juvie and psych
stuff, none of that matters.

798
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,803
Look at what you did.

799
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:52,742
You're a freaking superhero.

800
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,833
Hannah should be so lucky.

801
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:07,081
Excuse me, Dr. Archer?

802
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,473
Yeah.

803
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:11,041
There's a patient in
T7, headaches, nausea.

804
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:14,305
Her symptoms could point to
meningitis of unknown origin.

805
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:16,046
And?

806
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,552
I think we start with
a lumbar puncture.

807
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:22,400
Well, it makes sense.

808
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:23,967
Do you know how to do an LP?

809
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:26,733
No, but I was hoping
you'd show me.

810
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,627
Lumbar puncture.

811
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:34,325
Step one, position the patient
on their side, knees to chest.

812
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:37,241
Step two, place your thumbs
mid line to the spine.

813
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,416
Go away. Leave me alone!

814
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,722
Mister, can you
please calm down?

815
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:41,463
We're just taking you
to a different room.

816
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:42,986
No!

817
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,814
No, no, leave me alone! Go away!

818
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:46,381
Hey, shh, shh. What happened?

819
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:47,991
I'm not sure.

820
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:49,775
We were starting to transfer
him to the convalescent floor,

821
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:51,516
and he got really agitated.

822
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,779
Bert, look at me.

823
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:57,087
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

824
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:58,349
- Sharon!
- Yes.

825
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,960
Shh. Yes, it's Sharon.

826
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:02,658
I'm here.

827
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:05,182
- Sharon.
- Yes.

828
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:07,053
I want you to take me home.

829
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:08,620
Okay. Take me home.

830
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:10,579
All right. I'm here.

831
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:13,103
Okay, okay, okay.

832
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:15,627
Sit down for me.

833
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:18,239
Sit down. Sit down.

834
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:19,283
Sit down.

835
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:21,155
Take...

836
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,331
Take... take me home.

837
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:25,071
I will.

838
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:26,160
Take me home.

839
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,118
I will, okay?

840
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:30,207
Yeah? Okay.

841
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,035
- Okay.
- Okay.

842
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,191
Yeah.

843
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,684
Jackie?

844
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:56,015
Jackie, can I...

845
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,258
Yeah.

846
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:06,833
I'm sorry you've been
put into this situation.

847
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:15,233
The only thing we wanna
do is to help you.

848
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,939
I'm so tired.

849
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,553
So tired.

850
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:40,562
Thank you.

851
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,614
Yeah.

852
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:04,736
I... I thought that...

853
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,868
I thought he's going upstairs.

854
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:08,000
He's coming home with me.

855
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,045
Really?

856
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,525
Yeah, he, uh

857
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:12,135
he started sundowning, Daniel.

858
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,007
He got scared
and... and confused,

859
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:17,532
and I was the only one
who could calm him down.

860
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:18,707
Okay, okay.

861
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:21,710
But, um, what about you?

862
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:22,754
What about... what
about your job?

863
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:24,060
What about your life?

864
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:26,236
Well, you know, I'll
get a caregiver,

865
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,915
someone who could be
with him when I'm not.

866
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,242
I hope I don't need to tell you

867
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:35,289
this is not a long-term
solution, okay?

868
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,444
I'll manage.

869
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,386
Thank you, Jonas.

870
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,628
All set?

871
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:52,916
Asher.

872
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,854
- Hmm? Oh.
- Wait up.

873
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,574
How's Lynne?
- Uh, resting.

874
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:01,402
How about Sully?

875
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:04,013
Over the moon.

876
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:05,536
You were great today.

877
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,104
I think you got fans for life.

878
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,975
You know, it is easy to imagine

879
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:13,022
you and Sully getting
up to no good.

880
00:39:13,046 --> 00:39:17,006
Yeah, well, how much no
good might surprise you.

881
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,030
Look

882
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:25,469
the truth is, I
was an angry kid.

883
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:30,126
I spent some time in juvie,
lots of mandated therapy,

884
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:36,001
even got myself a diagnosis,
impulse control disorder.

885
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:39,440
All of this is just to say...

886
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:42,007
I really like you.

887
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:44,164
And if I haven't completely
scared you off...

888
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,844
I'm not concerned
with who you were.

889
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:55,044
I like who you are.

890
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:01,940
Dr. Ripley, there you are.

891
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:06,316
We've got incoming.
Pedestrian versus auto.

892
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:13,909
Okay, bud.

893
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:15,432
If you're ready, these
nice people here,

894
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:18,174
they're gonna give you a ride,
get you settled back home,

895
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:20,069
make sure you have
everything you need.

896
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,310
Am

897
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,553
Am I gonna die?

898
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:32,928
Listen, Colin...

899
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:37,715
Let's just... let's just get
you home get home, kiddo, okay?

900
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,524
Come on.
