- A fungal infection?
- Yes. Aspergillosis.

486
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:52,014
It will look, for all
intents and purposes,

487
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:54,976
exactly like a rapidly
spreading metastatic cancer,

488
00:17:55,017 --> 00:17:57,687

the kidneys, the brain.

489
00:17:57,728 --> 00:18:00,398
The only way to rule it out
for sure is to get a biopsy.
