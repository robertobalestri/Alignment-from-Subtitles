1
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:06,852
<i>You jeopardized a man's life.</i>

2
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,506
Am I gonna get fired?

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,247
I don't know if I'll be allowed
to practice medicine again.

4
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,639
It's not up to me.

5
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:12,989
You're supposed to
be her supervisor.

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,904
That never should have happened.

7
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,210
- Get out of my house!
- Daniel!

8
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,038
Why are you speaking
this way to my brother?

9
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,084
Because your brother
is suing Ripley

10
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:23,129
<i>and the hospital
for malpractice.</i>

11
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:26,393
I didn't think it
would happen so fast.

12
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:29,135
<i>Alzheimer's is just a
very tricky diagnosis.</i>

13
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,659
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

14
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:35,054
I didn't have the bandwidth
for worlds colliding.

15
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,490
Of course not.

16
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:38,168
<i>It wasn't the time or the place.</i>

17
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:43,671
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm. You too.

18
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,674
Medium black coffee for
me, and I got her today.

19
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:47,719
What are you doing?

20
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:49,895
Because it's her birthday.

21
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:50,896
Oh, happy birthday.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,550
Thank you.

23
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:54,987
I gotta say, I'm so pumped
for the big bash tonight.

24
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,510
I mean, pretty cool.

25
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:57,816
You have the same birthday
as your grandbaby?

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,296
I mean, come on.

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,819
Well, here's hoping
that my birthday twin

28
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:03,213
doesn't pass out before cake.

29
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:05,737
So is tonight really
the first night

30
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,652
that Bert and the kids
are meeting Dennis?

31
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,001
Well, just two of them.

32
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:12,744
David was gonna fly in,
but work got too hectic.

33
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,137
So how are you feeling?

34
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,704
Introducing the
boyfriend to the family.

35
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:19,925
Well, let's just say I only
got about three hours of sleep

36
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:21,535
last night, so...
- Oh, come on.

37
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:24,016
Dennis is gonna charm
their socks off.

38
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,452
Yeah, well, I better get going.

39
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:27,976
I got a meeting on the
Pawel suit in five.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,891
Sharon, I'm so sorry you
gotta deal with that crap.

41
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:31,067
No worries.

42
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,243
How are things at home?

43
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:36,115
Honestly, it's a
little strained.

44
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,204
Yeah, I can imagine.

45
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:40,076
So let me know how
the meeting goes?

46
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,599
- Will do.
- All right.

47
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,862
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

48
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,037
- That's right.
- Okay.

49
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:46,212
All right, so
these are my girls.

50
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:47,561
That is Melissa. That's Alice.

51
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:51,217
And Melissa is 24,
and Alice is 26?

52
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:52,808
- Yes, good memory.
- Oh.

53
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,178
And where are they?

54
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:56,875
That's Playa Del Carmen.

55
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,225
Melissa was actually supposed
to go with her girlfriend,

56
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,400
but the girlfriend
broke up with her

57
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,185
the night before the trip.

58
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,143
- Oh, poor kid.
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,449
I almost canceled my whole week

60
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:07,146
and hopped on the
next flight to Mexico.

61
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,453
You are a good mom.

62
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:13,239
Well, my girls mean
everything to me.

63
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,285
Isn't it just awful
watching your kids

64
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,156
go through their
first heartbreak?

65
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,419
Do you remember Sean's?

66
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,117
Sean's first serious breakup?

67
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,771
- Yes.
- Yeah.

68
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:27,819
Uh, well, actually,
Sean was the one doing

69
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:30,517
the heartbreaking back then.

70
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,674
Yeah, that does line up.

71
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,872
No one doubts the
suit is merit less,

72
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:40,614
but given the nature
of the injury...

73
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:43,617
It's gonna be your
word against Pawel's.

74
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:46,446
The bottom line is that
juries are unpredictable,

75
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,492
not to mention that
it could end up

76
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,885
costing the hospital
more to defend the claim

77
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,409
than to just settle it.

78
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:55,325
So trust me, the cost-benefit
analysis is clear.

79
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,611
It's to settle.

80
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,638
Sorry, I gotta get
back to the ED.

81
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,510
We got two helicopters inbound.
- Of course.

82
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:07,772
Listen, I'll draft
the settlement.

83
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:09,165
I'll get it over
to Pawel's lawyer.

84
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,296
And then there'll
be some documents

85
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,384
I'll need you to
sign, Dr. Ripley.

86
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,864
Now, hold on a second.

87
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:16,998
Listen, Dr. Ripley, this is
ultimately your decision.

88
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:20,306
If you wanna fight the suit,
the hospital will defend you.

89
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,656
- Reluctantly.
- Vigorously.

90
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,615
- Can I think it over?
- Absolutely.

91
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,759
- What's there to think about?
- That's not a problem.

92
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,316
Take the day.

93
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,733
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

94
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:37,758
Sharon, we are
settling this case.

95
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:42,198
Oh, hey, I hear the renegade
resident Dr. Ahmad got canned.

96
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,677
That true?

97
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:46,332
Try not to look so broken
up about it, okay, Peter?

98
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:48,160
And no, she was not canned.

99
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:52,623
She's suspended pending an
investigation of the incident.

100
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,691
Shayna Ellis,
28-year-old female.

101
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,867
She and a companion were
driving a UTV on the freeway

102
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,042
and got rear-ended.

103
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,305
Took a side-by-side
on the freeway?

104
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:03,871
Shocking it didn't
end well, right?

105
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,351
She was pretty
combative at the scene,

106
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,570
wouldn't let us treat her.

107
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:09,225
Gave her two of Versed,
four of morphine.

108
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,120
She's sedated but rousable.

109
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:14,882
Shayna, can you hear me?
You're at Chicago Med.

110
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:16,884
We're gonna take good
care of you, okay?

111
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:18,538
It's a good thing she was
wearing her seat belt.

112
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:19,713
The driver was not.

113
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:20,888
She got ejected
from the vehicle.

114
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,044
Yikes.

115
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:26,546
Clear breath sounds bilaterally.

116
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,591
She's tachycardic.

117
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:28,809
I'm gonna ultrasound.

118
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,550
Cycle her blood pressure cuff.
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:31,638
Dr. Ripley, I'm
bringing a second victim

120
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:32,900
into Baghdad right now.

121
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,230
- Zach.
- On it.

122
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,560
BP 150/100.

123
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,301
I'm not seeing any free fluid.

124
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,694
No.

125
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,086
Her right kidney look a
little abnormal to you?

126
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,566
Yeah, it does.

127
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,133
Nancy, let's get chest
and pelvis X-rays,

128
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,265
as well as an abdominal CT.

129
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,136
Yep. On it.

130
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,877
We did everything we could
for her at the scene,

131
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,748
but I don't know if
she's gonna make it.

132
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,576
Like her friend here, she
wasn't wearing a helmet.

133
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,820
- Get back!
- What's going on?

134
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:03,931
- Hey!
- I see them!

135
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,411
There they are! Look!

136
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:06,760
Back off right now!

137
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,196
They do not consent
to treatment!

138
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,220
We're taking them out of here!
- Like hell you are!

139
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,533
Get your hands off her!

140
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,736
You good?

141
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,890
Yeah.

142
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,784
Ow.

143
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:33,439
Maggie, who the hell
are these people?

144
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:37,467
Apparently, they're
members of a cult.

145
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,328
They've all been removed?

146
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,372
Yep, and we've
got extra security

147
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,808
posted outside in
case any of them

148
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:55,809
try to get back in.

149
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,898
Thanks, Kev.

150
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,205
What did you find
out about them?

151
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,077
Well, they call themselves
HTS, Heal Thyself.

152
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:06,342
The woman was driving
the UTV, Dakota Andrews.

153
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,170
AKA Cea, short for
Panacea, is the leader.

154
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,737
But wasn't Panacea
some kind of God?

155
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:11,912
The Greek goddess of healing.

156
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,087
She carried with her a potion

157
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,591
that could cure any
illness or injury.

158
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,484
I minored in
classical mythology.

159
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:19,443
Mm-hmm.

160
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:21,095
They're deeply anti-government.

161
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,446
They believe the medical
industrial complex

162
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,491
is a tool used to
control society,

163
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:28,189
that big pharma is incentivized
by the federal government

164
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:30,583
to actually keep people sick.

165
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:33,238
It appears to be mostly
an online community,

166
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:36,197
but the top brass live together
on a commune in Indiana.

167
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:38,199
Yeah, we picked them up
right along the border.

168
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:40,201
And how did they all
get here so fast?

169
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:41,681
Well, Shayna called
someone from the scene

170
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,117
before we sedated her.

171
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,205
We had to circle the
choppers a couple times

172
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:45,492
because of strong winds.

173
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:48,688
Shayna's labs just posted.

174
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:50,995
She's coming down from CT now,
and then I'll send Dakota up.

175
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,257
Great. Thanks, Zach.

176
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,912
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

177
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,783
Well, I guess I'll
be hitting the road,

178
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:57,915
unless you wanna put me to work.

179
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,091
Coming off a night
shift. I'm free.

180
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:02,485
I appreciate how much
you've helped us,

181
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,443
but you've been way too
generous with your time.

182
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,227
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

183
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,055
You know, I may have an
ulterior motive why I've been

184
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,622
hanging around the ED so much.

185
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,928
Oh, yeah? What's that?

186
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,538
Oh.

187
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:13,583
So sorry.

188
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:14,584
Trisha, are you okay?

189
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:17,238
No, I'm good.

190
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:18,370
See you around, Mags.

191
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,482
Yeah.

192
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:24,202
Are you two...

193
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,509
Oh, no. We're just friends.

194
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,860
In that case, you mind
putting in a good word for me?

195
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,339
I think I got a little crush.

196
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,820
Oh, yeah. I'd be happy to.

197
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,387
Thank you, Maggie.

198
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:36,586
You're the best.

199
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,743
Oh, Daniel, good.

200
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:46,093
Thank you for meeting me.

201
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:47,268
What's going on?

202
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,140
Will you give this to Sharon?

203
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:50,620
I'm afraid I'm not
going to be able

204
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,099
to make the party after all.

205
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:55,363
Oh, bummer. What's... what's up?

206
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:57,694
Pawel, he needs my help.

207
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,457
Well, what does he... what
does he need your help with?

208
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,354
Grocery shopping, a
few other errands.

209
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,072
Daniel, please.
- I didn't say anything.

210
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,030
I did not say anything.

211
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:10,553
He can't drive.

212
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,816
I am not going to have
him walk to the store.

213
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,339
He's my brother.

214
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,363
Sweetie, do you really
believe that he can't drive?

215
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:21,955
Dr. Ripley, I'm sure, did
not mean to harm Pawel.

216
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,348
But mistakes happen.

217
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,742
Dr. Ripley didn't make
a mistake, Liliana.

218
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,657
You were in the room.
You were right there.

219
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,093
I have to go to him.

220
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:31,530
I really do not want
to continue this.

221
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:34,296
But if we must, at home.

222
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,560
Okay.

223
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,240
Shayna.

224
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:48,808
Shayna, hi. I'm Dr. Ripley.

225
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,506
Cea.

226
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,724
Where is Cea?

227
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:54,205
You and your companion
were in an accident.

228
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:57,164
Where is she? Where
did you take her?

229
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,731
Your friend is in
critical condition,

230
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,733
but we're doing everything
we can to help her.

231
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,213
She doesn't need your help.

232
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:03,649
I beg to differ,

233
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:06,957
but right now, we
need to focus on you.

234
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,045
What is this?

235
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:09,786
What are you putting inside me?

236
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,657
It's just some medication to
control your blood pressure.

237
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:14,834
- I want it out. Now.
- I wouldn't advise that.

238
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:19,535
Shayna, your CT revealed a
mass on your adrenal gland.

239
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,754
It's likely a pheochromocytoma.

240
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,713
It's a rare tumor that
releases epinephrine

241
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:26,367
into your bloodstream, causing
the blood pressure to spike.

242
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,369
Have you found
yourself experiencing

243
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,371
panic attack-like
symptoms lately?

244
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:32,833
Rapid heartbeat, shortness of
breath, that kind of thing?

245
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:37,161
Okay, well, this appears

246
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:38,771
to have gone untreated
for some time.

247
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:41,339
Where is the adrenal gland?

248
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,558
We have two of them.

249
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,082
They're located on
top of your kidneys.

250
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:48,738
The crash caused you to
bleed in and around the mass,

251
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,478
which makes it even
more imperative

252
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:53,090
that we surgically remove
the pheo as soon as possible

253
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,874
to prevent life-threatening
complications

254
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:56,073
like heart attack and stroke.

255
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:04,057
I appreciate your
time and your concern

256
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,190
for my well-being, Doctor...

257
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,626
Ripley.

258
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,497
Dr. Ripley.

259
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:12,718
But I have come to the
realization on my own

260
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:16,243
and without coercion
that I don't want surgery

261
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,419
or any medical intervention.

262
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:19,638
I don't think you understand.

263
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,597
This could kill
you at any moment.

264
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,861
I understand completely the
potential risks of my choice.

265
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:28,255
I take full responsibility
for any negative consequences

266
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,564
that may result from
my informed decision.

267
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:35,698
And I would be happy
to put that in writing

268
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:39,658
or repeat my wishes
to a supervisor.

269
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,814
Okay?

270
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:45,751
No, no, I got it.

271
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:46,970
Crockett?
- Yeah?

272
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,362
Ambo just landed.

273
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,364
Pedestrian struck by a
vehicle while out jogging.

274
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:52,540
Dr. Tanaka-Reed is with you.

275
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:53,759
All right, uh, keep an eye

276
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,500
on your residents
today, Dr. Marcel.

277
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:57,284
Try not to let them
declare anyone dead

278
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,745
before they've actually croaked.

279
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,291
Hey.

280
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:05,771
Have you spoken to Zola?

281
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:07,294
How's she holding up?
- I don't know.

282
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,600
You haven't been
in touch at all?

283
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:09,862
No. I'm her attending, Maggie.

284
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:10,886
I'm not her buddy.

285
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:15,868
Mr. Acosta, I'm Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

286
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,827
We're gonna take good
care of you, okay?

287
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,263
Everyone watch the wires.

288
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,985
On my count. One, two, three.

289
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:25,791
I need to go home.
Emily is waiting.

290
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:28,141
I need to go home.
- Patient's perseverating.

291
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,360
Let's give two of Versed.
- Got it.

292
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,970
Oh, no, wait a second.

293
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,102
BP's soft.

294
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,451
Yeah, but he's clearly agitated.

295
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:34,844
How do you know the
change of mental status

296
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,672
isn't from hypoxia?

297
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,369
Resuscitate before you sedate.

298
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:40,414
Let's give two units of blood,
two of plasma, and TXA, please.

299
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:41,807
Lungs are equal bilaterally.

300
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,679
Put your hands by
your side for me.

301
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,984
There you go.

302
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,160
Pelvis is loose.

303
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,509
Let's get X-ray in here.

304
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,381
Let's get a binder on
him in the meantime.

305
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:51,817
Why don't we wait
for X-ray to confirm?

306
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,646
Because I know a busted
pelvis when I feel one.

307
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,127
Dr. Marcel, the ICU just called.

308
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,868
Carson Miller's labs are back.

309
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,913
Okay, one second.
I'll be right there.

310
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,852
I can bind a pelvis
without supervision.

311
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:09,835
All right. I'll be back.

312
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,426
What is his deal today?

313
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,716
Hey.

314
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,239
Hi, you.

315
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:25,372
I just wanted to apologize
again for the other night.

316
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:28,288
Oh, my gosh, you have
to stop apologizing.

317
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,899
I get it.

318
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:33,424
You'd just been served. I'd
need a night to myself too.

319
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:36,407
Speaking of, what's going
on with the lawsuit?

320
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,431
I think we're gonna settle.

321
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,172
You seem thrilled.

322
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:45,523
Yeah, I've just never been
one to walk away from a fight.

323
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,351
Doesn't feel great.
- Mm-hmm.

324
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:51,398
Especially considering this
is the dude who messed up our,

325
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:54,488
you know, tea,

326
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:57,230
which I was really looking
forward to, by the way.

327
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:59,798
As was I.

328
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:00,823
Rain check?

329
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:05,349
I think we can make that happen.

330
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:13,290
I see we had the same idea

331
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:15,292
combating the mid-morning slump.

332
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:17,163
I'm trying to, but
the pickings are slim.

333
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,232
Ugh.

334
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,343
Isn't that Sam Abrams' wife?

335
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,389
Yeah, it is.

336
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:26,694
Trini, why don't you
get a treatment room

337
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,087
with a crib ready?
- Got it.

338
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:29,436
Michelle, hey.

339
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,613
- Oh, Hannah, thank God.
- Hey. What's going on?

340
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:33,919
Mason had a fall.

341
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,268
I've never heard
him cry like this.

342
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,574
He won't stop.
- Okay.

343
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,793
I'm scared something's
really wrong.

344
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,011
Yeah, okay. Let's
get him checked out.

345
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,341
Come on.
- Okay.

346
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,064
So how'd this happen?

347
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:50,153
He was in his stroller
seat, and he just fell out.

348
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:51,719
He wasn't buckled in?

349
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,112
I had just unbuckled him.

350
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,810
How far was the
drop, would you say?

351
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,463
About two, three feet?

352
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:57,551
Yeah.

353
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,858
Yeah, exactly. Not very far.

354
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:04,254
Well, he seems to be a little
fussy when I move his left arm.

355
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:05,733
He's clearly favoring his right.

356
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,474
I'd like to get an X-ray.

357
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,563
Is that safe for
a baby of his age,

358
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:10,695
the radiation exposure?

359
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,697
Absolutely. The
radiation is minute.

360
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:15,134
Michelle, I was in surgery.

361
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:16,135
I just got your text.

362
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,746
- Honey.
- Okay.

363
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,879
All right.

364
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,663
Did he lose consciousness?

365
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:24,274
Has he been crying
appropriately the whole time?

366
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,623
- Mm-hmm.
- Did he vomit at all?

367
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:26,842
Is he taking his bottle?

368
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,191
Sam, you can take a deep breath.

369
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,583
We're not seeing
any cause for alarm.

370
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,716
Yeah, Hannah's right.
He's awake and alert.

371
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,850
He was crying, but he's
consolable now, obviously.

372
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,963
And Mason's gonna be just fine.

373
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:45,904
How much Levophed is he on?

374
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,863
- Five mics.
- Okay.

375
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,386
Keep titrating him down.

376
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,586
He's doing a good job
clearing his sepsis.

377
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:56,001
It's the perfect window
to transplant him.

378
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,655
It's gonna close.

379
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,831
Just a matter of time
before he gets sick again.

380
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,529
I have to imagine he's top on
the transplant list, right?

381
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:05,271
Hopefully a pair of lungs
will come through soon.

382
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,707
Yeah.

383
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:09,449
Their founder, a woman
named Dakota Andrews,

384
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:12,539
claims that all illness is a
manifestation of stored trauma.

385
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:15,238
Hmm. Not a completely
baseless idea.

386
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:18,197
We do know that excess
adrenaline, cortisol,

387
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:19,677
can cause all kinds
of health issues.

388
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:22,549
Agreed, except that
her proposed remedy

389
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,987
is a combination of
energy work, meditation,

390
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,337
and herbal teas she
makes containing.

391
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:29,687
God knows what... no
medicine, no surgery,

392
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,558
no diagnostic tests.

393
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:34,170
How did she start to
attract a following?

394
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,214
After she claimed to have cured

395
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:37,086
her own malignant meningioma.

396
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,826
Started going by
the name Panacea

397
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,959
and posting her ideas online.

398
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,221
Happy to have a
chat with Shayna,

399
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:43,831
but needless to say,
just because she has

400
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,659
a belief system at odds
with our treatment plan...

401
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,096
No, I know.

402
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,143
I don't think she lacks
decisional capacity.

403
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,450
And even if she does,
she's been heavily coached

404
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,060
to pass the test.

405
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,148
I was actually
hoping you might know

406
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,890
something about deprogramming.

407
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:01,197
What?
- Well, just, you know,

408
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,025
in practice, historically
speaking, anyway,

409
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,548
pretty horrifying tactic.

410
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:06,158
Usually starts off
with kidnapping,

411
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,725
and then there's
illegal imprisonment.

412
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,423
Yeah, no, I wasn't
suggesting we kidnap her.

413
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,382
Look, getting
somebody to abandon

414
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,253
a deeply held belief system

415
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:15,820
is not typically a
one-and-done idea,

416
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:16,908
but let me see where she's at.

417
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:18,151
Appreciate it.

418
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,568
The results of Dakota
Andrews' head CT.

419
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:27,614
Subdural hematoma with
brainstem herniation.

420
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,921
Neurosurgery saw her,
said her exam is congruent

421
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:32,837
with brain death and supported
by the confirmatory testing.

422
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,056
They just moved her to the ICU.

423
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,709
Any family to notify?

424
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,581
An older brother
who lives in Ohio.

425
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:38,974
He's on his way
here to say goodbye,

426
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,280
and he's expressed a desire

427
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:43,500
to possibly donate
his sister's organs.

428
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:46,329
Hey, uh... sorry.

429
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:48,070
Y'all mind keeping me
posted if the family decides

430
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,897
to go with organ donation?

431
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:52,988
I've got a patient up in the
ICU in dire need of new lungs.

432
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,163
- Sure thing.
- Yeah. Of course.

433
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:56,730
Great, thank you.

434
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:58,210
Hey, Zach?

435
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,821
Let me see Dakota's
head CT again.

436
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:02,630
I just wanna look at something.

437
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:13,008
They're ready.

438
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,835
Hey. What's going on?

439
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,229
We're heading up to
interventional radiology

440
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,188
to angio his pelvis.
- FAST was negative?

441
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,798
Have you been transfusing him?

442
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:21,973
Obviously.

443
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,496
BP 90 systolic.

444
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,715
His pressure's dropped before.

445
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,064
We just need to
give him more blood.

446
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,066
No, change of plans.

447
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,589
We're taking him up to the OR.

448
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,156
We'll pack his pelvis,
get him resuscitated,

449
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,679
then we can go to IR.

450
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:33,811
I'll call upstairs.

451
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,553
Isn't the OR an
unnecessary delay?

452
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,685
Mr. Acosta's been responding
well to blood and plasma.

453
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,644
Let's continue to
resuscitate him in IR.

454
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,689
You don't wanna take an
unstable patient to IR.

455
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,735
Things start going south,
you're much better off

456
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,693
being in the operating room.

457
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:47,129
Trust me.

458
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,347
Good judgment comes
from experience.

459
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,783
Experience comes
from bad judgment.

460
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:53,091
You should put that
on a bumper sticker.

461
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,421
Let's go.

462
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,184
Hey.

463
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,881
Just got Mason's X-ray back.

464
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,188
Mm, good.

465
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,712
Greenstick fracture
of the left humerus.

466
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:08,498
It need to be splinted, but
looks like it should heal

467
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,021
just fine on its own, right?

468
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,284
Correct.

469
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,720
Okay, then.

470
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:16,941
Why do you look like
the sky is falling?

471
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:19,944
It's highly suspect to
see a humerus fracture

472
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,491
from a short fall.

473
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:24,122
What are you saying?

474
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,256
These types of fractures,
especially in babies,

475
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,042
typically come from
direct blunt-force trauma.

476
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,348
What?

477
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,069
We should loop in Ms. Goodwin.

478
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:43,185
Hospital policy, not
to mention the law,

479
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:47,014
mandates that we notify
DCFS in these situations.

480
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,104
But this is Sam and Michelle.

481
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,932
There's just... there's no
way that this is child abuse.

482
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:54,109
You can't say that with
100% certainty, Hannah.

483
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,981
None of us were there.
- And if we turn a blind eye

484
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,896
because it's
Dr. Abram's family...

485
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,202
Look, I know how it looks.

486
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:02,029
It looks like
preferential treatment

487
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,858
because he's the
chief of neurosurgery.

488
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,860
And frankly, that's
exactly what it would be.

489
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:09,385
We all know how quickly
these investigations

490
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,603
can go off the rails.

491
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,692
They could lose their baby.
- I agree.

492
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:16,522
It seems highly implausible
that Mrs. Abrams

493
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:18,785
did something
intentional to Mason.

494
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,180
But she is also
a sleep-deprived,

495
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,747
terrified new mother.

496
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:26,837
We have no idea what's
going on in her head.

497
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:30,362
We have to err on
the side of caution.

498
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,669
Look, if you'd like,
I'll speak to the Abrams.

499
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,497
No, no, no. It
should come from us.

500
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,107
We'll talk to them.

501
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:37,872
Thank you.

502
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:47,249
Went about as well
as I expected,

503
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,902
so, you know, not great.

504
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:51,122
I mean, she thinks that Dakota
is this omnipotent being,

505
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,819
and everything she
says is the truth,

506
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,909
and everything else is a lie.

507
00:19:55,933 --> 00:20:00,697
Well, I think I might have
a way to break the spell,

508
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,220
prove to her that Dakota isn't

509
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,353
an all-powerful celestial being.

510
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,485
She didn't cure her
malignant meningioma

511
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,747
with meditation and herbs.

512
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,575
She never had brain cancer.

513
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,229
You see Dakota's
head CT from today?

514
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,623
No scar gliosis, no
evidence of past tumor.

515
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,147
Okay, just curious about
what this might have to do

516
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:19,237
with Shayna's care
right now, if anything.

517
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,586
If Shayna knew...

518
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,240
- Mitch, come on.
- Hey, I'll say it.

519
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,677
If there was ever an
instance to break HIPAA...

520
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,418
Because you might
get away with it?

521
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,506
Because Dakota is gonna die,

522
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,855
and the truth is
gonna die with her.

523
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,161
I dug deeper into this group,

524
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,815
and a lot of the
people who follow HTS

525
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,860
have completely
treatable illnesses

526
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,645
but are refusing care
because of this woman's

527
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,168
dangerous brainwashing.

528
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,214
If we can get Shayna to
see that Dakota built HTS

529
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,936
on nothing more than a lie...
- Need some help in here.

530
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:48,310
She tried to stand up
and had a dizzy spell.

531
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:52,139
Her blood pressure is
through the roof, 200/130.

532
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:55,273
And she won't allow us to
restart the phentolamine drip.

533
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,320
Shayna, you're having
a hypertensive crisis.

534
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,017
The pheo is releasing massive
amounts of epinephrine

535
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,323
into your bloodstream.

536
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:02,846
We need to give you
something to bring

537
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,543
your blood pressure down, or
you're gonna have a stroke.

538
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:08,441
I don't want your poison.

539
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,118
After the incision, you're gonna

540
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:15,250
make a nick in the fascia.

541
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,686
Then you're gonna
put down the knife

542
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,209
and grab the electrocautery.

543
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:21,105
Elevate the fascia, pull
out the hematoma, and pack.

544
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,283
I know the steps.

545
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:27,242
Scalpel.

546
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:34,467
Make sure you stay
out of the peritoneum.

547
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:37,948
Go on.

548
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,128
There you go.

549
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,109
Mr. Andrews?

550
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,068
Yes.

551
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:51,721
- I'm Dr. Charles.
- Hi.

552
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:55,551
First of all, I wanna offer
my very sincere condolences.

553
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:56,769
Thank you.

554
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,075
And I also understand that

555
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,685
you've agreed to organ donation.

556
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,339
That's an incredibly
generous act.

557
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,385
At Dakota's core, I think
all she really wanted

558
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:04,560
was to help people.

559
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,388
She just went about
it in the wrong way.

560
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:10,043
Kind of what I was hoping
to talk to you about today.

561
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,330
Do you mind if we sit?

562
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:20,576
I've been treating a young
woman who was in the crash

563
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,012
with your sister today.

564
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:23,492
One of her followers?

565
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,929
Yeah, very entrenched in
your sister's philosophy,

566
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,888
and as a consequence,
she's been refusing

567
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,261
life-saving treatment.

568
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,309
Oh, God.

569
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,636
When I first heard
the story that Dakota

570
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,988
was peddling that she'd
cured her own brain cancer,

571
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,382
I thought it'd be obvious
that that couldn't be true.

572
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,906
I knew what she was
saying was dangerous,

573
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,212
that it could hurt people,

574
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:51,128
but our relationship
was already so tenuous.

575
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,826
I was afraid that if
I confronted her...

576
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,175
You might lose your sister.

577
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:57,787
That's a really difficult
position to be in.

578
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:01,530
She had a lot of demons.

579
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:02,946
But I loved...

580
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,211
I loved her very much.

581
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,369
And now here I am,
losing her forever.

582
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:19,461
I'm so sorry that it's too
late to help your sister.

583
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:22,333
But if you're willing, I
think that it might not be

584
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:25,491
too late to help
this young woman.

585
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:31,995
You can't be serious.

586
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,605
Look, we're not accusing
you of anything.

587
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,391
This is just protocol...
- What a load of

588
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,503
yes, you are.

589
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,527
Get Mason. We're leaving now.

590
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,963
You know we can't let you leave.

591
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:45,922
It's gotta be cleared
by DCFS first.

592
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,880
Is that everything?

593
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:49,079
Let's go.

594
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,669
Move aside, or I will move you.

595
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:55,671
Sam.

596
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:56,846
Come on. Don't do this.

597
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,674
Please, don't make
us call security.

598
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:01,048
Honey, I don't know.

599
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:10,971
I can't believe you're
doing this to my family.

600
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,655
Mr. Acosta's wife is
asking for an update.

601
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,396
What should I tell her?

602
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,442
Soon as Kai finishes packing,
we'll close and take him to IR,

603
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,270
so hopefully any day now.

604
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:33,099
Gentlemen, temp's down to 96.8.

605
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:34,492
Gotta move faster, Kai.

606
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,537
Yeah, I'm trying.

607
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:38,061
Pressure's down.

608
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,410
How much blood has he had?

609
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:40,498
Four pack cells, four plasma.

610
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,978
- Any platelets?
- Not yet.

611
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:43,327
All right, give him
a dose of platelets

612
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,982
and start him on pressors.

613
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,158
Come on, Kai! Hurry up!

614
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:50,445
If I'm not moving fast
enough, do it yourself.

615
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,537
Step away from the
table right now.

616
00:24:58,105 --> 00:24:59,106
Gladly.

617
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:12,182
All right, come on. Focus, guys.

618
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,358
We're not done yet.

619
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,795
Shayna?

620
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:20,277
There's somebody here who
would like to talk to you.

621
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,956
This is Josh, Dakota's brother.

622
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,961
Why are you here?

623
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:30,572
I'm afraid.

624
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:33,943
My sister's not gonna make it.

625
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:36,859
No.

626
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:39,775
Unfortunately, Shayna,
Dakota suffered

627
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,081
a catastrophic brain
injury in the crash.

628
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:45,215
She can heal herself.

629
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,936
She's done it before.

630
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:56,206
I really wish that were true.

631
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,493
Smart move, pulling in someone

632
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:04,234
who isn't bound by HIPAA.

633
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:06,739
I figured the last thing you
needed was another lawsuit.

634
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:10,893
You think he'll be able
to get through to her?

635
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,789
I don't know. I mean,
I certainly hope so.

636
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:21,101
Checking to see if
there's anything you need.

637
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:36,614
Can we talk somewhere private?

638
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,640
Yeah, of course. Come here.

639
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,652
Hannah...

640
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,570
I lied.

641
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:59,550
Okay.

642
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:02,858
I was just so scared that if
I said what actually happened

643
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:05,817
please, they cannot take
Mason away from Sam.

644
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,645
He hasn't done anything wrong.

645
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:08,951
This is all my fault.
- Okay, okay.

646
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:10,082
- It's all my fault.
- Just take a deep breath.

647
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,431
We're gonna figure
this out, okay?

648
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:12,955
Just, just...
- What have I done?

649
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:14,458
Tell me what really happened.

650
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:24,662
I was... oh, God.

651
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:28,797
I was doing work in bed
on my laptop this morning.

652
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:30,668
You know, I've been
working from home

653
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:34,237
since Mason was born, and

654
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,892
he woke up from his nap
early, and he was crying,

655
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,850
so I brought him
into bed with me.

656
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:41,703
And he was on my chest.

657
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:46,292
I swear to God, I don't even
remember my eyes closing,

658
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:49,687
and the next thing
I know, he's crying.

659
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,690
And he's just not
on my chest anymore,

660
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,518
and I'm on my side,

661
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:57,042
and Mason is on
the hardwood floor,

662
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:59,523
and my laptop is on top of him.

663
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,873
Michelle, Michelle, hey.

664
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,159
Hey, that was an accident.

665
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:06,989
Hey, what's going on?

666
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,055
Hey, honey. What...

667
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,405
- I'm sorry.
- Sweetheart.

668
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:13,364
Honey, what is it?
- It's my fault.

669
00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:14,712
What is it? No, no, no.

670
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,061
Talk to me.

671
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:17,584
It's my fault.

672
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,021
Oh, baby, no, no, no.

673
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:22,048
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

674
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,553
- Crockett.
- Hey.

675
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,555
Hey. Mr. Acosta's doing well.

676
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:32,861
He's on his way to IR now.

677
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:36,212
Great. Hey, what
was that back there?

678
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:37,909
What do you mean?

679
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:40,129
Were you trying to
break Kai's confidence?

680
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:41,478
Come on, Maggie.

681
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:42,914
The patient was crashing,
and Kai's got confidence

682
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,742
to spare, all right?
- I was there.

683
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:47,005
It wasn't a crisis point.
- Yet.

684
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,225
I needed to gain control
of the situation,

685
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:50,922
and quickly, all right?

686
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,794
Well, maybe Kai was having
problems picking up his pace

687
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:54,534
because he couldn't concentrate.

688
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,928
You were breathing
down his neck.

689
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:58,625
Is this even about Kai?

690
00:28:58,649 --> 00:28:59,931
What's that supposed to mean?

691
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,759
You think that you
were too lax with Zola?

692
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,240
Clearly, I was
too lax with Zola.

693
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:05,850
I gave her an inch,
and she took a mile.

694
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,417
I'm gonna make sure that
doesn't happen again.

695
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:09,027
Whoa.

696
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:11,900
I really like Zola, but
this wasn't her first rodeo.

697
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:14,467
This was her third residency.

698
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,252
And I don't think the
problem was your supervision

699
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:17,712
or your lack thereof.

700
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:22,064
You're not responsible
for her poor decisions.

701
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,198
And neither is Kai.

702
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,462
So don't take it out on him.

703
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,276
- How's it going in there?
- Good.

704
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,148
I mean, good given where
it could have gone.

705
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,629
Gastern agrees it
was an accident,

706
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:49,111
but DCFS need to do a home visit

707
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,634
before they can close
the investigation,

708
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:53,313
and Michelle has to attend
a mandatory parenting class.

709
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,161
Yeah.

710
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:58,250
Man, if Michelle had
just told the truth

711
00:29:58,274 --> 00:30:00,426
from the beginning, she could
have avoided all of this.

712
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,993
Mm.

713
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:03,758
Lies always catch up to you.

714
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:09,566
I told one today to Margo.

715
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,875
It was a lie of
omission, really.

716
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:16,312
Okay. Why do you
think you did that?

717
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,835
Well, same as Michelle.

718
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,383
I didn't want her to
think I was a bad parent.

719
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:26,148
So she asked me if I remembered
Sean's first heartbreak.

720
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:29,847
And I made some glib
remark, you know.

721
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,850
But the truth is...

722
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,094
I had no idea. I wasn't there.

723
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,510
My advice?

724
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:43,339
If you must.

725
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:47,169
You're gonna have to show
her who you are eventually.

726
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:48,127
Mm.

727
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:49,998
It's called being vulnerable.

728
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:52,763
You can't have a real
relationship without it.

729
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:58,160
Let her see you, Dean,
your warts and all.

730
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:09,974
Dr. Charles.

731
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:11,715
Hey, I just wanted
to let you know

732
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:13,282
that Shayna agreed
to be admitted

733
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,588
and put back on a
phentolamine drip.

734
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:17,199
Oh, excellent news.

735
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:18,983
Yeah, that should keep
her in the hospital

736
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:20,985
for at least a couple of
days, hopefully enough time

737
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,988
to get her stabilized and
on board with surgery.

738
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:25,381
I'll make sure somebody
from inpatient psych's

739
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:28,863
assigned to her case.
- Yeah, great.

740
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,386
I wonder if the rest
of the followers

741
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,735
will ever figure it out.

742
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,215
Who knows?

743
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,433
See you later.

744
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:35,826
Oh, what did you, um

745
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,349
what did you decide
about the lawsuit?

746
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:38,829
Sharon said that you were taking

747
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:39,961
the rest of the day
to figure it out

748
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,919
if you don't mind me asking.

749
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:45,531
Look, I think settling
is all but inevitable.

750
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:47,882
Kalmick said it'd be my
word against Pawel, so...

751
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,231
Of course, right?

752
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:52,495
A respected physician's
word against a con man's?

753
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:55,063
Apparently, juries
are unpredictable.

754
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:57,065
Sure, but I mean, a
grifter like Pawel?

755
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,327
I mean, it shouldn't be
that hard to poke holes

756
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:59,850
in this guy's credibility,
I'm telling you.

757
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:01,808
I mean, for instance, he's
got a major gambling problem.

758
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:02,940
There's your motive right there.

759
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,550
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

760
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:07,249
Last year, Lili lost the
down payment to a house

761
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:08,728
paying off his gambling debts.

762
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,861
- Really?
- Really.

763
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,254
I mean, the guy's
a fricking menace.

764
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:14,386
And he's gonna
continue to be a menace

765
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,953
until he gets a
message that, you know,

766
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,153
you just can't use
other people as pawns.

767
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:26,335
Well, then, it sounds like
it's time he got that message.

768
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:35,277
That is one sparkly
birthday girl sweater.

769
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,519
You look fabulous.
- Thank you.

770
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,585
Oh, I wonder who that could be.

771
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:41,239
You better get it quick.
- Leave me alone.

772
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:42,786
Leave me alone.

773
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:46,027
Hey.
- Hey.

774
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:47,593
Ready to meet everyone?

775
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:50,074
You bet.

776
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:53,077
Everyone, this is Dennis.

777
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:54,296
Hey there.

778
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,427
Hi, Michael.

779
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,212
- And Tara.
- Hi.

780
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:58,256
I'm a hugger. Is that okay?

781
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,389
Oh, please.

782
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,608
Hi.

783
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:04,567
Hey, Bert. Nice to meet you.

784
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:06,612
You too.

785
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:08,440
Sorry, remind me...

786
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:10,051
- Dennis.
- Dennis.

787
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,661
Okay, got it now.

788
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:13,619
And who's that for?

789
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:14,969
Well, actually, it's something

790
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,405
for you and the birthday boy.

791
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:17,797
Oh!

792
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,016
Yeah, it's something
that Sharon told me

793
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,539
that Isaiah liked to
do with his grandpa.

794
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:21,758
Wow.

795
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:22,933
Where is the birthday boy?

796
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:24,717
Oh, he partied a
little too hard,

797
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,961
so he's already
knocked out upstairs.

798
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:30,636
You wanna open?

799
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,551
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Okay.

800
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:33,770
Tear it open.

801
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,665
Aww.

802
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,514
He loves blocks.

803
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:39,732
Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

804
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,996
Grandpa loves to
build him tall towers.

805
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,085
And Isaiah likes
to knock them down.

806
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,024
And so does Grandpa.

807
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,854
Thank you.

808
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,038
I told you so.

809
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,935
- Oh, hey.
- Trisha, um...

810
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,502
I'm sorry, but I actually can't

811
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:13,331
put in a good word with Loren.

812
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:16,228
Um, okay.

813
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:23,080
Oh, I see.

814
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,908
Mm-hmm.

815
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:26,562
So when are you
gonna make your move?

816
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,129
Oh, I hadn't really
thought about it.

817
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:31,808
You should, because
Loren is a catch, Maggie.

818
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:37,640
And if not me, it'll be
someone else who snaps him up.

819
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:57,680
Don't do that.

820
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:59,073
Don't time yourself.

821
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,639
Why not?

822
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:02,467
Because your pace is just fine.

823
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:04,600
Really.

824
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:08,149
If you rush, you'll get
sloppy, start to make mistakes.

825
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,936
All right.

826
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:18,570
- Dr. Marcel?
- Yeah?

827
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,529
I wanted to let you know,

828
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:23,009
unfortunately, Dakota wasn't a
donor match for Carson Miller.

829
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,750
I'm assuming he's your patient.

830
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:26,404
Yeah, he is.

831
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:28,493
Well, good news is,

832
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,650
he's top of the transplant list.

833
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,629
Hopefully there'll
be a match soon.

834
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:34,717
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Zach.

835
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:35,785
Mm-hmm.

836
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:47,077
By the way, does Sean know
that we're seeing each other?

837
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,557
I haven't said
anything, and I just...

838
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:49,906
I didn't know if he knew yet.

839
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,473
He does, and he's very
much in favor of it.

840
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:53,039
Okay, okay, good.

841
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:55,477
That is a relief, 'cause I
know how close you guys are.

842
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,609
Yeah, Sean and I are

843
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:01,439
we're close, at least now.

844
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:03,702
There was a period of
time, almost 15 years,

845
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,095
where we weren't.

846
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,706
And actually, we
didn't talk at all.

847
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,905
Yeah.

848
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:14,694
Wow, I mean, Sean, he
never said anything.

849
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,352
He's probably trying to
protect me, your opinion of me.

850
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,680
So what happened?

851
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,465
I tried for years

852
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:30,990
his mother and I both tried
for years to get him off drugs,

853
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:32,818
and he wouldn't quit using.

854
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:36,474
And I finally cut him off,

855
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:39,806
told him to get back in
touch when he was clean.

856
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:44,941
And 15 years goes by.

857
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,903
What are you thinking about?

858
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:52,360
Honestly?

859
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:55,058
Yeah.

860
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:57,669
I just... I can't
imagine anything else

861
00:36:57,693 --> 00:37:00,411
Melissa could do that would

862
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:02,239
make me stop speaking to them.

863
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:05,092
Single greatest
regret of my life.

864
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:08,071
I know, that's a
red flag. I get it.

865
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:09,899
Well...

866
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,814
Hold on a second.

867
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,033
I was going to say

868
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:17,036
that I have never dealt
with addiction as a parent.

869
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,084
So I... I don't
know what I would do

870
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:22,738
if there were to ever
come a point where...

871
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:25,219
To give up on your kid?

872
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,004
There's no excuse
for what I did.

873
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:29,899
And I'm not making any.

874
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:35,340
I see the way you show up
for Sean, and it's beautiful.

875
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:41,974
And it's one of the
reasons I was so

876
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:44,542
drawn to you.

877
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,394
And now?

878
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:51,965
Yeah, I'm not seeing
any red flags here.

879
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:05,171
- I do okay?
- Better than okay.

880
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:08,895
Tara's already pulled me
aside to gush over you.

881
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:12,918
Good to see you.

882
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:15,704
You get home safe now.

883
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:18,097
Oh, you too, Bert. I hope
to see you again soon.

884
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:20,012
Yeah. Hon, look, I'm tired.

885
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,275
I'm gonna go to bed.

886
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,539
I'll leave the light on for you.

887
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:27,150
Hey, Dad.

888
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:29,021
If you're tired, let's
just get you home, okay?

889
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,371
Yeah, I'll pull up the car.

890
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,937
Get me home? I am home.

891
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,157
Dad, this is Mom's house.

892
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:35,767
Best not to contradict.

893
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,291
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.

894
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,423
What are you talking
about, this is Mom's house?

895
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:41,469
She's my wife. This
is my house too.

896
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:44,036
Why don't we go sit down
on the couch for a moment?

897
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,603
I don't wanna have
a seat on the couch.

898
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:47,692
I'm tired! I wanna go to bed!

899
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,128
Is everything okay, Bert?

900
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:50,565
I don't know what they're saying

901
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,915
that this isn't my house.

902
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:54,917
They're trying to
steal it from me!

903
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:56,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Bert. Come on, now.

904
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:58,790
I want all of you
out of my house, now!

905
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:01,382
I think if we just
go sit down...

906
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,149
Okay.

907
00:39:10,173 --> 00:39:12,413
Can you...
- Yes, yes, of course.

908
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:13,979
- Get your hands off me.
- You're okay, Bert.

909
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:15,981
You're okay.
- It's okay.

910
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:17,940
Let go! Let go of me!

911
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:21,030
You're okay, Dad. You're okay.

912
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:23,056
Come on. Come on.

913
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:26,470
All right, just sit down.

914
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:28,148
It's okay.

915
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:33,347
Bert

916
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,132
