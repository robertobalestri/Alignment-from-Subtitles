1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,169
- Alicia, we can't
agree to this.

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,404
This is too much.

3
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:06,705
- Then we'll go to mediation,

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,073
and if you still think
it's too much,

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,108
we'll go to court.

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,609
I'm very confident
in our chances.

7
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,211
- Can't we find a compromise?

8
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:14,380
I'm sure everyone here
would like nothing more

9
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:16,115
than to put this behind us.

10
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,349
- Easy for you,

11
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,119
but since Dr. Halstead
resuscitated Mrs. Baker

12
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,320
against her wishes,

13
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,322
she's been confined
to this hospital,

14
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,623
fed through a tube,

15
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,026
and hooked up to a series
of wires, tanks,

16
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,294
and catheters
with no end in sight.

17
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,663
This is not something she'll
ever be able to put behind her.

18
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,633
- I never wanted any of that.

19
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,035
I did what I did
to give you time so--

20
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,036
- Dr. Halstead.

21
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,670
- Dr. Halstead.

22
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:49,314
- Ms. Goodwin,
you have our terms.

23
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,604
- Okay,
so it's my first surgery,

24
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,406
and I'm holding this thing
called a "Bovie."

25
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,774
- For cauterizing
blood vessels.

26
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,610
- Yeah, yeah, so the surgeon,
he tells me to buzz.

27
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:19,745
He's talking about the Bovie,

28
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,447
but I have no idea,

29
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:23,348
so finally I just look at him,

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,485
and I say, "Bzz."

31
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:27,619
- You did not.

32
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,354
- Hi.
- Hey.

33
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,656
- Don't you have
patients to see?

34
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:31,757
- Yeah, I'm on my way.

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,358
It's just another kid
with a earache.

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,161
- And we've got 20 more
in the waiting room.

37
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,230
You drinking baby formula?
- Oh, yes.

38
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,365
It's all they had
in the back.

39
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,434
The vanilla's actually
pretty good.

40
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,136
- Incoming!

41
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:46,405
- 35-year-old male
found down in his kitchen.

42
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,807
Hypotensive at 80 over 40,
rate 134,

43
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:53,445
Dr. Rhodes, can you get this,
please? We're slammed.

44
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,547
- I'm on it.
Reese, come with me.

45
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,689
Ready?
One, two, three.

46
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,560
- All right,
let's get him hooked up.

47
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,363
Prep a saline line.

48
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,764
We're gonna need another one
wide open.

49
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,234
- O2 sats are 85 and dropping.

50
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,602
- What's happening to me?

51
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,437
- We're gonna find that out.
We're gonna intubate.

52
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,440
Give me a 7.5 ET tube,
20 of etomidate,

53
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,642
and 1 milligram per kilo of roc.

54
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,710
- Septic shock?

55
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,545
- Maybe, but we need
to find a source.

56
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,280
Your respiratory muscles
are weak.

57
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,549
I'm gonna intubate you
so that they can rest.

58
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,217
Give him 3 grams Unasyn.

59
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,621
Send for a CBC, CMP,
coags, and lactate.

60
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,890
Give me a blood gas
and blood and urine for culture.

61
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:41,426
- There's no bleeding
or deformity in his legs.

62
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,629
- We're almost ready.

63
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,665
Heartrate is erratic.
- Watch his pressure.

64
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,738
- All right, I am in.

65
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,846
- Dr. Rhodes.

66
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,718
- O2 sats are 98
and he's stable.

67
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,223
- No.

68
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,724
We need to get him
up to the OR now.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,794
I have a feeling
we're already too late.

70
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,516
- Patient's spouse is here.
He's very anxious.

71
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,850
Any updates I can give him?

72
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,253
- Tell him his husband's
got necrotizing fasciitis

73
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:44,389
and we're debriding the muscle
to try and stop the infection.

74
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,757
- Dr. Rhodes, is that okay?

75
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,463
- Uh, yeah.
That's fine.

76
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,468
- Did a med student seriously
just go over my head to you?

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,573
- Zoe.

78
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,976
- Hi.

79
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,878
that you helped me get
into the clinical trial?

80
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,413
- Jennifer Baker?

81
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,349
- Could you find out
how she's doing?

82
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,883
You know, side effects,
tumor burden.

83
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,619
- Isn't she still suing you?

84
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,655
- I just want to know
if she's at least showing

85
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:17,856
some improvement.

86
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,293
- Will,
it's a Phase III study.

87
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:24,396
All that information
is confidential.

88
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,669
I'll see what I can do.

89
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,504
- Thank you.
- Okay.

90
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,906
<i>[indistinct P.A. chatter]</i>

91
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,776
- Hey.

92
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,046
- Hey.
- So how are you doing?

93
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,048
- I'm good.
- That's good.

94
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,819
We should, you know,
talk.

95
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:51,423
- Yeah, but not here.

96
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,557
- Yeah.
No.

97
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,725
- No.
- Right.

98
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,828
- Okay.

99
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,370
- You're gonna be fine.
- Hi. I'm Dr. Manning.

100
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,638
This is Dr. Halstead.

101
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,541
You must be Shiloh.

102
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,876
I heard you had a bit
of a headache, huh?

103
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:14,046
She's also had a 103 fever
since last night.

104
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,781
- Did you try Tylenol
or ibuprofen?

105
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:16,882
- Tylenol usually works,

106
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,717
but this time it
didn't touch her.

107
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,785
That's why we're here.

108
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,387
- How about any nausea
or vomiting?

109
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,389
- She threw up once.
That definitely concerned me.

110
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,991
- But there hasn't been
any purulent discharge,

111
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,592
so I doubt it's bacterial.

112
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,994
- Well, we can't
rule anything out yet.

113
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,330
- So you're going
to do cultures, right?

114
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,932
Anyone you know
have similar symptoms?

115
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,702
- No, not that I know of.

116
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,939
- Do you feel stiff
or achy back here?

117
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,607
- Yeah. When I move my head.

118
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,679
- Wait.
Are you thinking meningitis?

119
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,516
and neck stiffness,
it's definitely possible.

120
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,751
- Possible or probable?

121
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,453
Because she hasn't shown
increased drowsiness

122
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,788
or experienced any photophobia.

123
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,790
- Are you MDs?

124
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,360
- No. Engineers.

125
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,662
- Well, like we said,
meningitis is a possibility,

126
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,797
so the next step
is to do some tests.

127
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,433
- What kind of tests?

128
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,402
- Well, we're gonna do
two pokes in your arm

129
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,070
and one poke in your back

130
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,572
so we can figure out
what's going on

131
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,940
and get rid of this headache.

132
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,475
Is that okay with you?

133
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,380
Yeah?
Okay.

134
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:22,681
All right, well,
we'll be back in.

135
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,049
Thank you.

136
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:31,123
- Professor told me hardest part
of pediatrics--never the kids.

137
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,560
Nice.

138
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,762
Who sent you those?

139
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:37,796
- Not mine.

140
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:41,099
Goodwin's anniversary.
32 years.

141
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,068
Dr. Choi, incoming.

142
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,670
- Got it.
- Treatment six.

143
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,975
- Ken Gallagher.
57-year-old male with an LVAD.

144
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,777
Called 911 with
severe abdominal pain

145
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,812
and epigastric tenderness.
Vitals are stable.

146
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:54,813
- Mr. Gallagher,
on a scale of one to ten,

147
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,014
how bad is your pain?

148
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,550
- A zillion.
- All right, let's move him.

149
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:02,421
On my count.
One, two, three.

150
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,456
- High dose antibiotics
set up please.

151
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,658
- That's a left ventricle
assist device, right? An LVAD?

152
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,794
- Unfortunately, yes.

153
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,061
- No guarding
or rebound tenderness.

154
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,665
- There's a hole in my stomach.
It never stops.

155
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,100
- You've been diagnosed
with an ulcer?

156
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,970
- Diagnosed, scoped,
transfused, scoped again.

157
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,840
- Doesn't sound like
you've had an easy time.

158
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,643
Okay, you're gonna feel
a little p--

159
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,512
- Feel a little pressure.
Like I said, not my first rodeo.

160
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,949
- All right.
You on any ulcer meds?

161
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,885
- Three of 'em.
What is it this time?

162
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,154
Abscess?
Breakthrough bleeding?

163
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,923
- May be a trace
of blood in there.

164
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,958
Get me an NG tube,
and call GI for an endoscopy.

165
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,161
- No, no. Can't I just show you
my last six endoscopies?

166
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,963
It's still the same stomach.

167
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,965
- Well, I'll give you something
for the pain, but we have to try

168
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,834
and figure out how to get
this ulcer under better control.

169
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,869
- I'll tell you how.
Get rid of this thing.

170
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,571
- Not a good idea.
That thing,

171
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,573
the LVAD,
is pumping your blood for you.

172
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,908
- Yeah, and all my problems
started right after I got it.

173
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,679
but it's better you follow up
on that with your cardiologist.

174
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,214
- My cardiologist is
an arrogant SOB.

175
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,749
Come on.
- Fine.

176
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,017
I'll have cardiothoracic
down to take a look.

177
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,552
- Thank you.

178
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,923
Man, do I hate that stuff.

179
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,825
- It's a lot worse without it.

180
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,560
Okay.

181
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,195
I have a feeling
you know the drill.

182
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,504
- Ron.
- Hey, Dan.

183
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,638
- I haven't seen you
in a while.

184
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,973
- Oh, it'd be more often

185
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,608
if you'd show up at poker
now and again.

186
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,809
- Maybe I'd show up more often

187
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,110
if you didn't keep
taking my money.

188
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,613
- Yeah,
I'd stop taking your money

189
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,782
if you didn't touch your chin
whenever you bluffed.

190
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,251
- Wait.

191
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:43,288
I have a tell?
Really?

192
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,590
Really?

193
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,027
- Anyway, I try to stay
out of here.

194
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,997
Private practice doc
in a hospital

195
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,732
is never good news.

196
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,933
- Patient of yours
get admitted?

197
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,802
- Necrotizing fasciitis.

198
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,171
- Oh, man.
That is a bear.

199
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,040
- Been seeing me
for ten years.

200
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,276
Good guy.
I'll see you, Dan.

201
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,844
- Take it easy.

202
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,854
- Nat, the little girl
with the fever, Shiloh Kane.

203
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,789
Her lab results.
They said it was urgent.

204
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,726
- April, get the patient
from two into isolation

205
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,695
and order a chest X-ray
and CT head,

206
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,163
and put the rest of the family
in another room

207
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,833
and no matter what,
do not let anyone leave.

208
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,569
- Okay.
- What's going on?

209
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,703
- Get me on the phone
with the CDC.

210
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,138
Immediately.

211
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,947
- How dangerous is this?

212
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,715
- It depends.

213
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,918
Haemophilus influenza B
can often be contained

214
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,353
with the antibiotics

215
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,155
we're giving her now,
but not always.

216
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,990
- And if it's not contained?

217
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:55,694
- It can cause hearing loss,
brain injury...

218
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,363
- Well, I've never even
heard of it.

219
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,598
How'd she get it?

220
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
- Well, that is the question.

221
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,635
It's part of the standard
vaccination regimen.

222
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:04,970
Is Shiloh vaccinated?

223
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,137
- No.

224
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,672
- Are any of them?

225
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,309
- Type B is transmitted
by saliva,

226
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,945
which makes incidental contacts
like Dr. Halstead

227
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,146
and I not at risk,

228
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,717
but any of her long-term
close contacts are.

229
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:22,120
but in the meantime, you'll
each need to be immunized.

230
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,288
- I'm not sure we want that.

231
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,856
- Mr. Kane, I think it's very--

232
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,925
- Your children
are at serious risk.

233
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,827
- We feel vaccinations
pose a serious risk as well.

234
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:34,232
But left alone, the body has
a perfectly good immune system,

235
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,334
and once you start injecting it
with foreign proteins

236
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,236
and preservatives,
you can't help but change that.

237
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,671
- Right now,
all our other children

238
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,272
seem to be fine,

239
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,807
and Shiloh's in there all alone.

240
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,910
Can we just go be with her?

241
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,715
- Of course you can.

242
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,184
We'll send someone
in to watch your other children.

243
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,753
Thank you.

244
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,298
- So what?

245
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,000
You're just gonna
let them off the hook?

246
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,769
- They're scared to death
right now.

247
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,437
It is not the time to push.

248
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,673
I will talk to them
again later, okay?

249
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,811
- His coloring is pristine.

250
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,113
The LVAD is working perfectly.

251
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,149
I just don't see what else
we can do at this time.

252
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,985
- This is not pristine.
- I understand.

253
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:31,723
Unfortunately, GI ulcers are not
uncommon with these devices.

254
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,725
- Yeah, apparently
neither is torture.

255
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:34,993
I can't live like this.

256
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,062
- Well, fortunately,
the LVAD is temporary.

257
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,997
Just a bridge until you can get
a heart transplant.

258
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,232
- Come on, do you know
where I am on the list?

259
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,001
Your heart will fail
before I get one.

260
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,470
- That's not true.
There are a lot of factors.

261
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,405
- You're a surgeon, right?

262
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,940
- Mm-hmm.
- Take it out.

263
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:52,310
- Excuse me?
- Take the damn thing out.

264
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,714
- Mr. Gallagher, I'm--I'm--
I'm--I'm sure you understand.

265
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,749
Your heart is too weak
to pump on its own.

266
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,851
The device
is doing it for you.

267
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,419
- I don't care,

268
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,954
and I don't have a family.

269
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,491
It's my heart.
I want it out.

270
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,393
- That's not possible,

271
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,029
because if we take it out,
you will die.

272
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,101
- I'm sorry.

273
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,946
- Is Dr. Unger coming back?

274
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,448
- Dr. Unger?
I don't know. Was he--

275
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,884
- He was starting
to explain things,

276
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:36,755
but his office kept paging him,
so he had to go.

277
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,289
- Oh.

278
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,824
- But it sounded bad.

279
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,140
- Necrotizing fasciitis

280
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:59,144
is what people call
"flesh-eating bacteria,"

281
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,545
but that's a misnomer.

282
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,948
It doesn't actually eat.
It just spreads very quickly.

283
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,355
Even with surgery
and antibiotics,

284
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:13,792
once it starts moving,
we hardly ever catch up.

285
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,564
- That's what
Dr. Unger was saying.

286
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,034
- Is he Elias's
regular doctor?

287
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,402
- Yeah.

288
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,471
I mean, not regular.

289
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,440
He hardly ever went.

290
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,310
Monday was the first time
he'd been in, like...

291
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,146
two years.

292
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,215
- He saw Dr. Unger
two days ago?

293
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,917
- Yeah.

294
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,885
He had a pimple on his arm
that was bugging him.

295
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,823
- And what did Dr. Unger do?

296
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,491
- He didn't think
it was anything to worry about.

297
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,928
I mean, it was just a pimple.

298
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,499
It hurt him more yesterday,
so we called,

299
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,036
but we never heard back.

300
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,306
I-I guess it wasn't
just a pimple.

301
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,445
- No.

302
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,887
- Jennifer's nurses say
she's tolerating the trial

303
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,155
really well.

304
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,891
No nausea or vomiting.
No muscle pain.

305
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,160
No cognitive dysfunction.

306
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:25,597
It's as good as a report
as you could ask for.

307
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,299
- Thank you.

308
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,369
I really appreciate this.

309
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,409
- Hey.
Sweet, sweet man, your husband.

310
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,880
If you want, I'll have someone
take them to your office.

311
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,115
- No. Keep 'em here for now.

312
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,583
They brighten up the place.

313
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,952
- Works for me.
What are you guys doing tonight?

314
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,988
- Same as every year.
Gibson's.

315
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,258
Bert orders the T-bone,
and I get the sea bass.

316
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,593
- Best steak house
in Chicago and you get the fish?

317
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,095
- It's delicious.

318
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,903
- Do you know a doctor
in private practice named Unger?

319
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,304
- Yeah.

320
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,172
- Is he reputable?

321
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,441
- Why?

322
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,243
- He missed a diagnosis,
and now that patient's

323
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,379
probably going to die.

324
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:21,319
- Truthfully, he's missed a few
in the last few months.

325
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,921
- Can you pull up a list
of his patients

326
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,356
who've been here recently?

327
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,927
April.
- [sighs]

328
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,062
Okay.
Just keep my name out of it.

329
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,563
- Mm-hmm.

330
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,302
- You didn't get this
from me.

331
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,440
[alarm chiming]
<i>- Code blue.</i>

332
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,311
- He's in respiratory distress.
What happened?

333
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,415
- Get the crash cart.

334
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,450
Let's get him flat.

335
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,585
He's unresponsive.

336
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,687
- Prep a tray.

337
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,390
- He's wet as a sponge.
We're gonna intubate.

338
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,163
- I can't find the pulse.
- He won't have one.

339
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,397
LVAD's the pump.
It bypasses the heart.

340
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,200
His heart's too weak
to pump blood on its own.

341
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,336
That's why his lungs are soaked.

342
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:12,470
- Prepping now.

343
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,739
I got a 14 and a 16 standing by.

344
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,678
- No.

345
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,715
The LVAD battery.
He did this to himself.

346
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,191
- What do we got?
- Respiratory distress

347
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,460
and acute heart failure.

348
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,562
- I'll start a subclavian.

349
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,665
He take that out himself?

350
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:45,203
- Suicide mission.
Not today, buddy.

351
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,505
- And I'm in.

352
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,409
Vent setting's AC 16,
tidal volume 500,

353
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,344
peep of 5, and O2 at 100%.

354
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,281
- Battery's back in.
- Pushing pressors.

355
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,488
[electronic beeping]

356
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,756
- He's pinking up.

357
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:08,259
- BP is 100 over 65
and climbing.

358
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,294
- He's stable.
- Nice save.

359
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,696
- I'll call upstairs.

360
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,365
He's gonna need to be admitted.

361
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,777
- Dr. Halstead,
I need a word with you.

362
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,421
Why were you poking
around the clinical trial wing?

363
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,489
- I didn't talk to her.
- I instructed you

364
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,325
not to go anywhere near
Jennifer Baker.

365
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,693
- But I heard good news.

366
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,063
Jennifer hasn't had any
of the usual side effects.

367
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,464
She's doing great
in her treatment.

368
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,232
- That's beside the point.

369
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,234
You blatantly disregard
the one thing

370
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,170
I asked you not to do.

371
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,238
- This could mean she's
on the road to remission,

372
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,606
and then I'm sure
they'll drop the lawsuit.

373
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,408
- You don't know that.

374
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,112
You know, I have tried
to be supportive of you,

375
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:04,515
but one more misstep
and I will suspend you.

376
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,185
You will be barred
from this hospital

377
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:08,820
until the lawsuit is settled,

378
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:11,856
and when it is,
I will recommend to the board

379
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,758
that you be terminated.

380
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,567
I'm done.

381
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,841
- Excuse me, Ms. Goodwin.

382
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,175
- What is it?

383
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,743
- Um,
what exactly is the protocol

384
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,346
for reporting
medical misconduct?

385
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,781
- Nurse? Doctor? Who?

386
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,249
- Doctor.

387
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,251
Dr. Unger.

388
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,421
- Let's take this
up to my office.

389
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,823
- Over
the past two years,

390
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:49,260
Dr. Unger has increasingly
missed routine diagnoses.

391
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,661
In the past three months alone

392
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,763
there have been
four separate incidents.

393
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,800
A UTI that led
to pyelonephritis,

394
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,237
that turned
into a ruptured appendix,

395
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,405
a leg rash that turned out
to be a DVT,

396
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,174
and now an infected pimple

397
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,610
that's led
to necrotizing fasciitis.

398
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,479
- You know this guy.
What are your thoughts?

399
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,515
- We went
to medical school together,

400
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,317
and he's a caring,
thorough physician.

401
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,621
Been my personal doctor
for years.

402
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:17,922
Never missed a thing.

403
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,258
- He missed those,

404
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,593
and they're only the ones
that came in here.

405
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,795
- Thank you, Reese.
We'll look into it.

406
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:28,366
In the meantime, don't share
your concerns with anyone else.

407
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,676
- I worry about his patients.

408
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,344
Dr. Unger should lose
his license.

409
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,246
At the very least,
his hospital privileges.

410
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,782
- That's not your call to make.

411
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,684
Thank you.

412
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,794
- So why'd you really
ask me in here?

413
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,896
- I'm starting an investigation.

414
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,532
I didn't want you blindsided.

415
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,601
This could get ugly.

416
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,507
- Hey there.

417
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,342
Where are your parents?

418
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,611
- My dad took my brother
and sister home.

419
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,279
My mom's in the bathroom.

420
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,614
She'll be right back.

421
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,883
- Well, that's okay.
I just came in to check on you.

422
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,222
- Why do you have
to wear the mask?

423
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,424
- Because the bacteria
that's making you sick

424
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,993
is contagious, which means
other people can get it,

425
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,962
and I have to be
particularly careful

426
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,530
because I have a newborn baby,

427
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,398
and I wouldn't want
to get him sick.

428
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,702
- People always going to
have to wear masks around me?

429
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,538
- No, because this medicine
that we're giving you,

430
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,740
it's gonna make you all better.

431
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,808
You let me know
if there's anything

432
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,310
that you need, okay?

433
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,746
- Even strawberry Jell-O?

434
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,249
- Absolutely.

435
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,628
[knocking at door]

436
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,263
- Yes?

437
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,766
- Dr. Downey, you mind?

438
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,334
- Nope.

439
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,637
- What's that?

440
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,773
- "Ka Hana No'eau I Ka Hulu."

441
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,541
The art of the feather.

442
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,043
- Oh.

443
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,479
- I am a rank amateur,

444
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,981
but it's good for the hands.

445
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,519
What's on your mind?

446
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,887
- I have a patient.

447
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,822
He's had an LVAD
for four months.

448
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,859
Been experiencing
unremitting pain, fatigue.

449
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:37,662
He has little to no control
over his bodily functions.

450
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,765
- That happens,
unfortunately.

451
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:44,035
- It's been rough,

452
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:47,972
and he is not a candidate
for a artificial heart.

453
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,940
- Where is he
on the transplant list?

454
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,609
- Pretty far down.

455
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,812
Chances of being moved up
are slim to none.

456
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,321
- And he wants you
to take it out.

457
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,790
- Yeah.

458
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:09,060
- Do it.

459
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,462
- But he'll die.

460
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,834
- I am a cardiothoracic surgeon.

461
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:23,974
The patient has asked you
to remove it, yes?

462
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,544
- In no uncertain terms.

463
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:30,548
- Then honor his wishes.

464
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,985
I hope when my time comes

465
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,520
to be so lucky
as to have someone

466
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,723
extend me
the same consideration.

467
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,070
- Bad news?

468
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:56,807
- Well, Goodwin
took the paddle to me.

469
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,743
I'm okay.

470
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,077
- My shift's over
in a little,

471
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,012
and I was gonna go
to Shiloh's school

472
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,415
to help give out booster shots.

473
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:06,484
Why don't you come with us?

474
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,554
- Sure.
- All right.

475
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,889
Van will be outside in ten.

476
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,860
- Okay.

477
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,398
- Hey. You have a second?
- What's up?

478
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,134
- Did you give Keflex to the kid
with the ear infection in three?

479
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,537
- Because he was supposed
to get azithro.

480
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,072
He's allergic to Keflex.

481
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,774
- What happened?
- I mean, nothing terrible.

482
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,142
He's okay.

483
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,944
But it could have been lethal.

484
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,013
- Who else was on that side?

485
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,181
Doris?

486
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,182
Robert?

487
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,550
- No, she was on a break,

488
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:40,985
and he was with other patients.

489
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,988
I'll keep asking around.

490
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,723
- You man your desk.
I'll find out.

491
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,758
- Yeah?
Okay, thanks.

492
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,697
- Come on, girl, just--
- [laughs]

493
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,673
- Where's Mr. Gallagher?

494
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,675
- Dr. Rhodes just
took him to surgery.

495
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,710
- Surgery?
- To remove his LVAD.

496
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,892
- You're removing the LVAD?
You didn't consult me.

497
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:25,496
- The only person I needed
to consult was the patient.

498
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,665
- I thought we were
on the same page with this.

499
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,042
What you're doing
is assisted suicide.

500
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,612
- The patient
understands the consequences.

501
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,981
He made an informed decision.

502
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,050
- What about you?

503
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,585
You're killing him.

504
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,259
- It is what the patient wants.

505
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,761
It's ethical, and it's legal.

506
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,798
- I can't let you do it.

507
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,267
- Are you really gonna
try and stop me, Dr. Choi?

508
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:14,879
- Noah.
- Whoa.

509
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,215
- What?

510
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,550
- The kid
with the ear infection.

511
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:20,851
You were supposed
to give him azithro.

512
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:21,852
- I did.
- No,

513
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,655
you gave him Keflex instead.

514
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:27,258
- Really? Are you sure?
- Oh, my God.

515
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,127
The kid is allergic to Keflex.

516
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:33,063
- O-okay. D-did he--did
he go into anaphylactic shock?

517
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,698
- No, luckily,
they caught it in time.

518
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,534
- [sighs]
Okay.

519
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,836
- Okay?
It's not okay.

520
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,704
This could have been
really serious.

521
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,072
- But it wasn't.

522
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,874
- Don't you understand
what you did?

523
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,610
- I made a mistake,
but nobody died.

524
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,212
Anybody could have
done what I did.

525
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,613
Who sets up the pharmacy bin?

526
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,148
[both speaking foreign language]

527
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,551
- Don't look for
someone else to blame.

528
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,219
- I'm just saying...

529
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,058
Wait, wait, are you--
are you gonna write me up?

530
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,930
- I don't know.

531
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:09,633
- April, you'd do that to me?

532
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:12,069
if anything like this
happens again--

533
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,773
- Look, it won't. It won't.
I will be really careful.

534
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,245
Okay?

535
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,646
Don't worry.

536
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,148
It's all good.

537
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,320
It's all good.

538
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,130
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm the principal.

539
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,966
We're lining the kids
up in the auditorium.

540
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:44,201
Here are the consent forms.
- Thank you.

[alarm chiming]
<i>- Code blue, ICU.</i>

542
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:54,845
- Excuse me, sir.

543
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,848
Excuse me.

544
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,849
There's no pulse.

545
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,084
- What--what's happening?

546
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,822
- He's unresponsive.

547
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:07,024
- He's in V-tach.
- Cardiac arrest.

548
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:09,226
- What?
Elias!

549
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,328
- Give me the paddles.
Charge to 200.

550
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,963
- Charging to 200.

551
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,399
[electroning whining]

552
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,368
- Here.

553
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,204
Clear?
- Clear.

554
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:22,139
- Nothing.
Stand by.

555
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,776
- All right, 1 milligram of epi.
- Got it, milligram of epi.

556
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,415
- 1 of epi.

557
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,916
- Elias, come on.

558
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,785
Elias!

559
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,820
- Again. Clear.
- Clear.

560
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,089
- Please, please, save him.
Please, please.

561
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,391
Come on.
Save him.

562
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:42,826
- Again. Clear.
- Clear.

563
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,330
- Another milligram of epi.

564
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,672
- Doctor...

565
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,343
- Oh, my God, no.

566
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,015
- Time of death 15:22.

No! No!

[sobbing]

569
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,702
- I'm sorry, Jim.
- Don't touch me.

570
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,012
- What changed your mind?
- Downey.

571
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:38,282
- Right, you and Downey,
the dynamic duo.

572
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:41,919
Oh, that wasn't fair.

573
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,090
I still don't agree
with your call,

574
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,292
but I can see why you made it.

575
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,244
- Awful day today.

576
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,147
- So what happened with
this--with this patient?

577
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:14,017
- It presented as a superficial
skin infection.

578
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:17,421
Elias didn't have
any fever, no nausea.

579
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,890
He certainly didn't manifest
any risk factors

580
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:23,494
for necrotizing fasciitis.

581
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:27,831
He was nondiabetic,
not in renal failure.

582
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,535
So I gave him an oral doxy,

583
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,336
and I sent him on his way.

584
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,277
I misdiagnosed him.

585
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,312
I feel like hell.

586
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,816
- Hey, everybody
makes mistakes,

587
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,084
but tell me if I'm wrong.

588
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:51,889
Maybe you didn't used
to make so many?

589
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:55,192
- Our own little morbidity
immortality, huh?

590
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,564
Dan, I see upwards
of 50 patients a day now.

591
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:04,434
Between the lousy reimbursements
and my overhead,

592
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,336
I need that many
just to stay afloat,

593
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:10,941
I had to hire two people
just to deal with it.

594
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,342
- Health care bureaucracy.

595
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:15,379
I mean, it's tough on
both the patient and the doc.

596
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:18,282
- You know,
when a young person

597
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:21,084
comes and they ask me,
"Should I go into medicine?"

598
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:23,187
you know what I tell them?

599
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,588
No way.

600
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,324
Go get an MBA
and enjoy your life.

601
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,941
- That didn't hurt, did it?

602
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,045
Oh, you are so brave.

603
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,013
- Was that the shot?
- Nope.

604
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,249
That's just the alcohol
to make sure your arm is clean.

605
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,285
- Is that the shot?
- Nope.

606
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,087
I'm gonna give it to you
on the count of three, okay?

607
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,322
One, two--

608
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,025
- Where's three?

609
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,561
- That's it.
You got the shot.

610
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,966
- Mrs. Schroeder's
not feeling well.

611
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,902
- Have your teacher call 911,

612
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,303
and tell the other doctor
I need him.

613
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,205
Can you breathe?

614
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,518
- Natalie!

615
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,354
- Epiglottitis.
Airway's blocked.

616
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:33,056
Mouth-to-mouth isn't working.
Get me something.

618
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,473
Help me hold her hands down.

619
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,074
Hurry.

620
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,511
- Natalie, here.

621
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,215
- I know it's hard,

622
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:01,118
but try slow even breaths, okay?

623
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,086
- Mouth-to-mouth?
She's type B, Natalie.

624
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,455
What were you thinking?
- I had to do something.

<i>[sirens wailing]</i>

626
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:11,028
The ambulance is on its way.
You're gonna be okay.

.

628
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,041
- Theresa Schroeder.
Haemophilus influenza B.

629
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,977
- The ENT is waiting
for you in trauma three.

630
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,679
- All right.

631
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:31,181
- Terry? Shiloh's teacher?

632
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,516
- This is what happens
when you don't vaccinate.

633
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,318
- You don't know that
this was Shiloh's fault.

634
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,453
- That lady almost died,
and she may have infected

635
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,155
my friend,
who has a newborn baby.

636
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,157
- Terry's probably sick
because her immune system

637
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,458
is shot from a lifetime
of vaccinations.

638
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,994
- You docs,
you think you know it all.

639
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,462
How--how many times
you been wrong?

640
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,497
Urine therapy?
Radium for diarrhea?

641
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:50,300
How many approved drugs
need to be pulled every year

642
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,601
'cause they're killing people?

643
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,603
Fen-phen or Vioxx, Raptiva.

644
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,138
- There's no evidence
the HIB vaccine

645
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,206
has any negative side effects.

646
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,374
- How can you be sure?

647
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,176
Kids get the vaccine
when they're babies.

648
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,677
Who knows what
the long-term effects will be?

649
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,512
- For Shiloh's
long-term health and happiness,

650
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,114
we'll risk
a treatable childhood illness.

651
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,049
- So no child
should be vaccinated, right?

652
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,250
You want your kids in a school

653
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,353
where no one's protected
from polio, smallpox.

654
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,988
- Will, enough.
- No.

655
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,589
You trot out this pseudoscience,

656
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,324
but what you really want
is for every other kid

657
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,460
to be vaccinated
so yours can be safe.

658
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,503
- He has no right
to speak to us like that.

659
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,138
- You're right, he shouldn't
have spoken to you that way.

660
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,506
I'm very sorry.

661
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,313
- Hey.

662
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,215
You know they're
never gonna vaccinate

663
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:39,349
their other kids
after that, right?

664
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,684
- I know.

665
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,453
I know.

666
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,355
I shouldn't have
shot my mouth off.

667
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,027
- It was
because of me, wasn't it?

668
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,729
Because I was exposed.

669
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,400
I think it was very gallant.

670
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,302
- You do?

671
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,643
- Maybe we should talk
about that kiss.

672
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,745
- You asked why
I treat you so badly,

673
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,447
why I say things

674
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,750
I wouldn't say
to anybody else.

675
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:17,287
I'm like a little kid
with a crush on a girl,

676
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,522
so what does he do?

677
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:20,657
He pulls her pigtails.

678
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,831
Look, I understand if you don't
feel the same way.

679
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:31,334
- No.
Listen, pl--please.

680
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:35,806
I don't know
what I would do without you.

681
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,208
But there is
just so much in my life

682
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,776
that I haven't figured out yet.

683
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,778
- You don't have to explain,
Natalie; I--I--I get it.

684
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,381
- No, I don't--
I don't think you do.

685
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:46,516
I am not trying
to let you down gently

686
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,485
or put you off.

687
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,555
I'm just not
in that place yet.

688
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,594
- Okay.

689
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,532
I'm gonna go check
on the teacher.

690
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,568
You should get a booster.

691
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,269
- Okay.

692
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,877

00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,594
- I'm sorry, Dr. Unger.
I didn't have a choice.

695
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:40,564
I'll need your hospital ID.

696
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,950
- Okay.

697
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,548

It's basic chem.

00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,617
- Noah?

699
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,354
- Hey.

700
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:40,557
that I am gonna file
an incident report.

701
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,393
- What's going on?
Is someone making you do this?

702
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:44,961
- No, no.
It's my decision.

703
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,499
- Seriously?

704
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,801
- Yeah.

705
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,370
- Hey, hey, look, look.

706
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:56,039
I get it.
I screwed up.

707
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,642
But you're supposed to be here
for me, not dime me out.

708
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:02,812
[scoffs]

709
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,315
You know what?
You--you're just pissed

710
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:08,418
because I'm the doctor
and you're not.

711
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,655
- Noah, you are my brother,
and I love you...

712
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:14,724
- Mm.
- But you need to grow up.

713
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:17,694
Look at me.
If you're gonna be a doctor,

714
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,863
I want you to be
a good one.

715
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,781
- Dr. Halstead,
what are you doing?

716
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:41,484
- Agh, car wouldn't start.
Waiting on a tow.

717
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:45,522
- Ah, always a perfect way
to end the day.

718
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,057
- Yeah.
- Mm.

719
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,591
- Ms. Goodwin?

720
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,594
I'm sorry I've been
so much trouble.

721
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,798
- Yes, Dr. Halstead.

722
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,867
You have been
a monumental pain in the ass.

723
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,469
- I know.
- Good.

724
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,873
- Oh, and congratulations
on your anniversary.

725
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,075
- Thank you.

726
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:06,643
- I heard you've been
married a long time.

727
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,011
- I have.

728
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,348
- How do you do that?

729
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,016
- Stay out of each other's way

730
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:17,520
and never forget
an anniversary.

731
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,521
Good night.

732
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,856
- Good night.

733
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,369
- That was...

734
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,104
Whew.

735
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:35,638
It was a rough day.

736
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,517
- I have something
to show you.

737
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,160
- [grunts]

738
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,731
Johns Hopkins, huh?

739
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,136
- Head of trauma.

740
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:07,971
- That's quite an offer.

741
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:09,539
- Yeah, it is.

742
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,143
- I hope
you let them down gently.

743
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,156
You know, Baltimore
gets very cold too.

744
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,994
- I know.

745
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,510
- Looks like we had
the same kind of day.

746
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,647
Sweet and strong, please.

747
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,620
- I had a patient
who wanted his LVAD removed.

748
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,789
He got what he wanted.

749
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,157
Now he's dead.

750
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,127
- Huh.

751
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:10,033
I guess I took out
an LVAD myself today.

752
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,572
- How do we ever know
what we're doing is right?

753
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,841
- It's tricky.

754
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:19,542
I mean, the first part
of the Hippocratic oath

755
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:20,543
is clear, right?

756
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:21,845
"Do no harm."

757
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:23,913
Then it goes on to say,

758
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:27,050
"I will remember that
there is art to medicine

759
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,751
as well as science."

760
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,623
So it's tricky.

761
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,528
- It ever get any easier?

762
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,829
- Hope so.

763
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,030
[glasses clink]
