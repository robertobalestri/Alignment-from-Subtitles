3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,230
Hey.

00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,230
Thank you.

00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,530
just gotta turn it over.

00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,530
Sure.

10
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,510
again already?

11
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,560
Looks like it.

12
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,040
What's going on?

13
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,040
Who are they?

14
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,670
Big Brother. Hey.

15
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,110
Oh.

Up.

18
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,970
SHARON: Yeah.

19
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,910
They're doing

20
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,910
a surprise site survey.

21
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,950
Who's JCAHO?

MAGGIE: The Joint Commission.

23
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,540
They rate

24
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,540
the performance standards

25
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,990

00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,990
and certify them.

27
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,180
So far, JCAHO's reports

28
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,180
have been positive.

29
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,450
So let's keep it that way.

30
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,820
Stick to protocols

31
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,090
and with big smiles.

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,560

37
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,290
Sorry, I'm with

38
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,290

40
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,440
Mmm-hmm.

41
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,440
And "discipline"?

42
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,840
Is that a nice way of

43
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,840
saying I'm a tight-ass?

44
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,240
Oh, yes, tight.

45
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,900
I didn't say that.

46
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,970
(CHUCKLES)

47
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,870
And, uh, getting

48
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,870
those docs in line,

49
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,040
isn't that the Chief

50
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,040
Resident's job anyway?

51
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,110
SHARON: Wonderful.

52
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,710
The guy enforcing the rules

53
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,010
is the one who's

54
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,010
always breaking them.

55
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,080

He was walking with his wife

five of Haldol.

145

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,320

proximal humerus fracture.

150
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,630
How are his labs?

Calcium was elevated.

153
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,860

00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,860
a kidney stone down the road,

155
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
but it's likely

156
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
he's had a few before.

a quadruple bypass,

160
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,470
had it done at Northwestern

161
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,470
five years ago.

162
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,180
He remembers the details?

163
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,440
Yeah, he's lucid, somewhat.

164
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,040
All right, EKG is normal,

165
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,020
but because of

166
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,020
the prior heart surgery,

167
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,310
I'm gonna repeat it

168
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,310

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,240

Okay, honey, eight across.

411
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,780
It's five letters,

412
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,780
and the clue is

413
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,780
"rental agreement."

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,080
And the first letter

415
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,080
is "L".

416
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,030
I'm thinking

417
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,030
the second is "E".

Good. Good, honey.

463
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,940
if we may?

466
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,950

Nathan's bypass grafts.

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,350
His aorta is

469
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,350
leaking blood.

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,120
A pseudoaneurysm.

472
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,020
How bad?

473
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,130
Right now,

474
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,130
it's just a slow drip.

475
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,130
It hasn't ruptured yet.

476
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,930
So there's still

477
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,930
an opportunity to operate,

478
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,900
repair the suture line,

479
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,900
and plug the hole?

480
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,130
Normally, yes.

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,700
of the operation.

486
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,720
His odds of surviving

487
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,720
the procedure plummet.

488
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,040
So if surgery isn't

489
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,040
a viable option, what is?

490
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,190
Given the circumstances,

491
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,930
we feel the safest choice

492
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,930
is to make Nathan comfortable.

493
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,130
How long?

744
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,920

770
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,790

presented with

774
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,770
the same evidence,

775
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,330
I would have done

776
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,330
exactly the same thing,

777
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,870
reached exactly

778
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,870
the same diagnosis.

779
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,000
Anybody would've.

780
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,480
You didn't, I did.

781
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,910
And if I had caught

782
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,910
the PTH four years ago,

783
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,620
Nathan doesn't

784
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,620
run into traffic,

785
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,620
doesn't get hit by a car.

786
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,350
Today never happens.

787
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,150
He's dying and it's

788
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,150
entirely my fault.

789
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,130
(PANTING)

790
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,400
PAUL: Help! Please.

791
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,730
Anybody! I need help!

792
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,200
Ethan? Ethan, talk to me.

793
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,380
Ethan, do you copy?

794
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,840
Let's go.

795
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,940
MAN: Living room's clear.

796
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,310
(EXHALES)

797
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,950
(GRUNTS)

798
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,870
Thank God.

799
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,440
Paul.

800
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,440
Help me, please.

801
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,500
Paul, I'm Dr. Choi.

802
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,180
Hey, your heart's racing.

803
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,180
When's the last time

804
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,180
you had any fluids?

805
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,240
(EXHALES)

806
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,650
My leg, I burned it.

807
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,050
I see that.

808
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,210
Don't touch that.

809
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,330
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

810
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,460
How did this happen?

811
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,640
While I was cooking,

812
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,640
I tripped.

813
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,830
I spilled the frying

814
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,830
pan grease. (GRUNTS)

815
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,440
This didn't just happen.

816
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,780
This burn is thick, leathery.

817
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,780
Twenty-four hours old?

818
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,070
Why didn't you

819
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,070
seek help sooner?

820
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,520
Didn't want anybody

821
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,520
to see how I live.

822
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,080
Okay.

823
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,020
I'm here now.

824
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,020
I'm gonna take care of you.

825
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,490
(GRUNTS)

826
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,720
DR. HARPER:

827
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,720
Brachytherapy seed.

828
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,990
Yep.

829
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,730
Doesn't happen often,

830
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,730
but it can get

831
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,730
expelled in the urine.

832
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,030
So, um, how

833
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,030
radioactive is it?

834
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,330
To us, it's harmless.

835
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,500
Still, don't touch it

836
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,500
with your bare hands.

837
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,930
Oh!

838
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,500
So you're not

839
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,500
gonna dispose of it?

840
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,600
Not on JCAHO day. Sorry.

841
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,780
Call the Radiation

842
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,780
Safety Officer.

843
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,510
Oh, man. Here we go.

844
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,610
LAURA: I get it. You didn't

845
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,610
do Nathan's bypass surgery.

846
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,120
You don't know what

847
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,120
you're walking into.

848
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,180
I can get you

849
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,180
every angio he had.

850
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,090
You will know exactly

851
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,090
where the surgeon

852
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,090
placed every suture.

853
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,460
The bigger issues are

854
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,460
the adhesions and scar tissue

855
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,470
that have formed over

856
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,470
the last five years.

857
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,270
We can expose a healthy heart

858
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,270
in 10 or 15 minutes.

859
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,500
After a quadruple

860
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,500
bypass surgery,

861
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,470
it could take hours.

862
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,310
An infinite number

863
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,310
of complications could arise.

864
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,250
When I decided to

865
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,250
make Nathan comfortable,

866
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,110
I believed he had

867
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,110
a neurological

868
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,110
death sentence.

869
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,280
Now, it's a whole

870
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,280
new world.

871
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,890
The dementia

872
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,890
can be reversed.

873
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,790
I understand, but the fact

874
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,790
that he doesn't have LBD

875
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,380
doesn't make

876
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,380
the surgery any easier.

877
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,230
Nathan's odds of dying

878
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,230
in that operating room

879
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,460
are just as high

880
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,460
as they ever were.

881
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,400
It's still my recommendation

882
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,400
to not operate.

883
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,990
I'm sorry.

884
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,330
I'll do the surgery.

885
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,940
Thank you.

886
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,540
Thank you for

887
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,540
giving us a second chance.

888
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,880
Difficult is

889
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,880
not impossible.

890
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,530
ETHAN:

891
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,530
Brett, how close are you?

892
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,060
Ugh, Ethan, finally.

893
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,060
You okay?

894
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,470
I'm fine, but Paul's got

895
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,470
a serious third-degree burn

896
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,670
that needs to be

897
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,670
released in the ED. ETA?

898
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,270
BRETT: I think we're

899
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,270
almost to the kitchen.

900
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,510
We need more room

901
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,510
for the gear.

902
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,240
PARROT: Don't touch that.

903
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,240
Get away.

904
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,210
Get away.

905
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,210
Who was that?

906
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,810
The other person

907
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,810
I heard, a parrot.

908
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,240
Look, you still have

909
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,240
the hallway to deal with

910
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,790
and Paul's foot's

911
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,790
still swelling.

912
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,290
No pulse in

913
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,290
the instep or ankle.

914
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,380
BRETT: All right, uh, we're

915
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,380
coming as fast as we can.

916
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,550
But not fast enough?

917
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,600
Okay, Paul,

918
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,600
here's the deal.

919
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,890
Your skin's so burned,

920
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,440
blood can't get in

921
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,440
or out of your foot.

922
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,330
I'm gonna cut into

923
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,330
your leg on both sides

924
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,810
of the burn to

925
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,810
release the pressure.

926
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,400
Here?

927
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,400
I wait any longer,

928
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,670
you're gonna lose

929
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,670
your foot.

930
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,300
But is it going

931
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,300
to hurt?

932
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,370
Already pushed

933
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,370
morphine in your IV.

934
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,370
That'll help.

935
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,380
But I'll feel it?

936
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,050
Focus on me, not my hands.

937
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,220
It'll be over

938
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,220
before you know it, okay?

939
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,260
Deep breath.

940
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,310
(INHALES DEEPLY)

941
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,690
Then exhale.

942
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,690
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

943
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,650
(GROANS)

944
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,760
Keep breathing, Paul.

945
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,760
Keep breathing. Big breath.

946
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,320
(INHALES)

947
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,030
Bigger exhale. (EXHALES)

948
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,260
Done.

949
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,770
Good job, Paul.

950
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,530
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

951
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,940
Good job.

952
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,040
A high white cell count?

953
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,040
What does that mean?

954
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,820
You probably

955
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,820
have an infection.

956
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,580
From Boomer?

957
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,580
It's possible.

958
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,850
Have you felt

959
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,850
sick recently?

960
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,050
No, not really.

961
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,920
I mean, every now and then

962
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,920
my throat aches a little.

963
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,260
Doesn't really

964
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,260
bother me, though.

965
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,320
Hmm.

966
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,960
The lymph nodes are swollen.

967
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,970
Consistent with an upper

968
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,970
respiratory infection.

969
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,670
Let's get

970
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,670
a rapid strep test.

971
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,480
What kind of dog

972
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,480
is Boomer?

973
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,170
Boxer-bulldog mix,

974
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,170
a rescue.

975
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,470
When I went to the shelter,

976
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,470
all the dogs swarmed me.

977
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,210
But Boomer hung back.

978
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,710
Not because he was shy.

979
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,520
It was a move

980
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,520
so he'd stand out.

981
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,850
He was playing me. (CHUCKLES)

982
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,650
Smart dog.

983
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,260
I'm gonna swab

984
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,260
the back of your throat.

985
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,530
I'll get this to the lab.

986
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,530
(INHALES DEEPLY)

987
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,210
I'm doing what

988
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,210
I think is right.

989
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,210
Nathan's mental impairment

990
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,210
is due to a pea-sized tumor

991
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,550
that is easily removable.

992
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,350
A 45-minute operation

993
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,350
will cure him.

994
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,180
But first, (SIGHS)

995
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,190
he has to survive

996
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,190
this monumentally

997
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,190
difficult surgery.

998
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,040
I'm sorry,

999
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,040
you can't bring your dog

1000
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,040
into the hospital.

1001
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,740
It's my sister's dog.

1002
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,740
She's somewhere

1003
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,970
in the back

1004
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,970
not answering her texts.

1005
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Only service dogs in the ED.

1006
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
I'm sorry.

1007
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,570
Is this Boomer?

1008
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,670
How'd you know?

1009
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,320
I've been

1010
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,320
taking care of Tara.

1011
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,510
She said he was

1012
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,510
a boxer-bulldog mix.

1013
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,350
I thought it was only

1014
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,350
gonna be one or two hours.

1015
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,390
It's been five.

1016
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,390
Is she okay?

1017
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,920
She spiked a low fever

1018
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,920
and we're testing for strep.

1019
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,650
Strep? This is nothing.

1020
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,650
Okay, good.

1021
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,190
Look, I have

1022
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,190
to go to work.

1023
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,920
There's no pets

1024
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,920
allowed in my building.

1025
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,790
He barks one time,

1026
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,790
and I can get evicted.

1027
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,760
I'm sorry. There's nowhere

1028
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,760
else to take him.

1029
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,670
Oh. No, no, no.

1030
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,670
I can't take this...

1031
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,670
I know.

1032
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,540
It all happened

1033
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,540
really fast.

1034
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,540
What do I do?

1035
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,590
Get him

1036
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,590
out of here, now.

1037
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,380
But where do I take...

1038
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,380
Reese, I don't care where.

1039
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,890
Just out.

1040
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,380

1042
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,190
Yeah, Earl, this is Boomer,

1043
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,560
could you watch him

1044
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,560
for a minute?

1045
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,930
But don't get too close,

1046
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,930
because he...

1047
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,230
Come on, fella.

1048
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,030
Come on, guy, let's go.

1049
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,860
Come on, big boy.

1050
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,460
There you go.

1051
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,700
Okay. Okay.

1052
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,610
When I'm out, the city

1053
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,610
will condemn my home.

1054
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,880
Won't they?

1055
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,750
Fresh start, I guess.

1056
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,420
Get away.

1057
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,420
Don't touch that.

1058
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,650
Don't touch that.

1062
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,900
For a second there

1063
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,900
it sounded like you...

Little hairy for a while,

1065
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,400
that's all.

All right, guys.

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,570
Got it.

he barked at.

and go slow.

get him on the pump,

so we can do the repair.

No, I don't need the pump.

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,070
I have cancer?

1160
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:05,140
The next step is a biopsy

1161
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:05,140
to determine exactly

1162
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:05,140
which kind.

1163
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,040
But I'm only 26.

1164
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,580
I go to the gym every day.

1165
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,580
I don't smoke.

1166
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,950
I know. It's not fair.

1167
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,380
But I don't feel sick.

1168
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,980
Well, that's because

1169
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,980
it was caught early.

1170
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,080
You have time to

1171
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,080
get way ahead of this.

1172
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,080
Mmm-hmm.

1173
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,830
The lymph nodes

1174
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,830
are around here, aren't they?

1175
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,900
Boomer's been

1176
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,900
nipping at me for a month.

1177
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,900
Always right there.

1178
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,660
Do you think he knew?

1179
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,530
Maybe.

1180
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:37,340
It seems some dogs

1181
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:37,340
can smell cancers

1182
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,070
even in the very

1183
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,070
early stages.

1184
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,750
Yeah, he wasn't

1185
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,750
attacking you.

1186
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,050
He was trying

1187
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,050
to protect you.

1188
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,650
(CHUCKLES)

1189
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,320
Maggie, what's going on

1190
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,320
with Treatment Four?

1191
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,830
MAGGIE: I know, I know.

1192
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,830
We don't have

1193
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,830
the space for this...

1194
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,090
It's been all day.

1195
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,900
Dr. Halstead,

1196
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,900
Environmental Services

1197
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,900
hasn't shown up yet.

1198
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,630
I can't even get an estimate

1199
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,630
as to when they will.

1200
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,740
(EXHALES) I'll go

1201
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,740
see them in person.

1202
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,530
I'll drag someone

1203
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,530
down here if I have to.

1204
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,700
Knock some heads.

1205
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,270
I need that room back.

1206
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,180
How's he doing?

1207
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,930
Well.

1208
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,020
Good.

1209
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,260
How are you doing?

1210
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,300
As a neurologist,

1211
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,670
Lewy Body Dementia

1212
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,670
was my worst nightmare.

1213
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,900
I'd seen so many cases.

1214
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,380
And I'm wondering

1215
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,380
if it influenced

1216
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,380
my diagnosis.

1217
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,640
Hmm.

1218
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,250
Medicine,

1219
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,710
you know,

1220
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,250
imperfect science.

1221
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,150
Practiced by

1222
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,150
human beings, no less.

1223
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,320
Four years we could've

1224
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,320
been doing CTs.

1225
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,200
But I had an answer,

1226
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,200
so there was no reason

1227
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,260
to continue

1228
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,260
radiating his brain.

1229
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,940
I robbed Nathan

1230
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,940
of his mind,

1231
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,930
imprisoned him.

1232
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,840
I drained our savings,

1233
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,040
squandered our time together,

1234
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,180
time that we can

1235
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,180
never get back.

1236
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
How am I gonna

1237
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
tell him what I've done?

1238
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,030
He's never

1239
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,030
gonna forgive me.

1240
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,430
Your husband's gonna

1241
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,430
forgive you, Laura.

1242
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,360
Want you to

1243
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,360
trust me on that.

1244
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,600
Your struggle,

1245
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,370
if I may,

1246
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,810
is figuring out

1247
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,810
how you're gonna

1248
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,810
forgive yourself.

1249
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,790
Vitals are stable.

1250
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,790
EKG looks good.

1251
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,300
Cleveland Clinic

1252
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,300
has an axiom.

1253
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,000
Emergency surgery

1254
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,000
on a healthy heart,

1255
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,930
yes.

1256
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,830
Re-do surgery

1257
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,830
for a repaired heart,

1258
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,170
yes.

1259
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,580
Emergency surgery

1260
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,580
for a repaired heart,

1261
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,710
no.

1262
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,510
Because, overwhelmingly,

1263
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,720
those patients

1264
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,720
die on the table.

1265
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,990
Couldn't do nothing.

1266
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,320
I suspect it was ego

1267
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,320
more than altruism.

1268
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,730
Great surgeons

1269
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,730
know the balance.

1270
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,540
You're confident,

1271
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,540
not arrogant.

1272
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,110
I like that, Dr. Rhodes.

1273
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,710
Nice job today.

1274
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,050
(CHUCKLES)

1275
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,360
You're good. You're good.

1276
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,350
Good boy. Good boy.

1277
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,200
Don't come from above.

1278
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,470
Come from the front

1279
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,470
so he can see you.

1280
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,030
And hold out

1281
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,030
the back of your hand first.

1282
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,900
Okay.

1283
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,900
Come on, buddy.

1284
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,670
Yeah?

1285
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,670
Yeah.

1286
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,310
Hey. There.

1287
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,370
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1288
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,750
Did you ever hear

1289
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,750
that origin story

1290
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,750
about dogs?

1291
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,320
In Eden,

1292
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,320
humans and animals got along,

1293
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,320
even spoke the same language.

1294
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,990
But when Adam and Eve sinned

1295
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,990
and God drove them out,

1296
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,190
a great chasm opened up

1297
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,190
between people and animals.

1298
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,890
And as the chasm grew wider,

1299
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,890
at the very last moment,

1300
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:59,270
a dog leaped

1301
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:59,270
across it to be with us.

1302
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,340
SARAH:

1303
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,340
That's a great story.

1304
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,010
Yeah.

1305
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,780
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1306
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,840
Come in.

1307
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,290
Ms. Goodwin, can I

1308
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,290
talk to you for a moment?

1309
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,350
Quickly. I'm on

1310
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,350
the homestretch with JCAHO

1311
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,350
and I don't wanna let up now.

1312
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,490
I know my voice

1313
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,490
isn't official,

1314
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,500
but I'd like to put in

1315
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,500
a good word for Will

1316
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,470
regarding the open

1317
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,470
ED Attending position.

1318
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,690
Really?

1319
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,860
It'd be a shame

1320
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,860
to lose him.

1321
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,630
He's a great doctor.

1322
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,630
He cares about this hospital.

1323
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,700
Just a few weeks ago,

1324
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,700
you asked to be

1325
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,700
taken off his shifts.

1326
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,210
We don't always

1327
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,210
see eye-to-eye,

1328
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,840
but his heart is

1329
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,840
in the right place.

1330
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,880
Well, Dr. Manning,

1331
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,880
I'm glad your opinion

1332
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,880
of Dr. Halstead has changed.

1333
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,280
Okay.

1334
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,550
(GRUNTS)

1335
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,620
Dr. Halstead,

1336
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,620
Environmental Services

1337
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,620
are on their way?

1338
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,730
Nope.

1339
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,830
It turns out every department

1340
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,830
in the hospital's calling ES

1341
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,270
to handle things

1342
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,270
they normally

1343
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,270
take care of themselves.

1344
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,210
Be tomorrow before

1345
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,210
a janitor shows up.

1346
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,740
Ah, bureaucracy.

1347
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,240
Phew!

1348
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,970
Mmm.

1349
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,580
Yeah.

1350
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,860
There. The room

1351
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,860
is yours again.

1352
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,550
Against protocol.

1353
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,930
I won't tell

1354
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,930
if you won't.

1355
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,490
Well, guess that means

1356
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,490
I get to clean this up now.

1357
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,500
The way I wanted to

1358
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,500
eight hours ago.

1359
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,900
(CHUCKLES)

1360
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,100
You know what?

1361
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,100
Toss me a pair.

1362
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,500
Oh?

1363
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,500
You know,

1364
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,540
the kind that stick to yours

1365
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,540
when you pull 'em out.

1366
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,110
You want in?

1367
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,110
Heck, yeah.

1368
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,970
We've come this far.

1369
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,250
And they call you RoboCop.

1370
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,640
(CLEARS THROAT)

1371
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,950
RoboCop?

1372
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,350
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

1373
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,720
Katrina.

1374
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,390
Reese, come with me.

1375
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,090
Uh-oh.

1376
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,100
Yeah, I've seen that look.

1377
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,570
Dr. Rhodes.

1378
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,570
Everyone,

1379
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,740
look, we all know

1380
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,740
how important JCAHO site

1381
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,740
visits are.

1382
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,610
Yet, despite what I

1383
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,610
said about the rules,

1384
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,680
my team ordered

1385
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,680
tests on the sly,

1386
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,150
brought a dog into the ED,

1387
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,350
and handled

1388
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,350
radioactive material.

1389
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,360
Sharon, you have every right

1390
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,360
to be upset, really.

1391
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,330
But we can't

1392
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,330
really be ignoring

1393
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,570
the second law of

1394
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,570
thermodynamics here,

1395
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,570
now, can we?

1396
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,400
How's that?

1397
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,440
Well, systems do tend

1398
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,440
to degenerate

1399
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,070
into evermore

1400
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,070
disordered versions

1401
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,070
of themselves, right?

1402
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,350
I mean, look around you,

1403
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,180
all we're doing

1404
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,180
here all day long

1405
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,150
is battle the universe's

1406
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,150
desire to fall apart.

1407
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,310
Yeah.

1408
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,060
Wish you had seen

1409
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,060
the house I was in today.

1410
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,960
DANIEL: I'm just saying,

1411
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,960
I love rules, we all do.

1412
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,790
But in bringing

1413
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,790
order to disorder

1414
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,790
every now and then

1415
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,520
a couple

1416
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,520
are gonna get bent.

1417
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,730
Nice try, Daniel.

1418
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,500
But the good news is

1419
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,200
JCAHO didn't catch

1420
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,200
any of you.

1421
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,770
So we keep our top rating.

1422
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,170
I'll see you all tomorrow.

1423
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,410
"Second law

1424
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,410
of thermodynamics."

1425
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,410
Please. (CHUCKLES)
