1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,840
Isn't it finally time

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,840
you admitted I'm

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,840
quicker, old man?

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,980
These young boys

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,980
always come out

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,980
both side of their mouth.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,770
Uh, what you run the 40

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,770
in at the Combine?

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,110
Um, four. Four six.

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,110
TATE: That's good.

11
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,680
That's fast.

12
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,680
Four. Four two.

13
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,740
Ooh.

14
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,420
If you're even I'm leavin',

15
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,420
baby. You gotta keep up.

16
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,220
You know what I'm sayin'?

17
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,220
Got it.

18
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,590
I literally have no idea

19
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,590
what just happened.

20
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,920
Baby, now you know how I feel

21
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,050
when I come pick you up

22
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,050
from work.

23
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,890
Everybody running

24
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,890
around talking about,

25
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,620
"Let me get me 50 cc's of epi,

26
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,620
stat!"

27
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,690
And I'm like...

28
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,690
Fifty cc's of epi?

29
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,860
You trying to

30
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,860
kill my patient?

31
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,860
Baby. Mmm.

32
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,900
Doc in the house.

33
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,900
Looks good.

34
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,130
What's going on, man?

35
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,130
I'm good, man.

36
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,040
MAN: Hey, let me set you

37
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,040
up in the bedroom.

38
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,040
Yeah. Sure, sure.

39
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,400
Noah?

40
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,400
Hey.

41
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,910
What's up, man?

42
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,910
What's happenin', bro?

43
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,480
What's up?

44
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,550
Gotta get these fellas ready

45
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,550
for morning practice.

46
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,980
Gonna get your fast break

47
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,980
on point tomorrow,

48
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,980
I'm telling you.

49
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,550
Sounds good. Come on.

50
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,060
All right.

51
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,060
I'll be right back.

52
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,490
What's he doing here?

53
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,090
He said he wanted

54
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,090
to meet some players.

55
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,500
MAN: So, what's all this, man?

56
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,170
NOAH: All right, so, this is

57
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,170
my "Recovery Ultra," okay?

58
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,140
It's filled with

59
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,140
electrolytes

60
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,140
and anti-oxidants.

61
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,010
MAN: Yeah,

62
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,010
that sounds real good.

63
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,910
Um, but first, I wanna

64
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,910
get you guys started

65
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,910
with some B12, okay?

66
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,490
Babe.

67
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,490
(SIGHS)

68
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,450
I gotta go home.

69
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,450
What's wrong?

70
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,750
Nothing. I just have

71
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,750
an early shift

72
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,750
in the morning.

73
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,560
Okay. I'll drive you.

74
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,560
No, no, no.

75
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,960
You stay with your friends.

76
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,960
I just texted for a ride.

77
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,130
Honeymooners

78
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,130
with food poisoning.

79
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,130
Take 'em to four.

80
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,670
You can say it.

81
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,670
What?

82
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,900
You were right

83
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,900
about athletes.

84
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,970
Ah!

85
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,270
What happened?

86
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,270
KENNY: Help!

87
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,140
Get me a gurney.

88
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,140
Dr. Manning,

89
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,140
we're going to Six!

90
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,650
My stomach is on fire!

91
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,850
What's your name,

92
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,850
sweetheart?

93
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,180
It's Ellie Newman.

94
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,810
It's okay.

95
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,810
We're gonna take good

96
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,810
care of you, all right?

97
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,690
Get me a gurney!

98
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,690
MALE NURSE: On it, Maggie.

99
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,380
Get ready to

100
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,380
raise the head.

101
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,830
Let's start an IV.

102
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,830
On it.

103
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,730
Are you her father?

104
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,730
Uh, yeah.

105
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,630
She eat anything that

106
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,630
could've made her sick?

107
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,170
Um, no. She ate what I ate.

108
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,000
How old is your daughter?

109
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,000
Uh, she's 16.

110
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,800
Is she on any medications?

111
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,800
Any medical issues

112
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,800
we should know about?

113
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,460
I don't think so.

114
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,460
I don't know.

115
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,940
When did this start?

116
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,370
KENNY: Uh, last night.

117
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,670
Did you take any

118
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,670
drugs? Alcohol?

119
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,480
Were you at a party?

120
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,480
No!

121
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,010
I was just trying

122
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,010
on my prom dress.

123
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,140
Oh, baby.

124
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,810
BP is 133 over 88,

125
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,810
heart rate 112. Sat's 99%.

126
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,550
Give her 0.2

127
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,550
of hydromorphone.

128
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,960
No! No drugs!

129
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,030
Sweetie, you're in pain.

130
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,030
Let us help you.

131
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,030
No, I don't

132
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,030
want any drugs!

133
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,550
What?

134
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,360
She doesn't want

135
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,360
to end up like me.

136
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,080
FAST is negative,

137
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,080
i-STAT labs normal.

138
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,180
So, it's probably

139
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,180
not a surgical issue?

140
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,850
I'd like to put a scope

141
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,850
in her just to make sure

142
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,910
we're not missing anything.

143
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,460
Without pain meds?

144
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,790
We could try a non-narcotic,

145
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,790
maybe she'll go for that.

146
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,850
(SIGHS)

147
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,220
Hi, Ellie, Mr. Newman,

148
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,220
this is Dr. Rhodes,

149
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,220
our trauma surgeon.

150
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,100
I've asked him to consult.

151
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,100
Has Ellie ever

152
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,100
experienced this before?

153
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,100
A year ago.

154
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,200
A year ago.

155
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,070
How long did it last?

156
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,840
Maybe, like,

157
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,840
three weeks.

158
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,470
Your daughter

159
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,470
was sick like this

160
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,670
for three weeks

161
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,670
and you didn't know?

162
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,070
I was...

163
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,140
Strung out.

164
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,040
Yeah.

165
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,740
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

166
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,720
Ellie, we're gonna

167
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,720
give you a painkiller

168
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,720
that's a non-narcotic.

169
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,420
No, I don't want anything.

170
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,090
The girl won't even

171
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,090
take two aspirin.

172
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,690
Did you see a doctor

173
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,690
for your last attack?

174
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,840
He couldn't find anything.

175
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,840
He sent me to a psychologist.

176
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,770
But I'm not

177
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,770
making this up.

178
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,630
Don't worry, Ellie,

179
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,180
we're gonna get to the bottom

180
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,180
of this.

181
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,780
I don't know,

182
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,780
she's in a lot of pain.

183
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,940
Maybe it is psychological.

184
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,820
I'll page Dr. Charles.

185
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,320
Dr. Rhodes. Your sister's

186
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,320
on line two.

187
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,320
Yeah.

188
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,720
Right, tell her I need

189
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,720
to reschedule.

190
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,580
Like you did last week?

191
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,150
Yes, Maggie, like I did

192
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,150
last week.

193
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,030
Ms. Rhodes,

194
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,030
he's with a patient.

195
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,930
He said he won't be able

196
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,930
to make lunch today,

197
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,300
but he'll call you

198
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,300
back to reschedule.

199
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,400
Okay.

200
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,400
Hey, Maggie.

201
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,440
Do you by any chance

202
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,440
know of a good contractor?

203
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,530
For what?

204
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,710
I'm thinking about

205
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,710
turning the basement

206
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,580
into a man cave for Bert.

207
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,210
Oh, trying to buy him off,

208
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,950
so he'll stop bugging you

209
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,950
about retiring?

210
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,350
Something like that.

211
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,390
Yeah, I got a cousin.

212
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,390
Not too big a crook.

213
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,150
Text me his number.

214
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,150
I will.

215
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,420
Dr. Halstead.

216
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,620
Maggie.

217
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,630
I got a patient in two

218
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,630
that's from your

219
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,630
old hood Canaryville.

220
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,830
Thought you

221
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,830
might be interested.

222
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,990
Sure.

223
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,930
Vitals?

224
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,610
BP 164 over 90.

225
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,610
Heart rate 92, Sat 99%.

226
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,870
Okay, Mr...

227
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,710
Tucker.

228
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,710
You gotta be kidding me.

229
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,980
Ginger Spice

230
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,980
is our doctor?

231
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,210
ANDREW: No way.

232
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,980
Ginger Spice?

233
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,280
What they called me

234
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,280
back at De La Salle.

235
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,550
Well, how about we

236
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,550
get a real doctor?

237
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,920
Dr. Halstead is

238
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,920
a real doctor,

239
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,920
an excellent doctor.

240
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,260
It's okay, Reese. This is

241
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,260
how we gentlemen

242
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,260
relate in Canaryville.

243
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,960
Andrew, what's

244
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,960
going on with that leg?

245
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,300
Swelled up

246
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,300
during my truck route.

247
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,300
Pain won't let up.

248
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,930
Push on my hand

249
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,930
like you're

250
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,930
stepping on the gas.

251
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,600
Come on.

252
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,810
All right, how long

253
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,810
ago did the pain start?

254
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,210
About 12 hours.

255
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,770
Why didn't you

256
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,770
say something?

257
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,140
I would've had Pete

258
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,140
take over your deliveries.

259
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,300
Wasn't this bad at first.

260
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,370
WILL: You on any medication?

261
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,410
ANDREW: No.

262
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,410
Still smoke?

263
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,150
Been cutting back.

264
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,840
Alcohol?

265
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,350
Not much since this

266
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,350
one bumped me up to

267
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,350
Transpo Coordinator.

268
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,480
Gotta be ready to

269
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,480
cover any driver

270
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,480
who calls out.

271
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,030
Hey, you should ask

272
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,030
Ginger about the fight

273
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,030
we had in high school.

274
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,490
I caught him

275
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,490
staring at my girl.

276
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,890
How many times did I

277
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,890
knock you on your ass?

278
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,890
A hundred?

279
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
Sounds about right.

280
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,630
Ever had any pain

281
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,630
or swelling like this before?

282
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,330
Any shortness of breath?

283
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,330
ANDREW: No.

284
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,730
Okay, now we're gonna

285
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,730
start with some basic labs

286
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,600
and get

287
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,600
a duplex scan

288
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,600
of your legs.

289
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,900
And we'll take it

290
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,900
from there.

291
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,350
So, where you

292
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,350
livin' now, Ginger?

293
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,350
Gold Coast?

294
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,140
Not quite. I'll get

295
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,140
those orders started.

296
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,720
Were they always

297
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,720
like that?

298
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,620
The Tucker brothers

299
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,620
were very popular.

300
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,360
And they loved

301
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,360
sticking it to us

302
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,360
lesser mortals.

303
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,560
Go ahead and

304
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,560
order an ultrasound

305
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,560
of Mr. Tucker's leg.

306
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,450
April.

307
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,420
Hi.

308
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,500
How's my guy?

309
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,700
Better.

310
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,700
Much better.

311
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,030
Coming in for Eric's

312
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,030
check-up upstairs.

313
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,200
Cool.

314
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,730
Hold on. Hold on.

315
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,070
You got little hands.

316
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,070
See if you can

317
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,070
untangle these.

318
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,710
I can do it.

319
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,710
All right.

320
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,980
Please.

321
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,850
I just wanted to

322
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,850
make sure you're okay.

323
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,850
You left in a bit of a hurry.

324
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,730
Look, um, I don't know

325
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,730
if this was such a good idea.

326
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,450
What? What do you mean?

327
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,290
Last night was

328
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,290
just not my scene.

329
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,560
It's not mine

330
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,560
either. I'm...

331
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,330
Okay, it used to be,

332
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,330
but I got Eric now.

333
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,330
Things are different.

334
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,330
Just wanted you

335
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,330
to meet some

336
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,330
old friends, that's all.

337
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,400
Mmm-hmm.

338
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,530
Yeah. I don't know.

339
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,530
I have to get back to work.

340
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Daddy! I did it.

341
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,010
(CHUCKLES)

342
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,010
Good job.

343
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,610
Bye.

344
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,270
(EXHALES)

345
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,590
It's a tough situation, man.

346
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,590
Sixteen years old,

347
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,590
taking care of herself,

348
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,430
and her

349
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,430
heroin-addicted father.

350
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,430
And doing it for years.

351
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,200
She said she was

352
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,200
trying on her prom dress.

353
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,900
I mean, could that

354
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,900
have been

355
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,900
some kind of trigger?

356
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,130
And maybe the pain

357
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,130
is psychosomatic?

358
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,130
Possibly.

359
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,870
I don't really know

360
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,870
enough to make that call.

361
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,370
We have to figure

362
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,370
out what's going on,

363
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,310
and the only way

364
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,310
we're gonna do that

365
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,310
is if we scope her.

366
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,110
We can't unless we

367
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,110
get her to accept

368
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,110
pain meds or an anesthetic.

369
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,350
Given her family history,

370
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,820
we have to take

371
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,820
her concern for

372
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,820
addiction very seriously.

373
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,320
Okay. So, what do we do?

374
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,820
Well, how about

375
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,820
good old-fashioned

376
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,820
topical numbing agent?

377
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,690
No. Worth a shot.

378
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,300
(ELLIE SOBBING)

379
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,030
That's okay, sweetie,

380
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,030
we will take care of them.

381
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,010
Dr. Choi,

382
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,010
April. Doris,

383
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,010
open that door.

384
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,140
Neela Desai,

385
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,140
32 weeks pregnant

386
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,140
and contracting.

387
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,910
Got it.

388
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,910
Let's rotate the chair.

389
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,140
Mommy.

390
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,310
Go with the nurse, okay?

391
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,870
Let's take them

392
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,870
to the break room

393
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,870
to get a snack, okay?

394
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,320
Okay, mama.

395
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,210
We're going to take

396
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,210
care of your mommy and

397
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,220
then we're gonna

398
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,220
come and get you. Okay?

399
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,310
(SCREAMS)

400
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,720
Okay. Let's go.

401
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,050
Go ahead, love,

402
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,050
take them to

403
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,050
the break room.

404
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,320
Lie back, so,

405
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,320
the doctor can

406
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,320
examine you, okay?

407
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,290
There you go.

408
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,290
Take this out, please?

409
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,890
Okay. You're in

410
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,890
good hands, love.

411
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,190
Okay.

412
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,160
I can't have this baby!

413
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,160
It's not due for

414
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,160
another two months.

415
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,530
Page OB.

416
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,770
BP 142 over 90.

417
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,530
That's high, probably due to

418
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,530
anxiety or the pain.

419
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,600
Just to be safe, I'm gonna

420
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,600
order some labs, okay?

421
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,350
Now, you're gonna

422
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,350
feel a little pressure.

423
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,180
She's bleeding

424
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,180
from the cervix.

425
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,650
Grab six-gram mag

426
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,650
bolus and call OB,

427
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,650
tell them we're coming up.

428
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,990
Wait. What's going on?

429
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,420
Ms. Desai, you may be

430
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,420
experiencing an abruption,

431
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,290
your placenta is separating

432
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,290
from the wall of your uterus.

433
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,920
The overall picture

434
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,920
suggests something

435
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,490
called preeclampsia

436
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,490
with HELLP syndrome.

437
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,860
What does that mean?

438
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,230
It means

439
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,230
that we need to

440
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,230
deliver this baby now.

441
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,290
No, no, no.

442
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,960
I know 32 weeks

443
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,960
is more premature

444
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,960
than we'd like.

445
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,230
But right now,

446
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,230
your baby is safer

447
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,400
outside of your

448
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,400
body than inside.

449
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,200
Yeah, I can't deliver

450
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,200
this baby premature.

451
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,200
This is not my baby.

452
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,010
I'm a surrogate.

453
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,010
I'm carrying this

454
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,010
baby for someone else.

455
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,210
I need to carry it to term,

456
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,210
or I don't get paid.

457
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,540
ETHAN: If we don't

458
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,540
deliver now,

459
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,450
this condition could be fatal

460
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,450
for both you and the baby.

461
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,450
Yeah, I need the money.

462
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,450
Ms. Desai, I don't...

463
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,820
No! No.

464
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,450
We just got out of

465
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,450
the shelter, okay?

466
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,590
I'm not putting my boys

467
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,390
through another

468
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,390
Chicago winter in one.

469
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,950
So, please, help me!

470
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,670
It was nice

471
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,670
talking to you.

472
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,710
How'd she do on

473
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,710
the psych eval?

474
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,580
In my opinion

475
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,580
Ms. Desai is competent,

476
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,680
capable of making

477
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,680
her own decisions.

478
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,190
Mentally, she's stable.

479
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,460
How can she be stable?

480
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,460
She's risking her

481
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,460
life and the baby's.

482
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,220
She has no

483
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,220
genetic connection

484
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,220
to that baby, Ethan.

485
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,560
Another couple's

486
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,560
fertilized egg is

487
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,560
implanted in her womb.

488
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,230
For her, it's about

489
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,230
making enough money to

490
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,230
take care of her kids.

491
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,570
Then, that's it then,

492
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,570
we have to respect

493
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,570
the patient's wishes.

494
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,000
We can't force her to deliver.

495
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,740
You expect me to just

496
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,740
wait for her to die?

497
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,400
I'll call her

498
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,400
surrogacy agency.

499
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,500
See if they can help

500
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,500
us find a solution.

501
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,760
Trucks are on their way,

502
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,760
just running a little late.

503
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,860
We're backed up with me

504
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,860
out of the office today.

505
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,920
Hey, let me call you back.

506
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,050
You finally figure

507
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,050
out what's going on?

508
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,100
The duplex scan

509
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,100
shows that

510
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,830
the swelling of

511
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,830
your leg is being

512
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,830
caused by a DVT,

513
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,500
a deep vein

514
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,500
thrombosis.

515
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,830
A what?

516
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,830
Okay, English, Halstead.

517
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,630
You've got a blood

518
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,630
clot in your leg.

519
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,740
So, how do you fix it?

520
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,740
Blood thinners.

521
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,280
Enoxaparin is

522
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,280
where I'd start.

523
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,070
No, hold on,

524
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,070
most of the time,

525
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,140
administering a blood thinner

526
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,140
like enoxaparin would

527
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,140
be the right answer,

528
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,880
but given Andrew's history,

529
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,880
I'm leery of doing that.

530
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,610
It could cause

531
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,610
intra-cranial hemorrhaging.

532
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,250
Bleeding?

533
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,250
Yes, in the brain.

534
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,320
I remember you

535
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,320
getting into your

536
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,320
fair share of scuffles

537
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,490
back in high school.

538
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,790
Is that still the case?

539
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,230
Only when the

540
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,230
Packers are in town.

541
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,830
When you've experienced

542
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,830
trauma to the head,

543
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,340
blood thinners are

544
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,340
more likely to make

545
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,340
your brain bleed,

546
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,630
cause you to stroke,

547
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,630
possibly die.

548
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,760
Whoa.

549
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,370
I'm gonna make sure

550
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,370
that doesn't happen.

551
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,600
For now, I'd like to get

552
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,600
a CT scan of your head

553
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,610
to establish a baseline,

554
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,910
and then we'll wait and see.

555
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,780
Wait, that's your plan?

556
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,780
"Wait and see"?

557
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,290
A nurse will be by to

558
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,290
take you for that scan.

559
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,180
Well, I hope you know

560
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,180
what you're doing, Ginger.

561
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,170
CLAIRE: Connor.

562
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,570
CONNOR: Hey.

563
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,570
Hey.

564
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,010
Looks like I need

565
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,010
to check into the ER

566
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,010
to spend any time with you.

567
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,670
Claire, I'm sorry.

568
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,670
It's just been

569
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,670
really busy around here.

570
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,580
You're avoiding me.

571
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,870
I'm not avoiding you...

572
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,870
It's because of Dad, isn't it?

573
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,510
You hate that I

574
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,510
don't hate him.

575
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,680
You're not being fair.

576
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,250
Listen, Mom's suicide,

577
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,250
I know you blame him,

578
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,790
but Mom had real problems.

579
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,090
That's not exactly

580
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,090
how I remember it.

581
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,160
That's because,

582
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,160
believe it or not,

583
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,160

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,700
was inconclusive.

778
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,140
I thought that

779
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,140
we concluded

780
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,140
that staying away

781
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,740
from narcotics was

782
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,740
Ellie's top priority.

783
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,310
Yes. But she's a minor.

784
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,650
She wasn't in any condition

785
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,650
to make decisions.

786
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,880
And what condition

787
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,880
was her father in?

788
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,980
Was he sober when

789
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,980
you asked his consent?

790
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,960
She was in so much pain.

791
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,550
It was the right call

792
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,550
to make.

793
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,890
I think it might have

794
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,890
felt like the right

795
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,890
call for you, doctor.

796
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,940
For Ellie,

797
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,940
gonna have to wait and see.

798
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,810
Our clients are people

799
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,810
who are desperate

800
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,810
to have children.

801
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,440
Ms. Desai is

802
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,440
helping a couple

803
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,440
realize that dream.

804
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,010
Her life is in jeopardy.

805
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,850
We'd like to

806
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,850
understand

807
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,850
the arrangement

808
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,980
your clients have

809
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,980
with our patient.

810
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,280
Well, she has

811
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,280
graciously allowed

812
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,420
our clients' baby to

813
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,420
develop in her womb.

814
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,480
In turn, they give

815
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,480
her a living stipend

816
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,490
for every week she

817
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,490
nurtures that child.

818
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,330
She specifically said

819
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,330
she needs the payout.

820
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,330
What's that?

821
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,630
In the spirit of

822
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,630
inspiring a

823
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,630
healthy baby,

824
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,400
our clients have

825
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,400
promised a bonus

826
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,100
should Ms. Desai

827
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,100
carry to term.

828
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,840
That's what she's

829
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,840
killing herself for.

830
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,210
Ms. Allen,

831
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,210
this contract seems to be

832
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,210
incentivizing our patient

833
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,710
to put her health at risk.

834
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,750
Is there any

835
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,750
way to alter this?

836
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,840
How so?

837
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,940
Well, perhaps,

838
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,940
she would

839
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,940
deliver the baby now,

840
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,850
if she knew she

841
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,850
was still eligible

842
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,720
for at least

843
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,720
a part of that bonus.

844
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,320
Unfortunately,

845
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,320
our clients

846
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,320
have stipulated

847
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,660
that they do not

848
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,660
wish to adopt

849
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,660
a premature baby.

850
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,920
It's their baby.

851
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,120
According to the law,

852
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,670
my clients are

853
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,670
under no obligation

854
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,670
to adopt this child.

855
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,570
Wait. Then who's

856
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,570
responsible for this baby?

857
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,000
If the bio parents

858
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,000
choose not to adopt,

859
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,470
Ms. Desai is welcome

860
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,470
to keep the child or

861
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,470
surrender it to the state.

862
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,940
"Welcome to keep it"?

863
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,040
Ms. Allen, this contract

864
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,040
seems to protect everyone,

865
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,910
but Ms. Desai

866
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,910
and that baby.

867
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,320
I'm sorry,

868
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,320
that is the arrangement

869
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,320
she willingly agreed to.

870
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,360
If you have any

871
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,360
further questions,

872
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,660
please feel free

873
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,660
to call my office.

874
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,360
Uh...

875
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,010
This embolism,

876
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,010
it happened

877
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,010
'cause of you.

878
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,780
She said you were supposed

879
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,780
to give him something,

880
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,780
but you didn't.

881
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,720
I am telling you.

882
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,720
I know your brother.

883
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,220
I saw Jimmy Doyle

884
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,220
knock him out cold.

885
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,920
I'm sure that happened

886
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,920
more than once.

887
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,930
Andy's too high a risk

888
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,930
for blood thinners.

889
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,130
No, you made the wrong call

890
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,130
and now Andy's got

891
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,130
this clot in his lungs.

892
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,500
You're an uppity bastard,

893
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,500
and you don't give

894
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,500
a rat's ass about us.

895
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,970
Back off, Brian. Back off.

896
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,630
I want a doctor who

897
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,630
knows what he's doing.

898
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,400
You want a new doctor?

899
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,400
Is that it?

900
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,400
Yeah.

901
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,480
A good one.

902
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,510
Okay, I'm done.

903
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,460
Noah showed me some

904
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,460
selfies he took

905
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,460
with Tate's friends.

906
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,160
God. I want to strangle him.

907
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,630
Noah or Tate?

908
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,630
Noah.

909
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,640
He's hooking

910
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,640
these ballers up

911
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,640
with banana bags.

912
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,670
Oh, very enterprising.

913
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,040
Tate's idea?

914
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,040
No.

915
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,610
He thought he was

916
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,610
doing Noah a favor,

917
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,610
giving out his card.

918
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,700
Still, what'd I tell

919
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,700
you about athletes?

920
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,550
Hey, Noah is what he is.

921
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,550
It's not Tate's fault.

922
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,620
Then what are

923
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,620
you mad at him for?

924
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,520
I don't know.

925
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,520
I'm... Oh, God, I'm not.

926
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,890
Tate.

927
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,300
Uh, how was his check-up?

928
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,630
Wasn't too bad. I mean,

929
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,630
he cried twice, but...

930
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,940
Did not!

931
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,140
I'm just playing.

932
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,730
'Course not.

933
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,730
You're too brave for that.

934
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,250
Hey, Eric, do you mind

935
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,250
if I have a really

936
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,250
quick word with your dad?

937
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,250
I want you to take

938
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,250
a seat for a second

939
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,250
right over there, honey.

940
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,620
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

941
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,820
I shouldn't have

942
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,820
made this about you,

943
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,820
when it wasn't.

944
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,230
It's my brother,

945
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,390
I really did not like what

946
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,390
he was doing at that party.

947
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,690
I get you.

948
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,430
I really like

949
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,430
being with you.

950
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,530
(CHUCKLES)

951
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,770
I don't want that to stop.

952
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,770
Me neither.

953
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,670
Look, I was

954
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,670
just helping

955
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,670
Noah out because,

956
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,270
hey, that's your

957
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,270
little brother.

958
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,170
But I'll let my

959
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,170
guys know, no more.

960
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,750
No, that's sweet,

961
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,750
but if they wanna hire him,

962
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,750
they can go right ahead.

963
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,810
Noah is making his own way,

964
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,810
and I'm done fighting it.

965
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,350
Okay.

966
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,660
Hey, Eric!

967
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,530
How about an

968
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,530
ice cream sandwich?

969
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,830
If it's okay

970
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,830
with your dad.

971
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,000
I want an ice cream sandwich.

972
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,870
Let's get you

973
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,870
an ice cream sandwich.

974
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,870
Yay!

975
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,070
Under fluoro,

976
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,070
we'll get a

977
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,070
precise picture

978
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,940
of the clot burden,

979
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,940
then we can lyse it.

980
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,710
Let's get him

981
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,710
into the elevator.

982
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,110
What's happening?

983
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,440
Dr. Perrington is

984
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,440
taking him to the cath lab

985
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,440
for a clot buster.

986
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,630
If you're right about

987
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,630
Andrew's head traumas,

988
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,750
giving him a clot buster

989
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,750
is worse than giving

990
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,750
him blood thinners.

991
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,830
I gave my medical opinion.

992
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,490
The patient

993
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,490
and his brother

994
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,490
did not wanna listen.

995
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,570
Perrington's an attending.

996
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,570
It's out of my hands now.

997
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,710
Rough day?

998
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,650
Yeah. I just...

I just... I can't

1002
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,260
believe what I just did.

1003
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,030
I have this teenage patient

1004
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,030
who adamantly

1005
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,030
refused drugs of any kind

1006
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,430
because addiction

1007
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,430
runs in her family,

1008
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,900
and I just convinced

1009
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,900
her heroin-addict father

1010
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,300
to let me give her

1011
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,300
pain meds anyway.

1012
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,270
What was I thinking?

1013
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,800
(EXHALES)

1014
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,810
What?

1015
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,220
Well, I hate to say it,

1016
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,220
but going against

1017
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,220
a patient's wishes

1018
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,920
because you think

1019
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,920
you know better?

1020
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,550
Sounds like something

1021
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,550
you'd bust my balls for.

1022
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,390
All right, what's wrong

1023
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,390
with this kid, anyway?

1024
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,360
I wish I knew.

but the endoscopy

1055
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,030
comes back clean.

1056
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,940
And she has

1057
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,940
a psychotic episode.

1058
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,270
You were right.

1059
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,270
I never should've

1060
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,270
given her the narcotic.

1061
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,510
Although that

1062
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,510
could not have caused

1063
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,510
the hallucinations.

1064
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,020
I'm at a loss. I guess

1065
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,020
this is in your court.

1066
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,850
And whatever

1067
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,850
she's suffering from

1068
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,850
must be psychological.

1069
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,620
You know,

1070
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,620
I'm not sure that I agree.

1071
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,590
When you scoped her,

1072
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,590
did you give her

1073
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,590
a benzo or an opiate?

1074
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,890
Fentanyl.

1075
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,890
Huh.

1076
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,300
An opiate. Was it effective?

1077
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,700
Very. Why?

1078
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,530
I got a hunch

1079
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,010
that the stomach pain

1080
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,010
and the psychotic episode

1081
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,010
might be related,

1082
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,470
and if that's the case,

1083
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,520
whole thing would

1084
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,520
in fact be

1085
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,520
entirely physiological.

1086
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,480
Excuse me for a second?

1087
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,480
Sure.

1088
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,330
So, do you mind

1089
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,330
if I ask you a couple

1090
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,330
personal questions?

1091
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,390
Nope.

1092
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,730
When did you, um,

1093
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,730
start using drugs?

1094
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,630
Well, um...

1095
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,230
Just so you know,

1096
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,230
only asking

1097
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,040
because it might

1098
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,040
help us figure out

1099
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,040
what's wrong with Ellie.

1100
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,310
Near as you can remember.

1101
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,310
When did you start using?

1102
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,540
Uh...

1103
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,780
I'd say high school.

1104
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,120
And did you experiment

1105
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,120
with various things

1106
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,920
or did you go

1107
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,920
straight to heroin, or...

1108
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,650
Oh, uh...

1109
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,160
Nat.

1110
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,160
Yeah.

1111
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,330
I could use your

1112
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,330
help with a patient.

1113
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,430
What is it?

1114
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,530
I can't get through to her.

1115
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,040
I thought maybe you

1116
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,040
could talk to her,

1117
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,040
as a mother.

1118
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,170
Dr. Choi.

1119
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,220
Ms. Desai,

1120
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,220
we can't delay this

1121
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,220
delivery any longer.

1122
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,550
No, please.

1123
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,380
Ms. Desai,

1124
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,380
I'm Dr. Manning.

1125
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,850
I'm sorry you're

1126
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,850
going through such a

1127
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,850
rough time right now.

1128
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,650
I know when

1129
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,650
my water broke,

1130
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,650
I was a mess.

1131
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,060
I wasn't ready

1132
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,060
to deliver, either.

1133
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,500
I told Dr. Choi,

1134
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,500
I can't have this baby now.

1135
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,130
My boys are counting

1136
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,130
on me to keep a roof

1137
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,130
over their heads.

1138
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,770
I understand. I have a son.

1139
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,770
I would do anything for him.

1140
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,970
But do you understand

1141
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,970
what's happening in

1142
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,970
your body right now?

1143
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,210
The proteins from

1144
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,210
your placenta are

1145
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,210
poisoning your blood.

1146
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,080
And at any moment,

1147
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,080
you could have

1148
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,080
an eclamptic seizure

1149
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,210
that could kill

1150
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,210
you and this baby.

1151
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,360
Ms. Desai, your boys

1152
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,360
would rather spend

1153
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,830
100 Chicago winters

1154
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,830
in a shelter

1155
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,460
than a lifetime

1156
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,460
without their mother.

1157
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,500
Don't orphan

1158
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,500
them for this money.

1159
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,100
Neela, look at me.

1160
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,100
Look at me. Neela.

1161
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,540
Dr. Choi is gonna

1162
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,540
take you up to OB

1163
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,980
and you are going

1164
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,980
to deliver this baby.

1165
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,910
For your boys.

1166
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,980
Okay.

1167
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,690
ETHAN: Call OB,

1168
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,690
tell them we're on our way.

1169
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,090
(NEELA CRYING AND GROANING)

1170
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,400
(SOBBING)

1171
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,200
Halstead!

1172
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,200
Why'd you dump us?

1173
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,970
Dump you?

1174
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,970
You dumped me.

1175
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,230
Said you wanted

1176
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,230
another doctor.

1177
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,430
Yeah, so?

1178
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,940
So?

1179
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,600
All right,

1180
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,600
do I look like a doctor?

1181
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,310
Who cares what

1182
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,310
I think? You're

1183
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,310
the smartest guy I know.

1184
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,080
Listen, I don't know

1185
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,080
what it is that you want,

1186
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,980
but Andy's in good hands

1187
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,980
with Dr. Perrington.

1188
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,670
She knows what

1189
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,670
she's doing...

1190
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,670
Hey.

1191
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,950
What happened to

1192
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,950
that stand-up kid

1193
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,950
from high school?

1194
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,720
What?

1195
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,720
We respected you.

1196
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,020
Funny way of showing it.

1197
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,260
Hey, no matter how

1198
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,260
many times we knocked

1199
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,260
you on your ass,

1200
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,820
you always got back up.

1201
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,260
Ginger never stayed down.

1202
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,100
Yeah, I don't care

1203
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,100
about this other doctor.

1204
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,100
I care about my brother.

1205
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,500
And you know him.

1206
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,300
God sakes, you even

1207
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,300
remember the fight

1208
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,300
with Jimmy Doyle.

1209
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,110
You said he could get a...

1210
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,110
What? A brain bleed.

1211
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,580
And that could

1212
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,580
kill him, right?

1213
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,950
That's right.

1214
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,950
Then shouldn't you

1215
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,950
stop this?

1216
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,580
Oxygen looks good.

1217
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,580
Let's turn up the propofol.

1218
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,490
Let's administer the tPA.

1219
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,620
Wait!

1220
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,760
What's going on?

1221
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,830
I wanna make sure

1222
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,830
we're giving Mr. Tucker

1223
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,830
the proper treatment.

1224
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,830
He's no longer

1225
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,830
your patient,

1226
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,830
Dr. Halstead.

1227
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,960
He thinks what you're doing

1228
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,960
could make his brain bleed.

1229
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,500
Excuse me.

1230
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,500
Your brother's CT was clean

1231
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,500
except for old hygromas.

1232
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,770
That means

1233
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,770
the risk is very low.

1234
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,930
I grew up with this patient,

1235
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,910
seen him take

1236
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,910
a lot of hits to

1237
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,910
the head over the years.

1238
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,950
Those hygromas

1239
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,950
are indicative

1240
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,950
of old subdurals.

1241
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,010
He's at a much higher risk

1242
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,010
than his CT shows.

1243
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,880
We need to

1244
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,880
implant an IVC filter

1245
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,880
to prevent future clots,

1246
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,580
but as far as

1247
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,580
the current clot's

1248
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,580
concerned,

1249
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,320
I think we should hold off

1250
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,320
and let him ride it out.

1251
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,090
Dr. Halstead is a resident,

1252
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,090
a doctor in training.

1253
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,730
I'm an attending physician

1254
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,730
and a board-certified

1255
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,730
critical care specialist.

1256
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,870
I'm telling you, your

1257
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,870
brother is perfectly able

1258
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,870
to handle this treatment.

1259
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,420
He's not.

1260
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,750
We're going with

1261
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,750
Dr. Halstead, what he says.

1262
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,180
All right.

1263
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,860
How are you

1264
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,860
feeling, Ellie?

1265
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,190
You gave me drugs.

1266
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,630
I'm sorry. I didn't

1267
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,630
feel like we had a choice.

1268
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,190
And what are these?

1269
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,730
You had what we call

1270
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,730
a delusional episode.

1271
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,070
So, I'm going crazy?

1272
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,070
No.

1273
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,300
We actually think

1274
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,300
that it might be related

1275
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,300
to your stomach pain.

1276
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,010
Did you change

1277
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,010
your diet at all

1278
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,770
in anticipation of

1279
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,770
wearing your prom dress?

1280
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,450
Yeah, a little. I...

1281
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,450
I just started

1282
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,450
eating salads at lunch.

1283
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,190
Can you remember

1284
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,190
your last attack,

1285
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,350
a year ago,

1286
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,350
had you also changed

1287
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,350
your diet then?

1288
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,290
I guess I...

1289
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,560
I was going to

1290
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,560
a volleyball tournament

1291
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,560
in Florida,

1292
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,730
and I wanted to, you know,

1293
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,730
wear a bathing suit.

1294
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,520
Why?

1295
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,500
We believe you may

1296
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,500
have a disease called AIP,

1297
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,440
acute intermittent porphyria.

1298
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,570
It's a genetic condition

1299
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,230
that causes

1300
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,230
severe stomach pain

1301
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,680
along with episodes

1302
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,680
of psychosis.

1303
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,270
Carbohydrates actually

1304
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,270
help control it.

1305
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,110
And we think that

1306
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,110
your latest flare-up

1307
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,910
was probably helped

1308
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,910
along by your

1309
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,910
recent change in diet.

1310
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,720
That's what's making me

1311
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,720
feel like this?

1312
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,020
NATALIE: We think so.

1313
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,590
Long term, AIP can be

1314
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,590
treated and managed.

1315
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,490
In the short term,

1316
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,490
an opiate will

1317
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,490
help to ease the pain.

1318
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,460
An opiate?

1319
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,460
You don't have to worry.

1320
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,900
We will carefully

1321
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,900
manage your dosage.

1322
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,990
(EXHALES)

1323
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,800
As long as I don't

1324
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,800
turn out like my dad.

1325
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,880
Ellie, your father

1326
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,880
helped lead us

1327
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,880
to this diagnosis.

1328
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,610
Again, it's a

1329
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,610
genetic condition.

1330
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,620
He probably has it,

1331
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,810
and has very likely

1332
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,810
been self-medicating

1333
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,810
all these years.

1334
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,520
You mean, that...

1335
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,520
That's why he's an addict?

1336
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,820
Well, more like

1337
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,820
a contributing factor.

1338
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,230
He probably experienced

1339
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,230
the same pain

1340
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,060
that you did when

1341
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,060
he was your age,

1342
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,690
and without proper

1343
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,690
help or diagnosis,

1344
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,240
he came up with his

1345
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,240
own way to treat it.

1346
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,010
ETHAN: The baby's in distress.

1347
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,880
We've got fetal bradycardia.

1348
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,880
It's not getting oxygen.

1349
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,360
DR. PATCHEFSKY:

1350
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,360
Almost there.

1351
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,630
Baby's apneic, suction.

1352
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,410
ETHAN: Come on. Come on.

1353
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,310
She looks good.

1354
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,310
Premature, but healthy.

1355
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,290
Let's get her to NICU.

1356
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,290
ETHAN: Wait.

1357
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,920
(BABY CRYING)

1358
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,360
It's a girl.

1359
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,220
DR. PATCHEFSKY: Don't you

1360
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,220
wanna see your baby?

1361
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,390
I can't. I can't.

1362
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,100
ETHAN: Ms. Desai...

1363
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,100
No.

1364
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,090
(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)

1365
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,970
Take it away!

1366
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,740
He's stabilized.

1367
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,740
Not as bad as we thought.

1368
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,250
Maybe we don't need to

1369
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,250
push to the clot busters.

1370
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,010
You were right.

1371
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,620
Just glad he's okay.

1372
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,460
Excuse me.

1373
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,440
Dr. Halstead.

1374
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,910
Just curious,

1375
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,180
you planning on applying

1376
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,180
for a job here when your

1377
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,180
residency is complete?

1378
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,510
First choice.

1379
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,950
I'm on the hiring committee,

1380
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,950
and if I were you,

1381
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,450
I'd be looking

1382
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,450
for other hospitals.

1383
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,670
What's going on in there?

1384
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,960
They look like

1385
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,960
they're celebrating.

1386
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,840
Yeah, we ran a PBG test

1387
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,840
on Ellie and

1388
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,840
confirmed the diagnosis.

1389
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,800
We also did one

1390
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,800
on her father,

1391
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,340
and it turns out

1392
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,340
he has it, too,

1393
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,340
but he never knew it.

1394
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,480
All her life, she just

1395
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,480
thought he was an addict

1396
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,480
who didn't care,

1397
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,440
and now she sees

1398
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,440
it was just

1399
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,440
his way of coping.

1400
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,710
SHARON: Any issues?

1401
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,490
ETHAN: She was born

1402
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,490
shy of four pounds

1403
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,190
and her lungs

1404
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,190
are underdeveloped,

1405
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,920
but I think two

1406
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,920
months in the NICU

1407
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,470
will plump her up and get

1408
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,470
her breathing properly.

1409
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,020
That's good to hear.

1410
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,240
I'm sorry, but I have

1411
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,240
some unfortunate news.

1412
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,800
Our clients have

1413
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,800
pulled out.

1414
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,430
What?

1415
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,040
They don't feel

1416
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,040
equipped to deal with

1417
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,040
the complications

1418
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,600
that come with

1419
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,600
a premature baby.

1420
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,510
This is a healthy baby.

1421
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,510
She just needs

1422
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,510
some extra attention.

1423
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,640
I understand.

1424
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,610
You know, my heart

1425
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,610
goes out to Neela,

1426
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,610
all she's been through.

1427
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,950
But I'm not giving up.

1428
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,150
I'm sure we can find

1429
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,150
an adventurous couple

1430
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,250
willing to take on

1431
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,250
that little bundle of joy.

1432
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,390
And maybe get a little

1433
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,390
something for Neela, too.

1434
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,290
Of course,

1435
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,290
you'll get a fee as well.

1436
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,270
I need to make

1437
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,270
a quick call, excuse me.

1438
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,440
Is this a happy ending?

1439
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,880
Dr. Choi, this is

1440
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,880
as happy as it's

1441
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,880
going to get.

1442
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,630
Mr. Newman.

1443
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,030
Yeah. Hey.

1444
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,030
Hey.

1445
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,240
Very excited to hear that

1446
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,240
you and your daughter

1447
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,240
finally got a diagnosis.

1448
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,670
That's good.

1449
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,670
Yeah. That's great.

1450
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,970
Hey, can you step

1451
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,970
over into my office here

1452
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,970
for a second?

1453
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,150
You know, sometimes,

1454
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,150
people get new perspective,

1455
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,090
how they got into a

1456
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,090
situation, they re-evaluate

1457
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,090
getting out of it, you know?

1458
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,650
And if that

1459
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,650
were the case,

1460
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,190
I just wanted to

1461
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,190
offer my assistance,

1462
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,190
you know?

1463
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,420
Kicking heroin is

1464
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,420
a tremendous undertaking,

1465
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,620
and it really shouldn't

1466
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,620
be attempted alone.

1467
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,560
Um...

1468
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,230
Yeah, um, you know,

1469
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,230
I appreciate that. Thank you.

1470
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,530
Yeah, I work with

1471
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,530
these alternative rehabs,

1472
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,170
you know, who use

1473
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,170
psychoactives like ibogaine.

1474
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,870
They've been having

1475
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,870
extraordinary success.

1476
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,570
I just wanted, you know,

1477
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,570
to put that on the table.

1478
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,810
(EXHALES)

1479
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,050
Yeah, well, uh, you know,

1480
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,050
(CLEARS THROAT) like I said,

1481
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,050
I appreciate it and, uh...

1482
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,190
You know, I think,

1483
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,190
I think I got it handled.

1484
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,560
You know, so, I'm gonna

1485
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,560
have a smoke.

1486
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,760
Okay, man.

1487
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,290
Thank you.

1488
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,290
Good luck.

1489
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:58,430
Hey, just in case, you know?

1490
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,500
(CLEARS THROAT) Great.

1491
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,800
Thank you.

1492
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,720
How's she doing?

1493
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,460
I suggest you stay

1494
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,460
as far away from me

1495
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,460
as possible.

1496
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,400
What you're

1497
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,400
doing may be legal,

1498
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,740
but it sure as

1499
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,740
hell isn't right.

1500
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,640
No reputable

1501
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,640
surrogacy agency

1502
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,510
would've ever given

1503
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,510
Neela a contract like that.

1504
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,210
This is an emotional process,

1505
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,210
I can understand you're upset.

1506
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,950
Don't you dare

1507
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,950
patronize me.

1508
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,850
What you do,

1509
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,850
let's call it what it is,

1510
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,820
human trafficking.

1511
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,350
Maybe if we bring

1512
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,350
that one down here.

1513
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,250
And yes, I've been

1514
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,250
thinking about it just...

1515
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,250
Claire.

1516
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,980
(CHUCKLES)

1517
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,220
Well...

1518
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,790
Um...

1519
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,000
Any chance you're

1520
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,000
free for dinner?

1521
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,830
Yeah, I think I could

1522
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,830
make that work.

1523
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,600
Let me just

1524
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,600
grab my coat.

1525
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,140
(SIGHS)

1526
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,140
Leave it to you to

1527
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,140
find the nearest bar.

1528
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,310
Homing instinct.

1529
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,210
Let me buy you

1530
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,210
a drink.

1531
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,620
Okay.

1532
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,950
What'll you have?

1533
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,950
One of those fancy

1534
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,950
fresh-squeezed cocktails?

1535
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:13,360
With my med school loans,

1536
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:13,360
I stick to beer.

1537
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,630
Thank you.

1538
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,930
Another for me.

1539
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,930
And the same

1540
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,930
for my friend.
