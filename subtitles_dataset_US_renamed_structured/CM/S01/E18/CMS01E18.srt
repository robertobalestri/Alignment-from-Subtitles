From the diarrhea?

We've given him fluids,

194

00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,620
SHANNON: Oh, my God.

199
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,890
NATALIE:

200
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,890
Was he exposed

201
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,890
to any toxins in the house?

202
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,430
NICK: No, we're careful

203
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,430
about that.

204
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,260
Anything else

205
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,260
you can think of?

206
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,460
Only, he had just

207
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,460
started sitting up,

208
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,090
but he hasn't

209
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,090
been able to do that

210
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,090
the last couple of days.

211
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,510
Okay. Let's order a CBC,

212
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,510
CMP, UA and blood cultures.

213
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,410
And let's start a

214
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,410
10 cc bolus of albumin

215
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,410
and page Dr. Grant.

216
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,570
What is all that?

217
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,170
We just need to run

218
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,170
some further tests.

219
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,880
And I'm bringing in

220
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,880
a specialist to consult.

221
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,880
Okay?

222
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,750
We're gonna find out

223
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,750
what's going on with you.

224
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
NATALIE: I'll be back shortly.

225
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,590
You could've just

226
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,590
dropped me off.

227
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,290
My mama told me,

228
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,290
"Escort a lady to the door."

229
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,390
(CHUCKLES)

230
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,760
Well, here I am.

231
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,760
Safe and sound.

232
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,760
Mmm-hmm.

233
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,930
Yes.

234
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,600
See you tonight.

235
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,100
(INAUDIBLE)

236
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,110
Hey, Maggie?

237
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,110
MAGGIE: Yeah.

238
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,980
Any word on Dr. Downey?

239
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,040
He's out of surgery

240
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,040
and stable.

241
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,490
Oh, good. Good.

242
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
How's the renovation going,

243
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
Bert's "man cave?"

244
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,830
Oh, you know, I thought

245
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,830
it would cheer him up.

246
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,990
But he's not showing

247
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,990
any interest at all.

248
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,360
I feel like I'm

249
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,360
being punished for

250
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,360
not retiring with him.

251
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,890
Rough at home, huh?

252
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,940
That's an understatement.

253
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Morning, Ms. Goodwin.

254
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Dr. Halstead.

255
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,450
That woman

256
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,450
does not like me.

257
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,140
You haven't exactly

258
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,140
made her life easy.

259
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,580
How's the

260
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,580
job search going?

261
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,020
Hey, got an offer yesterday

262
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,020
from Mount Sinai, Miami.

263
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,020
Oh.

264
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,660
Plus Memorial

265
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,660
West in California.

266
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,160
So, either way,

267
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,160
looks like sunshine for me.

268
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,460
What about Med?

269
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,590
Lost cause.

270
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,590
I should've heard by now.

271
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,830
Oh, well, and you know

272
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,830
Dr. Manning...

273
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,930
What?

274
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,000
She's not wearing

275
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,000
her wedding ring anymore.

276
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,470
Why would you

277
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,470
tell me that?

278
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,380
Timing, Dr. Halstead.

279
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,380
That's what it's all about.

280
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,390
(SLURRING) I'm fine.

281
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,390
His fault! Shouldn't have

282
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,390
been wearing that shirt!

283
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,580
Oh, lovely.

284
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,680
Ugh, that seems

285
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,680
like a pleasant one.

286
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,250
Take them to

287
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,250
Treatment Three, please.

288
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,660
Oh, Thank you.

289
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,660
April, you busy?

290
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,490
I'm with you.

291
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,030
All right, fellas,

292
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,030
I'm Dr. Halstead. Follow me.

293
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,090
(CHUCKLES)

294
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,090
I don't need this.

295
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,220
Fin, just let them

296
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,220
take a look.

297
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,320
(CONTINUES CHUCKLING)

298
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,320
I'm fine!

299
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,070
All right, come on,

300
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,070
let's get you

301
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,070
on this bed?

302
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,500
No, no. Just,

303
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,500
just wanna go home...

304
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,940
Hey. What happened?

305
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,940
(GRUNTS) Okay.

306
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,500
Went out to

307
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,500
party after the game,

308
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,500
he sees these Cards fans...

309
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,700
Douchebag's wearing

310
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,700
a "Cubs suck" shirt.

311
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,210
And we won,

312
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,210
how could we suck?

313
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,680
Hey. Sit down!

314
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,680
Sit down!

315
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,680
Douchebag!

316
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,050
Sir, I need you

317
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,050
to stay on the bed!

318
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,140
Sir, stay on the bed!

319
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,140
No, let me go!

320
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,280
WILL: Hey!

321
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,280
Ow!

322
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,380
WILL: Security!

323
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,380
You, hold him!

324
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,380
(PANTING)

325
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,510
TY: Dude.

326
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,450
You all right, April?

327
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,450
(COUGHING)

328
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,420
You okay?

329
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,990
Yeah, I'm okay.

330
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,990
Get this guy

331
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,990
in restraints.

332
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,220
SECURITY: I got it.

333
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,220
Five of Haldol.

334
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,780
FINLEY: No! No!

335
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,780
You're good?

336
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,860
You're okay?

337
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,860
(PANTING) I'm fine.

338
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,560
All right,

339
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,560
let's move here.

340
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,530
Cardiomegaly.

341
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,460
What?

342
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,630
Michael's heart

343
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,630
is enlarged.

344
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,540
What would cause that?

345
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,150
Given everything else,

346
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,150
I'd say we're looking

347
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,150
at a genetic disease.

348
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,780
How can that be?

349
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,780
We're both fine.

350
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,880
You can each be

351
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,880
carrying one faulty

352
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,880
recessive gene which,

353
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,480
when paired together,

354
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,480
can express in Michael.

355
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,350
Dr. Manning,

356
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,350
BP and sats are dropping.

357
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,650
(RAPID BEEPING)

358
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,460
He's not breathing.

359
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,460
Oh, my God.

360
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,660
Tube him now.

361
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,660
Ten mics dopamine

362
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,660
per kilo and 15 of fentanyl.

363
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,730
FEMALE NURSE: Right away.

364
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,600
NATALIE: I'm in.

365
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,140
SARAH:

366
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,140
Sats are coming up.

367
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,750
Right, let's get him

368
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,750
up to the PICU.

369
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,040
I'll go with him.

370
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,220
Where is he going?

371
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,220
What's happening?

372
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,650
He's stable.

373
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,650
We're taking him up to

374
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,650
Pediatric Intensive Care.

375
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,710
You can come with.

376
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,780
And then what?

377
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,020
There are many

378
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,020
genetic diseases

379
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,020
that could be causing this.

380
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,560
We need to

381
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,560
determine which one.

382
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,600
Chicago Med can do

383
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,600
fast genetic sequencing.

384
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,630
We'll need blood samples

385
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,630
from the three of you

386
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,630
to analyze.

387
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,260
Hopefully, we'll have

388
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,260
a diagnosis in 26 hours.

389
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,160
But, what if he

390
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,160
keeps getting worse?

391

We're gonna do

392
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,440
everything that we can.

393
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,440
Okay? Go ahead.

394
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,450
Didn't mean to hit her.

395
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,450
Sorry. Sorry.

396
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,650
Really, I'm fine.

397
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,710
Lungs are clear.

398
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,290
So, can I go

399
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,290
back to work?

400
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,730
Just hold on.

401
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,160
Does this hurt?

402
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,160
No.

403
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,260
You finished?

404
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,260
Here?

405
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,420
Ow!

406
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,340
Okay. On a scale

407
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,340
of one to ten,

408
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,340
how bad's the pain?

409
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,300
Three.

410
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,300
That means it's

411
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,300
a seven or eight.

412
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,180
Hey, you are probably okay,

413
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,180
but I'd like to get

414
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
a chest X-ray

415
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
just to be safe.

416
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,180
No way.

April,

418
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,650
you have some

419
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,650
pain and tenderness.

420
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,710
A broken rib

421
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,710
could've punctured

422
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,710
your liver, or your lung.

423
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,310
I wanna make sure

424
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,310
you don't have

425
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,310
a pneumothorax.

426
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,580

00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,420
here on a gurney.

430
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,010
Ms. Goodwin,

431
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,010
I appreciate that.

432
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,220
But you are all

433
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,220
over-reacting.

434
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,220
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

435
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,360
He's been off

436
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,360
the lorazepam for two hours,

437
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,360
and he still hasn't woken up.

438
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,000
And he's still

439
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,000
completely reliant

440
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,000
on the vent.

441
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,900

442
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,900
to tell you he should've

443
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,900
come to by now?

444
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,170
No, I needed you to

445
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,170
tell me why he hasn't.

446
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,810
Could it just be that

447
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,810
his poor liver function

448
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,410
is preventing him from

449
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,410
metabolizing the lorazepam?

450
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,850
Dr. Rhodes, you called

451
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,850
a neurosurgeon in to consult.

452
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,120
Obviously, you suspect

453
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,120
something else.

454
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,050
I'm afraid he might've

455
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,050
stroked on the table.

456
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,450
And you were hoping

457
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,450
I'd tell you otherwise.

458
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,830
I can't.

459
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,830
His pupils are sluggish.

460
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,430
We need a head CT.

461
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,930
You should've

462
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,930
already ordered one.

463
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,740

I know this sounds crazy,

but I think he

Yes.

611
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,430

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,430
If I resect,

628
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,130
he'll have

629
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,130

You won't recognize

631
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,910

632
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,370

638

You know my reservations.

654

All due respect, Dr. Abrams

655
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,010
is not the only neurosurgeon

656
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,010
in this hospital.

657
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,350
No. But he's the best.

658
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,820
No surgery.

659
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,760
Dr. Downey, we should

660
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,760
at least get

661
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,760

running your tongue

712
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,360

I know it's a lot of words,

911
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,670
but what it basically

912
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,670
boils down to,

913
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,400
is he can't process fat.

914
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,030
So...

915
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,570
When, um, the body

916
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,570
can't use fat for energy,

917
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,570
it relies on glucose.

918
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,770
But there's only

919
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,770

Blood sugar?

923
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,550
That's what caused

924
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,550
him to stop breathing?

925
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,550
And his heart?

926
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,720
It doesn't have

927
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,720
to happen again.

928
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,720
It can be managed.

929
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,880
How?

930
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,860
We're giving him

931
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,860
intravenous dextrose,

932
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,860
getting his blood sugar up.

933
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,620
That will keep him stable.

934
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,760
So, he's gonna be okay?

935
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,360

have the condition,

937
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,030
but by altering his diet,

938
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,030
we can control it.

939
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,800

00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,940
The blow didn't cause

1168
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,940
any significant damage.

1169
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,000
Told you.

1170
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,240
It did show us

1171
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,240
something else.

1172
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,720
There's a coin lesion

1173
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,720
in the upper lobe

1174
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,720
of your lung.

1175
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,520
Now, given your history,

1176
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,520
I think we can rule out

1177
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,520
lung cancer or lymphoma.

1178
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,190
Then, what is it?

1179
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,860
Well, we'll need

1180
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,860
a bronchoscopy

1181
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,860
and an IGRA to confirm.

1182
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,660
But I'm pretty sure

1183
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,660
that you have tuberculosis.

1184
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,500
What?

1185
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,040
I've got TB?

1186
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,040
I'm afraid so.

1187
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,920
Dr. Rhodes, we're so

1188
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,920
very sorry for your loss.

1189
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,010
Thank you.

1190
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,780
Ms. Goodwin, I'm gonna need

1191
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,780
a few personal days,

1192
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,780
if that's all right?

1193
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,290
Of course.

1194
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,290
Thanks.

1195
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,020
Yeah.

1196
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,020
Thinking about you, pal.

1197
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,030
Appreciate that.

1198
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,200
So, uh,

1199
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,200
how are you doing?

1200
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,770
What do you mean?

1201
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,470
I don't know.

1202
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,470
You haven't quite

1203
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,470
seemed yourself, lately.

1204
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,600
(SIGHS)

1205
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,310
Hasn't been a good day.

1206
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,400
Huh.

1207
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,770
Sorry to hear it.

1208
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,620
Oh, Dr. Reese,

1209
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,620
I understand that

1210
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,620
congratulations are in order.

1211
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,390
I just quit pathology.

1212
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,160
Nice freaking move.

1213
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,160
Right on, sister,

1214
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,160
I knew you were smart.

1215
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,640
I don't have a job.

1216
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,440
So, what?

1217
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,440
You're gonna be fine.

1218
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,940
(SQUAWKING)

1219
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,180
His vocabulary's improving.

1220
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,280
He said "Be back"

1221
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,280
to me this morning.

1222
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,210
Nice.

1223
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,210
Pretty smart.

1224
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,750
He knew I was leaving.

1225
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,860
Come on, show Dr. Charles.

1226
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,860
Say, "Be back."

1227
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,630
"Be back tonight."

1228
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,700
(WHISPERING)

1229
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,700
Performance anxiety, man.

1230
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,170
He did say it.

1231
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,170
I heard him!

1232
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,640
He said it to me

1233
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,640
this morning.

1234
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,800
I believe you.

1235
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,710
Whoa!

1236
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,520
Look at that.

1237
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,390
Dang.

1238
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,360
Good job.

1239
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,200
More success than I have

1240
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,200
with most of my patients.

1241
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,630
Congratulations.

1242
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,630
To the both of you.

1243
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:35,920
(INAUDIBLE)

1244
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,990
(CHUCKLES)

1245
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,070
(BOTH GRUNT)

1246
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,240
(BOTH LAUGHING)
