1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,472
    - Here, let me help you.
        - No, I got it.

2
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:08,207
        - No, I got it.
    - No, really, I got it.

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,608
                     - I got it.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,710
- I'm not sure
about that bag on you.

5
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,345
                 - Well, perhaps
          with a different shoe?

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,747
             - Nah.

7
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,615
         - You jealous?
           - Jealous?

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,018
     Of how bad it looks on you?
               I don't think so.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,621
- Dr. Halstead,
got a possible MI coming in.

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,223
      - And good morning to you,
                         Maggie.

11
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,941
        - Good morning.

12
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,658
- Dr. Manning, it was a pleasure
         being your caddy today.

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,728
     - Don't expect a tip.
          - [chuckles]

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,531
              - Hey, we still on
                    for tonight?

15
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,501
           - Tonight?
  - Ladies' night at Molly's,

16
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,503
             Me, you, and April.

17
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,138
         April hasn't had a date
                     in a while.

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,406
                     She can use
                 some wingwomen.

19
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:41,740
- Me, a wing woman?

20
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,510
      - Your hormones--they will
              lure the dudes in.

21
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:46,478
- Right.

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,047
              Hey.
          - Thank you.

23
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,481
- You're going the wrong way.

24
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,284
  - Left my badge in the car.

25
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,819
- I'll think about it.

26
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:03,562
- Help!
Help, anyone!

27
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,664
I need help here.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,067
- [grunts]

29
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,402
           I got her, I got her,
           I got her, I got her.

30
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,506
            Come on!
 She's bleeding from somewhere.

31
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,176
                   - Trauma two.
       Get your asses over here!

32
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,477
                     Who is she?
                  What happened?

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,812
        - I don't know.
          I found her

34
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,146
      a couple blocks away
   collapsed on the sidewalk.

35
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,614
- Let's get her
on the monitors.

36
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,749
     - April, you got this?

37
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,551
                       - Got it.

38
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,758
  - Where's she bleeding from?
        - Working on it.

39
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,260
- HR 130.

40
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,795
BP's at least 90.
I've got a radial pulse.

41
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,430
  - All right, get two lines.
            - On it.

42
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,232
      - Get an i-STAT ABG
         and send labs.

43
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,218
  Make sure we type and cross.

44
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,203
       - Can you hear me?
 Can you tell me what happened?

45
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,637
          The blood--
       did you get shot?

46
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,206
 - Let's get these wet clothes
          off her now.

47
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,507
- Don't worry.
We're gonna put you in a gown

48
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,775
and see what's going on,
okay?

49
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,643
    - Get blood, O negative,
      make sure it's warm.

50
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,212
      Put it on level one.
         Give her two.

51
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:54,279
- Hey, stay with me.

52
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,280
     - You find the source?

53
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,515
- No head, neck,
or torso trauma.

54
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,118
Belly distended but soft.

55
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,789
   - That's not an intestine.

56
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,357
       - It's an umbilical cord.

57
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,725
         This kid just delivered
                         a baby.

58
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,628
   - What do you mean "just"?
   - Maybe five minutes ago.

59
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,363
    - She's still bleeding.
             Clamp.

60
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,766
    - Where did you deliver
           this baby?

61
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,169
- Hey,
what happened to your baby?

62
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,279
           Hey, sir?

63
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,281
      Sir, you're the one
  who brought the girl, yeah?

64
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,649
      - She gonna be okay?
      - Yeah, she's fine.

65
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,185
     Where'd you find her?
  - About two blocks that way.

66
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,486
        - Okay, can you show me?

67
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,554
            - Yeah.
            - Okay.

68
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,656
      Hey, grab an OB kit
         and follow us.

69
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,857
                   - You got it.

70
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,635
          - She was right there.

71
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,576
        What are we looking for?

72
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,354
           - Sexton!

73
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,389
          - Did she just abandon
                      the thing?

74
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,657
- April!

75
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,260
Bulb syringe.

76
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,332
            Come on.

77
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:25,304
       Come on, come on,
       come on, come on.

78
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,905
           Come on--
       [baby gags, cries]

79
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,474
           Oh, okay.
       Blanket, blanket.

80
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,343
         [baby crying]
            Oxygen.

81
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,717
          [murmuring]
         - Okay...okay.

82
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,352
                 - There you go.
                      All right.

83
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,388
  - I'll take him to the NICU.
        - I'll take him.

84
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,268
- She hasn't delivered
the placenta yet.

85
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,836
It has to come out.
Where the hell is OB?

86
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,973
     - Stuck in a delivery.
          I can do it.

87
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,442
      I've done it before.

88
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,646
       - I'm on the baby.
           You sure?

89
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,880
             - Yes.

90
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,950
             April,
   where'd you find the baby?

91
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,386
                 - In a backpack
  behind that building on Huron.

92
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,722
      We got there just in time.

93
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,932
                 - Hey, hotshot.
                      Yeah, you.

94
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,735
         An old lady had a fall,
            sprained her wrists.

95
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,504
              last name Francis.

96
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:40,045
        - Miss Francis?
      Ms. Connie Francis?

97
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,713
- That's me.

98
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,817
You look awfully young
to be a doctor.

99
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,420
    - Oh, I'm a medical student.
                    Sarah Reese.

100
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,855
- Why don't you
come with us?

101
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,290
                - Come with you?

102
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,592
- To the beach.

103
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,430
       Hey, did you bring
        the Coppertone?

104
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,499
- The...

105
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,570
           - He says he's having
                 a heart attack.

106
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,406
              He's always having
                 a heart attack.

107
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,808
- I'm not always
having a heart attack.

108
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,311
      - Nope, just when the lawn
                    needs mowing

109
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,579
             or the gutters need
                        clearing

110
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,516
                  or the garbage
               needs taking out.

111
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,418
       - Can you describe
    the pain you're feeling?

112
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,421
    - It feels like someone
      sitting on my chest,

113
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,524
   slowly squeezing the life
           out of me.

114
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,895
  - How about we take a look?

115
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:34,066
- Keep your hands off of me.

116
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:39,371
I want to go to the beach.
I want to go to the beach.

117
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,943
    - Oh, Dr. Charles, good.
     Could I get a consult?

118
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,347
   I need to get this splint
on her, but she won't sit still.

119
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,384
- I'm late, and we're still
30 minutes away

120
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,652
from Fort Lauderdale.

121
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,455
                  - Ms. Francis,
   I am so sorry to hold you up,

122
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,090
    but do you mind if I ask you
          a couple of questions?

123
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,424
                I'm Dr. Charles.

124
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,792
- Well, I hope you're not
one of those

125
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,394
stuck-up Princeton boys.

126
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,029
            - Oh, heaven forbid.

127
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,832
     University of Pennsylvania,
            thank you very much.

128
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,835
       Please forgive Ms. Reese.

129
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,838
     Smart and caring as she is,
           she's still learning.

130
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,774
            Do you mind terribly
       if we were to borrow this

131
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,076
        so that we could contact
                your loved ones?

132
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,545
- Well, if it won't
take you too long.

133
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,115
       - We will make it snappy.

134
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,117
                  Be right back.
                      Thank you.

135
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,689
So it didn't occur to you
she might have dementia?

136
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,558
That name didn't mean anything
to you, "Connie Francis"?

137
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,527
               - Should it have?

138
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,830
- Oh, I'm so damn old.
Just call her contact.

139
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,932
                          - Uh--

140
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,901
- If you could just fill
each of these with nuts,

141
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,036
and I brought the nuts.

142
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,639
I'll take care
of everything else.

143
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,691
                        - Helen,

144
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,742
     I thought this was gonna be
       a little bit more casual.

145
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,512
- But I just--I want it to be
just right, you know?

146
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,880
I want--I want it to be
something

147
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,882
she'll remember always.

148
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,891
            - Helen?

149
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,527
    Hey, what were you doing
     with my mother-in-law?

150
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,796
                   - Who, Helen?
              Was she just here?

151
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,898
          Wish I would've known.
             I would've said hi.

152
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,566
- She handed you
that pink box.

153
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:15,567
                          - Huh?

154
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,069
- What's in the box,
Maggie?

155
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,205
Maggie!

156
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,674
       - Napkin diaper nut cups.

157
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,210
- What?

158
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:28,547
       - Napkin diaper nut cups.

159
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,881
 You fold the colored napkin up,
                        you see,

160
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,983
   and then you hold it together
               with safety pins,

161
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,085
    and then you stuff it--
 - You're throwing me a shower?

162
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,154
                     - Surprise!
             Tonight at Molly's.

163
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,590
- So the whole
ladies' night ruse--

164
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,759
      - Just roll with it, okay?

165
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,794
- Fine.

166
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,096
           - Oh, how's baby Doe?
                     Poor thing.

167
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,632
- He's stable for now.
And the mother?

168
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,235
                 - Just came to.

169
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,504
- Do we have any information
on her yet?

170
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:57,175
           - All we know is that
            her name...is Erika.

171
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,146
       - Okay. Thank you.
            - Yeah.

172
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,853
         Hello, Erika.
        I'm Dr. Manning.

173
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,555
             - When can I leave?

174
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,923
   - Based on how much blood
            you lost

175
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,792
      and what your body's
         gone through,

176
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,863
         I'd say you're
    at least here overnight.

177
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:21,166
Is there anyone I can call,
your mother or father?

178
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,502
                           - No.

179
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,637
- Maybe a friend?

180
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,176
                 - Did they find
                   the backpack?

181
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,779
- Yes.

182
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,822
How did you end up
in that alley, Erika?

183
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,291
Why did you leave your baby
there?

184
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,593
                 - I don't know.

185
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,829
        I mean, I knew something
         was going on inside me,

186
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:56,001
   but I figured if I could just
not think about it, then maybe--

187
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:59,571
                  I'm so stupid.
                          [sobs]

188
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:03,775
               I'm just so happy
        that somebody found him.

189
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:07,946
- Erika, honey,
how old are you?

190
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,316
                           - 14.

191
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,190
                There is someone
                   you can call.

192
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,664
    - She's 14 years old, a kid.
            She's scared, alone.

193
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,965
- What about the family?

194
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,900
       - Her mother's in prison.
             Father's long gone.

195
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,902
   She does have an older sister
    living in Champaign, though.

196
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,737
               I left a message.

197
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,173
              Here's the thing--
        she was two blocks away.

198
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,208
Two blocks--maybe she was trying
               the make it here.

199
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,743
- Is that what she said?

200
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,112
                   - She clamped
             the umbilical cord.

201
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,014
                She did not mean
              to harm that baby.

202
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,983
- Right. Put him in a backpack.
Leave him in an alley.

203
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,284
That'll keep him safe.

204
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,219
  - It's not that cut and dried.
              She was delirious.

205
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,755
- She left her baby to die.
It's exactly that cut and dried.

206
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,591
                - She's a child.

207
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,060
     She wasn't ready for any of
                    this, right?

208
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,261
    - People come here for help.

209
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,862
      I try to leave my feelings
                      out of it.

210
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,331
      - Well, that's convenient.

211
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,167
      Look, you don't understand
     because you're not a woman.

212
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,169
- Don't give me that.

213
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,170
People need to be held
accountable, regardless of sex.

214
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,973
    - This is a safe haven.

215
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,275
 She could've dropped the baby
    off, no questions asked.

216
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,978
 - So now you do have feelings?

217
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,114
  She's got to live with this
   for the rest of her life.

218
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,983
       Do we really want
     to punish her as well?

219
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,718
- You're talking
as if there's a happy ending

220
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,885
where that baby survives.

221
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,654
                  - That baby is
               going to survive.

222
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:26,658
- And if he doesn't, then what
that girl did is murder.

223
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,927
How you gonna feel then?

224
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,411
   - Who's the pediatric surgery
                attending today?

225
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:47,946
- Dr. Grant.

226
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,414
               - I've got to get
            back down to the ED.

227
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,784
     Page me if anything changes
with this one's condition, okay?

228
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,690
         - Dr. Rhodes.
            - Yeah?

229
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,059
           - Your father called.
     Wants you to call him back.

230
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,061
           - Thanks.
           - Mm-hmm.

231
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,233
        - Excuse me, Dr. Czerny.

232
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,235
 You said yesterday that you may
            have some time today

233
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,137
              to discuss our new
           tranexamic acid drug?

234
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,405
- Talk to me tomorrow.

235
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,307
And are you
even supposed to be in here?

236
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,076
     - Have a great...day.

237
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,748
         Good morning.

238
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,316
                 - Good morning.

239
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,254
        - Dr...Halstead.

240
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:32,190
I'm Zoe Roth with Stewart
and Breck Pharmaceutical.

241
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,694
                         - Will.

242
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,331
- Okay, so how big of a problem
is blood loss

243
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,900
during surgery, Will?

244
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:45,236
           - I'm an ER doc, Zoe.
      Don't do a lot of surgery.

245
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:52,277
                 But keep going.
        I might learn something.

246
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,913
- Well, you should know
that S&B is conducting

247
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,948
a major multi-institutional
trial

248
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,783
to establish
our product's efficacy

249
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:02,921
in so many different uses
and procedures.

250
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,990
 - I'm sorry, I have a patient.
    Can we do this tomorrow?

251
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,493
- W-what about later?

252
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,129
Maybe over dinner?

253
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,897
                       - Dinner?

254
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,935
      Sure, I'm free for dinner.

255
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,271
- Good.
Say about 8:00?

256
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,074
           - Yeah, I'll meet you
                      out front.

257
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,811
- Call me if there are
any conflicts.

258
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,880
           - All right, will do.

259
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,482
                   - Yeah, okay.

260
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,120
          - She's very friendly.

261
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,821
     - Just doing her job.

262
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,923
          - You got a high fever
  in treatment 5, dog bite in 4.

263
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,291
            These just came back
                from cardiology.

264
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,327
- Uh, thank you, April.

265
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,265
                  - Doug, Jenna,
                      good news.

266
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,367
           Second set of enzymes
                 came back fine.

267
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:53,004
           Both EKGs are normal,
        CK and troponin as well.

268
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,273
              These chest X-rays
                     look solid.

269
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,908
- So you're telling me
I'm fine?

270
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,143
    - That's what the tests say.

271
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,011
  Looks like you are good to go,
                      my friend.

272
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,446
       - I knew it, huh?

273
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,515
   We wasted six hours here,
   and it's all on your head.

274
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,884
                - Well, it's not
                    that simple.

275
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,318
                There are plenty
                of other factors

276
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,987
             that can contribute
                  to chest pain.

277
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,523
              It could be reflux
            or stress, anxiety--

278
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,491
           - [laughs]
       Yeah, like I said,

279
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,093
        all in his head.

280
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,561
       Speaking of which,
  just in time to pick up Liam

281
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,830
         from daycare.
              Bye.

282
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,034
           - I'm gonna refer you
              to a cardiologist.

283
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,653
                  She'll get you
                  on a treadmill

284
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:26,271
             and put you through
            a stress test, okay?

285
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,374
- Like Jenna's not
enough of a test.

286
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:33,411
I started calling her
"Jenna-cide," as a dig,

287
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,547
but it turns out
she likes the nickname.

288
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,248
                    - All right.

289
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,450
 I'll see if they can get you in
                this week, okay?

290
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,319
                In the meantime,
                  you tell Jenna

291
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,288
           the doctor recommends
                 no lawn mowing.

292
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,856
- [chuckles]
Just in time

293
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,391
to start shoveling snow.

294
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,126
  - All right, you take care.
      - Thank you so much.

295
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,260
                   - Absolutely.

296
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,564
                   Heard you had
             a bit of a morning.

297
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,300
- Yeah.
So listen, my mother-in-law's

298
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,101
throwing me
a surprise baby shower tonight

299
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,603
that I totally
don't want to go to,

300
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,538
so you have to come
with me.

301
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,475
      - Can't. I'm having dinner
                       with Zoe.

302
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,543
                          - Zoe?

303
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:09,047
- The new S&B pharma rep.
Blonde hair.

304
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,216
                 - Yeah, I think
                 I know the one.

305
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,384
          So you're deserting me
              in my hour of need

306
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,253
                 to go get laid?

307
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,121
- What are you talking about?
It's strictly business.

308
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,357
She wants to pitch me
on their new TXA product.

309
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,892
                     - Whatever.

310
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,293
- I was frantic
trying to figure out

311
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,863
where she'd gotten off to.

312
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,432
 - Mr. Donovan, how long have we
 been in the Connie Francis era?

313
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:31,369
- We met in Fort Lauderdale,
Spring Break, 1960--

314
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,906
                       same year
  "Where the Boys Are" came out.

315
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:38,643
         Carol loved that movie.
    She mixes it up in our life.

316
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:42,046
       This past year, it's been
        getting worse and worse.

317
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,649
     - Mr. Donovan, caring
   for someone with dementia

318
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,318
    is one of the most demanding
             tasks in the world.

319
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,287
                 Remind yourself
               from time to time

320
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,421
             it's okay not to be
                        perfect.

321
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,123
- Thank you, dear.
I'll give that a try.

322
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,859
         - Mr. Donovan,

323
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,594
   I just need your signature
  for these discharge papers.

324
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,063
- What did I do?

325
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,598
                  - You get that
            from a greeting card

326
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,500
            or a fortune cookie?

327
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,904
     - So where's my wife?

328
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,106
       [tapping on glass]

329
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,077
Thank God.

330
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,979
Carol?

331
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,481
                  - Who is this?

332
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,182
- Your husband.

333
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,118
         - My husband?
             - Yes.

334
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,689
He loves you,
and he's gonna take you home.

335
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,958
       - I'd rather go with you.

336
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,326
- I wouldn't know
where to go.

337
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,995
Tom does.
Tom knows the way home.

338
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,968
- She'll need to keep the splint
    on for about six weeks.

339
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,537
             - I feel so stupid.

340
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,105
    Get up to go to the bathroom
          and trip over the rug.

341
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,676
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

342
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:48,112
Are you hearing
what I'm hearing?

343
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,331
Are you okay to walk?

344
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,549
Would you mind just getting up
and taking a few steps for me?

345
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,585
            - Sure.
         - Here we go.

346
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,450
What do you think?

347
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:10,435
  - Magnetic gait and complete
     recall of her injuries

348
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,303
not consistent with a diagnosis
        for Alzheimer's.

349
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,539
          - Very good.
       - What's going on?

350
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,075
- I'd like to run a few tests
on your wife.

351
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,409
I promise it won't take long,

352
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,411
and it could very well
be worth our while.

353
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,513
                         - Sure.

354
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,717
        [alarm blaring]

355
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,252
    - Juvie's hemorrhaging!
           Trauma 2!

356
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,625
- How many pads
did she soak?

357
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,627
        - Dozen or more.
     - She must still have

358
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,330
              retained products.
       Which attending did this?

359
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,632
- They were busy.
I did it.

360
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:45,370
                          - You?
                     You did it?

361
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,738
                         [sighs]
             All right, page OB.

362
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,239
Let's get her
up to the OR now.

363
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,708
           - Got it.
       Yep, your newbie.

            [beeps]

366
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,588
        - How many units
        has she gotten?

367
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,756
- 6.

368
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,591
 - Her most recent hemoglobin?
             - 5.9.

369
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,060
 - She still looks like a ghost.
           She needs more blood.

370
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,462
                Restart the MTP.

371
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,532
      - Give me methergine
   and 1,000 mics of Cytotec.

372
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:26,744
         Little room--

373
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,587
        - Erika Dougherty's been
        in the system for years.

374
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,823
 In and out of foster care since
      her mom was sent to Logan.

375
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,225
     Runs away when the families
             don't kick her out.

00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,796
     Suspected substance abuse,
  at least alcohol, maybe worse.

377
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,466
  - Would you ask Dr. Manning

378
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,601
    to step in here, please?
         <i> - Yes, ma'am.</i>

379
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,270
What about the baby's father?

380
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,105
                      - [laughs]
                      Who knows?

381
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,641
           Erika's been arrested
more than once for solicitation.

382
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,343
         - Ms. Goodwin?
      - Yes, Dr. Manning,

383
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,145
           this Madeline Gastern

384
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,248
             from the Department
   of Child and Family Services.

385
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,683
               What's the baby's
                      condition?

386
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,552
         - He's stable.
      - And Ms. Dougherty?

387
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:08,753
- Dr. Pachefsky's
treating her.

388
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,421
She may need
a hysterectomy.

389
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,793
I reached her older sister,
Kara Dougherty.

390
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,329
She's on her way
up from Champaign.

391
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,764
Kara's an adult.

392
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,601
Could she potentially take
custody of Erika and the baby?

393
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,336
                  - Potentially.

394
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,472
- I know you always try
to keep families intact.

395
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,107
          - Thank you,
          Dr. Manning.

396
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,612
  - This girl is in big trouble.
   She could be going to prison.

397
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,748
- Come on.
She's 14 years old.

398
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,817
Solicitation or not,
that's rape.

399
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,586
          - Doesn't absolve her.

400
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,354
                    She's facing
     several potential felonies.

401
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,556
                    Abandonment,
               attempted murder.

402
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,726
 It's up to the State's Attorney
 and the judge, but Cook County?

403
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,161
          Anything could happen.

404
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,205
- I thought I got it all.

405
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,207
     - Forcing the delivery
        of the placenta

406
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,610
     is an OB procedure, so
what the hell were you thinking?

407
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,312
- It was an emergency situation.
I made a decision.

408
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,714
                    - A bad one.

409
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:12,183
    You overstepped your bounds,
             and you botched it.

410
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,918
         That girl almost needed
                 a hysterectomy.

411
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,754
                  A 14-year-old!

412
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:20,358
             Now, let me ask you
            something, Dr. Choi.

413
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,627
   You didn't like this patient.
         You disapproved of her.

414
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:26,230
- You think that affected
my judgment and my performance?

415
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,766
                  - You tell me.

   <i> - Dr. Halstead to the E.D.</i>
    <i> Dr. Halstead to the E.D.</i>

           <i> Code blue.</i>

418
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,874
- Dr. Halstead,
cardiac arrest, treatment 5.

419
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,277
         Your patient.
          <i> - Code blue.</i>

420
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,813

     he was gonna be okay.

421
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,248
          - Get the pads on him.

422
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,185
      - He was in earlier.
       Is there anything

423
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,553
        we need to know
        from his charts?

424
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,622
- No. We did a full workup,
and everything checked out.

425
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,858
     - I was driving home,
     and he--I looked over

426
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,294
        and he was just
       white as a sheet.

427
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,363
  And then I turned around and
 drove back as fast as I could.

428
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,965
         I don't think
       he was breathing.

429
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,633
             - Ma'am, I'm sorry.
       You need to wait outside.

430
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,702
- Okay.

431
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,376
      - Hold compressions.

432
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,445
             V-fib,
     charge to 200 joules.

433
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,247
        Everyone clear.
          all: Clear.

434
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,316
        [electric pulse]

435
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,785
                - I got a pulse.

436
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,887
           He's in sinus rhythm,
                    brady at 50.

437
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:23,888
             - BP?

438
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,873
                   - 90 over 45.

439
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:27,857
            [beeps]
 Wait, wait, wait. 72 over 35.

440
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,561
     - Start dopamine at 10
and titrate to a systolic of 90.

441
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,230
          - Yes, sir.
      - Get a 12 lead EKG.

442
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,564
                   - Right away,
                   Dr. Halstead.

443
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,567
   - We gotta get his BP up.

444
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,575
        - You paged me?

445
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,010
                    - Dr. Grant.

446
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,347
        - Pneumothorax.
     Right lung collapsed.

447
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,585
        Tubing him now.

448
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,797
- O2 sats at 78.
We get below 75 and--

449
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,466
   - We're not getting below 75.

450
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,567
           Campbell.

451
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,636
- What do you need?

452
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,372
           Inhaled nitric oxide.
 We need to improve oxygenation.

453
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,307
- I'll get a tank.

454
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,778
- He's really bradycardic.

455
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,380
    - Turn up the dopamine.
  It should help the pressure

456
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,848
        and heart rate.

457
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,517
       - Dr. Halstead, it's been
    15 minutes--make a decision.

458
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,419
    - I'm not giving up yet.

459
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,056
        RV's not moving.

460
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,925
       - You have a blown-out RV
            and severe akinesis.

461
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,028
       I think you might want to
     consider giving more fluids

462
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,330
           instead of escalating
                   the pressers.

463
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,738
      - Call RT for a tank
        of nitric oxide.

464
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,640
- Nitric oxide?

465
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,541
  - It'll reduce the afterload
  so that the heart works less

466
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,444
       and buy some time
  till the cath lab is ready.

467
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,645
- I've never seen
it used for this.

468
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,348
   - It's unorthodox, I know,

469
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,050
but I don't have a balloon pump,
   and we're out of options.

470
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,721
        - RT says Dr. Manning is
      signing out the last tank.

471
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,923
      They'll have another ready
                 in ten minutes.

472
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,426
    - He'll be dead by then.

473
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,633
       Nat, where are you going?

474
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,868
- NICU. Baby Doe's sats
are in the 70s.

475
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,770
       - Put him on ECMO.
    - That's a last resort.

476
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,405
                    - I'm sorry,
           but I need this tank.

477
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,406
                 - What the hell
                  are you doing?

478
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:23,607
- I have no other option.
You do.

479
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,775
      - Give me that tank!
             - Nat,

480
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,477
my patient will die
without it.

481
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,745
       - You're putting the baby
                        at risk.

482
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:28,913
- I'm not gonna lose this guy.

483
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,881
            - Will--
     - He's got three kids.

484
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,984
Try thinking like a doctor
and not a pregnant woman.

485
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,460
- He's in v-fib.
Lost his pulse again.

486
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,761
                - Charge to 200.
                 Everyone clear.

487
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,029
            [beeps]
          all: Clear.

488
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,131
        [electric pulse]

489
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,900
     One more round of epi.
           Let's go.

490
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,470
     Restart compressions.

491
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,807
- Nothing.

492
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,142
           - Come on!

493
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,844
            - Doug?
         Doug, please?

494
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,546
Please listen to me, okay?
We need you, all right?

495
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,981
       I need you, okay?
            - Nurse.

496
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:07,051
           - Please?
    [sobbing] Please--stop.

497
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,388
- Hold compressions.

498
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,391
I got a pulse.
Sinus brady again.

499
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,626
      - Start amnio drip.
 Let's get him to the cath lab.

500
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,896
                - Let's unclamp.

501
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,865
            Turn on the circuit.

502
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,666
          - ECMO acts
    as a heart-lung bypass,

503
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,002
 oxygenating the infant's blood
       outside its body.

504
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,542
       - Sats are rising.
          - Thank God.

505
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,810
         - Dr. Manning?

506
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:35,079
    There's a Kara Dougherty
     downstairs to see you.

507
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,747
                         - Okay.

508
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,018
- The usual, Dino.

509
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,832
- Dr. Charles.

510
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,034
                     - Dr. Choi.

511
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:08,913
               You were in the--
          what, the Navy, right?

512
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:12,049
- Still am.
Naval Reserves.

513
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:16,053
   - Doc I did my residency with
was on away leave from the Navy.

514
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,939
                      [chuckles]

515
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,824
 It was tough as hell practicing
       psychiatry with you guys.

516
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:22,960
            Couldn't get anybody
                     to open up.

517
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,063
- Could be
a sign of weakness.

518
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,674
                    - Pork rind?

519
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:37,741
- No, thanks.

520
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,043
                           - No?

521
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,682
      I shouldn't eat this stuff
                        so much.

522
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:48,152
   Guess that military culture's
                   tough, right?

523
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:51,755
             Loose lips and all?

524
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,892
                [loud crunching]

525
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:03,968
                 [clears throat]

526
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,569
               Last chance, man.

527
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,838
                     Pretty sure
                they're organic.

528
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,907
          - I'm good.
             - No?

529
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,853
- Kara, I'm Natalie.
We spoke on the phone.

530
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,088
               - I brought Erika
                   some clothes.

531
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,823
- Thank you.

532
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,292
      - Where's my sister?
          - Follow me.

533
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,062
There were some complications
with the birth,

534
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,964
but we think the baby's
gonna be fine.

535
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,099
                    - You think?

536
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,534
- It's still very early,

537
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,969
but we have the best
neonatal ICU in the Midwest.

538
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,271
I could take you up to see him
if you want.

539
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,705
                  - Maybe later.

540
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,173
- I spoke to a social worker.

541
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,175
It might be possible
for Erika and the baby

542
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:48,245
to come live with you.

543
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,581
           - Let me talk to her.

544
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,956
             - Hey.
             - Hey.

545
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:19,209
  - You really stabilized him
         using nitric?

546
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,779
          Interesting.

547
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,280
- What about the patient?

548
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,583
        - The RCA was completely
                       occluded,

549
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,851
   and there was a 60% occlusion
              of the circumflex.

550
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,120
       I stented both and placed
    an impella for a couple days

551
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,889
              to rest the heart.

552
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,358
         What was his code time?

553
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,226
- Maybe 20 minutes total.

554
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,028
                   - 20 minutes?

555
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,298
          I would've let him go.

556
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,771
           What's the difference
       between God and a doctor?

557
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:51,909
              God knows he's not
                       a doctor.

558
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,155
      - I just got a page.

559
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,857
                   - Dr. Rhodes?

560
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,493
- Yeah?

561
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,128
         - Please, my boss wants
                 to talk to you.

562
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,064
            - Okay.

563
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:30,147
     - You wear the scrubs well.

564
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,718
- I'm glad you approve.

565
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,687
                    - Long time.

566
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,724
        Got a couple of minutes?

567
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,193
        We can go grab a coffee,
                 maybe catch up.

568
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,729
- I'm working.

569
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,698
                           - Ah.

570
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,734
   You know, I took it as a good
      sign that you'd come home,

571
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:52,403
         that maybe you'd worked
            through your issues?

572
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,071
- My issues?

573
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,906
                      - Come on.

574
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,175
                      Let it go.
                  Let's move on.

575
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,444
- You're still the same,
aren't you?

576
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,246
Just untouchable.

577
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:04,332
    - Let me tell you something.

578
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,417
When you left this town, Connor,
              I was deeply hurt.

579
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,987
                           Yeah.
                 You ask Claire.

580
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:14,425
      But right now, I'm willing
      to put all that behind me,

581
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:17,895
               for the two of us
                  to start over.

582
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:25,002
- It's a good pitch, Dad.

583
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:28,772
Really.
You hit all the right notes.

584
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:33,243
I'm not buying it.

585
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,486
          - We can go.

586
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,126
              - You ready to see
                    your nephew?

587
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:51,395
- I wish I could
help them.

588
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,429
                         - Kara.

589
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,131
- I just got a promotion--

590
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,034
customer service rep--
and my boyfriend and I

591
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,303
are talking about us
moving in together.

592
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:02,272
I've come too far to get sucked
   back into this crap again.

593
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,508
- They're your family.

594
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,811
           - You make that sound
              like a good thing.

595
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,758
           - Hold that position.

596
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,196
- What did you say
this might be again, hydro what?

597
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:27,531
                - Hydrocephalus.

598
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,266
                 Literally means
           "water on the brain."

599
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,136
      The lumbar puncture should
          relieve some pressure.

600
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,971
- So her dementia might--

601
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,974
    - Well, hopefully, we'll see
     some cognitive improvement,

602
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:39,143
         and if that's the case,
  we'll implant a surgical shunt

603
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:41,812
        for long-term treatment.

604
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:45,382
- I, uh...[chuckles]
the summer we met,

605
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:47,551
dancing to "Where the Boys Are."
             - Wow.

606
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:50,187
- I'd give anything
to see that look in her eyes

607
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,955
even one more time.

608
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,525
How did they miss this?

609
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,527
How did I miss it?

610
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,830
           - How would you know?
  I mean, give yourself a break.

611
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,865
             It goes undiagnosed
                80% of the time.

612
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:04,868
- I feel like
I betrayed her.

613
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:10,874
      - Sometimes, when somebody
        that we love gets sick,

614
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:13,510
         very easy to lose sight
                   of the person

615
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,279
       and see only the disease.

616
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:21,552
  Remembering that our loved one
is still there--not always easy.

617
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:24,888
   Why don't you go get yourself
          a cup of coffee, okay?

618
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,423
          This can take a while.
                       I'm here.

619
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,192
       I know where to find you.

620
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,536
                   - Nat.

621
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,309
         - Dr. Manning,

622
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:48,111
  the police are on their way
  to talk to Erika Dougherty.

623
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,147
           - Police?
   - That's the way it works.

624
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,515
- What are they gonna do
to her?

625
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,016
                 - I don't know.
               It's not my call.

626
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,852
- Can't you change this?

627
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:57,421
      - No, and neither can you.

628
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,892
- Well,
this should make you happy.

629
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:16,440
          <i> [TV voices]</i>

630
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:17,441
           <i> [TV stops]</i>

631
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:19,576
- Listen...

632
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:23,080
the hospital's
only two blocks away.

633
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,182
                  - What?

634
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,583
- The police
will be here soon.

635
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:31,021
Tell them you knew the hospital
was only two blocks away.

636
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,890
          - The cops are coming?

637
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:35,893
- And tell them
you clamped the umbilical cord.

638
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:40,063
You wanted your baby to live.

639
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,546
- The neurologist
will talk more about this,

640
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,515
but there are going to be
deficits--

641
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,450
increased irritability,

642
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:03,654
forgetfulness,
impaired mobility.

643
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,156
He won't be getting out of bed
anytime soon.

644
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:09,026
                    - I'm sorry.
       I don't understand, um...

645
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,460
                       deficits?

646
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,429
          - We'll see
     how he does in rehab.

647
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,532
 I'm sorry, but your husband's
  going to need a lot of care.

648
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:21,505
                   - Oh, my God.

649
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,312
             What have you done?

650
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:33,083
      Have you turned my husband
               into a vegetable?

651
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:38,555
- We don't know the extent
of the damage.

652
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,292
    - This is not what Doug
        would've wanted.

653
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,227
   He would never want this.

654
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,730
Why didn't you tell me something
    like this would happen?

655
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:50,467
             We...
      We have three kids.

656
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:54,338
   We live--we live paycheck
          to paycheck.

657
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,507
 What am I supposed to do now?

658
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,146
             You son of a bitch!

659
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:08,118
[sobbing]

660
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,360
             [continues sobbing]

661
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,100
              - She's still weak
              from the delivery.

662
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:25,002
- We just need to ask her
a couple questions.

663
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,338
She's not facing
any charges yet.

664
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,274
           - Would you mind just
    giving me a moment with her?

665
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:34,544
         - Yeah, sure.

666
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,586
- She's gone.

667
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:45,355
 - Shocker. Leave a 14-year-old
     runaway unattended...

668
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,562
         - [deep sigh]

669
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:55,599
        That poor baby.

670
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:59,336
       I had this fantasy
   I could give him a family.

671
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:01,538
     Where was my head at?

672
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,174
- You weren't thinking
with your head.

673
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,377
               And good for you.

674
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:12,582
  You want out of the shower,
    everyone'll understand.

675
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,385
Ugh, maybe not Helen.

676
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,787
Oh, Helen.

677
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:19,222
        [both chuckling]

678
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,759
- Yeah.

679
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,796
Yeah.

680
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,833
         Time to rally.
          - All right.

681
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,512
  - Dr. Charles...do you know?

682
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,215
        Did they find that girl?

683
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:46,817
- Oh, not yet.

684
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,756
         - I think it's my fault
                   she took off.

685
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,292
                      I told her
         the police were coming.

686
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,727
- Huh.

687
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,563
So, um...

688
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:01,832
how's that
sitting with you?

689
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,402
       - Thought I'd feel worse.

690
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:08,772
- Huh. Interesting.

691
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,618
           - What are you doing?

692
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,421
     - Trying to figure out
      where I went wrong.

693
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:27,424
  Guy showed up this morning.

694
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,159
I ran these, discharged him.

695
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:32,529
Two hours later, he's wheeled
in with a massive MI.

696
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,831
How did I miss it?

697
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,471
         - Where was the lesion?

698
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,739
- Right coronary.

699
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,344
                   - I know what
                I'm looking for,

700
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,746
                 and I don't see
              any abnormalities.

701
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:53,350
- I got the guy back,
but it's not good.

702
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:56,486
It's not good.

703
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,691
                   - Sorry, man.

704
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,494
                      It's late.
                          [pats]

705
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,862
- Yeah.

706
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:12,702
- Hello there.

707
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,172
Do you know where you are?

708
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:16,940
                - In a hospital.

709
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,409
         - And can you
   tell me your name, please?

710
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,479
                        - Carol.
                  Carol Donovan.

711
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,614
                         - Good.

712
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:28,485
        - Why am I here?
     - You had some buildup

713
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,887
in the frontal subcortical
region of your brain.

714
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,823
We drained about 50 ccs
of spinal fluid.

715
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,760
      - What my colleague
        is trying to say

716
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:39,229
            is that
  you weren't quite yourself.

717
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:40,864
   The pressure on your brain
        was causing you

718
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,733
         to see things
      in a different way,

719
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,635
     and now that pressure
       has been relieved.

720
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,805
     Can I ask you, do you
 feel strong enough to stand,

721
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,408
       take a few steps?
       - Oh, yeah, sure.

722
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,686
          Tom, honey.

723
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,763
           - Carol. You're back.

724
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:16,399
        - I was here...

725
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,736
       and I was not here
       at the same time.

726
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:23,006
    Like I was fading away.

727
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,608
     It all seemed so real.

728
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,743
        - Your memories
   are gonna feel very real.

729
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,778
    That's perfectly normal
      and to be expected,

730
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,014
          but this was
     just a temporary fix.

731
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:34,517
          We're gonna
 have to do another procedure.

732
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:41,358
- Ms. Donovan, I have something
    for you and Mr. Donovan.

733
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,829
         I went online
   and did a little research.

734
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,500
  <i> ["Where the Boys Are" plays]</i>

735
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:54,537
          <i> - ¶ Where ¶</i>

736
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,742
        <i> ¶ The boys are ¶</i>

737
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:03,380
    <i> ¶ Someone waits for me ¶</i>

738
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,782
- Not bad.

739
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,960
           - Hello?
       <i> - Zoe, it's Will.</i>

740
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,762
  - Dr. Halstead, how are you?

741
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,764
        - I am so sorry.

742
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:22,465
 I got bogged down with a case,

743
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,501
    and I totally lost track
            of time.

744
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:27,604
      My bad, completely.
 Can I--can I get a rain check?

745
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,143
         - No problem.

746
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,911
  I just got pulled into a sales
      meeting that's going long,

747
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,880
        so this works out for me
                        as well.
