1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,850
- Thank you.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,950
- Stop trying to calm me down.
You're not good at it.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,460
- I'm just saying,
there's no reason to be nervous.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,860
- Joey, it's Match Day.

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,400
They're gonna hand me
a piece of paper

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,440
Telling you I am going to do my residency

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,770
I understand but

8
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,750
- It's literally the
turning point in my life,

9
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,550
both the world's assessment
of my past

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,560
and a map of my future.

11
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,660
It's my whole life.

12
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,390
- That's an awfully
dramatic way to put it.

13
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,440
- That's because you're
not good at calming me down.

14
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,660
- Pathology at Chicago Med
is your top choice.

15
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,900
Everyone here thinks
very highly of you.

16
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,340
You're at the top of your class.

17
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,540
Plus you are
extremely attractive.

18
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,940
- Joey.
- Reese.

19
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,180
It's going to be pathology.

20
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,180
You'll be down
in the basement with me.

21
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,550
- I'm still not calm.

22
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,450
- Well, I-I really don't
mean to nag,

23
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,690
but I think it's important.

24
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,820
- I understand.

25
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,560
- I know it's what Jeffrey
would have wanted.

26
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,690
- I'll think about it, okay?

27
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,840
Bye, sweetie.

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,710
I'll see you later.

29
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,430
All right.

30
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,350
Hey.

31
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,220
How are you doing?

32
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,720
- Fine.

33
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,430
- Really?

34
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,960
- Jennifer Baker.

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,990
The drug trial I got her on,

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,300
I found out they're
giving her a placebo.

37
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,970
- Oh, Will, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,410
- They're treating her cancer
with sugar water.

39
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,850
- Well, my mother-in-law
is driving me crazy.

40
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,980
- Cloth diapers again?

41
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,010
- No.

42
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,310
She wants me to
get Owen christened.

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,350
- So?

44
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,450
She's Catholic.
It's what we do.

45
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,510
So was Jeff.

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,760
- Lapsed Catholic.

47
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,430
And he hated parochial school.

48
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,320
Always told me horror stories
about all the nuns.

49
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,660
- Eh, we all tell those stories.

50
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,720
Doesn't mean a thing.

51
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,300
Hey, take it from
a formal altar boy.

52
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,730
Baptism's a piece of cake.

53
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,390
A lot easier than a briss.

54
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,970
- But I'm not religious.

55
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,670
Wouldn't it be hypocritical?

56
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,370
- Eh, think of it like
a vaccination.

57
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,830
Do it and get it over with.

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,400
Hey, this is my world.

59
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,710
I'll make a few calls,
hook you up.

60
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,710
We'll do this together.

61
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,310
Incoming.

62
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,310
- Lisa Patrick, early 30's.

63
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,820
Penetrating head wound
from falling ice

64
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,820
off the Citadel Center.

65
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,060
Tubed in the field.

66
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,990
BP's 90 over 50, GCS 3.
That's her husband.

67
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,630
- Dr. Rhodes,
you're going to Baghdad.

68
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,060
- We were just
walking down the street.

69
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,430
It fell out of nowhere.

70
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,800
- Tell radiology
we're sending them a head CT.

71
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,600
- Got it.

72
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,870
- Set her up on tele
and get a pulse ox.

73
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,570
Easy.
- Set on my count.

74
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,940
One, two, three.

75
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,470
- Oh, God, is she gonna be okay?
Maggie...

76
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,300
- Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step to the side.

77
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,910
They're gonna do
everything they can.

78
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,380
- Gonna need an O2 sat.

79
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,720
- She's completely unresponsive.

80
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,610
- Pupils are fixed and dilated.
- Her head is crushed.

81
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,320
- The ice is penetrating
through the side

82
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
and the back of her skull.

83
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,890
- Yeah, looks like the ice
clipped the carotid.

84
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,590
She'll start to pump.

85
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,460
Two minutes tops,
and then she'll bleed out.

86
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,430
- All right, we got to clamp off
the carotid now.

87
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,330
- Well, without a scan, we don't
know what we're dealing with.

88
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,590
- Agreed,
but we don't have time.

89
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
- No, you're right.
Let's do it.

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,370
- All right,
chest and plastics tray.

91
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,610
We're gonna explore the neck to
get control of the artery.

92
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,700
- All right, I'll get suction.

93
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,040
- She's bleeding faster.

94
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,610
- All right, turn her.
But gently.

95
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,410
If that ice moves,
she's gonna gush like a hose.

96
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,540
Knife.
- Here, doctor.

97
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,950
- Okay, here we go.

98
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,950
- There's too much blood.
I can't see the carotid.

99
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,930
- Not in a good way.

100
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,360
Bleeding's picking up.

101
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,540
- There it is.

102
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,900
Damn it, I missed.

103
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,100
- Ice is melting.

104
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,840
- Suction can't keep up
with the bleeding.

105
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,880
- All right, gauze.
- 4 by 4.

106
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,450
- Wait, wait, wait, look.

107
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,050
- Yup, there.

108
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,620
Clamp.
- Clamp.

109
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,450
- All right.

110
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,510
Pull with the Richardson.

111
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,450
I need a little more exposure.

112
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,450
- Uh-huh.

113
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,490
- One more.

114
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,130
And there.

115
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,790
- Got it.
Bleeding's stopped.

116
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,840
- Let's cover it up
and get her up to CT now.

117
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,040
Nice work.

118
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
- Crushed skull.

119
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,480
Too much damage.

120
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,020
- She's never gonna wake up.

121
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,060
- Page from Dr. Choi.
- He's in Trauma 1.

122
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,820
- I want it off.
- That guy's crazy.

123
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,550
- I want it off!
Please take it off.

124
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,860
- Tell ortho hand
we're coming up.

125
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,060
Get a CBC, ABG, chem panel
and type and cross him for four.

126
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,520
- Got it.

127
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,460
- This is Mr. Tacker.
- He was in a hardware store.

128
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,070
Grabbed a hatchet,
tried to hack his arm off.

129
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,170
- It's not me!

130
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,800
- Medics gave him
a milligram of Versed

131
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,960
and four morphine in the ambo.

132
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,470
- Mr. Tacker,
I'm Dr. Charles.

133
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,000
What's going on?
- Can you cut it off?

134
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,750
- I'm not a surgeon, but I'd
like to try and help you.

135
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,170
- How bad's the injury?

136
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,740
- Cut through the radial artery,
but I think we can save the arm.

137
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,690
- No, no, no, no,
please don't...

138
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,120
- Mr. Tacker, I promise you
we'll talk about this later,

139
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,880
but right now,
our concern is your safety,

140
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,160
so we got to get you
up to surgery.

141
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,730
- No, no!
Cut it off!

142
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,800
- We'll talk later.
- I want it off!

143
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,200
- Any idea what that's about?

144
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,870
- Hmm.

145
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,700
I definitely want
to do a drug screen,

146
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,160
but I think we might be
dealing with something else.

147
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,580
- Crazy.
Poor guy.

148
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,750
- Mr. Patrick,
I'm Dr. Halstead.

149
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,920
I just saw your wife's scans.

150
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,490
I'm afraid I have bad news.

151
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,730
The damage is catastrophic.

152
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,660
- "Catastrophic"?

153
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,630
- Her heart is beating,
but the ventilator

154
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,170
is the only thing
keeping her alive.

155
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,070
I'm sorry, but her brain
is injured beyond repair.

156
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,670
Lisa is never going to wake up.

157
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,150
I'm very sorry.
- No...

158
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,850
No.

159
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,920
- Mr. Patrick,
you take as long as you need.

160
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,890
Before we take your wife
off the ventilator,

161
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,760
someone will be in to talk to
you about organ donation.

162
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,870
Again, I'm so sorry.

163
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,070
Agnes, let's call Gift of Hope.

164
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,050
But we'll give him some time
to process this, okay?

165
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,840
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

166
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,850
- Dr. Halstead.

167
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,750
About organ donation?

168
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,150
- You don't have to
think about that right now.

169
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,710
- No.

170
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,760
We've been trying to have a baby

171
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,620
for months now.

172
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,280
I read where you could
still use someone's eggs

173
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,320
when they're like this.

174
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,190
To make a baby.

175
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,660
- I believe so, yes.

176
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,760
- That's what I want to do.

177
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,630
I want a baby.

178
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,300
Our baby.

179
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,870
Roge... Roger, I'm tired of
waiting on these bedpans.

180
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,280
This is not something
people can do without.

181
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,780
Or you're gonna be up here
mopping the floor.

182
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,080
- Hey, Maggie.
- Uh-huh?

183
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,210
- You know anything
about the Maldives?

184
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,890
- The what?
- Chain of islands near India.

185
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,190
Bert is retiring at
the end of the school year,

186
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,190
so now he's on this, uh,
this big travel kick.

187
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,300
- Ah.

188
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,070
A week at the beach
sounds pretty good to me.

189
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,070
- No, no, he's talking months.

190
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,700
Wants to experience
it like a local.

191
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,160
- And he thinks you're
just gonna let him

192
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,160
take off like that?

193
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,800
- He wants me
to retire with him.

194
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,110
- What?

195
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,750
- Ms. Goodwin?

196
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,950
- Yes.

197
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,780
- We lost a patient
this morning, Lisa Patrick.

198
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,640
Her husband wants to
harvest her eggs.

199
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,910
Do we have a protocol for that?

200
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,660
Ms. Patrick will have to be
on life support for two weeks

201
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,030
for hormone stimulation therapy,

202
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,930
followed by
the retrieval itself.

203
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,770
It's an expensive
and complicated procedure.

204
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,040
- Well, he seems
pretty committed.

205
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,060
He says his wife
really wanted to have a child.

206
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,010
- Well, I imagine she meant
she wanted a child

207
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,210
she could mother and raise.

208
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,840
This is a little different.

209
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,100
- A lot different.

210
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,910
- I'll call gynecology
and get the process started.

211
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,640
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,220
- I didn't know what else to do.

213
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,890
My ex-wife's in China.

214
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,260
I, uh, couldn't
get a hold of her,

215
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,780
so I brought him here.

216
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,030
- Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

217
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,650
Mr. Jenkins?
- Yes.

218
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,430
- And you must be Eric.

219
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,060
I heard you swallowed
some magnets.

220
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,190
- From a game I got on my desk.

221
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,230
Like these.

222
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,060
- Sorry, I thought it was candy.

223
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,910
- I took my eyes off him for
two seconds to get a juice box.

224
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,860
Kid's got quicker moves than me.

225
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,070
- Mr. Jenkins used to
play for the Bears.

226
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,900
- Oh, yeah, I think I remember.

227
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,180
My husband was
a big football fan.

228
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,320
So how many magnets
did Eric swallow?

229
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,910
- Two, maybe three.

230
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,420
It's probably nothing, right?

231
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,090
When I was a kid,
I swallowed a quarter.

232
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,320
Went right through me.

233
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,190
- Have you had a tummy ache?

234
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,730
Has he thrown anything up?

235
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,960
How long ago
did he swallow them?

236
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
- Couple hours.

237
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,430
It's not serious, is it?

238
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,760
- Well, before I say that,
I'd like to take some pictures

239
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,060
of Eric's belly,
just to make sure

240
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,170
that everything's
moving through okay.

241
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,200
Is that all right with you,

242
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
if I take some pictures
of your tummy?

243
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,860
- Daddy?
- It's gonna be okay, son.

244
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,830
Don't worry.
- I want to go home.

245
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,070
- Do what you need to.
- Hey, hey, Eric.

246
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,110
Do you like to play with
building blocks?

247
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,770
Because I happen to have
the biggest block collection

248
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,110
in this whole hospital.

249
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,150
Yeah?
Okay.

250
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,290
Stay right here.

251
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,190
I think I have so many blocks,
I'm gonna need

252
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,890
a truck to bring them in.

253
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,930
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

254
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,200
- I'll check back in
in a little bit.

255
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,030
- Full abdominal series?
- You got it.

256
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,090
- Nurse? Nurse?

257
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,900
Hey, nurse!

258
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,470
- Are you talking to me?
- Hello?

259
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,730
Been here for two hours with
snot pouring out my nose.

260
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,870
- I'm sorry, but we need to see
patients in order of urgency.

261
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,950
- And I'm dying of
a sinus infection.

262
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,980
Maybe if you got off that iPad
and did a little work,

263
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,410
- Maybe you just need to
wait your turn.

264
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,860
And I'm not a nurse.

265
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,160
- Handled like
a true pathologist.

266
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,790
- I know, I'm sorry.

267
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,020
- My Match Day, I threw up
six times and passed out,

268
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,260
so I'd say you're doing fine.

269
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,990
- You did not throw up
and pass out.

270
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,340
- Wanted to, though.

271
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,230
- Was emergency medicine
your first choice?

272
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,540
- My only choice.

273
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,240
All I ever wanted to do.

274
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,110
- Even though it comes with
a lifetime supply of

275
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,240
angry snot guys?

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,940
- Has its downsides.

277
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,340
Then again, how many
jobs are there

278
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,880
where you literally
get to save lives?

279
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm sure you'll find pathology
just as rewarding.

280
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,290
- You are?
- No.

281
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,320
I don't get it at all.

282
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,930
- It's still there.

283
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,140
- Yeah.

284
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,840
I guess they were
able to save it.

285
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,810
- Oh, God.

286
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,950
- I'm sorry, it's, uh...
It's important to us

287
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,850
that you don't hurt yourself.

288
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,390
Mr. Tacker...
I'm a psychiatrist

289
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,490
and I'd very much
like to help you.

290
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,260
But I need to understand why

291
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,260
you tried to...
To sever your arm.

292
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,930
- I told you.

293
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,830
It's not mine.

294
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,000
It's not part of me.

295
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,970
- How long have you
felt this way?

296
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,840
- Since I was a little boy.

297
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,140
Four or five.

298
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,980
I'd look at it
and it just felt strange.

299
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,410
Like it belonged
to somebody else.

300
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,310
It's like walking around
with something dead on me.

301
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,950
- Sounds terrible.

302
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,910
- I talked to a doctor
a couple months ago,

303
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,520
asked him if he could remove it.

304
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,150
He threw me out of his office.

305
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,860
Told me I was crazy.

306
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,920
But I'm not crazy.

307
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,000
I've been on the Internet.
There are others like me.

308
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,640
I've tried to cope.
I just can't stand it anymore.

309
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,380
- Mr. Tacker.

310
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,380
If it's any comfort, I'm gonna
do everything I can to help you.

311
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,460
- So I got ahold
of Father Brady.

312
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,020
He's a sweet old guy.

313
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,590
Of course, he asked me
when was the last time

314
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,240
I went to confession.

315
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,340
Anyway, he's pretty booked up,
but he says if we commit today,

316
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,080
he can baptize Owen next Sunday.

317
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,370
- That soon?
- Yeah.

318
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,380
- Dr. Halstead?

319
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,450
I need to see you.

320
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,210
- Let me just
think about it, okay?

321
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,630
- I just examined your patient
for the egg harvest protocol,

322
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,460
and I can't in good conscience
go forward with it.

323
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,560
- This woman didn't want to
have children.

324
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,260
- Why would you say that?

325
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,140
- She was using birth control.

326
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,110
Look.

327
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,100
- An IUD.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:27,110
- It's not true.

329
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,390
- I can show you the ultrasound.

330
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,290
The IUD is definitely there.

331
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,420
- Maybe it's something else?

332
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,130
A growth?

333
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,070
- Mr. Patrick,
your wife was on birth control.

334
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,390
- But it doesn't make sense.

335
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,500
We were trying to
start a family.

336
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,360
- I can understand how hard
this must be for you.

337
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,640
- No!

338
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,640
We were tracking her cycles,
using ovulation kits.

339
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,300
We had names picked out.

340
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,210
- I know how much
you wanted a child.

341
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,240
I'm sorry things
didn't work out.

342
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,660
And I'm sorry you can't ask her.

343
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,530
- Excuse me, sir.

344
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,130
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

345
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,990
- Oh, man...

346
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm so sorry.

347
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,010
- Oh, please, this is
the least disgusting thing

348
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,010
I've cleaned up all day.

349
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,010
I, uh, wanted to thank you for
the way you calmed Eric down.

350
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,440
Since his mom and I split,
he really doesn't

351
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,050
get that sort of thing much.

352
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,020
- Well, it was my pleasure.

353
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,530
- He's falling for you.

354
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,130
- No, he isn't.

355
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,800
- I've seen that look
a million times.

356
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,800
His angel of mercy.

357
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,300
- Dr. Charles.

358
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,040
What's the word
on Mr. Tacker?

359
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,270
- No physical issues that would
make him want to self-amputate.

360
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,720
His labs are clean;
he's not on drugs.

361
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,140
- Psychotic.

362
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,050
- He is, in fact,
entirely rational.

363
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,460
- I think he might be suffering
from a very rare condition,

364
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,400
something I never
dealt with before.

365
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,390
B.I.I.D.

366
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,700
Body Integrity
Identity Disorder.

367
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,430
Bear with me now.

368
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,460
These people believe
that one of their limbs,

369
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,610
a part of their body,
is not their own.

370
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,140
His sense of self
does not extend

371
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,670
to the fingers of his left arm.

372
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,810
It stops at the elbow.

373
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,410
Sorry.

374
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,190
- I mean, who are any of us
to say where we end, right?

375
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,560
Or begin?

376
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,090
I mean, physicists will tell you
there's no physical self at all.

377
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,850
Right?

378
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,300
Just waves of energy.

379
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,270
A mystic will say that
we're all one big soup.

380
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,330
- I'm not a physicist
or a mystic.

381
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,130
I'm a doc who's spent his career
treating wounded soldiers

382
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,410
who begged me,
"Save my leg, save my arm."

383
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,270
You don't think you should
commit this guy?

384
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,870
- At this point,
my only option is to put him

385
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,110
on a 72-hour
suicide hold.

386
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,740
And then I got to
let him go home.

387
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,280
- And then what?

388
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,110
He'll try it again?

389
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,150
- Unless I can find a way
to treat him.

390
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,230
- Will.

391
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,230
- Hey.

392
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,230
What'd you decide?

393
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,400
Should I call Father Brady?

394
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,420
- No, it's, uh,
it's something else.

395
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,230
Jennifer Baker.

396
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,630
I heard from a trial nurse.

397
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,660
- What?

398
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,670
- She's going downhill.

399
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,210
Fast.

400
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,710
I'm sorry.

401
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,280
- I know it was coming.

402
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,280
But still...

403
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,350
If I'd just left her alone,

404
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,410
she would've been
spared all of this.

405
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,590
- Dr. Manning.

406
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,630
The little boy, Eric Jenkins,
his x-rays are up.

407
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,550
Better take a look.

408
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,660
- Page Dr. Rhodes, please.

409
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,700
- Will do.

410
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,560
- I'll talk to you later.

411
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,740
- And arms up.

412
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,640
- So they ever
give you guys breaks?

413
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,410
- Only as often
as the state requires.

414
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,270
- Maybe after Eric
gets the all-clear,

415
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,310
we could go out
for coffee sometime?

416
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,600
I'll try not to spill it on you.

417
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,280
That's really sweet,
but we're discouraged

418
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,960
from going out with our patients
or their families.

419
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,690
- I won't tell if you won't.

420
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,860
- Um...
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, Eric.

421
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,560
I... there is this thing
called transference.

422
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,440
Um, people develop feelings
for their caregivers.

423
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
It's not real.

424
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,810
- Hi, Mr. Jenkins,
I'm Dr. Rhodes.

425
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,380
Dr. Manning's
asked me to consult.

426
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,910
- Would you mind
stepping out for a minute?

427
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,550
- Sure.
- Thanks.

428
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,580
- Eric, can you show me
what you just made?

429
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,710
What is that?

430
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,250
- These are Eric's x-rays,
and these two dots

431
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,280
are the magnets.

432
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,660
They're attracted to
one another,

433
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,810
and if they meet,
they could pin separate parts

434
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,950
of his digestive tract together
and erode through

435
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,530
the thin intestinal walls.

436
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,460
- Which could cause
systemic infection,

437
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,260
obstruction, bleeding.

438
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,560
And any of those things
could be life-threatening.

439
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,540
- All right, so... okay, so, um,
so what should we do?

440
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,310
- In my opinion, we should
remove them surgically.

441
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,980
- But isn't surgery
kind of risky, too?

442
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,580
- Uh, yes, there is the
possibility of adhesions,

443
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,580
motility issues.

444
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,450
- What does that mean?

445
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,950
- His digestive tract
wouldn't work as well.

446
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,990
- The argument for surgery
outweighs the possible risks.

447
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,360
Every minute that we wait

448
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,490
increases the chance
of a bad outcome.

449
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,630
- I still can't
reach my ex-wife.

450
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,690
- Why don't you think about it?

451
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,530
I'll monitor Eric closely,
we'll get another set of x-rays,

452
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,430
and then we'll check back
in a little bit, okay?

453
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,460
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

454
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,700
- Natalie.

455
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,980
The kid needs surgery.

456
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,480
- Surgery could leave him with
a lifetime of complications.

457
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,380
It's not an easy
decision to make,

458
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,720
and that dad has to
make it all on his own.

459
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,350
You have no idea
how difficult that is.

460
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,590
- Mr. Wirtz?

461
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,450
Mr. Wirtz!

462
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,660
His pressure
just shot up over 190.

463
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,970
- He's not breathing
and his pupils are blown.

464
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:16,970
Call neurosurgery.

465
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,670
I need to intubate.

466
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,830
- He just got a head CT.
Look.

467
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,930
That's a Mount Fuji sign.

468
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,440
Air building up in his skull,

469
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,640
which means this is not mucous
coming out of his nose.

470
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,780
It's cerebrospinal fluid
from his brain.

471
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,040
He must've fallen
a few days ago.

472
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,440
This isn't a sinus infection.

473
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,780
This is an anterior
skull fracture.

474
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,790
And if we don't release
the pressure immediately,

475
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,790
he's gonna die.

476
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,430
I'm in.
Maggie, get the drill.

477
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,330
- Got you.
- Code blue team to the ED.

478
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,860
- Dr. Choi, I need you
to drill a burr hole.

479
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,460
- Can't.
Gunshot just came in.

480
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,390
- But this man's got about...
- You've seen it done.

481
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,440
Do it.

482
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,540
- Who's gonna do this?
- I am.

483
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,770
- But you're a med student.

484
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,570
Somebody has to.

485
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,440
Here.

486
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,110
We're both gonna
catch hell for this.

487
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,090
- Yeah.

488
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,660
- Are you sure you're
in the right spot?

489
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,110
- Three centimeters
from the midline.

490
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,140
Should be right above
the pocket of air.

491
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,140
- "Should be"?

492
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,010
- I'm through.

493
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,010
- BP back down 130 over 74.

494
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,530
- Damn, Reese, you did it.

495
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,690
- Uh-huh.

496
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,590
See what's taking neuro
so long to get down here.

497
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,430
- Got you.

498
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,970
- So I'm thinking our best
approach would be

499
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,640
a course of both medication...
A serotonin reuptake inhibitor...

500
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,040
And psychotherapy.

501
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,140
- It's not gonna work.

502
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,100
- How do you know
until we've tried?

503
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,410
- You see that guy out there?

504
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,020
They gave him something
called a nerve block.

505
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,120
- It's a regional anesthetic
injected near a nerve

506
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,150
to block a specific site.

507
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,930
- Maybe that could work for me?

508
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,200
You know, so I wouldn't
be so aware of the arm.

509
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,420
- Well, it wouldn't be
a permanent fix.

510
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,130
- I would do anything to make
this feeling go away,

511
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,120
even for a minute.

512
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,590
- Right.

513
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,170
I understand, I understand.

514
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,110
- And I would try the meds
and the psychotherapy

515
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,440
along with it.

516
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,780
- I would need your assurance

517
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,870
that you'd both
stick with your therapy

518
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,550
and that you wouldn't
harm yourself.

519
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,750
- I promise.

520
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,020
- Look, why don't I consult
an anesthesiologist

521
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,150
and, um...
And we'll go from there.

522
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,620
- Dr. Charles?

523
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,720
Do you think someone could get
me out of these restraints?

524
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,100
- All in due time.

525
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,530
For now, frankly, I'm just, uh...
I'm really encouraged

526
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,460
that we've come up with a plan.

527
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,890
- Ms. Patrick's still hooked up
to the ventilator.

528
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,840
Her husband agree
to organ donation?

529
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,850
- Not yet.

530
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,950
- He said anything?

531
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,860
- Just sits there.

532
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,830
- Hey, Father.
No, no, she hasn't decided yet.

533
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,030
As soon as she does,
I'll... I'll call you, okay?

534
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,840
All right, thanks.

535
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,810
Helping Natalie
with the baptism.

536
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,640
- Uh-huh.

537
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,570
She wants you to do that?

538
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,650
- Course.
Why wouldn't she?

539
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,240
What?

540
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,010
- You want my opinion?

541
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,160
- Sounds like I'm
going to get it.

542
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,660
- You need to give
that woman some space.

543
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,150
- Did you drill the burr hole
in the patient's head?

544
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,650
- I did.

545
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,890
- Ms. Reese,
you're not a doctor.

546
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,210
You're a student granted access
to this hospital,

547
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,120
strictly for learning purposes,

548
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,280
which means you are not licensed

549
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,590
to perform an invasive procedure
on a patient

550
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,300
without direct supervision
by an actual physician.

551
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,040
It is, in fact, illegal.

552
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,670
- I understand.
- I gave the order.

553
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,930
- Excuse me?

554
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,080
- I was confident she was
capable of this procedure.

555
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,250
- I'd warn you to be
very careful what you say.

556
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,620
- I've had extensive
clinical experience

557
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,820
with student doctor Reese.

558
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,790
I have full faith
in her abilities.

559
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,190
If you disagree with
this patient's treatment,

560
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,190
your disagreement is with me.

561
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,010
Don't either of you ever
put me in this position again.

562
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,650
- You did not have to do that.

563
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,850
- It's the truth, Reese.

564
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,780
And you're family.

565
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,310
We rise or fall together.

566
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,360
- Some help here!
I need some help!

567
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,860
- Daddy, Daddy!

568
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,000
- He threw up blood.

569
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,370
- Call the OR.
We're taking him up now.

570
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,760
- Okay.

571
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,630
- It's like you said, right?
The bleeding.

572
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,790
We should have operated.

573
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,840
- Wait here.
We'll keep you updated.

574
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,840
- It's my fault.

575
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
This is...
This is my fault.

576
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:09,790
- Looking for magnets in the
intestine is a little bit like

577
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,760
looking for a piece of gum
in a garden hose.

578
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,090
- How's the bowel look?

579
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,650
- Obstructed,
but no gross ischemia.

580
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,790
Looks like we got here in time.

581
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,100
One's in the stomach,
the other small intestine.

582
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,760
Let's get him out of here
while the bowel

583
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,800
still has some life in it.

584
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,210
Damn.

585
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,840
- What is it?

586
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,760
- The magnets must have
eroded through an artery.

587
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,920
- I need an extra
set of hands now.

588
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,450
- I haven't done that
since medical school.

589
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,280
Call a surgical resident.
- There's no time.

590
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,320
Get in here.

591
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,930
Here.

592
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,400
Hold this back.

593
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,440
There.
Right there.

594
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,100
- I'm getting a ton of blood
from the NG tube.

595
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
I got to give him a unit.

596
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,830
- He's a kid.
Not yet.

597
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,070
- I keep slipping.

598
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,770
- Can you get it?

599
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,880
- No, I lost it.

600
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,310
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

601
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,970
Hold still.

602
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,250
There.

603
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,180
Pinch down.

604
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,480
Right there.

605
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,250
- Got it.
- Good.

606
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,180
Clamps.
- Clamp.

607
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,490
- I don't see the vessel.

608
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,160
- It's buried in the fat,
but you've got it.

609
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,060
Trust me.

610
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,390
All right.

611
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,440
Now let go.

612
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,460
- BP's stable.

613
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,800
- Good.

614
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,280
Let's tie these off,
close up the holes,

615
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,100
and get him on his way.

616
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,250
Thank you,
Dr. Manning.

617
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,080
- Eric did fine.

618
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,440
He's gonna be okay.

619
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,310
- Thank you.
Thank you.

620
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,760
- Dr. Rhodes will come soon
and talk to you.

621
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,430
- Can I see my son?
- Yes.

622
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,450
In a little while.

623
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,170
Eric will be in the hospital
for four to five days,

624
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:03,240
maybe a week.

625
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,500
So I guess I'll be seeing you.

626
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,530
- Yeah.

627
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,040
- Got to get back to work.

628
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,270
- Sure.

629
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,460
- He's a young kid;
he's healthy.

630
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,010
He will heal fast.

631
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,220
Now be honest,
you kind of liked using

632
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,550
the giant intestine stapler.

633
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,390
I kind of liked using
the giant intestine stapler.

634
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,830
Everybody does.

635
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,860
Hey, I'm sorry for earlier.

636
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,470
When I snapped at you.
- It's okay.

637
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,300
- I just...
I felt for that dad.

638
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,210
Single parent, having to make
that decision by himself.

639
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,250
- I imagine it can't be easy.

640
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,320
- I have a decision
of my own to make.

641
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,110
Nothing so momentous,
but I'm having a tough time.

642
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,490
My mother-in-law is insisting
I get Owen baptized.

643
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,960
- Oh, family drama.
Now you're in my wheelhouse.

644
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,290
- Yeah.
Family and religion.

645
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,390
- You know, religion was
actually the one topic

646
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,850
we managed to avoid.

647
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,260
Dad never saw the upside to it.

648
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,490
- You're lucky.
- I don't know.

649
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
I always kind of envied
the kids who went to church.

650
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,000
You know, they were
a part of something.

651
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,430
It's like they had
their own tribe.

652
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,210
- Mr. Tacker.

653
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,970
I see you've had
your nerve block.

654
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,980
Should be starting
to feel it by now.

655
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,110
- I feel so much better.

656
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,620
How long will it last?

657
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,610
- Oh, several hours.

658
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,350
But we could always
re-administer

659
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,260
for longer periods.

660
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,300
I wanted to use the nerve block
in conjunction with

661
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,000
another approach
that I've been looking into.

662
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,240
It's called
"pretend therapy."

663
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,370
- The idea is that you function
as if the limb weren't there.

664
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,270
See what it's like
to go through life without it.

665
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,150
It's cognitive work.

666
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,050
- Sorry, I'm so tired.

667
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,450
- You know what?

668
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,210
The anesthesiologist
administered a mild sedative

669
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,360
before giving you the block.

670
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,130
Why don't I check back
with you in a bit,

671
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,390
and we'll get started?

672
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,920
- Could you pull my covers up?

673
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,270
I'm just a little cold.

674
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Dr. Charles.

675
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,630
Thank you.

676
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,110
For everything.

677
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,140
- Come on.
We're a team.

678
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,160
- Hope you're not
planning on jumping.

679
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,200
- No.

680
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,660
Everything is mixed up.

681
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,530
I saved a life.

682
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,300
And that was good, really good.

683
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,100
And then I got in trouble,
and that was bad.

684
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,980
And then Dr. Choi
stuck up for me.

685
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,450
Called me family.

686
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,480
- That sounds good, too.

687
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,380
- It was.

688
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,110
- So...

689
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,020
why are you out here?

690
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,260
'Cause it's Match Day,
and everything's mixed up!

691
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,020
- It'll all be clear very soon.

692
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,460
- Yeah.

693
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,190
- Mrs. Baker is too sick
to continue the trial.

694
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,190
- She's going home.

695
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,530
She's finally getting her wish.

696
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,560
- Yes.

697
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,800
- Dr. Halstead.

698
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,810
Dr. Halstead.

699
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,510
Guy in three
dislocated his shoulder.

700
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,750
Go.

701
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,650
Pop it back in.

702
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,150
- Okay.

703
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,100
- Blood pressure spiked.

704
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,130
- Mr. Tacker?

705
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,390
- I'm sorry!

706
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,410
- He slipped his restraint!

707
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,080
- He made a tourniquet
out of tubing.

708
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,110
Half milligram dilaudid.
- Yes, Dr. Charles.

709
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,180
- No, no, no, don't touch it!

710
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
The arm's dead.

711
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,720
You dump potassium
into the bloodstream,

712
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,370
he'd go into
cardiovascular collapse.

713
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,780
We have to amputate his arm.

714
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
Let's go!

715
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,450
- I'm sorry.
I had to!

716
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:33,490
- Yes!
Yes!

717
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,570
- Here you go.

718
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,740
- Mayo, baby!

719
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,360
Yes!

720
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,860
- Reese, Sarah.

721
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,750
- I haven't got room for them!

722
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,250
Yes, this is
your problem, Roger.

723
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Get them out of here!

724
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,690
- This is a lot of bedpans.

725
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,450
Are we expecting
a listeria outbreak?

726
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,720
- Some idiot in supply
added a zero to my order.

727
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,730
So instead of four dozen...
- You got 40 dozen?

728
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,300
- Uh-huh.

729
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,440
- See?
You can't retire.

730
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,570
How could you give all this up?

731
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,380
- Yeah, how could I?

732
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,780
It's so much better
than the Maldives.

733
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,630
- Well?

734
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,700
You got it!

735
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,600
Chicago Med, pathology.

736
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,430
This calls for celebration.

737
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,410
- Yeah.

738
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,450
- I'll get my coat,
and um, check Groupon,

739
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,470
and see where I can get a deal.

740
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,550
Congratulations.

741
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,440
- Reese.
You get your match?

742
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
- Uh-huh.
Pathology.

743
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,570
- Congrats!

744
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,020
That's what you wanted, right?

745
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,570
- Yeah.

746
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,580
Yeah, um, but this was starting
to feel sort of like home.

747
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,350
- Yeah.

748
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,890
We'll miss you.

749
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,350
- He played us.

750
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,550
- You mean me.

751
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,300
Look, nobody likes
getting snookered.

752
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,630
But that's not
what's bothering me.

753
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,370
It's why I fell for it.

754
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,830
- He's a good liar.

755
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,800
- Not really.

756
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,330
I didn't see the depth
of his desperation.

757
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,540
You know, didn't want to.

758
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,870
So I just pulled out
my standard playbook...

759
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,320
Meds, psychotherapy.

760
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,580
- What else could you have done?

761
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,080
- I could have gone up to ortho.

762
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,840
Looked for somebody
to take his arm off.

763
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:18,550
- Dr. Charles, we can't
intentionally maim a patient.

764
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,890
- Of course not.

765
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,820
All I'm saying...

766
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:27,430
in cases like this,
are the decisions we're making

767
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,430
really in the patient's best
interest, or are they in ours?

768
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,970
To make us feel better?

769
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,510
'Cause like it or not,
that's a happy ending.

770
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,500
- Mr. Patrick...

771
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,830
- You didn't know her.

772
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,860
I knew her.

773
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,140
- Come in.

774
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,800
- You paged?
- Uh, yes.

775
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,780
Mr. Patrick wants to
go forward

776
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,920
with the egg harvesting
protocol.

777
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,070
- I don't understand.

778
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,040
- Despite the IUD, he says
his wife would want this.

779
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,780
Hospital council says
we have no choice.

780
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,560
We have to restart Ms. Patrick
on the protocol.

781
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,060
- It's not right.

782
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,900
Loud and clear.
- Yes.

783
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,460
I agree.

784
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,430
- So why won't he listen?

785
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,930
- Well, Dr. Halstead,

786
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:42,670
sometimes we want to believe
something so badly,

787
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,700
we ignore the reality
in front of us.

788
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,610
You're familiar with that,
aren't you?

789
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,020
- Yeah.

790
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,160
- Hey.

791
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
- Hey.

792
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,860
- So...

793
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,890
I-I appreciate all the
trouble you've gone to.

794
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,070
The church, the priest.

795
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,070
Just not like that.

796
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,170
- Like that?

797
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,650
- I want Owen to be
a part of a community.

798
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,980
I just want it to be one
that I'm a part of.

799
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,910
So I'm gonna do it my own way.

800
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,090
I know Helen's gonna be upset,

801
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,190
but I hope you won't be.

802
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,020
- No.

803
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,220
Natalie...
it's your life.

804
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,470
And I want whatever's
best for you.

805
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,140
I need to move on.

806
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,040
So, as Father Brady would say,

807
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,050
"Go in peace."

808
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,650
- Can you just watch her
for a minute?

809
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,100
Thank you.

810
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Thank you for
not giving up on Jen.

811
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,230
- We're here today to celebrate
the newest member

812
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,760
And as we do at weddings
and funerals,

813
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,090
to offer our love and support.

814
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,040
It is the people in our lives
who bring us joy.

815
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,010
They are the color of our lives.

816
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,100
The beauty and the grace.

817
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,010
I can see by
this gathering today,

818
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,350
you will not walk
through life alone.

819
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,740
And so, little man,

820
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,310
I wish you Godspeed.

821
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,170
In front of all these
gathered on your behalf,

822
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,710
I baptize you,
Owen Jeffrey Manning.

823
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,340
- I thought he was gonna hit me.

824
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,010
But he thanked me.

825
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,870
- Must've been a relief.

826
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,780
- Jay, she was on a placebo.

827
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,810
They never knew.

828
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:24,660
It was all for nothing.

829
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,790
- No, you cared.

830
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,070
I think, if we care, then...

831
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,710
whatever happens,
it's for something.

832
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:40,180
We might not see the effect,
but...

833
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,320
It goes out there
and it circulates around.

834
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,920
It makes us all better,
you know?

835
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,060
- My brother,
cop and philosopher.

836
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,790
- You've got to think
big picture.
