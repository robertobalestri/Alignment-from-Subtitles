He got my eyelashes.

7

- You delivered him.
That doesn't give him your DNA.

8
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,147
- You'd be surprised.
The power of these hands.

9
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:16,315
- You can sign out
the patient in four.

10

- Look--look at Owen.
- Cute.

11
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,785
- Have you been up to see
Natalie today?

12
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:22,321
- Not yet.
- What's up with him?

13

talk about surgeries.

19
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,800
All I wanted was
to actually do one.

20
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,069
Kept hoping a speaker would
choke on his dentures

21
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,771
so I could cric him.
- Dinner tonight?

22
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,372

I'm in-house on call.

- Maybe someone'll need surgery.

26
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,815
I'm ready to cut.

27
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:53,152

the King with an ET.

Grab an intubation kit.

Maybe.

He's an ex-con.
- He's also my patient.

00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,034
- Christy Pierce.

176
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,604
- Oh, yeah.
Today's the big day.

177
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,005
- Uh-huh.
- Christy Pierce?

178
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,841
- Yeah, a teen
with aplastic anemia.

179
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,010
Been in and out of Med
the last ten years

180
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,045
due to infections,
but finally,

181
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,681
today she's getting
a bone marrow transplant.

182
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,884
- It hasn't been ten years.
- Yes, it has.

183
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,752
I know because I was
sitting in your chair

184
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,921
the first time her mother
brought her here.

185
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,791
- You think I'm tough?
You should've seen her.

186
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,659
- I'm going up to say hello.

187
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,162
- Give Christy a kiss for me.

188
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:14,633
- So Dr. Farinas has told me
that a transplant isn't painful.

189
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,601
You'll be awake the whole time.

190
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,069
- It's a simple process.

191
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,971
We'll administer
the donor's stem cells

192
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,106
through your central line.

193
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,707
- It's just like
a blood transfusion.

194
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,644
- Is it really happening?
Finally.

195
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,879
- Well, we just heard
from the clinic in Springfield.

196
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,214
The bags are en route.

197
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,849
- Oh, my God.

198
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,618
- Mom, you promised.
No crying.

199
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,754
- I'm sorry, I just--
I can't help it.

200
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,723
- And, Nick,
I can't believe you.

201
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,892
You're almost as tall as me.

202
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,961
- And he has been
a very busy little brother.

203
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,629
He's got all his friends
together

204
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,465
and they've been shoveling
driveways to raise money.

205
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,634
Oh, show Mrs. Goodwin the flyer.

206
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,607
- We're gonna send
Christy's donor and her family

207
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,877
on a vacation.
- They've already raised $1,000.

208
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,512
- That's a sweet gesture.

209
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,482
- He's just trying
to build up his muscles

210
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,051
to impress the girls.
- Am not!

211
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,887
- Well, I'll leave you
in good hands with Dr. Farinas.

212
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:09,955
I'll check back later.

213
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,990
- Thank you.

214
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,728
- Dr. Rose,
pretty slick in the OR.

215
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,564
- Thank you.

216
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,734
- That was a very fast
splenectomy for a fellow.

217
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,270
Had to be under 30 seconds.

218
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,805
Where'd you pick that up?

219
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,206
- Riyadh.
- Mm.

220
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,542
- Oil workers
got a lot of abdominal injuries

221
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:31,776
on the derricks.
- Hmm.

222
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,778
- Hold the elevator, please!
Hold the elevator!

223
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,547
- Ah! Ow!

224
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,982
Damn it.
- Sorry. Thanks.

225
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,149
- You okay?
- Yes.

226
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,719
I, um, just banged it
on the shower in Orlando.

227
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:41,920
- Let me take a look at it.
- No, no, no.

228
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,088
It's fine.
- No, no.

229
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,289
- It's fine, really.
- Just--hey, hey.

230
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,625
Shush, shush. Just, shh.

231
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,295
<i>[elevator bell dings]</i>

232
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,696
- [laughs]

233
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,632
Wait, no. No, no, no.
What are we doing?

234
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,934
- You are going to Ortho
to get that checked out.

235
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,769
- No, it's not necessary.

236
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,170
- Uh, your elbow is red

237
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,006
and it feels hot.
So, yeah, it is.

238
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,208
- Yeah, well,
I put myself on Cipro, so--

239
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,843
- Oh, so you know
you have an infection?

240
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,545
- Just as a precaution.

241
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,546
- Well, as a precaution,

242
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,015
because that may need
to be drained.

243
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,050
- [laughing]
- Look, Sam? Sam.

244
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,019
This is serious.

245
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,954
You know better.
Don't mess around.

246
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,656
- Okay. All right.

247
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,291
I will get it looked at.

248
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,027
- Okay.
That's all I'm asking.

249
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,628
- [chuckles]

250
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,898
- Ouch.
- You were right.

251
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,134
Two-bone distal fracture,
moderately displaced.

252
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,235
Needs to be plated.

253
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,736
- It didn't take
a diagnostic genius.

254
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,672
Not with that
degree of deformity.

255
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,206
Mr. Blevins--
- I'm done here.

256
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,875
Let 'em take me away.

257
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,877
- Well, I'm afraid, first,
you need surgery

258
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,278
to realign
the bones in your arm.

259
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,180
We're gonna have
an orthopedic surgeon

260
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,016
come down right now to--
- No. No surgery.

261
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,184
[coughing]

262
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,787
- Well, without it, your arm
may not heal properly.

263
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,921
You could have
a permanent deformity

264
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,056
and reduced function.

265
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,592
- Put a cast on it.

266
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,826
- Mr. Blevins,
you want some water?

267
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:58,330
- No--no, what I want
is to be taken out of here.

268
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,366
Put the cuffs--
[gurgles]

269
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,901
Put the cuffs on!

270
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,903
- Whoa. Mr. Blevins.
- [coughs]

271
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,237
[screams]
- Okay.

272
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,772
I need--
- [screams]

273
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,040
- All right, I need suction.

274
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,308
Get a crash cart
and have atropine ready

275
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,710
in case his heart rate drops.

276
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,745
We are not losing this guy.

277
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:19,317
- Where is he?
Where is Walter?

278
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,852
- We are running a few tests
right now.

279
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,921
When he's done,
I can take you to him.

280
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,924
Oh, Dr. Halstead,
this is Mrs. Blevins.

281
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,660
- Please, someone tell me
what's going on.

282
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,662
- Your husband
was in a car accident.

283
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,330
He has a badly broken arm

284
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,798
and in the last half hour

285
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,333
he began coughing up blood

286
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,802
and passed out.
- Oh, my God!

287
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,238
- Is Walter being treated
for any illnesses?

288
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,974
- No.
No, he's--he's fine.

289
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,877
I need to see him.
- Okay.

290
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,645
I can take you to his room.

291
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,953
- Excuse me. Um, Mrs. Blevins?
My name's Jay Halstead.

292
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,921
I'm a detective with
the Chicago Police Department.

293
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,224
I need to ask you a few
questions about your husband.

294
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,026
- Why are the police involved?

295
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,861
I thought Walter
was in an accident.

296
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,129
- Uh, yes.

297
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,964
He was driving a car
that he stole.

298
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,266
At gunpoint.
- What?

299
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,335
- There's multiple witnesses.

300
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,338
- That son of a bitch.

301
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,407
- I'm sorry.
Ma'am?

302
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,975
- My husband is no angel.

303
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,243
I knew that when I married him,

304
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,980
but he has been straight
for 18 years.

305
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,915
Has a job, a kid,

306
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,184
and now, out of the blue,
he throws it all away?

307
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,253
I warned him, if he ever
committed another crime,

308
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,454
I would leave him,
and that is exactly

309
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,989
what I'm going to do.

310
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,058
What do you want to know?

311
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
- Um, why don't we go
sit down somewhere?

312
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,095
Yeah.

313
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,934
- I'm looking for
a Robert Parker.

314
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,235
- Bobby's in Treatment 3.

315
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,204
Wha--who called
for a psych consult?

316
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,406
- The attending,
Dr. Movitt.

317
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,041
Why?
- I know Bobby.

318
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,276
Treated him for a month now.

319
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,477
He's just really kind.

320
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,046
- Huh.
I guess there's some concern

321
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,448
that he can't
take care of himself?

322
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,049
- Because he gave
some clothes away?

323
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,451
He just likes to help people.

324
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:03,488
- Oh,
just gonna have a little chat.

325
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,791
- He is such a good nurser.

326
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,760
I think it took Jeff
three or four days

327
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,463
to actually get the hang of it.

328
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,032
- He's so beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

329
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,167
Oh, look at this.

330
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,103
I couldn't resist.

331
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,805
A little something for him
to wear on the way home.

332
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,340
Isn't that cute?

333
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,510
- Oh,
I think he's finished.

334
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,078
- Oh, you think he is?

335
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,480
Here. I'll get him.

336
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:32,183
You come here.
You come here to me.

337
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:36,087
Yeah. Oh.
[baby coos]

338
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,390
Oh.
[chuckles]

339
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,025
- You know,
my parents emailed.

340
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,260
They should be here soon.

341
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,795
- Oh.

342
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:47,098
Well, they'll be so happy
to see the baby.

343
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,933
They must miss you terribly.

344
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,203
- Yeah, they complain
about it all the time.

345
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:56,808
Always asking when I'm gonna
move back to Seattle.

346
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,311
- Do you ever think about that?
- Oh, yeah,

347
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,013
but I want to finish
my fellowship.

348
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:05,483
- Oh.
Well, you met Jeff here.

349
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,452
You must have a lot
of good memories here.

350
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,187
- Of course I do.

351
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,122
- I mean, I know the weather's
not good in Chicago,

352
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,160
but Seattle, ugh.
That rain?

353
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,129
I'd get depressed.

354
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,232
What do you think?

355
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,301
- So, uh, how long you been
living at the shelter, Bobby?

356
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,336
- Uh, about two months now.

357
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,105
- And where were you
before that?

358
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,940
- At home.
Uh, Lincoln Park.

359
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,208
- Ooh, nice neighborhood.

360
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,143
Shelter must have been
quite a change.

361
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,578
- I don't mind.

362
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,547
The people there need me.

363
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,948
I don't have much anymore,

364
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,184
but what I do have,
I'm happy to give.

365
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,219
- And what prompted you
to make the move

366
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,954
from Lincoln Park?

367
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,823
- It's my wife's idea.

368
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,558
She said I was giving away
all of our savings.

369
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,526
Bankrupting the family.

370
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,929
She didn't know
what happened to me.

371
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,330
Why I changed.

372
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,365
- Uh, tell me how you changed.

373
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,368
- [chuckles]
I used to be a regular guy.

374
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,038
Corporate job, a house,
a couple of cars.

375
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,007
One morning I woke up,

376
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,577
and I realized that
the only thing I wanted to do,

377
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,146
the only thing that mattered,

378
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,048
was helping other people.

379
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,916
Giving whatever I had to them.

380
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:15,854
- Any idea of the, uh--
the source of this inspiration?

381
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,023
- You mean did God talk to me?
Or an angel?

382
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,527
No, no, I--
I just knew...

383
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,562
inside.

384
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,132
- I can barely see it.

385
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,968
- It's the gray spot
right here.

386
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,336
That's the hematoma.

387
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,971
We often see it in car crashes.

388
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,305
When the seatbelt you were
wearing tightened,

389
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,341
it caused a deep bruise
around your intestine.

390
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:39,143
- So I'm, like,
bleeding inside?

391
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,612
- Not anymore.

392
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,513
Blood's clotted now,
formed a solid mass,

393
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,916
causing the swelling and pain
you're feeling in your stomach.

394
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,451
The swelling should go down
in a couple days.

395
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,253
For the next few hours,
we'll continue to monitor you.

396
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,654
So sit tight, all right?

397
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,956
- What about Jess?

398
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,359
- She's still in ICU.

399
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,930
- We met at this coffee shop,

400
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,531
but it was too crowded,

401
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,035
so I suggested we drive
to one a few miles away.

402
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,639
That's when it happened.

403
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,509
Can I see her?

404
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,411
- I'll have a nurse
take you up to ICU

405
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,114
once Jess has been cleared
for visitors.

406
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:19,117
- Thanks.
- Sure.

407
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,455
- And initial there, please.

408
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,391
And sign here
to acknowledge receipt.

409
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,259
That's two bags HLA-matched

410
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,661
bone marrow-regenerating
stem cells

411
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:32,263
for patient Christy Pierce.
- Thank you.

412
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,265
Careful with these.

413
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,035
Thanks.

414
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,971
- Fingers crossed.

415
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,439
- Sharon.

416
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,643
I'm sorry to have to tell you
this, believe me.

417
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,011
- Tell me what?

418
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,646
- The hospital's decided
to shut down

419
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,481
Christy Pierce's transplant.

420
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,616
- What?

421
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,384
- Have you seen these?

422
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,286
- Yeah, Christy's brother
put them up.

423
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,688
He organized a fundraiser.

424
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,389
- For Christy's donor.

425
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,658
And the hospital is concerned
about the appearance

426
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
of an individual being
compensated

427
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,195
for donating an organ, which--

428
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,331
- Violates federal law.
I know that,

429
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,199
but no one's being paid.

430
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,734
The donor agreed months ago.

431
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,703
- Well, it still puts
the hospital and its staff

432
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,738
at risk for hefty fines,

433
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,373
sanctions,
I mean, even imprisonment.

434
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,376
- It's a kid doing a good deed.

435
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,211
He's a minor.
- It doesn't matter.

436
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,113
These flyers have put us
in an impossible situation.

437
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,248
- Well how about Christy's
impossible situation?

438
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,185
- Maggie.
- It--

439
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,587
- Christy has just gone through

440
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,191
five days of chemotherapy
and radiation.

441
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,460
Her body has been ravaged

442
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,662
in preparation
for this transplant.

443
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,399
Without it, she will die.

444
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,401
- It's out of my hands.
- No, Peter,

445
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,370
it's still in your hands.

446
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,271
Find a way to fix this.

447
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,273
- I will do my best,
but the law does not give me

448
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,576
a lot of room to maneuver
on this.

449
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,612
You need to look
for another donor.

450
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,583
- [sighs]

451
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:05,289
- I don't understand.

452
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,691
They can't just
shut the transplant down.

453
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,126
They can't do that.

454
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,195
- I'm sorry, Kathleen.
They can and they have.

455
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,331
- No, there must be
something you can do.

456
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,800
- We're exploring
our legal options,

457
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,702
but the only thing
we can do right now

458
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,570
is look for another donor

459
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,105
which we're doing.

460
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,807
- Wha--what if we promise

461
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,709
not to give any of the proceeds
to the donor?

462
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,780
- Unfortunately, the intent
was to give a financial gift

463
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,783
to the donor,
which is enough

464
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,351
in the eyes of the law.

465
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,753
- Intent?

466
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,488
Are these lawyers
gonna go in there

467
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,258
and tell my daughter
that intent

468
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,226
is more important than she is?

469
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,629
Are they willing
to let her die?

470
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,531
- Do you want me
to break the news to Christy?

471
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,466
- No.

472
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,071
I'm her mother.

473
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,773
I'll tell her.

474
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,419
- Mr. Blevins,
how are you feeling?

475
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,121
I hope that means better.

476
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,757
Has anything like that
ever happened before?

477
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,525
- How's the couple I hit?

478
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,861
- She's in the ICU.
We're monitoring him.

479
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,863
- Can they take me away now?

480
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,398
- First, we need to discuss

481
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,799
the results of your chest X-ray.

482
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,134
- [sighs]

483
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,769
- We discovered a mass,

484
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,871
approximately two centimeters
in diameter,

485
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,840
in the left lobe of your lungs.

486
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,441
Now, a finding like that,

487
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,310
in conjunction with
coughing blood--

488
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,146
I'm concerned.

489
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,181
We need a CT scan, and then
a possible biopsy--

490
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,117
- Don't bother.

491
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,418
- Well, we really should
determine--

492
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,121
- It's cancer.

493
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,592
I've known about it
for a few months.

494
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,561
- When I spoke with
your wife earlier,

495
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,697
she didn't mention
that you were diagnosed.

496
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,466
- She doesn't know about it.

497
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,469
- Well, have you started
treatment, or--

498
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,171
- Look, you've run
your little test.

499
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,140
You've checked all the boxes,
but now,

500
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,375
I just want the cops
to get me out of here.

501
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,344
- Well, I can't release
you until I'm sure

502
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,447
you're stable enough for jail.

503
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,183
- Well,
do what you have to.

504
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,686
- All right.

505
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:19,457

about this.

00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,433
- Look at this beautiful boy.

525
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,702
- Can you believe
we're grandparents?

526
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,771
Oh, I think he has
your daddy's mouth.

527
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,306
- You think?
- Watch his head.

528
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,475
- Oh, here. Here he is.
- Oh, my goodness.

529
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,310
- Oh.

530
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,313
- Oh, wait till
Auntie and Uncle Cliff meet him.

531
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,450
for when you and Owen
come to visit.

532
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,552
- Just don't take down
my Nick Carter poster, okay?

533
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:57,588
- We won't. We promise.
- Good. Right.

534
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,590
- Dr. Charles.

535
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,792
I heard Bobby was upstairs
getting a CT?

536
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,594
- Yeah, just want to rule out

537
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,631
any organic cause
for his behavior, that's all.

538
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,898
- You think he's crazy?

539
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,600
- You mean like delusional
or psychotic?

540
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,868
Not at all.

541
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,536
Quite rational, in fact.

542
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,438
- Then why the CT?

543
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,808
- Actions are a little
obsessive, if not compulsive.

544
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,277
You know,
giving your shoes away

545
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,646
in Chicago
in the middle of the winter?

546
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,414
You've, um...

547
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,450
taken quite an interest
in Mr. Parker, haven't you?

548
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,718
- Yeah, I guess I have.

549
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,721
It's...
never mind.

550
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,725
- Try me.

551
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,462
- St. Francis.

552
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,564
He reminds me of St. Francis.

553
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,900
I was raised Catholic.
- Ah.

554
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,635
- And growing up, we had
this little statue

555
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,570
of San Francisco in the garden.

556
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,372
Of all the saints,
he was my favorite.

557
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,740
He gave away all his money,

558
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,609
all his possessions,
to the poor.

559
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,412
Took care of the sick
with no thought of himself.

560
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,946
- Remarkable fella.

561
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,582
- I'm not saying Bobby
is an actual saint,

562
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,452
but...saintly?

563
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,587
Yeah.

564
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,089
- We're just--
want to make sure

565
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,458
we're doing the right thing
by him, that's all.

566
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,960
- Yeah.

567
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,565
- Boss?
- Yeah?

568
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,567
- Peter Kalmick's
in Treatment 4.

569
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,036
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

570
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,873
- What happened?

571
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,742
- I've been getting
these pounding headaches.

572
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,844
- His blood pressure spiked.

573
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,713
Dr. Movitt put him
on a nipride drip.

574
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:31,716
Pressure's coming down.
- Thank you.

575
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,589
- Christy Pierce,

576
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,124
there's nothing I can do.

577
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:43,661
You understand why the sale
of human organs is illegal.

578
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:44,895
Once they have monetary value,

579
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,597
at best,
poor people will sell them.

580
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,032
At worst, people will get
killed for them.

581
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,500
- I get all that.

582
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,868
How about you try this?

583
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,803
Bone marrow is not an organ.

584
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,139
- According to the National
Organ Transplant Act, it is.

585
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,707
- But that's wrong.

586
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,511
A donor's marrow regenerates
itself within two weeks.

587
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:01,946
It's just like giving blood.

588
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,647
- Come on, Sharon.
I've done my homework.

589
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,950
In 2011, the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals

590
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,586
ruled that bone marrow donors
can be compensated

591
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:10,721
because the cells are
blood parts, not organ parts.

592
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,056
- So what's the problem?

593
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,724
- The problem is that that's
the Ninth Circuit.

594
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,727
It's Arizona, Montana.
We're in Illinois, the Seventh.

595
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,529
It hasn't ruled.

596
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,131
Look--
[sighs]

597
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:22,600
I shouldn't just gone into
estate planning like my brother.

598
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:24,468
It's so much less stressful.

599
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,737
- I'm sorry you're suffering,
Peter,

600
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,173
but your stress is nothing

601
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:32,843
compared to
what's going on upstairs.

602
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,682
<i>[alarm blares]</i>
<i>- Help!</i>

603
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:41,085
- That's Jess's room.
- She must have thrown a clot.

604
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,586
- Help him, please. Somebody!

605
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,054
- He was complaining of
abdominal pain.

606
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,589
CT showed a duodenal hematoma.
- Oh, Mike!

607
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,525
Mike--
- Ah!

608
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:48,759
- It must've ruptured.

609
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,027
We need to get him
up to the OR, now.

610
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,762
- Yes, Doctor.
- Is he gonna be all right?

611
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,632
- We'll do our best.

612
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,066
- [grunts]

613
00:23:56,068 --> 00:24:03,507
- There's too much blood.
More suction.

614
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,942
- Suction.

615
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,046
- There's food particles
mixed in with his blood.

616
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,881
- Slow down,
it won't do you any good

617
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,516
if you make the injury bigger.

618
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,618
- If he bleeds out,
it won't help me, either.

619
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,987
It's a big duodenal hematoma

620
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,190
with pretty brisk bleeding
along the anterior perforation.

621
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,524
Stitch?

622
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,059
- The lac extends
into the second portion.

623
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:26,030
- I can see that.
- Stay clear of the ampulla.

624
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:28,899
- What did the Ortho say
about the elbow?

625
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,602
- Just concentrate
on your surgery.

626
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,070
- Did he drain it?

627
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,538
- Make sure you close
transversely.

628
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,606
- I got it.
- In two layers.

629
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:36,807
- I know what I'm doing.

630
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,476
- Don't take that tone with me,
Dr. Rhodes.

631
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,511
I'm your attending.

632
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,914
- Right.

633
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,818
Close him up.

634
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,121
Unless Dr. Zanetti
would prefer to.

635
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,030
- Helen?

636
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,702
Maggie.

637
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,505
- Why are you out here
and not with Natalie?

638
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,640
- Oh, um,

639
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,142
her--her parents
flew in from Seattle,

640
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:16,080
so...
they're in there with her.

641
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,148
- Okay.

642
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,185
- [sobs]
- Oh.

643
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,062
- [whimpers]

644
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,634
Je--Jeff was my--
my only child,

645
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,636
and...

646
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:41,906
and his dad and I divorced
when he was three.

647
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:44,642
He's remarried and...

648
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:48,045
lives in Arizona someplace.

649
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,182
The rest of my family is...

650
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,918
gone.

651
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,121
Jeff is gone...

652
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:00,291
and Natalie and Owen...
[sobs]

653
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:04,895
They're--
they're all I have.

654
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,831
They're all--
- Oh, honey.

655
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,968
- I don't want Natalie
and the baby go to Seattle.

656
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,305
- I'm selfish too.
I don't want Natalie to go.

657
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:15,639
- [sobbing]

658
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,643
- Hey there, Bobby.

659
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,046
- Hey.
- Got your CT results back.

660
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,648
I'd like to go over them
with you if you have a sec.

661
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,216
- I can finish this later.
- No, no. Stay.

662
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,818
It's--it's fine.

663
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,753
- So...

664
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,922
when we talked before

665
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,591
about the change you
experienced,

666
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,225
you said that it was sudden.

667
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,027
Happened overnight.
- That's right.

668
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,228
- The abrupt nature
of the change

669
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,198
made me wonder if there might
be a physical cause.

670
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,668
So here, I want you to take
a look at something.

671
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,971
This...

672
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,006
is an image of a typical brain.

673
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:51,875
And this...
is yours.

674
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,711
- Why does it look different?

675
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:58,148
- Because you, my friend,
had a stroke.

676
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,919
- That's--
I know stroke victims.

677
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:05,889
- There are actually many
different kinds of strokes.

678
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,792
Yours caused lesions to form
in the frontal lobe.

679
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,327
That's the region of the brain
that controls,

680
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,263
among many other things,
behavior and judgment.

681
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,165
- So you're saying
I'm brain damaged?

682
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,067
- I'm saying that,
in your instance,

683
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,003
the stroke didn't cause
any physical impairment,

684
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,404
but it did cause you to become

685
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,740
what, clinically,

686
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:26,310
I would describe as
pathologically generous.

687
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:29,680
Making you compulsively
driven to give.

688
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:32,916
- So I help people
because of damage to my brain?

689
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,084
- Basically, yeah.

690
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,654
- But it feels good.
It makes me happy.

691
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,023
- Makes sense.

692
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,891
- I--I...

693
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,126
don't want you to fix it.

694
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:44,795
- Well, that's fortunate
because,

695
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:45,829
truthfully, even if you did,

696
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,332
aside from some
behavioral therapy,

697
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,201
we can't.
- Okay.

698
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,804

we've given him,

Yeah, wouldn't know it

People who experience a life
and death situation together,

909

911
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,450
I'm sure Dr. Charles
can explain it.

912
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,419
- Right,
so what happens later?

913

to normal lives?

00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,722

916
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,430

917
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,478
- Nick, you'll have to say
"Happy Birthday" to your sister.

918
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,813
- It's not till summer.

919
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,482

receives a transplant,

920
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,284
we call that "Day Zero."

921
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,954
So, in a way,
it's like a second birthday.

922

Sharon.

924
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,926

925

926
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,438
- Don't start, Peter.
I know what I'm in for.

927
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,474
- Hey, hey.
I'm the bearer of good news.

928
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,011
The hospital's not gonna
take action against you

929
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:30,280
given the gravity
of the situation.

930
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:32,716
"U.S. prosecutes hospital
administrator

931
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:33,850

932
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:34,918
I don't think
the Justice Department

933
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
needs that kind of publicity.

934
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,855
So I think it is safe to assume

935
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,357
you are in the clear.

936
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:42,859
- Well, ain't that great.
- Sharon?

937
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,561
- A girl has to almost die

938
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,329
for this hospital to realize

939
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:49,699
that it's actually
here to treat patients?

940
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:53,436
You stay on your
blood pressure meds, Peter.

941
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,409
and then he nearly gets
that couple killed

942
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,577
so he can get free health care?

943
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,379
They should let the guy rot.

944
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,381

to protect his family.

945
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,750
- Sure. Sure.

946
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,418
- Here's a stat for you.

947
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,320
Health care expenses
account for over half

948
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:13,323
of all bankruptcies
in the U.S.

949
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,724
Be thankful you got
a great health plan.
