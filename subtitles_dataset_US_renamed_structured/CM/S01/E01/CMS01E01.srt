JAMIE: A few means three,

175
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,677
I've had more,

176
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,846
Well, we're gonna
take good care of
you here, okay?

177
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,514
You're at Northwestern?
Yeah,

178
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,683
Well, we better get
you out of here quick

179
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,555
so you don't miss
those midterms,

Hey, who's
my next patient?

The red tags have
all been handled,

183
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,166
Why don't you sit
down for a minute?

184
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,261
You know, exercise is good
for pregnant women,

185
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,635
Come on, next patient,

186
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,570

You guys don't
have to do that,

that you're gonna do

Thanks, guys,
I don't know what
I'd do without you,

197
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,300
Why am I putting in
this bolt? Where's my
good-for-nothing resident?

198
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,338
Put in her 12 hours,
Had to knock off,

Ms, Donahue,,,
What happened to her?

00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,347
Dr, Abrams, Dr, Halstead,
this is Ms, Donahue,

My husband, Joel, and I,,,
He's at work,
he's on his way here,

211
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,605
We're the parents,
Gina's our surrogate,

Is, is she gonna be
okay? And the baby?

215
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,783
The baby checks
out fine,
Oh!

216
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:54,217
Healthy heartbeat,
Amniotic sac and
placenta are intact,

217
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,522
Gina, though,
I'm afraid, suffered
a traumatic head injury

218
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,888
and, so far,
she's unresponsive,

219
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,630
We need to contact her family,
If you have any information,,,

220
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,371
My husband and I are
pretty much her family,

221
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,236
She's been Iiving
with us since before
the embryo was implanted,

222
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,368
Okay,

223
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,772
She's gonna get
better, isn't she?
She's gonna be okay?

224
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,315
I can't promise anything,

225
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,374
Oh!

00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,180
Oh, I can't believe this,

227
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,386
What about the baby?

228
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,125
It's too soon to
deliver, isn't it?
She's only 24 weeks,

229
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,753
Yes, the baby
needs more time,

230
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,160
What does that mean?

231
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,195
Are we gonna Iose
our child, too? Oh, my God!

232
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,496
No, Ms, Donahue,
I'm not saying that,

233
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,965
And I'm not
giving up on Gina,

234
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,904
But if the worst
did happen,

235
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,744
it might be possible
to keep her on
Iife support

236
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,576
Iong enough
for the fetus to
become viable,

237

So,,,

238
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,384
So what,
Gina just becomes

00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,587

Thank you,

Must've snagged
it on the wreckage,

246
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,522
You know, we do
have a couple of
doctors around here,

247
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,712
I could hook you up,

248
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,151
I don't need one,
But I could use
a nurse, though,

249
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,749
Come be my other hand,

250
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,831

Iike a plastic surgeon,

00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,435

Saudis paid me well
not to Ieave unsightly scars,

255
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,300
Could you pinch
those two sides together?

00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,278
There you go,
What about a tetanus shot?

00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,852
Our real Iast
name is Sanguessuga,

262
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,592
But my parents thought

263
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,321
"Sexton" sounded
more American,

264
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,828
and people could
actually pronounce it,

00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,123
Where are you from?

266
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,794

She has a pretty

but she's okay,
just a Iittle shaken up,

283
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,940
The orthopedic resident
is on his way to
put a cast on her,

284
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,602
And what about my husband?
I can't get any information,,,

285
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,545
We made some calls,
your husband's down
the road at Sinai,

286
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,645
They were able
to stabilize him, but
his injuries are serious,

he was headed
into surgery,

00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,520
How's this happening?

289
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,652
They were just going on
a father-daughter day trip,

290
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,282
She wanted to go to
the zoo, What am I,,,

291
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,357
Ms, Lewis, the best
thing you can do

292
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,361
right now is just be
there for your daughter,

293
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,659
We'II keep checking
on your husband, okay?

294
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,455
All right,

295
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,368

Everything Looks good,
Mr, and Mrs, Donahue,

297
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,509
Oh, thank you for doing
this, We just needed
to see her again,

298
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,718
She just squeezed my hand,
I swear, I felt it,

299
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,377
Her reflexes
are still intact,

300
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,184
Movement can occur,
but it's not purposeful,

301
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,855
Look, she just did it again,

302
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,692
right when you
wiped her stomach,
She responded,

303
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,303
Tell me that
wasn't purposeful,

304
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,776
Dr, Choi, Iet's get
a repeat CAT scan,

305
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,744

blanket here, buddy,

00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,363

00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,463

Uh, you two know
each other?

321
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:51,054
Yeah, old pals, Known
Jamie since he was eight,

322
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,817
He taught me
how to play chess,

323
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,892
Big mistake, Beats me
every time, I'm not kidding,

324
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,619
(CHUCKLES)

325
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,598
Uh, Jamie, I've got
your test results back,

326
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,903
I wish they were
a Iittle more encouraging,

327
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:09,236
You're pancytopenic,
which means that
your cell counts are Iow,

328
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,802
You've got a blood pH of
7,14, which means you,,,

329
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,070
I know,

330
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:19,243
I'd Iike to intubate you,
Put you to sleep,
Get you on a ventilator,

331
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,812
You're getting fatigued,

332
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,444
This would just
allow you to rest,

333
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,045
so that the antibiotics
can do their job,

334
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,918
I've been intubated
eight times,

335
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,416
I think I'II skip it,

336
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,964
All right,
I'II check back in Iater?

00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:40,894
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

338
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,566
Hey,

339
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,939
Well, there's something
I don't often see,

Looking stumped,

341
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,913

injuries are never Iike
you read in the textbooks?

she was a GCS 3,

344
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,192
And now, all of a sudden,
she's exhibiting

345
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,660
movement and
she's improved to a 6,

346
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,953
Well, that's good news,

347
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,799
Yeah, The baby's
parents will be happy,

348
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,403
Oh! She's a surrogate,

349
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,598
Oh, Wow! I don't know
how they do that,

350
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,973
Carry a baby and
then give it up?
(EXHALES)

351
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,877
I mean, I know it brings
a Iot of joy to other

352
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,670
Hmm,

353
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,049
Thanks, (GRUNTS)
Yeah,

354
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,744
You meet the new
guy yet? Rhodes,

355
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,878
You could say that,

356
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,914
Likes to throw
his weight around,

357
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,926
It all strikes me
as a Iittle arrogant,

358
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,788
Hey, I am not arrogant,

359
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,161
No, No, not at all,

360
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,427

more than anybody else,

Hi,

00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,008
We, uh, read to
the baby every night

401
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,742
so she'II recognize
our voices,

402
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,775

Sherry?
Dr, Halstead?

405
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,693
Need to Iower down
her CO2, Take her off
the vent and bag her,

406
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,254
Give her a dose of
mannitol and increase
her dopamine drip to 12,

407
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,095
Right away,
Doctor?

408
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,027
Gina's intracranial
pressure is rising,

409
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,562
What does that mean?

410
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,765
You said that she
was getting better,

411
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,067
Well, she is, in that her
function was improving,

412
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,475
But the swelling
of her brain is
getting worse,

413
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,909
We're gonna try to
control it with medication,

414
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,307
And what if
the medication
doesn't work?

415
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,050
Then she'II
require surgery,

416
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,545
The procedure's called
a "decompressive
craniectomy,"

417
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,856
Would that be
dangerous to the baby?

418
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,353
There's always
a risk for the fetus,

419
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,726
And for the mother
as well, So, yes,

420
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,822
That's why we hope
the medication does the trick,

421
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,701
Thanks, Sherry,
Call me in five,

422
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,707
Dr, Charles,

423
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,715
Jamie has pneumonia,

424
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,849
And if there's any
hope of beating it,

425
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,614
I need to get him
on a ventilator now,

426
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,456
Well, you heard what he said,
he doesn't want that,

427
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,355
No, we're past
what Jamie wants,

428
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,620
You know what, Doctor,
we're actually not
past what Jamie wants,

429
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,826
The kid has been so
brutalized his entire Iife,
He has a right to say no,

430
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,835
Intubating Jamie
is the only hope

431
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,564
we have of
keeping him alive,

432
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,970
What's that gonna give
him? A week? 10 days?

433
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,168
It could be six months,
A year, More,

434
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,235
And in that time
anything could happen,

435
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,974
new treatments are
coming along every day,

436
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,379
Now, is he on the Iist?

437
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,678
He's right at the top,

438
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,013
But a match is
highly unlikely,

439
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,213
He has HLA antibodies from
an islet cell transplant,

440
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,146
Well, have you spoken
to his next of kin?

441
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,315
Have they
weighed in on this?

442
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,688
There isn't anybody,
Dad took off years ago,

443
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,625

Bounces in and out,

444
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,555
Look, Dr, Charles, you know
what's gonna happen,

445
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,862
Jamie'II Iose
consciousness,
and as his doctor,

446
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,233
I'm gonna put him
on a ventilator,

447
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,498
But by then it
may be too Iate,

448
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,532
And there won't be
any more choices,

449

you give him a name?

518
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:03,990
I found this,

519
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,173
"From J,M, to M,A,"

520
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,947
You're not his girlfriend,

521
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,483
you're his fiancée,

522
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,288
(BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH)

523
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,372
Jorge,

524
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,193
Natalie, what happened
with the Iittle girl?
Hey,

525
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,959
She had a cardiac contusion,
Bruising caused her to arrest,

526
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,528
She's good now,
but it was a real scare,

527
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,897
Thank you,
Yeah,

528
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,016
Hey, your
comatose guy,

529
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,644
Seems Iike you'd
want to put him

530
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,153
on the hypothermic protocol
and protect his brain,

531
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,523
Well, I just gave him
twenty units of blood,

532
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,387
His pH is only 7,2
and he's too cold
to make a clot,

533
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,963
So, I didn't see
how the hypothermic
protocol would help him,

534
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,092
Hey, you're the fellow,
I'm just a resident,

535
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,938
Heard you're Iocal, Me, too,
Where'd you grow up?

536
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,234
Lake Shore Drive,

537
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,600
(WHISTLES) Nice,

538
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,937
Doubt we have any
friends in common,

539
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,806
Hmm?

540
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,219
Where'd you go to med school?
Johns Hopkins? Stanford?

541
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,012
No, I went to UAG,

542
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,154
Where's that?
Guadalajara,

543
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,154
Didn't see that coming,

544
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:13,755
Gotta go,

545
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,634
Her ICP is
unresponsive?

546
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,205
Her CPP is 40,

547
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,373
Sherry, get me
Dr, Abrams,

548
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,742
You're planning
to do the surgery?

549
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,908
What about our baby?

550
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,019
The meds we've
been giving Gina
haven't been effective,

551
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,615
Her intracranial pressure,
the brain swelling,

552
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,815
is getting to
a dangerous Ievel,

553
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,914
And we shouldn't
wait any Ionger,

554
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,658
I'm not sure we
can consent to that,

555
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,351
It's not really
a matter of consent,

556
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,496
Well, actually,
Doctor, it is,

557
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,428
We have a surrogacy
contract with Gina,

558
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,225
A rider to that is
a medical power
of attorney,

559
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,826
giving us the right
to make decisions
on Gina's behalf,

560
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,030
I don't see how
we can sign off

561
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,266
on a procedure
knowing it will
endanger our child,

562
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,139
Mr, and Mrs, Donahue,
Gina needs this surgery,

563
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,302
It's her only hope,

564
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,812
But it's not a guarantee
she's gonna recover,

565
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,780
No, But without
the surgery, I can
guarantee she won't,

566
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,687
You would just allow
her condition to worsen?

567
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:16,488
This is our child!
What would you do
to save your child?

582
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,235

control everything,

What Gina can eat, drink,
how much she sleeps,
Even what she wears,

585
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,243
We have to perform
this operation,

586
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,743
Well, I'd advise
against that,

587
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,246
Because this is
really comprehensive,

588
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,939
And nicely drawn up,
I might add,

589
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,913
The Iady probably
didn't even know
what she was signing,

590
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,280
We can't prove that,

591
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,449
We can't just stand
by and Iet her die,

592
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,989
I guarantee if we
perform this operation,

593
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,582
regardless of the outcome,
we'II be sued,

594
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,785
And they'II Iikely win,
And I'm,,, Millions,

595
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,223
And that's how we
make our decisions?

596
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,088
By how much
it's gonna cost us?
All right!

597
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,961
Get off the high horse,
Dr, Halstead,

598
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,035
How about we call
the Ethics Committee?

599
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,262
Be faster to call a judge,
But I'm not gonna
burn a favor on this,

600
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,534
This is ridiculous!
Why aren't you
trying to help us?

need to back off,

We just wanted to
have a baby, that's all,

It was a difficult surgery,
But it went well,

690
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,189
Dr, Abrams was able
to relieve the pressure
on Gina's brain,

691
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,658
Both Gina and the baby
came through just fine,

692
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,059

I missed before

I know how to do it,
I just couldn't
do it in there,

718
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,657
It takes practice,
that's all,

719

I'm fine with him,
I never miss,

Yeah, He's the ideal
patient,

You can't hurt him,
and his Iife's not
hanging in the balance,

better in pathology,

When he was eight,

749
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,170
You know, I was brought
in to help him cope
with his condition,

750
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,404
All the things he
wouldn't be able to do,

751
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,545
Did not need my help,

752

I mean, this kid
did more things

753

than most kids
his age ever do,
