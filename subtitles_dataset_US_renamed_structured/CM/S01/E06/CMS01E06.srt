1
00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:03,952
Incoming. Talk to me.

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:05,390
Female, late teens, hypothermic.

3
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:06,827
- GCS of 9.
- Trauma 2.

4
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:08,496
Can barely feel a pulse. She's really cold.

5
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,036
I got her.

6
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:11,381
Male, early 20s.
Fell off a plane at touchdown.

7
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:12,334
Go to Trauma 1.

8
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,082
Left chest is crushed. Unable to intubate.

9
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:16,259
Pale and unresponsive. Get intubation drugs.

10
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:17,910
20 of etomidate and 100 of succs.

11
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,881
Get a labs and a base deficit
and trigger the MTP

12
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:21,772
and start transfusing as soon
as the blood shows up.

13
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:22,607
On my count.

14
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:24,703
- Both: One, two, three.
- Transfer.

15
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:28,768
All right,
let's get that board out.

16
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:30,979
- Got it.
- Let's get a CPC and a crit.

17
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,321
Okay, let's roll him over.

18
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:33,753
And roll.

19
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:34,984
Hold him steady.

20
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:36,675
- Hold.
- Right here, Maggie.

21
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,371
Miguel. Miguel.

22
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:40,241
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?

23
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,122
Miguel!

24
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:42,862
ABCs intact.
GCS 9.

25
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:44,318
All right, get warm saline bags

26
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:46,543
in her axillae, groin,
and behind her neck.

27
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:47,901
And let's cover
the top of her head

28
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:49,315
to keep whatever heat
she has in.

29
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,663
- On it.
- Too much blood in the airway.

30
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,544
Can't see a thing.

31
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:53,032
Okay.
We're gonna crich this guy.

32
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:54,623
We're gonna need
about three more.

33
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:56,983
Get a core temp.

34
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:06,148
All right, let's get the X-ray
and the FAST scan in here now.

35
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,149
Trach set.
Got it?

36
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,751
Got it.
I'll bag him.

37
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:10,352
How's she doing over here?

38
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:12,388
Heart rate's 50.
Temp is 29 Celsius.

39
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,389
Still responding.

40
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,723
Breath sounds bilaterally.

41
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,058
Right is really muffled.

42
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,059
What the hell happened?

43
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:18,460
Stowaways from Mexico.

44
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:20,036
He fell out of the plane.

45
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:22,164
She came out of the wheel well
after landing.

46
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:28,363
All right.
Let's get a look at his chest.

47
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,682
X-ray clear.

48
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:32,975
Hemopneumothorax.

49
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:34,576
Dr. Choi, get a chest tube
in on the right.

50
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:35,577
You got it.

51
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,645
Roll!

52
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:42,251
- All right. Scanner.
- Here.

53
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:44,353
Thank you.

54
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:45,754
Pressure's down.

55
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,824
There's blood
throughout his belly.

56
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:50,426
We need to get him up
to the OR now.

57
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:51,527
He's gonna need a lap.

58
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,362
On it.
Calling the OR.

59
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,363
Yes, 100%.

60
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,066
Okay. I need to set his leg.

61
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,267
All right, Maggie?

62
00:01:58,269 --> 00:01:59,334
Yup.

63
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,239
Ready.

64
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:11,780
Okay.
All right.

65
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:14,183
All right.

66
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:15,584
- You wrap that up for me?
- Yep.

67
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:17,119
Whenever you're set, go.

68
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:18,876
Will do.

69
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,733
What's her core temp?

70
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,558
Still 29 Celsius.

71
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,960
- Got the Foley in?
- Yup.

72
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:26,302
Get 2 of Versed IV.

73
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:28,728
Get the ECD in
and set up for a DPL.

74
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:31,253
We have a very short window
to get her warm.

75
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,102
Versed in.

76
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:37,253
Go ahead and get me a flush.
I need heparin. Ready to travel.

77
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,678
All right, let's go.

78
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,003
Okay.

79
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:46,328
Start the infuser
and set it to warm.

80
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:48,420
Give me the big needle.

81
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:01,407
Just use the level one to warm.

82
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:02,798
Do not pressure infuse.

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,517
Got it.

84
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,244
ECD warming to 46 degrees.

85
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,236
Core temp's 35 and rising.

86
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:09,271
Heart rate's up, 60.

87
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,706
That should stabilize
her for now.

88
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,352
Good work, everyone.

89
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,131
Nice work.

90
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:16,433
I'm afraid she's not out
of the woods yet.

91
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:18,356
Hypothermia and hypoxia?

92
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,348
That's like hibernation.

93
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:23,963
It's, like, minus 60
to 70 up there.

94
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:25,921
What kind of screwed up
life did she have

95
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:27,890
that she took a risk like that?

96
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:29,057
Hey, no offense,

97
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,980
but not everyone's
born a Rhodes.

98
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,777
Thanks.
I keep forgetting that.

100
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:47,855
Can you lift your arm?

101
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,918
I... I can't.

102
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:52,132
Can you hold it out
in front of you?

103
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,156
Ha! Ah!

104
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:55,612
Okay.

105
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:56,676
Does this hurt?

106
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,477
Ah!

107
00:03:57,502 --> 00:04:00,680
He was playing in the
backyard, tripped and fell.

108
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:02,568
Dad says I'm clumsy.

109
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:04,900
You just need to watch
where you're going.

110
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:08,781
I think Parker
has fractured his left clavicle,

111
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:11,007
but we need to get an X-ray
to make sure.

112
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:13,766
The tech will be right in.

113
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,930
Hmm.

114
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,168
Why you think he gave us
all that money?

115
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:30,136
You mean he's not
honoring his late wife?

116
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,029
I doubt it's a coincidence
Cornelius Rhodes

117
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:35,192
gave to the hospital
where his son works.

118
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:36,232
You think?

119
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:39,092
Man who likes to be
in the center of attention.

120
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:41,417
Freaking world-class
narcissist, that guy.

121
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:43,950
Yeah, and what better way
to steal the spotlight

122
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,977
from his son than
by donating a million dollars?

123
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:49,424
Whatever his motives,
the money's green.

124
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,625
And I get a new psych ward!

125
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:58,331
Good morning.
How you feeling?

126
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:00,423
Wonderful, you know,
considering the fact

127
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:02,351
that I can't sleep longer
than 15 minutes,

128
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:03,942
and when I do actually
get comfortable,

129
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:04,966
I have to pee.

130
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,172
- Fun!
- Yup.

131
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:07,630
Did you try
that pillow I gave you?

132
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:08,672
Yes.

133
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:11,544
I added to the 20 other pillows
that aren't helping me sleep,

134
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:12,568
but thank you.

135
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,636
Oh.

136
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,194
Sarah's got a kid
with a fractured clav

137
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:16,276
in Treatment 1 for you.

138
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:17,151
Okay.

139
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:18,819
I'll just hit the bathroom

140
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:20,806
and then waddle my way over there.

141
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:22,966
- Talk to you later.
- See ya.

142
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,789
What?

143
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:37,827
How's she doing?

144
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:39,752
Still in and out
of consciousness.

145
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,868
Temp's back to normal.

146
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,993
Still waiting on her charts.

147
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:45,853
<i>Soy El Doctor Rhodes.</i>

148
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,521
<i>ÿCómo se siente?</i>

149
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:51,747
<i>ÿDónde... Miguel?</i>

150
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:54,023
Her name is Maria Gonzalez.

151
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:55,253
Miguel is her brother.

152
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:57,511
He was the one that
was brought in with her.

153
00:05:57,538 --> 00:05:58,604
All right.

154
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:06,536
Maria...

155
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:10,998
your brother was
very seriously injured.

156
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:16,002
Alive?

157
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:19,095
Yes. He is.

158
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:22,432
<i>Pero está en terapia intensiva.</i>

159
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:25,867
<i>Va a necesitar soporte vida.</i>

160
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:30,893
<i>El estaba tratando de salva.</i>

161
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,484
Why was he trying to save you?

162
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:44,220
<i>Nuestro padre... </i>

163
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:47,323
Our father...

164
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:50,351
is narco...

165
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,444
Sinaloa.

166
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:56,275
Not good man.

167
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,764
Want to sell me.

168
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:04,756
<i>Pero... </i>

169
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:08,426
<i>mi hermano,</i>

170
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:11,840
Miguel, protect me.

171
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:16,494
He get me out.

172
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,994
<i>Por favor, cuida a Miguel.</i>

173
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,787
<i>Cuida a Miguel.</i>

174
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:24,572
We will.

175
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:27,783
<i>Haremos todo lo Que
podamos por él.</i>

176
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:31,044
<i>Gracias.</i>

177
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,487
<i>Gracias.</i>

178
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:41,501
<i>Respir.</i>

179
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,826
Sorry, I have to go.

180
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,519
<i>Descanse.</i>

181
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:51,770
<i>Volveré pronto.</i>

182
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,521
<i>Respira otra vez.</i>

183
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:04,833
On the day you were born,
the Earth turned.

184
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,613
The moon pulled.

185
00:08:06,638 --> 00:08:07,937
The sun flared.

186
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:09,972
And then, with a push,

187
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:12,223
you slipped out
of the dark quiet,

188
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,973
where suddenly you could hear.

189
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:16,757
Parker's fracture is aligned,

190
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:18,929
which means
he will not need surgery.

191
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,285
Are you gonna put a cast on?

192
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,364
I want a cast!

193
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,201
Oh, sorry,
all you get is a sling.

194
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,777
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

195
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,851
Hey, well, I heard someone broke
his collarbone this morning.

196
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,408
Hey, buddy!

197
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,711
I was just telling them that
their son won't need surgery.

198
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,186
All right, well,
let me take a look.

199
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:36,482
Hi, Parker.

200
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,407
Do you mind if I check
your pulse?

201
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:39,180
Yeah?

202
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:40,505
Thank you.

203
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:46,315
All right, I'm just gonna take
a little peek in here...

204
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,941
see what's going on...

205
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,061
He's seizing!

206
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:52,085
What's happening to him?

207
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,443
Give me 1 milligram of Ativan.

208
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,958
He's having a seizure.

209
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:56,931
Does he have epilepsy?

210
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:57,722
No!

211
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:58,861
Any history of seizures?

212
00:08:58,886 --> 00:08:59,885
No.

213
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:03,668
You're okay, honey!

214
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:04,716
You're okay.

215
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,900
Oh, my God.

216
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:10,857
What just happened?

217
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:11,693
I'm not sure,

218
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,448
but I don't think
it's related to his clavicle.

219
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:15,523
With your permission,
I'd like to run some tests

220
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:16,610
and see what's going on.

221
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:17,921
Of course.

222
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:24,914
Come in.

223
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:28,750
Mrs. Goodwin?

224
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,451
Thanks for coming,
Dr. Rhodes.

225
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:34,380
These are agents
McManus and Ramirez

226
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:36,305
from Homeland Security.

227
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,273
Dr. Rhodes, you have
a female patient,

228
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:39,297
a stowaway?

229
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:41,055
Yes, Maria Gonzalez.

230
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,920
And she was brought in
with a companion?

231
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:43,706
She was.

232
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:44,936
Miguel, her brother.

233
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,093
Her brother?

234
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,112
We understand he's
unconscious in the ICU.

235
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,115
Mm-hmm.

236
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,593
We would like
to talk to Miss Gonzalez.

237
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:53,840
Well, I'm afraid that
she's barely conscious herself.

238
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:57,001
She's in no condition
to be questioned right now.

239
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:59,390
Any idea when we'd be able
to talk to Miss Gonzalez?

240
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:01,448
It's too early to say.

241
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:03,705
This woman is a victim.

242
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,514
Her father is a narco.

243
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,307
He was planning on selling her.

244
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:09,150
Her brother was only
trying to save her.

245
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,975
Sounds like you had
extensive conversations

246
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,267
with the semi-conscious
Miss Gonzalez.

247
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:15,506
No, that's all I know.

248
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,826
Dr. Rhodes, you realize
we wouldn't be here

249
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,236
if this weren't a matter
of great concern?

250
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:22,481
Yes, and he'll let you know
as soon as you can speak to her.

251
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:24,650
Thanks.

252
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:27,920
We'll be back.

253
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:34,250
And you can count on that.

254
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:41,913
I'm trying to make this
look pretty, Cedric,

255
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:43,683
but I'm afraid you're
still gonna have a scar.

256
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,897
That's a good thing, Doc.

257
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:46,673
Bigger the better.
Makes my case.

258
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:48,041
What do you mean?

259
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:50,711
Well, you see, my pops doesn't
want me to have a car.

260
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:51,837
Now I can say,

261
00:10:51,862 --> 00:10:55,631
"See, if I had been in my
ride instead of on my bike,

262
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,022
I wouldn't have this scar."

263
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:59,014
Or if you'd been
wearing your helmet.

264
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,272
Doc, don't confuse the issue.

265
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:02,663
What do you think?

266
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:04,088
That gonna do the trick?

267
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,127
Oh, yeah.

268
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:07,185
That's a Honda scar.

269
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,029
We aim to please.

270
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:10,961
You are good to go.

271
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:11,873
Thanks, Doc.

272
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:13,844
No problem.
She'll sign you out.

273
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,967
<i>Dr. Choi to ICU.</i>

274
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:20,922
Hold compressions.

275
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,178
What happened?

276
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,347
We lost him.

277
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,727
Time of death: 11:32.

278
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,895
Damn.

279
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:30,162
Want me to tell his sister?

280
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:33,178
No, I will.

281
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:43,844
<i>Mis piernas!</i>

282
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,301
<i>ÿTe duele?</i>

283
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:46,726
<i>ÿDónde?
Mis piernas!</i>

284
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:47,650
What's going on?

285
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:50,679
Hard as a rock.

286
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,467
Compartment syndrome.

287
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:53,930
She must have injured her leg

288
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:55,519
when she was unconscious
in the plane.

289
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:56,427
I don't feel a pulse.

290
00:11:56,452 --> 00:11:57,364
Get me a Stryker needle.

291
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,463
Let's evaluate the pressure.

292
00:11:58,488 --> 00:11:59,592
No, no, no, we are past that.

293
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:01,231
She needs all four compartments
released right now,

294
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:02,450
or she's gonna lose this leg.

295
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:04,441
Call the OR and tell 'em
we're on our way up now.

296
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,143
Fentanyl?

297
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:08,340
100 mics.
We need repeat labs stat.

298
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:09,965
CBC, lytes, and a CPK.

299
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,909
ORs are busy,
at least a two-hour wait.

300
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,098
That's too long.

301
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:16,882
We're gonna do
the fasciotomies here.

302
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:19,716
Draw up to syringes of ketamine,
70 milligrams apiece,

303
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:20,974
and get me 2 of Versed.

304
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,899
Whoa, wait.
You're not gonna intubate her?

305
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:24,123
Not necessary.

306
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:25,422
We can do this
with deep sedation.

307
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:26,981
The ketamine
won't give you much time.

308
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,359
Well, then I will be fast.

309
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,830
<i>Mi hermano Miguel.</i>

310
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,278
Give her the Versed,
follow it up with the ketamine.

311
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:38,802
On it.

312
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,809
BP's 120 over 82.

313
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,100
Heart rate's 110.

314
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,701
Sat's at 99%.

315
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:48,169
Okay.

316
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:49,350
Here we go.

317
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:55,823
Okay.

318
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,467
I'm going for
the posterior compartment now.

319
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,873
Keep her still.

320
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,397
I'm telling you
we should be in the OR.

321
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:09,463
Just suction her out.

322
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,235
April, 70 more of ketamine,

323
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,026
and then come down here
and help hold the leg.

324
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:14,884
Got it.

325
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:17,661
Second dose is...

326
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,246
in.

327
00:13:23,294 --> 00:13:24,789
Okay.

328
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:31,700
Almost...

329
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:34,911
Okay.

330
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,263
Okay.

331
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:38,351
Muscle looks viable,
bleeds well.

332
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:39,990
That should do it.

333
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:42,296
Wrap her up.
Send her up to the ICU.

334
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,681
Got it.

335
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:46,472
Let me know when she's alert.

336
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:48,439
I need to talk to her.

337
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:50,057
Her brother just died.

338
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:58,249
You listen to me.

339
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,142
When we are under
the gun like that,

340
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,368
it doesn't help to keep
questioning my decisions.

341
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:04,266
You follow my lead.

342
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:12,184
Guy's father writes a big check

343
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,164
and he acts like
he owns the joint.

344
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:16,780
How about you cut him
some slack today?

345
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,505
Look, my mother died too.

346
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,424
She's not getting commemorated
with a new hospital ward, okay?

347
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,693
I thought you said
you grew up in Chicago.

348
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:28,051
Southside.
Canaryville.

349
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,376
Ah.

350
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,967
And you mean to tell me
that you don't know

351
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,656
what happened
to Connor's mother?

352
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:33,947
Nope.

353
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:38,083
Well, it was 20 years ago.

354
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:40,546
You were just a kid.

355
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:44,573
Connor's mom threw herself
off the roof of their home.

356
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:46,965
Three stories.

357
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,567
Connor was just ten.

358
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:53,826
Are you serious?

359
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,035
Mm-hmm.

360
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,145
It was all over the news
back in the day.

361
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:03,298
And with the reception
tonight...

362
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:06,072
lot of stuff that he probably

363
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:08,230
doesn't want to
have to think about.

364
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:16,976
I got Parker's
test results back.

365
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,133
And?

366
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,658
You need to take a look.

367
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:20,955
Here.

368
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:24,584
CT negative.
We need to order...

369
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:25,497
An MRI, I know.

370
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,387
I already did it.

371
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:29,862
It shows excessive
demyelination.

372
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,322
Explains the clumsiness,
degeneration of motor skills...

373
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:34,523
And the seizure.

374
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,182
I don't want to jump
to conclusions,

375
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:37,026
but I'm pretty sure he has...

376
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,160
Krabbe Disease.

377
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,296
Yeah.

378
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,907
He's eight,
so it's late-onset.

379
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:43,365
Gives him five to seven years

380
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,856
before he becomes
confined to a bed

381
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:46,702
and completely vegetative.

382
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:48,904
Poor kid.

383
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,074
What do you want to do?

384
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,603
Well, I've got
to go talk to the par...

385
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:56,532
Dr. Manning?

386
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:58,693
You okay?

387
00:15:58,718 --> 00:16:00,200
No.

388
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,486
I think my water just broke.

389
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:06,465
Oh, my God.
It did.

390
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,186
I guess this is happening today.

391
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:09,811
Uh, can we get
a wheelchair over here?

392
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:10,974
Look, I'm sorry, Sarah,

393
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,294
but you have to go
tell the parents.

394
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:13,295
What? Me?
No. I can't...

395
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,185
You have to.

396
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,210
I don't have the experience.

397
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,234
Go get Dr. Charles.

398
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:17,291
He will help you.

399
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:19,144
I have to go have this baby now.

400
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:20,200
Thank you.

401
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:24,669
Okay.

402
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:36,211
Breathe out.
Exhale.

403
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,442
Shh.

404
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:38,500
That's it.

405
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,204
One more time.

406
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:46,030
How much longer do
we have to do this?

407
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:47,722
- Ten more laps.
- Ugh.

408
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:50,214
Make sure everything gets
aligned correctly down there.

409
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,839
You know,
I am seriously regretting

410
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:53,263
making you my birthing coach.

411
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:54,074
Good.

412
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,866
That means I'm doing my job.

413
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,257
Oh, hey, handsome!

414
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,933
Get yourself over here.

415
00:16:58,958 --> 00:16:59,991
- Sorry.
- Hi.

416
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:02,043
I had to bribe Fromson
to cover my shift.

417
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:03,522
What do you need me to do?

418
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:06,062
Okay, I need you
to walk with her for now

419
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,419
and be her rock.

420
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,744
And I will be back
as soon as I can.

421
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:10,902
Wait, you're leaving?

422
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,403
Got to find somebody
to cover my desk.

423
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:13,182
Yup.

424
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:14,673
We could be here
for the next 30 hours.

425
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,334
- 30 hours?
- No.

426
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,793
Not if you listen
to your birthing coach.

427
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:28,571
I'm not sure how fast
a rock is supposed to walk.

428
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:31,497
You're doing just fine.

429
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,086
Thank you for being here.

430
00:17:41,545 --> 00:17:42,818
Natalie?

431
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,777
It's finally happening!

432
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:49,076
Ah!

433
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,611
Hi, Helen.

434
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,757
Hi, honey.

435
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:52,948
And you are?

436
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:53,973
Oh, this is Dr. Halstead.

437
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:54,925
Will.

438
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,157
I work with Natalie.

439
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:58,316
And this is Helen,
my mother-in-law.

440
00:17:58,318 --> 00:18:00,351
Congratulations.

441
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:01,819
I've got this now.

442
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:02,954
Sure.

443
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,155
Yeah.

444
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,003
Hello.

445
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:13,629
Sorry I'm late.

446
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:15,990
Thanks for coming, Sharon.

447
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:19,920
A meeting without
a single doctor present?

448
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:23,379
My guess is this isn't
about a medical issue.

449
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:25,237
Peter?

450
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:28,897
Sharon, I know
you're not gonna like this...

451
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:31,590
Neither do we...
But we need to discuss

452
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:33,879
our stowaway patient.

453
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,901
Dr. Charles?

454
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:41,980
Dr. Manning said
you could help me.

455
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:43,471
What's up?

456
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:48,409
I have a patient,
an eight-year-old boy,

457
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,186
Parker Kindler, and...

458
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,632
uh...

459
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,233
You know what,
let me back up for a second.

460
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:57,430
Dr. Manning and I
were treating Parker,

461
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:59,621
and then she went
into labor, and...

462
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:00,662
Natalie's in labor?

463
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:01,410
Mm-hmm.

464
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:02,434
How's she doing?

465
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:03,513
Fine, I suppose.

466
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:04,869
Her water broke right
in front of me,

467
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,311
but that's not what
I came to talk to you about.

468
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,333
Okay.

469
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,747
Dr. Manning and I
just diagnosed Parker

470
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:16,706
with a terminal genetic
condition called Krabbe Disease,

471
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:20,900
and now she's in labor,
and I have to tell the parents

472
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:23,911
that their eight-year-old child
is going to die,

473
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:26,553
and that the same thing might
happen to their three-year-old.

474
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:29,179
So I guess I was just
wondering...

475
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:31,204
how do...
How do I do that?

476
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,139
Have a seat.

477
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:35,797
Yeah.

478
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:44,102
In my experience,
it's best to be direct

479
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:45,927
and get straight to the point.

480
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,069
When people get
bad news like this,

481
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:50,561
they tend to get overwhelmed.

482
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:53,293
They might ask you
to clarify things

483
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,333
or repeat them.

484
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:56,534
You know...

485
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:58,295
They might seem like
they have a million questions.

486
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,687
They might want to be left alone

487
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:04,551
to begin to process the grief.

488
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:06,020
The most important thing

489
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:08,120
is that they need to know
that somebody's there

490
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,945
who understands
what they're going through.

491
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,492
You know...

492
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:15,953
So really it's your compassion
that they need to feel.

493
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:17,283
Compassion.

494
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:18,295
Yeah.

495
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,521
And after you tell
the parents...

496
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:25,681
they might want you there
when they tell the child.

497
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:26,705
They might not.

498
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,762
That's up to them.

499
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:31,521
Wait.
Tell the child?

500
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,004
Oh, yeah.

501
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:36,272
The child actually
needs to know.

502
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:39,554
Okay.

503
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,642
Look, Sarah,
it's the hardest thing

504
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,201
that you'll have to do
as a doctor, right?

505
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:46,849
And it doesn't get any easier.

506
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:49,287
At least, it hasn't for me.

507
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:53,449
But we are the ones

508
00:20:53,474 --> 00:20:56,308
who have been chosen to do this,

509
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,601
and I think that there's
a certain nobility in that.

510
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,882
Okay?

511
00:21:04,907 --> 00:21:05,972
Good.

512
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:16,168
You want me to come along?

513
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,592
That would be great.

514
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:19,551
Thank you.

515
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:21,209
Given his current symptoms,

516
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:24,201
Parker has anywhere
from five to seven years

517
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:26,930
before the progressively
degenerative nature

518
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:29,589
of the disease
confines him to a bed

519
00:21:29,614 --> 00:21:33,007
and eventually leaves him
in a vegetative state.

520
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:36,933
I mean, there must
be some kind of treatment.

521
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,708
At the moment, no.

522
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,449
You mean there's no cure?

523
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:48,324
There's nothing we can do?

524
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,338
Um...

525
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,150
that is correct.

526
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:56,577
Krabbe is an extremely
rare disease.

527
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:58,335
We can treat his symptoms,

528
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,368
but eventually Parker will need

529
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:02,417
to be ventilated
to continue living.

530
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:13,121
There is something else.

531
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:16,168
Since the disease is hereditary,

532
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:19,527
we need to determine
if Seth carries it as well.

533
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:21,115
Do you know if he's been tested?

534
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,573
Seth?

535
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:24,525
I don't remember.

536
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,150
That's okay.

537
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:27,603
I can find out.

538
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:29,495
Do I have permission
to check his natal records?

539
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,857
Of course.

540
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:34,515
What happens
if Seth tests positive?

541
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,820
Since he has not yet
presented symptoms,

542
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:47,519
the hope is we can treat him
with stem cells

543
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:50,811
and stop him from
developing the disease.

544
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:52,646
The hope?

545
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,490
Why don't we check
the records first

546
00:22:55,515 --> 00:22:57,775
and... and go from there?

547
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:09,794
Again, I'm so sorry.

548
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,264
Excuse me.

549
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:43,333
Okay.

550
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:23,303
Oz, turn the room over.

551
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,946
Whoa.
What happened to my patient?

552
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:27,538
The Air Ambulance medics came
to take Ms. Gonzalez away.

553
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,554
What?

554
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:29,949
They just left.

555
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:39,817
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

556
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:41,106
What are you doing
with my patient?

557
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:42,552
All right, Doc, please,
it's best you stay out of this.

558
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:43,581
No, no, no.
She is under my care.

559
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:45,521
- She... Maria!
- Dr. Rhodes,<i> por favor!</i>

560
00:24:45,546 --> 00:24:46,846
- Are okay?
- Let's keep him back.

561
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,296
You get off of me.

562
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,454
I'm sorry, but she's
being repatriated home.

563
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,616
No, she is barely stable.

564
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:52,640
She can't go anywhere.

565
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:53,965
She's stable enough to travel.

566
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,657
She's gonna be accompanied
by a doctor and a nurse.

567
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:56,834
No, no, no.
I can't allow this.

568
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:57,933
Doctor, I'm sorry.

569
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,291
This is not up to you.

570
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:22,496
Mrs. Goodwin?

571
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,381
Yeah.

572
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:25,506
You backed me up
with Homeland Security.

573
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:26,423
Yes, I did.

574
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:29,416
Then why did you let
them deport Maria Gonzalez?

575
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:32,631
Not here, Dr. Rhodes.

576
00:25:34,295 --> 00:25:36,185
Give us the room.

577
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:39,924
Hmm?

578
00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:42,271
Homeland Security
did not deport your patient.

579
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:43,328
No, no, no.
I was outside.

580
00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:44,333
I saw them.

581
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:47,067
It's the hospital
that's repatriating her.

582
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:48,672
The hospital?

583
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,922
Why... we're doing this why?

584
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:53,854
Because Maria Gonzalez
is undocumented

585
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:55,749
and without medical insurance.

586
00:25:55,774 --> 00:25:57,140
We're legally bound
to treat her.

587
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,230
Which we have done.

588
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:00,131
She is still
in critical condition.

589
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:03,023
We contract with a private
ambulance service.

590
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:06,083
They provide medical personnel
for the patient.

591
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:07,326
That's how you justify it, then?

592
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:10,121
Look, I wish I could wave
a magic wand and fix it,

593
00:26:10,146 --> 00:26:11,145
but I can't.

594
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,426
Maria came her for refuge.

595
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:17,081
Her brother risked everything
so that he could help her,

596
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:19,466
and he sacrificed his life.

597
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:20,596
For what?

598
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,663
For nothing.

599
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,958
Dr. Rhodes.

600
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:31,190
Damn.

601
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:35,762
There was meconium
in your water,

602
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:38,598
so we'll want to watch for fetal
aspiration during delivery.

603
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,164
Okay.

604
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:41,655
Oof.

605
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,282
Your dilation is 4 centimeters.

606
00:26:43,307 --> 00:26:45,836
So... looks like
you're on your way.

607
00:26:46,911 --> 00:26:49,263
Dr. Halstead,
you can come in now.

608
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,453
How you doing?

609
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:56,912
I'm okay.
Mm.

610
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:59,137
All right,
I got Betty to cover the desk.

611
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:00,697
I'm here for the duration.

612
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:02,174
What do you need?

613
00:27:02,198 --> 00:27:04,346
- I'm really thirsty.
- Okay.

614
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:06,201
- I'll get you some ice chips.
- Oh, thank you.

615
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:07,548
All right, thank you.

616
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:10,083
Let me fluff
that pillow for you.

617
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:14,003
There you go.

618
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:15,989
Okay.

619
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:24,521
Will?

620
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:25,578
Yeah.

621
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,576
Natalie's husband,

622
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:32,082
my son, Jeff...

623
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:35,283
died seven months ago.

624
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:38,119
Yeah, I'm very sorry
for your loss.

625
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:40,846
Only seven months.

626
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,261
What are you doing?

627
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:46,886
I'm...

628
00:27:46,911 --> 00:27:49,111
just trying to help.

629
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,679
Natalie and I are friends.

630
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:51,937
Friends?

631
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:52,934
And colleagues.

632
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,425
And that's it?

633
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,950
Of course.

634
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,892
I care about her.

635
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:02,060
Natalie's having a baby.

636
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:03,818
She's a widow.

637
00:28:03,843 --> 00:28:05,830
She's vulnerable.

638
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:15,653
Can you just give that to her?

639
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,575
Tell her I'll be back later.

640
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:24,909
What do we got?

641
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:26,867
17-year-old involved
in a drive-by.

642
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:28,828
Triple zero.
Three entry wounds in the chest.

643
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:30,483
Multiple exit wounds.
He's shredded.

644
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,841
Intubated.
16-gauge IV in the right AC.

645
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:33,858
Downtime 12 minutes.

646
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:35,450
Get on his chest.
Open the crash cart.

647
00:28:35,475 --> 00:28:37,241
Milligram of EPI.
Rapid transfusion line.

648
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:38,680
Yes, doctor.

649
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:54,304
That's asystole.

650
00:28:58,196 --> 00:28:59,261
Come on.

651
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:02,786
Come on!

652
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:05,753
Come on.

653
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:09,725
Come on!

654
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,386
Dr. Choi?

655
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:15,161
He's gone.

656
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,278
All right. Let's call it.

657
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,467
18:06.

658
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:44,230
Those are my sutures.

659
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:45,793
He was here this morning.

660
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,952
I know him.

661
00:29:47,977 --> 00:29:49,478
Cedric.

662
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:53,066
He fell off his bike.

663
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:04,791
Parker, honey,
you've been asking

664
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:07,672
why Seth had to get a test.

665
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:10,325
And why your dad and I

666
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,930
have seemed so sad...

667
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:14,692
Is something the matter?

668
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:17,841
Yes.

669
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:21,800
There is, and we need
to tell you about it.

670
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:23,563
Okay.

671
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,548
We asked
Dr. Charles to help us

672
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:29,285
in case we can't
explain it very well.

673
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,277
'Cause he's a doctor.

674
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:33,014
Right.

675
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:38,609
It turns out, honey, that...

676
00:30:41,684 --> 00:30:42,816
You're sick.

677
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,849
You mean this?

678
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:47,441
No.

679
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:50,134
Something more.

680
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,946
You mean,
like when I get a cold?

681
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,686
No.

682
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:01,550
Please.

683
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:05,930
Parker...

684
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:09,700
you are sick in a different way.

685
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:12,900
So should we check
to see if I have a temperature?

686
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:14,696
Mm, we don't have to.

687
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:16,221
You don't.

688
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:18,907
Does that mean
I'm getting better?

689
00:31:18,932 --> 00:31:21,766
No, buddy, it doesn't.
I'm sorry.

690
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:25,395
Unfortunately,
you have an illness

691
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,721
that we don't have
a cure for yet.

692
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:30,113
Is this like when Finn got sick?

693
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:34,567
Finn was my dog.

694
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,870
Oh, you had a dog?

695
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,860
Uh-huh.

696
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:39,952
He died.

697
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:43,689
Am I gonna die too?

698
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:46,729
Yeah.

699
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:48,172
You are.

700
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,298
But not for a long time.

701
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:52,971
A year?

702
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,453
Oh, longer than that.

703
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:57,979
More like five years.

704
00:31:58,004 --> 00:31:59,370
That's a long time.

705
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:00,364
Yeah.

706
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:02,156
Will I get to eat ice cream?

707
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:04,047
I'm guessing...

708
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:06,819
the answer might be yes.

709
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:14,915
Push! Push, push!

710
00:32:19,575 --> 00:32:20,771
Where's Will?

711
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:22,028
I don't know.

712
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:24,193
Don't worry.
Maggie and I are here with you.

713
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,988
Your BP is rising.

714
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:29,827
It's still okay, right?

715
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:31,010
The baby's not descending.

716
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:32,630
I'm worried that
he's occiput posterior

717
00:32:32,655 --> 00:32:33,754
and stuck in the birth canal.

718
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:34,737
What does that mean?

719
00:32:34,762 --> 00:32:36,735
- The baby is sunny-side up.
- Breathe.

720
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,093
We need to consider
a C-section.

721
00:32:38,118 --> 00:32:39,178
A C-section?

722
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:41,167
Is it that serious?
Is the baby in danger?

723
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,242
Ma'am, I'm sorry,

724
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:43,929
but I think it would be better
if you waited outside.

725
00:32:43,954 --> 00:32:45,164
No, I'm not leaving.

726
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,221
Helen, it's okay.

727
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:48,646
I'm fine.
I promise.

728
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:49,758
Ma'am.

729
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:52,142
- Okay, if you're sure.
- Yes.

730
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:53,371
- I got this, Helen.
- Ma'am?

731
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:54,788
I'll be right outside.

732
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:00,658
I don't want a C-section.

733
00:33:00,683 --> 00:33:01,668
I don't blame you.

734
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:02,867
I think you're being
overly cautious.

735
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:04,215
That 'cause you're
treating another doctor?

736
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,884
I treat all my
patients the same.

737
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:06,971
We're not there yet.

738
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,233
Are you questioning my judgment?

739
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:09,077
I'm her midwife,

740
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:11,546
and I don't think cutting
into her is a good idea yet.

741
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:14,391
Are you going to listen
to her or your obstetrician?

742
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:18,713
Nat, I can turn the baby.

743
00:33:20,477 --> 00:33:21,777
Natalie?

744
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:23,408
Nat?

745
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:25,973
Let her try.

746
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:32,699
Breathe, breathe!

747
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:39,921
Give me ultrasound.

748
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:49,742
Heart rate's decelerating.

749
00:33:50,132 --> 00:33:52,051
Baby's still OP.

750
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:53,075
We should operate.

751
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:54,720
Not yet.

752
00:33:54,745 --> 00:33:56,111
One more time.
Okay, Nat?

753
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,160
Breathe.

754
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:03,445
Breathe.
Breathe!

755
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:05,890
Try it now.

756
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:07,246
I think we have it.

757
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:11,013
Yes!

758
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:12,783
Okay, he's in position.

759
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:14,907
Okay?
Okay.

760
00:34:14,932 --> 00:34:16,845
Okay.

761
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,304
Give me a push.
Now!

762
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:25,917
That's it.
That's it.

763
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:28,342
Push!

764
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,723
The baby's crowning.
The baby's crowning.

765
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:32,181
We're almost there.

766
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:33,312
Okay.

767
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:34,569
I'm so tired.

768
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:36,227
Listen to me, okay?

769
00:34:36,252 --> 00:34:38,199
You can do this.

770
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:40,388
Okay?
Okay?

771
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:41,412
Wait a second.

772
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:42,208
Again.

773
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:45,238
Three, two, one...

774
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,262
push!

775
00:34:47,498 --> 00:34:49,316
That's it!

776
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:50,473
That's it!

777
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:51,920
That's it.
That's it!

778
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,443
Okay, that's it.
Here he is.

779
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,182
We've got a tight nuchal cord.

780
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:58,528
What's happening?

781
00:34:58,553 --> 00:35:00,544
Baby's not breathing.

782
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:01,899
Clip.
Clip.

783
00:35:01,924 --> 00:35:03,829
What's happening!

784
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:06,144
Okay, Nat.
Cut.

785
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:07,626
Tell me what's happening!

786
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:09,868
Here you go.

787
00:35:09,893 --> 00:35:11,792
Someone tell
me what's happening!

788
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:14,038
Meconium in the airway.

789
00:35:14,063 --> 00:35:15,328
Suctioning now.

790
00:35:18,238 --> 00:35:19,707
I need you to be strong.

791
00:35:19,732 --> 00:35:21,049
They're working on the baby.

792
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:22,674
Be strong.

793
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:36,579
Here.
Suction.

794
00:35:38,894 --> 00:35:40,259
Keep it going.

795
00:35:48,912 --> 00:35:52,480
Oh, thank God!

796
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:07,708
Hi, hi!

797
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,061
Here's your son.

798
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,947
Hi!

799
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,672
Hi.

800
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,458
Hi.

801
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,646
Oh, yes.

802
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:32,729
Hi.

803
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:55,721
And you put this lace
over this loop.

804
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:58,860
Tie them together.

805
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:00,921
And...

806
00:37:00,946 --> 00:37:02,700
cut!

807
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:05,511
Hey, I have good news.

808
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:07,536
Seth tested negative
for Krabbe Disease.

809
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:08,674
He doesn't have it.

810
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:09,932
Oh, my God.

811
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:12,221
We're making a movie.

812
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:14,847
Instructional videos
for his brother.

813
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:16,805
Things that I learned
when I was little.

814
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:18,574
In case I get too sick
to teach him.

815
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:21,008
That's really nice.

816
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,242
Okay.
I got something to do...

817
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:25,890
- Uh-huh.
- But I'll be right back.

818
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:33,732
I know all too well
how difficult it is

819
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:36,925
for the loved ones
of those who suffer

820
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:39,675
from mental illness.

821
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:44,246
22 years ago,
my wife, Elizabeth,

822
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:47,071
lost her battle
with depression...

823
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:48,763
and killed herself,

824
00:37:48,806 --> 00:37:50,772
scarring not only me,

825
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:53,616
but our two children.

826
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,810
Sadly, this kind of tragedy
is not unique to our family,

827
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:03,123
and therefore, I can
only hope that my donation

828
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,722
helps to ease the suffering,

829
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:09,838
the feeling of hopelessness,

830
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:14,673
that we and too many others
have experienced.

831
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:19,205
Thank you.

832
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,225
So, in memory of my late wife,

833
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,853
I have given $1 million
to help build

834
00:38:30,047 --> 00:38:33,013
the Elizabeth Rhodes
Psychiatric Ward.

835
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:37,818
Thank you.

836
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:41,896
Thank you.

837
00:38:44,247 --> 00:38:45,814
Thank you you all very much.

838
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,405
Thank you.

839
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:55,585
He looks just like his father.

840
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:58,712
Yeah.

841
00:38:58,818 --> 00:39:01,331
He really does.

842
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:07,616
I'm gonna name him Owen.

843
00:39:09,317 --> 00:39:11,583
It's Irish for "little fighter."

844
00:39:12,803 --> 00:39:15,436
Given how he came
into the world.

845
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:19,441
Owen.

846
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:21,797
I like it.

847
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,890
Owen.

848
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:44,671
It was a beautiful speech, Dad.

849
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:47,837
Why, thank you.

850
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:54,425
I had this patient today.

851
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,217
She came in with her brother,

852
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:58,140
and he died.

853
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,991
He sacrificed his life for her.

854
00:40:05,658 --> 00:40:08,256
I never should have left Claire.

855
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:11,575
No.

856
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,589
You shouldn't have.

857
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,713
Hurt her deeply.

858
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:20,432
You know, I never told her
about the night that Mom died,

859
00:40:20,457 --> 00:40:23,600
what really happened.

860
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:30,654
Your mother was disturbed.

861
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,678
She had a mental illness.

862
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:34,503
You and I both know

863
00:40:34,528 --> 00:40:38,086
that that's not the reason
she killed herself.

864
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:44,012
Let me get this for you.

865
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:49,087
Hey, Dad.

866
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:54,110
I am really glad that I'm back.

867
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:41,014
All: To Owen!
