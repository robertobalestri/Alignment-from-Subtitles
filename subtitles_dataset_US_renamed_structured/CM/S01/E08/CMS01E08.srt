1
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:08,451
This is the main entrance,
though it's not really private.

2
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,065
- So this is where he's...
- You can take a look.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,682
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

4
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:12,759
Is that really you?

5
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:14,655
Aww.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,011
And look at you,

7
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:17,436
like you were never
even pregnant.

8
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,889
How are your boobs feeling?

9
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:20,796
Besieged.

10
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,520
- That'll happen.
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:25,079
Cover this side.

12
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:27,941
What's with all the suits?

13
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:29,565
Some mucky-muck
flying into town

14
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,133
for heart surgery.

15
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:33,708
This is what they call
an advance team.

16
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,226
And here I thought
you were rolling out

17
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,299
the red carpet for me.

18
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:37,220
Sorry.

19
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,987
But I'm glad to see you.

20
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,939
I'm surprised you didn't ask
for a couple more weeks.

21
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:42,963
Well, it's been a month.

22
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:43,951
I was just joking.

23
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,548
You mean you don't think
I'm a bad mom?

24
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,265
Juvie.
Respiratory distress.

25
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,186
All right.

26
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:49,477
Welcome back,
Dr. Manning.

27
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:50,400
Thank you.

28
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,362
Trauma 2.

29
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:52,753
- I'll get your stuff.
- Thanks.

30
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:54,144
All tenens to the ED.

31
00:00:54,169 --> 00:00:55,768
13-year-old female,
Michelle.

32
00:00:55,793 --> 00:00:57,393
Worsened on the ride.
This is her father.

33
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,585
Michelle, I'm Dr. Manning.
I'm gonna take care of you.

34
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,372
- When did this start?
- 20 minutes ago.

35
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:02,714
- Is she asthmatic?
- No.

36
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:03,891
Bee sting?
Something she ate?

37
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,030
Definitely not
something she ate.

38
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:05,879
How can you be sure?

39
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:07,110
Because she never eats anything

40
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:08,401
I don't prepare for her.

41
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:10,153
All right, we're gonna
move her on my count.

42
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:11,447
One, two, three.

43
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,332
Call respiratory
for a vent, stat,

44
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:16,533
and get a crash cart in here.

45
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:18,458
- Yes, Dr. Manning.
- She's in bronchospasm.

46
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:19,654
Breathe, breathe.

47
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,489
Draw up .3 milligrams of EPI,
1/1000, and give it IM.

48
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:23,869
- Got it.
- I'm not sure that's safe.

49
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:25,442
- She's on other medications.
- What medications?

50
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,483
Metoprolol, and Tegretol
for her seizures,

51
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:29,098
- Methadone for her pain...
- Methadone?

52
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,463
She has Mitochondrial Disease.

53
00:01:30,488 --> 00:01:31,846
It affects her body's ability
to produce...

54
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:33,380
- I'm familiar with Mito.
- Stats are dropping.

55
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:35,104
All right, we can't wait
for respiratory.

56
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,332
We need to intubate.

57
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,094
Get me 20 of Etomidate,
80 of Sux.

58
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,265
She's spasmed down.
Where are the drugs?

59
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,057
I lost the IV.
I'm trying again on this side.

60
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:44,669
We don't have time.
We need to crich her.

61
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:47,643
Get me a 10cc syringe
and a 16-gauge needle, now.

62
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:49,783
- What is happening?
- Sir, I need you to step out.

63
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:50,740
Don't tell me what to do.

64
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:52,464
My daughter is dying
and you're letting her.

65
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:53,622
- Now!
- Sir, step back.

66
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:54,902
No, look...
It's all right, kiddo.

67
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:56,407
- Needle, now.
- Here, doctor.

68
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:58,132
Go ahead and hang another liter.

69
00:01:58,157 --> 00:01:59,399
Stand by.

70
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:02,724
I'm okay.

71
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,181
I'm okay!

72
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,984
Hold off.

73
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,554
I'm okay.

74
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:13,303
Sats are improving.

75
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:15,028
- Let's get a face mask on her.
- Yes, doctor.

76
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,753
Oh, thank God
you pulled out of it.

77
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,511
Sorry I scared you, Dad.

78
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:19,535
Are you okay?

79
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,499
Am I okay?

80
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:22,951
Listen to you.

81
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,435
Oh, you silly girl.

82
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:28,337
Deep breaths, deep breaths.

83
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,829
I've never seen someone
improve like that so quick.

84
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:31,853
You?

85
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:33,875
No.

86
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,090
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

87
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,413
You had a G-tube implanted?

88
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:45,837
Helps with her nutrition.

89
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,806
She's not the greatest eater.

90
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:50,008
We IV her supplements
and vitamins.

91
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,343
My smoothie.

92
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,310
And the, uh...

93
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:53,611
Central line catheter?

94
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:55,146
It's for all her meds.

95
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:57,115
Mm.

96
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,565
She's good to go.

97
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,352
You are a very brave girl.

98
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:02,087
Got that from her mother.

99
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:03,680
My wife died four years ago.

100
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:04,756
Breast cancer.

101
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,358
I'm sorry.

102
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,892
Not long after that's
when kiddo here

103
00:03:07,894 --> 00:03:09,394
started getting sick.

104
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:11,173
Migraines, fatigue, IBS.

105
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:12,253
For a while, I figured

106
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:13,652
it was just part
of the mourning process,

107
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,744
but it kept happening.

108
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,005
I got that.

109
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,785
I took her to...
I don't know how many doctors,

110
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,410
but nobody knew what was wrong,

111
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,704
so I went online

112
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:24,328
and found out about Mito.

113
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:25,752
You went online for that?

114
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:27,277
For the first time,

115
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:29,741
what Michelle was going through
finally made sense.

116
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,499
Good news, we know what it is.

117
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:33,191
Bad news, there's no cure.

118
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:34,784
So we manage.

119
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:35,950
Okay.

120
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:38,111
Well, I'd like to do
a full workup

121
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,172
before discharging her.

122
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:41,252
See if we can find
what caused those spasms.

123
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:42,343
Could take a couple of hours.

124
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:43,516
You guys okay with that?

125
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,507
Do what you do.

126
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:45,924
We're old pros.

127
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,708
Never leave home unprepared,

128
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:50,353
just in case
we end up in the hospital.

129
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,115
This way.

130
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:59,358
Well, it looks like
royalty's arrived.

131
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:01,951
You're referring to him...

132
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,493
or him?

133
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:06,072
Princes come and go,

134
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:08,227
but there's only one
King Downey.

135
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:09,611
Ah, yes, Your Highness.

136
00:04:09,636 --> 00:04:10,802
Welcome.

137
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:12,623
Guy's a surgical rock star.

138
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:14,525
This prince flies halfway
around the world

139
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,111
to have him replace his valve.

140
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,194
This is the place we want to be.

141
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:18,251
Come on, your room's ready.

142
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:21,006
Downey, number one
with a bullet.

143
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:22,964
Although, I suppose
if that were true,

144
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:25,238
you'd be yanking it out of him,
wouldn't you?

145
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:26,932
Doctor Rhodes,

146
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:28,517
they're ready for you in OR 2.

147
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:29,877
Thank you, Maggie.

148
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:33,730
This woman stabbed her husband
in the right flank

149
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:35,121
with a pair of scissors.

150
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:37,192
Sounds like they could use
a marriage counselor.

151
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:44,963
Mr. Mason,

152
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:46,721
I'm Dr. Halstead.

153
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,348
So, tell me,
when did this pain start?

154
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:55,082
Who let this man
in the hospital?

155
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:57,870
Who let this man
become a doctor?

156
00:04:58,026 --> 00:04:59,211
Whoa, gentlemen.

157
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:03,771
I take it you two kids
know each other?

158
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:04,961
I had the pleasure

159
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:06,898
of serving time on a carrier
with this man,

160
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,600
Chief Petty Officer Mason.

161
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,541
Choi.

162
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,045
Great to see you, Chief.

163
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,836
What are you doing in Chicago?

164
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:15,380
I retired two years ago,
and, uh...

165
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:17,890
Let's catch up after we let
the doc here do his thing.

166
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:18,734
Nothing doing.

167
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,343
You come to Chicago Med,
you get me.

168
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:21,967
Chart, please.

169
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:23,743
You're in good hands.

170
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:25,819
Honor to meet you.

171
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:30,177
So...

172
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:31,378
what brings you in here?

173
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,013
I feel like
I swallowed a fishhook.

174
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,373
Well, let's take a look.

175
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:41,988
There you are.

176
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,890
- Heard you were back.
- Hey.

177
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:44,991
Hey.

178
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,102
How's Owen?

179
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,248
He liking that mobile thing
I hung up?

180
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:50,434
Mesmerized.
He can't stop staring at it.

181
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,660
Success.

182
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,284
Wasn't the same without you.

183
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,675
I'm glad to be back.

184
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,132
I just hope my son forgives me.

185
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,034
Of course he will.

186
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,595
Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

187
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm not that absent.

188
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:03,553
Oh, no, I didn't...

189
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:04,877
I didn't mean any...

190
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:06,254
I'm sorry;
I'm exhausted.

191
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,515
I... it's just...
It's our first day apart.

192
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,074
Absolutely.
First day.

193
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,076
What's all this?

194
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,266
My 13-year-old's
medical history.

195
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:19,332
Dad keeps a copy of everything
in the car just in case.

196
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:20,840
This is all for a 13-year-old?

197
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:22,569
Girl presents with bronchospasm.

198
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,026
I get this close
to criching her.

199
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,895
The moment her father
leaves her side...

200
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:27,430
She catches her breath.

201
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:28,631
Like magic.

202
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,153
The kid's
a budding Harry Potter.

203
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:31,745
She has mitochondrial disease.

204
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,802
Mito?

205
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:34,570
We really are
talking fiction here.

206
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:36,326
You don't think it exists?

207
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:39,175
Always felt like
a wastebasket diagnosis to me.

208
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,161
Doctor can't figure out
what's really going wrong,

209
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:42,439
says it's Mito, calls it a day.

210
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:42,965
Hmm.

211
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,087
What did the muscle biopsy say?

212
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:45,410
That I don't know,

213
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:47,471
because I haven't found it yet.

214
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,127
Want a second set of eyes?

215
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:51,265
Yes, thank you.

216
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,589
You're welcome.

217
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:02,291
- Okay, here you go.
- Okay. Yeah.

218
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:03,663
Yeah.

219
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,521
See you.
Okay, bye.

220
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:12,256
Oh, my God.
You guys are so cute.

221
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:13,447
We're just friends.

222
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:14,415
Uh-huh.

223
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,319
Another dating app?

224
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:19,913
Why? You go to any bar,
and there's a line

225
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:21,338
around the block
to buy you a drink.

226
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:23,630
Oh, well, at least
these guys know how to type,

227
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:24,931
for the most part.

228
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,089
Look at this one.

229
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:29,062
Profile name,
"Windy City Winner."

230
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:29,769
Nope.

231
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:33,655
Another idiot without a shirt.

232
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:35,784
Oh.

233
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,141
That's...

234
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:41,057
Joey.

235
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,151
"Cold Tech, Warm Heart."

236
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,842
It says his favorite thing is

237
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:46,867
watching the Chicago skyline
at night

238
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:48,492
from Promontory Point.

239
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:50,769
Please, he hardly ever
leaves his computer.

240
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,405
Hate to drag you two ladies
away from electronic romance...

241
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,729
Oh, my gosh!

242
00:07:56,754 --> 00:07:58,362
But Treatment Five awaits.

243
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,197
Have fun.

244
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,020
Okay.

245
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:11,131
I need everything
to stop spinning.

246
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,268
Okay.
You brought her in?

247
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:13,292
Sloane's my girl.

248
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,522
Ride or die since junior high,

249
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:15,491
and we're college roommates.

250
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:17,225
She appears inebriated.

251
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:19,240
I only had two glasses of wine.

252
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,449
She told me
she was staying in to study

253
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,108
for her environmental studie.

254
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,369
Bacteria.

255
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:25,501
Yes, look... going over things
from her field trips.

256
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:27,326
I'm so sorry, Ames.

257
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:29,880
- Don't deserve you.
- It's okay, Sloaney.

258
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:31,105
Her knee appears swollen.

259
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,394
Well, she did fall
in the shower this morning.

260
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,202
Well, often, in college,

261
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:36,803
people find out
their actual limits,

262
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:38,085
and she exceeded hers.

263
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,443
You got wasted like this a lot?

264
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:42,045
No, not me.
Never once.

265
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:44,777
Maybe once.

266
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:47,437
All right, let's draw some labs,
start an IV,

267
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,722
get her on a liter
of normal saline,

268
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,050
see if we can't sober her up.

269
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:51,534
Yep.

270
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,322
99.3.

271
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:57,082
A little hot, that's all.

272
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:58,247
That's it?

273
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,585
That, my friend, is it.

274
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:01,784
You don't want to
run a CAT scan or something?

275
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:02,852
CAT scan?

276
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,574
It's pretty standard, isn't it?

277
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,889
Not with what I'm seeing,

278
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:07,914
unless there's something
you haven't told me.

279
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,699
When I go to the bathroom,

280
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:13,308
there's blood in my stool.

281
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:18,410
Blood.

282
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:19,746
Bright red?
Dark?

283
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,300
Dark.

284
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:23,549
How long has that been going on?

285
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:24,985
About three months.

286
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,081
And you're just
seeing a doctor now?

287
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,859
Can you roll over on your side?

288
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:36,998
You know what's coming.

289
00:09:38,981 --> 00:09:41,314
But it'll just be
for a few seconds.

290
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,997
We call this the Chicago Med
handshake.

291
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:53,353
Okay, done.

292
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:57,203
Chief,

293
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:59,139
we are gonna do
that CAT scan after all.

294
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,571
Not a scratch on the liver,
but a hole in the diaphragm.

295
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,162
She got him good.

296
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,351
Uh, Doctor Downey.

297
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:19,710
- Good morning.
- What's he doing here?

298
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:21,745
The patient, Marty.

299
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:29,987
Hmm.

300
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:31,831
Do you know this patient?

301
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,874
No.

302
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:39,998
Ah.

303
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:41,623
Are there any concerns,
Dr. Downey?

304
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:42,490
No.

305
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,712
And we are... done.

306
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:55,923
What did he want?

307
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,848
I have no idea.

308
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:07,122
Excuse me.

309
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:09,314
Excuse me.

310
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:10,771
Sorry.

311
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,923
It's a fricking
Rose Bowl parade in here.

312
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:15,998
Well, the prince
has a lot of well-wishers.

313
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:18,796
Is he gifting David
a polo pony this time?

314
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:20,607
I thought I saw
a saddle back there.

315
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:22,699
Do I sense a tinge of jealousy,

316
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:23,691
or are you just upset

317
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,659
because I let him use
your parking spot?

318
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:26,894
Look, Hawaiian shirts aside,

319
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,801
I think David is a lovely man.

320
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:31,794
It's, frankly, our priorities
that I tend to question.

321
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:33,878
Look at this ED, Daniel.

322
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:36,363
You don't get this without that.

323
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:40,011
Downey helps make Chicago Med
a destination hospital.

324
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,186
Yeah, like Disneyland.

325
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:45,339
Right?

326
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,513
Hi, Michelle.

327
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:50,637
How are you feeling?

328
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:52,896
- Well...
- Not great, to be honest.

329
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,221
I'm wondering if we should
adjust her IV fluids?

330
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:57,079
Okay.
Well, we'll look into that.

331
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:59,705
This is Dr. Halstead;
I've asked him to join us.

332
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,063
Thank you,
by the way, for keeping

333
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,155
such a detailed account
of Michelle's history.

334
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,314
Yeah, well, sometimes
it feels like a full-time job.

335
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:07,839
I bet.

336
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:09,497
Well, we were looking over
her records

337
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:12,556
and didn't come across
any results for a muscle biopsy.

338
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,463
Do you know if one
was ever performed?

339
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:15,945
No, we haven't done a biopsy.

340
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,303
Uh-huh.

341
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:18,924
I highly recommend one.

342
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:22,200
It's really the only way
to confirm a diagnosis of Mito.

343
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,459
Well, no,
the doctor was concerned

344
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,654
how Michelle would react
to the anesthesia.

345
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,042
What's he talking about, Daddy?

346
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:29,786
Nothing, kiddo.

347
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,720
You know, she should rest.

348
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:34,707
I'll be right outside.

349
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:36,488
Can we chat outside?

350
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:43,968
What are you doing?

351
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:46,193
- Just trying to confirm...
- Michelle has Mito.

352
00:12:46,218 --> 00:12:48,351
If I wanted her retested,
I'd ask.

353
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,621
I came here because she was
having trouble breathing

354
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,989
and this was
the closest hospital.

355
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:53,647
I didn't come here
to debate her diagnosis.

356
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,848
We're just trying to find a way

357
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,435
to help your daughter start
feeling better.

358
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,423
No, Dr. Halstead thinks
he knows better than her father.

359
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:01,507
- I was not questioning...
- Oh, the hell you weren't.

360
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,075
Daddy?

361
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,682
My stomach...

362
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,946
Michelle?

363
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:08,046
Are you okay?

364
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:09,770
- Pulse is strong.
- Pupils are equal.

365
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:10,581
IV?

366
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,292
- It's good.
- April, ammonia ampule.

367
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,862
- Got it.
- Anything you need?

368
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:14,886
Thanks, we got it.

369
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:16,697
We need to take a look
at that hand.

370
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:18,274
Do something.

371
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,274
Dr. Halstead.

372
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,849
Thank you.

373
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:25,240
Michelle?

374
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:27,637
Okay, Michelle?

375
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:29,121
It's okay, kiddo.

376
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,218
It's okay.

377
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,442
I'm here.
Daddy's right here.

378
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,030
Daddy!

379
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,400
Yeah.

380
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:35,925
You still want to
convince yourselves

381
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,073
there's nothing wrong with her?

382
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:45,438
I'm guessing,
by your expression,

383
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:46,943
it doesn't look good.

384
00:13:47,962 --> 00:13:49,729
It doesn't.

385
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,413
You have a large mass

386
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:53,271
partially obstructing
your right colon,

387
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:56,281
which explains the symptoms
you've been experiencing.

388
00:13:56,364 --> 00:13:59,031
I can't be sure, but...

389
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:00,535
in all likelihood, I...

390
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,513
Colon cancer, right?

391
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,388
My doctor at the VA,

392
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,094
she thought this might
be what it was.

393
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,517
Wait, you have a doctor
at the VA

394
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,364
who knew your symptoms
and hasn't had you scanned yet?

395
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:12,220
Dr. Glass, but it...
It wasn't her fault, okay?

396
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:13,841
She's been beating the drum
for me.

397
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,164
It's that VA.

398
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,823
They got their own special pace.

399
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:20,381
Slow.

400
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,738
Hey,

401
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:24,030
you think I'll make it
another week?

402
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,191
What happens in a week?

403
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:28,649
Reunion.

404
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:31,259
You know, all the chiefs
from the Vinson

405
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,684
who were deployed to Haiti,

406
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,736
helping out after the quake.

407
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:37,562
I remember.

408
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:40,121
You'll be at that reunion,
Chief.

409
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:51,564
How's that feel?
Is that okay, Michelle?

410
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,890
How's your stomach feeling now?

411
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,124
A little better.

412
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:57,827
It never feels great, though.

413
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:00,563
That's why I'm so lucky
to have my dad.

414
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:02,231
He's always there
to take care of me.

415
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:04,523
Now, where else
would I be, kiddo?

416
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:13,680
Hey.

417
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,839
How's that, uh...

418
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,056
young lady doing?

419
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,515
I wish there was
a simple answer to that.

420
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,284
How about the un-simple one?

421
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:27,302
So something's clearly
wrong with her,

422
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,326
but Mito?

423
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,360
I'm not buying it.

424
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,496
Could it just be
all the medication?

425
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:32,930
The girl's a walking pharmacy.

426
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,198
Who knows how she's reacting
to all those drugs?

427
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:37,345
Ideally, I'd wean Michelle
off everything

428
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,503
and establish a new baseline.

429
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,904
You think the dad
would go for that?

430
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,013
Not a chance.

431
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,713
The guy is dead set it's Mito.

432
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:46,287
I... I got a weird feeling
here, doc.

433
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,602
It... it's like...

434
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:50,040
they've built their lives
around this disease.

435
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:51,711
Huh.

436
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:53,947
I don't know, Will.

437
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:57,165
It feels like something
worth investigating to me.

438
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,990
Yeah, I think it'd be great

439
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,105
if you went and talked to them.

440
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,064
What, I walk in there?
A shrink?

441
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,855
No, it'd change
the whole dynamic.

442
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,267
You'd never get a clean read.

443
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:06,985
I need to watch them

444
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,473
without them knowing
I'm watching them.

445
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:15,807
Dr. Rhodes, your presence
has been requested

446
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:17,265
on the fifth floor.

447
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,531
Dr. Downey wants
to speak with you.

448
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:24,369
Yeah, yeah, I'll come up.

449
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:26,306
He'll be right up.

450
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:29,332
Well, let me know what he wants.

451
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:31,216
Yeah.

452
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,168
Hey...

453
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,860
How's our patient in five?

454
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,996
Still sleeping it off.

455
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,232
Um... about that profile?

456
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:42,548
I'm wondering if it's something

457
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:45,048
Joey just had up
and forgot to take down.

458
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:46,639
Does it say the last time
he was on?

459
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:48,436
Mm...

460
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:52,765
He was last active...

461
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,956
today.

462
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:55,448
- Today?
- Mm-hmm.

463
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,727
Excuse me.

464
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:58,618
I had a question
I wanted to ask you.

465
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,453
What's it like being a doctor?

466
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,995
Oh, not a doctor.
Fourth-year med student.

467
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,319
Oh, I'm premed.

468
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:05,225
Does the work load
ever calm down?

469
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:06,760
No, just gets worse.

470
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:09,728
Miles, my boyfriend,
is about ready to dump my ass.

471
00:17:09,754 --> 00:17:13,579
Last night, he begs me
to go see some band at Metro,

472
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:17,551
Well, in my experience,
med school and guys don't mix.

473
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:19,497
Most of them
are liars and cheats anyway.

474
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:21,088
You say, "Let's take it slow,"

475
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,182
and for them, that means
a license to sleep around.

476
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,026
Seizure in Five!

477
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,152
Get one milligram of Ativan,
and grab the attending.

478
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:36,111
Thank you.
I've got her airway.

479
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:38,402
Oh, my God.

480
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,551
Have you ever seen her
have a seizure before?

481
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,276
No.

482
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,477
Where's that Ativan?

483
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:51,662
How often does she
drink like this?

484
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,020
Is it possible she's detoxing?

485
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,488
No way Sloane's a closet alkie.

486
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,410
We don't keep secrets
from each other.

487
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:57,825
All of this
from one night of drinking

488
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,783
doesn't make sense.

489
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,786
Dr. Rhodes.

490
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:15,175
Nice work down there.

491
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,191
Thank you.

492
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:20,259
So my angels tell me

493
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,725
you spent time in Riyadh?

494
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,084
Your angels are correct.

495
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:28,054
I was there last year
helping injured oil workers.

496
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:29,455
How's your Arabic?

497
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:32,091
Sounds good to me.

498
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:34,093
Come on, I want you
to meet somebody.

499
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:44,046
So here it is.

500
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,072
Hyponatremia?

501
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:47,740
Yeah, her sodium levels
are pretty low.

502
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:49,542
119.

503
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,090
Her...

504
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:57,650
Glucose is 74,
so she's not diabetic.

505
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:59,011
Her blood alcohol is negative.

506
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:00,035
- What caused her...
- Hey.

507
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:01,403
Her seizure?

508
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:02,737
Is everything okay?

509
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,272
You know, with us?

510
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:09,551
You on that app too?

511
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:11,153
What?
No.

512
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:12,421
What are you doing on it?

513
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:13,455
I mean...

514
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:14,857
you said you like
to take it slow

515
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,225
and get to know a person.

516
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:17,459
Yeah, get to know one person,

517
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:19,895
not get to know me
while you date half of Chicago.

518
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,063
No, I'm not dating half of...

519
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:23,187
And the Chicago skyline?

520
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,017
When's the last time
you were even outside at night?

521
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:33,052
There'll be a pulmonary
thromboendarterectomy,

522
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:35,043
full bypass, hemodilution.

523
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:36,478
Now, I like it
because it gives us

524
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:39,581
a clear field, so we can
completely remove the blockage.

525
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,783
Would you like me
to translate this into Arabic?

526
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:44,114
Why would you need to do that?

527
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:45,988
I see that I don't.

528
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,934
So surgery's set for 3:00.

529
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,613
Make yourself comfortable
while my team preps.

530
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:54,772
Stop worrying.

531
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:58,033
You're making me nervous.

532
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:01,203
You certainly don't want that
while I'm operating.

533
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,638
We'll see you in a bit.

534
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:09,781
I'm not a CT surgeon,

535
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,672
but bypass
for pulmonary thrombus

536
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:13,541
isn't common, is it?

537
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:15,643
Who wants common?
I know my patient doesn't.

538
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:16,711
You okay with common?

539
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:18,713
Dr. Downey, what exactly
am I doing here?

540
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,681
You're helping me
prep for surgery.

541
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:24,752
I guess so.

542
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:26,687
Did he eat?

543
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,723
Oh, okay, good.
Good.

544
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:30,691
And you're sure
you have enough milk?

545
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,405
Okay, because you know,
I'm really close;

546
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,148
I could always come...

547
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:36,306
Okay.

548
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:38,509
All right, well,
call me if you need anything.

549
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:39,734
You know, I'm, um...

550
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:41,804
just ten minutes away.

551
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,150
I'll call you
in a little bit, okay?

552
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,808
Give Owen a kiss for me.

553
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,132
Okay, bye.

554
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:50,319
There's something
you need to see.

555
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,120
That feel okay?

556
00:20:57,145 --> 00:20:58,711
Do you need anything?

557
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,513
No, water's fine.

558
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:02,800
Notice how normal she is
with April,

559
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:04,925
and then... and then
her dad walks in.

560
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:07,728
Hey.
How you doing, kiddo?

561
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:09,581
Hanging in the

562
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:11,506
And her smile disappears.

563
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,198
Hey, Dad.

564
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,179
I can't hold that cup.

565
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:16,237
Can you bring it

566
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,738
Of course, sweetheart.

567
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,407
See, so before,
she's drinking on her own,

568
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:21,626
and now, all of a sudden,
she needs her dad's help.

569
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:25,214
It's like she's instantly
self-infantilizing.

570
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:26,905
Why would you do this?

571
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,996
Because I asked him to.

572
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,240
Without consulting me?

573
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,098
This is my patient.

574
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,037
You know, I ought to
haul your ass up

575
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:34,901
in front of the ethics
committee.

576
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,606
This is an absolute violation
of patient rights,

577
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:38,597
and you know that.

578
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:39,869
I do, Sharon,

579
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:41,093
but we could be
looking at a case

580
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:42,231
of medical child abuse here.

581
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:43,420
Child abuse?

582
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:45,060
Mr. Joffe is overbearing,

583
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:47,098
but he's clearly not intending
to hurt Michelle.

584
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:47,830
Of course not.

585
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:49,286
He's trying to save her,

586
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:51,612
but that's precisely why
we would refer to this

587
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:53,370
as a conversion disorder.

588
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,096
My gut is telling me

589
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:58,166
this entire relationship
is driven by her being sick

590
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,840
and him taking care of her.

591
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:01,365
Hold on.

592
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,873
Even if it's not Mito,

593
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:05,491
her symptoms could still
be explained by something else.

594
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:08,102
A Chiari malformation, maybe?

595
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,993
Before I call this guy
an abuser,

596
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,927
I want to
rule everything else out.

597
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:13,318
As soon as Michelle can stand,

598
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:15,319
he's gonna take her home,
and then we're out of options.

599
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:17,177
Okay.

600
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,019
You erase that footage
immediately.

601
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:22,687
Dr. Manning,
I understand how you feel,

602
00:22:22,712 --> 00:22:25,613
and I want you to run whatever
tests you deem necessary

603
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:27,666
to narrow your differential
diagnosis;

604
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:32,260
however, if there is even
a 1% chance of abuse

605
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,523
taking place,
we have an obligation here.

606
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:38,711
So what do you need
to make a clear call?

607
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:42,604
I need to talk with Michelle
without her father present.

608
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,176
All right.

609
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:47,814
This is how
we're gonna make that happen.

610
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:51,406
All right, Michelle.

611
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,920
Here's the MRI machine
we're gonna be using.

612
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:57,079
It's still warming up,
but we have Dr. Charles here

613
00:22:57,104 --> 00:22:58,687
to keep us company
until it's ready.

614
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,412
Are you okay with that?

615
00:23:00,437 --> 00:23:01,636
Hi, Michelle.

616
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:03,461
Hi.

617
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:05,519
What kind of doctor are you?

618
00:23:05,544 --> 00:23:08,412
I am the kind of doctor

619
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:11,271
whose job it is to make sure
you don't get nervous

620
00:23:11,296 --> 00:23:13,033
about getting in that machine.

621
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,612
I'm not scared.

622
00:23:14,637 --> 00:23:16,670
I'm used to this kind of stuff.

623
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,829
Me and my dad are in hospitals
all the time.

624
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:20,620
Hmm.

625
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:22,480
Well, we're hoping to
make it so that

626
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:24,505
you don't have to be
in them so much.

627
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,729
How does that sound?

628
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,014
Okay.

629
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,572
Good.

630
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:40,828
Six teaspoons
of gunpowder green tea.

631
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,386
Boiling water.

632
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:55,612
Gently.

633
00:23:55,614 --> 00:23:57,171
Arabic tea.

634
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:59,163
This helps you prep for surgery?

635
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:03,885
Swirl.

636
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,897
Pour.

637
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,964
Make sure the tea
stays in the pot.

638
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,673
Sugar.

639
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:24,029
Mint.

640
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,364
Stir.

641
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:32,158
Slowly.

642
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,448
Don't want to change
the viscosity.

643
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:38,206
Viscosity?

644
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:42,390
Wait; that's why
you use hemodilution

645
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:45,383
to allow bypass
without reperfusion injury?

646
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:48,366
Should be done.

647
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:52,742
Tea with mint.

648
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:55,338
That's Moroccan, not Saudi.

649
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:58,146
It's not for the prince.

650
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,376
Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

651
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:01,767
You can go.

652
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,258
That's it?

653
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,069
You did a nice job.

654
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:24,893
I remember Dad got tickets
to a play that day, "Wicked."

655
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:27,351
Oh, my daughter wanted me
to take her to that.

656
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:28,409
Was it good?

657
00:25:28,434 --> 00:25:30,528
I don't know;
I never saw it.

658
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:34,054
I went into my dad's room
to see if he was ready,

659
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,240
but he was looking
at pictures of my mom

660
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:38,523
and being sad, so...

661
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:41,516
I went back to my room.

662
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,007
Then what happened?

663
00:25:49,271 --> 00:25:50,971
I have got to confess,

664
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:53,291
I am so jealous of those socks.

665
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:56,417
Those hedgehogs are fantastic.

666
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:59,226
Okay, so you went back
to your room,

667
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:01,085
and...

668
00:26:02,408 --> 00:26:04,975
Oh, I just waited

669
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,833
for a long time,

670
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,392
and then my stomach
started to hurt,

671
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:10,891
and I got dizzy,

672
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,302
and I yelled out for my dad,

673
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:13,684
and then...

674
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:15,704
And he came?

675
00:26:15,729 --> 00:26:17,696
Yeah, he came.

676
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:21,256
He picked me up
and took me to the hospital.

677
00:26:21,323 --> 00:26:25,091
Since then,
it's been like this a lot.

678
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:26,745
And how's your dad been doing?

679
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,542
Does, uh...
Does he still get sad?

680
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:31,434
Not so much.

681
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:35,433
I guess I keep him pretty busy.

682
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:38,802
Makes sense.

683
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:39,943
So.

684
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:42,035
We, uh... we good?

685
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,486
We should be all set.

686
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:45,419
Thank you, Mr. Joffe.

687
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:49,476
Now, if you can sign
just three more forms,

688
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,479
I promise you'll be done.

689
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,314
Dr. Manning's
been down in radiology

690
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:56,203
with my daughter
for over an hour.

691
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:57,895
Would you like me to page her?

692
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,152
No.

693
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:00,543
I'll just go down there.

694
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:02,182
Oh, I'm sorry,
you can't be in the room

695
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:03,773
while your daughter's
having an MRI.

696
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:04,964
Yeah, that's what she said,

697
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:06,995
but I'm not waiting around
anymore.

698
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,220
Mr. Joffe?

699
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:09,677
I'm Dr. Charles.

700
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:11,202
Could I talk to you
for a second?

701
00:27:11,227 --> 00:27:12,313
Yeah, why?

702
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:13,920
Well, it's about your daughter.

703
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:15,839
There's a consultation room
right over here

704
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:16,783
if you have a couple minutes.

705
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:17,678
No, you know what?

706
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:18,836
If you have something to say,

707
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:20,354
can you just say it?

708
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:22,597
There is a strong possibility

709
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:24,701
that your daughter's
medical issues

710
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,668
have a psychological
component to them.

711
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:29,018
What the hell
are you talking about?

712
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:30,697
It's very important
that you understand that

713
00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:32,622
I wouldn't be telling you this
unless I perceived

714
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:35,088
significant risk
to both you and your daughter,

715
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,225
but I want you
to consider the possibility

716
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,530
that when your wife died,

717
00:27:38,554 --> 00:27:40,195
your daughter
might have misunderstood

718
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,727
your attempts to protect her
from your grief.

719
00:27:42,752 --> 00:27:45,519
- Her isolation...
- Wait, what?

720
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:47,701
So I've been making her sick?

721
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:49,159
That's what you're
accusing me of?

722
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:50,694
It's much more complicated
than that.

723
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,602
No, but it's my fault.
I'm to blame.

724
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:53,939
That's actually
not what I'm saying.

725
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:54,963
If you'd hear me out...

726
00:27:54,988 --> 00:27:56,220
I cannot believe you people.

727
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:58,087
I am not going to stand here
and listen to this.

728
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:00,893
I'm going to get my daughter
and get here out of here.

729
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:07,591
Michelle!

730
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:09,888
Excuse me,
my daughter's having an MRI.

731
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:12,395
- Where is that?
- Right over there, sir.

732
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:13,941
Where's my daughter?

733
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:15,588
She's still in the MRI machine.

734
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:17,313
Well, turn it off.
I'm taking her home now.

735
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:18,869
I'm sorry, sir,
but we can't do that.

736
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:20,814
No, please...
Mr. Joffe!

737
00:28:20,954 --> 00:28:22,387
- Please, Mr. Joffe.
- Open this door.

738
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:24,045
- Please, Mr. Joffe.
- Open this door!

739
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,469
Mr. Joffe?
Madeline Gastern.

740
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:27,995
We are from the Department
of Child and Family Services.

741
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,820
What the hell is going on here?

742
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,478
A charge of medical child abuse

743
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:33,192
has been brought against you
by this hospital.

744
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:34,350
Child abuse?

745
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,142
That is a legal term only,
Mr. Joffe...

746
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,290
Michelle will be taken
into custody by the state

747
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:39,793
while the charge
is investigated.

748
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,184
What are you talking about?

749
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:43,342
I'm sorry;
I know this must be confusing,

750
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,897
but we need to sit down
with you and explain

751
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:47,381
why this has happened.

752
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:50,903
You.
You set this up, didn't you?

753
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:52,348
- No...
- Shame on you.

754
00:28:52,373 --> 00:28:53,803
- Mr. Joffe...
- You...

755
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:56,344
Stay away from me.

756
00:28:56,855 --> 00:28:58,233
Let me tell you something.

757
00:28:58,258 --> 00:29:00,592
You people have
picked the wrong battle.

758
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,411
Dr. Ethan Choi
from Chicago Med.

759
00:29:12,413 --> 00:29:13,798
I've left a few messages
for Dr. Glass.

760
00:29:13,823 --> 00:29:15,356
We have a patient of hers here
who needs...

761
00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:17,026
Please don't put me
on hold again.

762
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:18,917
I'm aware of that, but...

763
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:21,887
Unbelievable.

764
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:23,655
Maggie, I'm taking an hour
of personal time.

765
00:29:23,657 --> 00:29:25,357
I wouldn't do it
if it wasn't important.

766
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:26,881
Why are you still here?

767
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:30,195
Hey, heard one of your
old shipmates was here.

768
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:31,330
- How's he doing?
- Not good.

769
00:29:31,332 --> 00:29:32,898
I'm headed to the VA
to crack some heads.

770
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,533
You want me to come with?
Power in numbers?

771
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:36,358
I'll be okay.
Thanks.

772
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:44,276
You look a little lost.

773
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:46,545
I'm not sure what's going on
with my patient.

774
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:49,281
Her labs are inconsistent
with how she presents.

775
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:51,632
Whenever I get confused,
I always go back

776
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:52,818
to the history and the physical.

777
00:29:52,843 --> 00:29:54,676
It's the best place
to find answers.

778
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:01,493
I need to know everything
you ate and drank last night.

779
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:02,706
I already told you.

780
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:04,159
Two glasses of white wine.

781
00:30:04,184 --> 00:30:05,365
That's it.

782
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:07,834
And a ton of water
'cause I didn't want a hangover.

783
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:08,621
What's a "ton"?

784
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:11,580
Like, six or seven
of those bottled waters.

785
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:13,684
I would have had more
if it wasn't so expensive.

786
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:15,949
Expensive?
You said you were at home.

787
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,187
- I was.
- What is this?

788
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,141
"Metro"?
Were you there last night?

789
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:23,907
No.

790
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:26,165
You went to Metro?

791
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,009
Oh, my God.

792
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,034
You were there with Miles,
weren't you?

793
00:30:29,297 --> 00:30:31,262
Did you hook up with him?

794
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:35,187
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.

795
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:36,678
I'm so stupid.

796
00:30:37,974 --> 00:30:38,939
Amy...

797
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:40,197
You're a liar

798
00:30:40,222 --> 00:30:41,955
and a bitch.

799
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,257
Amy...

800
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:45,815
I hope you get an STD
and it kills you.

801
00:30:58,228 --> 00:31:00,364
Let's get a urine tox.

802
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:02,522
If she took ecstasy,
that would explain her thirst.

803
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:03,668
Right.

804
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:05,226
By the way...

805
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:06,584
wow.

806
00:31:18,953 --> 00:31:21,254
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

807
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,412
I'm looking for Dr. Vicky Glass.

808
00:31:24,698 --> 00:31:26,097
Over there.

809
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,628
Dr. Glass?
Yes.

810
00:31:31,653 --> 00:31:33,419
Lieutenant Commander Choi,
Naval Reserve.

811
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:34,888
I'm a resident at Chicago Med.

812
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:37,113
Chief Mason came into our ED
complaining of stomach pains.

813
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:38,762
We did a CT and found this.

814
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,007
This cancer could kill him,

815
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,337
something that
could have been prevented

816
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:42,728
if you'd run a scan
three months ago

817
00:31:42,753 --> 00:31:43,855
when he first told you
about his symptoms.

818
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,820
Well, I couldn't get him in
for the scan.

819
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:47,010
Believe me, I wanted to.

820
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:49,081
I did everything I could
to make it happen,

821
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:51,506
but as you can see,
there's a huge backlog here...

822
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:53,265
And you're underfunded
and understaffed.

823
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,595
I don't care.
These guys deserve better.

824
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,787
You can't get a scan approved;
go through back channels.

825
00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:57,944
Oh, you mean screw protocol?

826
00:31:57,969 --> 00:31:59,068
Yes, screw protocol.

827
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:00,660
Hey, that's an idea.

828
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,777
After all, the VA pays
for ER care

829
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:04,787
if a patient can't get
to a VA hospital.

830
00:32:04,812 --> 00:32:06,905
Well, I could just tell him
what to say to get a CAT scan

831
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,529
and send him to you.

832
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:12,036
That what you mean?

833
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:15,091
- Yeah.
- Good.

834
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:16,523
We done chatting here?

835
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:18,812
'Cause I've got to get Mason in
to see a surgeon.

836
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:21,331
It might be too late.

837
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:30,440
I just got the results.

838
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:32,970
Wanted to bring them
as soon as I got them.

839
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,881
You didn't have to do that.

840
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:37,985
Wow.

841
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,453
Her UTox is negative.
No drugs.

842
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,728
I am out of ideas.

843
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:46,470
I need to talk to an attending.

844
00:32:46,495 --> 00:32:48,190
I'm taking down
my online profile.

845
00:32:48,697 --> 00:32:49,696
Whatever.

846
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:51,321
Don't do it on my account.
Go have fun.

847
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,512
"Fun"?

848
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,737
I... I've been on one awful date.

849
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:55,961
She asked me to go on a hike,

850
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:58,253
and I got bit by a spider.

851
00:33:00,404 --> 00:33:01,937
It still hasn't healed.

852
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,544
Did you hear me?

853
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:09,706
Do you care?

854
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:11,260
Environmental studies,

855
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:15,054
dehydrated, the puffy knee...

856
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:17,114
We have one more test to run.

857
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:21,195
What happened?

858
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,785
Massive lower GI bleed.
We're taking him to surgery now.

859
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,910
Ethan, he could lose his colon.
Maybe worse.

860
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:28,202
I promised he'd make
a Naval reunion next week.

861
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:29,840
I'll do my best.

862
00:33:29,865 --> 00:33:31,456
Hang in there, Chief.

863
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:39,401
Michelle's MRI?

864
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:41,760
No sign
of a Chiari malformation.

865
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:44,713
Just add it to the long list
of things I got wrong today.

866
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:45,902
Come on, Nat.

867
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:48,482
Look, I know something
had to be done.

868
00:33:48,507 --> 00:33:50,531
I just think
we had other options.

869
00:33:50,556 --> 00:33:51,304
Like what?

870
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,814
Like not breaking up a family.

871
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,019
I know how I'd feel

872
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:55,643
if someone tried to take Owen
away from me.

873
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:57,251
Look, this was the only way.

874
00:33:57,277 --> 00:33:59,144
Remove the parent
and monitor the kid.

875
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:00,208
See what's really going on.

876
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:02,030
What about the trauma
of separation?

877
00:34:02,055 --> 00:34:03,354
I mean, the guy loses his wife,

878
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:05,391
and now he's gonna
lose his daughter too?

879
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:08,238
It is traumatic,

880
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:09,521
but not fatal.

881
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:10,545
We don't step in,

882
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,127
Michelle could end up
in the morgue

883
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,718
from medication alone.

884
00:34:15,174 --> 00:34:17,526
This hospital kidnapped
my daughter,

885
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:18,650
and I want her back.

886
00:34:18,675 --> 00:34:20,374
- Mr. Joffe, you can't...
- And those two.

887
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,811
They're part of it.

888
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,440
No, I don't care.

889
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:30,793
I want my daughter,

890
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,091
and I want her now.

891
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:33,616
We'll talk
to the administrators.

892
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:34,691
See what's what.

893
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:36,262
I'm Chief of Patient Services.

894
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:37,307
Can I help you?

895
00:34:37,332 --> 00:34:39,498
This man has a complaint
about his daughter.

896
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:41,689
I brought my daughter here
for treatment,

897
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,308
and they have kidnapped her.

898
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,317
- Can I speak to you, please?
- Yeah.

899
00:34:58,014 --> 00:34:59,513
Mr. Joffe,

900
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:02,105
please, we're just trying
to help Michelle.

901
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,669
She's my daughter.

902
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:07,329
My daughter.

903
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:09,354
You cannot just take her away.

904
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:13,131
Well?

905
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:14,689
Mr. Joffe,

906
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:18,248
DCFS has jurisdiction over this.

907
00:35:18,273 --> 00:35:20,380
There's nothing, at this time,

908
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:23,039
you can do here
about your daughter.

909
00:35:23,064 --> 00:35:25,204
Are you serious?

910
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:29,350
My advice:
find yourself a lawyer.

911
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,584
How are you feeling?

912
00:35:57,609 --> 00:36:00,510
I guess all right,
for a terrible friend.

913
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:03,169
We finally found out
what's wrong with you.

914
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,503
You have Lyme disease.

915
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:05,527
Seriously?

916
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:07,018
Lyme disease?

917
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:09,847
Yeah, it's probably
from a tick bite

918
00:36:09,872 --> 00:36:11,346
on one of your field trips.

919
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,474
It explains your knee
and the rest of your symptoms.

920
00:36:13,498 --> 00:36:14,962
So what happens now?

921
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:17,418
I'm putting you
on an antibiotic course,

922
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,066
and hopefully we got it
early enough

923
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:21,187
to avoid any long-term
consequences.

924
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:25,242
I hooked up with
my best friend's boyfriend.

925
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,198
There are gonna be some
long-term consequences.

926
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:41,651
Hello, hello.

927
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:43,142
Hey, what did Downey want?

928
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,134
Wish I knew.

929
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,458
Uh, he told me all about
his medical plan for the prince.

930
00:36:47,483 --> 00:36:48,154
Yeah.

931
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:50,813
But then all he had me do
was make tea.

932
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:52,368
Moroccan mint tea.

933
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:54,787
Is he crazy?

934
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,340
- Yeah.
- Like, Mozart-crazy.

935
00:36:58,365 --> 00:37:01,333
Guess I have to learn
how to make Moroccan tea.

936
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:10,899
Chief Mason...

937
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:12,757
he pulled through.

938
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:14,481
He's stable.

939
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:18,343
Thank you.

940
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:22,651
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

941
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:28,549
It's crazy.

942
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,529
A Saudi prince comes here

943
00:37:30,554 --> 00:37:32,735
and gets the best
heart surgeon we have,

944
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,875
and a vet can't even
get a CT scan.

945
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:40,926
We didn't make the world, right?

946
00:37:58,803 --> 00:38:02,302
I've spent all afternoon
justifying what we did.

947
00:38:05,055 --> 00:38:07,189
I wish I felt better about it.

948
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:12,261
Me too.

949
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,966
Mr. Joffe?

950
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:30,761
The medical profession
isn't crazy about

951
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:34,255
doctors walking around
apologizing for things,

952
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,879
um...

953
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:37,637
but I'm very sorry.

954
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:44,253
What if it was me?

955
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:48,577
Look,
Mr. Joffe, we...

956
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:52,660
We all send out messages
that we're unaware of,

957
00:38:53,421 --> 00:38:56,040
and not just you in this case.

958
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:57,471
Your daughter too.
I mean...

959
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:58,436
I just...

960
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,010
I don't understand how.

961
00:39:01,035 --> 00:39:02,668
Look.

962
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:06,962
It is a very painful,

963
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:10,574
complicated idea to confront,

964
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,998
but if you are even
beginning to consider

965
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:15,843
that you might have had
a part in this,

966
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:17,289
conscious or not,

967
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:20,616
that is a huge,
very positive step.

968
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:22,519
I was trying to be
a good father.

969
00:39:22,544 --> 00:39:24,065
And you are.

970
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,777
Nobody wants to cut you
out of this process.

971
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:30,976
And when the time is right,
you'll be allowed to visit.

972
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:34,681
Will you trust me on that?

973
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,872
Okay.

974
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:43,626
It's okay.

975
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:48,050
I appreciate that, sir.

976
00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:08,244
Dr. Glass.

977
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:10,088
Didn't know you were Navy.

978
00:40:10,113 --> 00:40:11,937
Please. Vicki.

979
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:13,995
Ethan.

980
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,701
Nice of the chiefs to allow
a couple Os in here.

981
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:18,702
Mason looks happy.

982
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:23,755
Thanks for taking
such good care of him.

983
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,146
You too.

984
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:26,637
Very resourceful.

985
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:29,191
I have no idea
what you're referring to.

986
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:35,308
Care for a drink?

987
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,866
Love one.

988
