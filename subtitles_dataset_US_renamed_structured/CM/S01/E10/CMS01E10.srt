1
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,509
- Uh...
- Ha.

2
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,679
- That wasn't the warm reception
I was expecting.

3
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,081
- Sorry. Just thinking
about the day ahead.

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,750
- Speaking of...

5
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:20,285
dinner before the recruiting
event tonight?

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,720
- Oh, yeah.

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,391
of the next generation
of Navy sailors.

8
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,492
- [laughs]

9
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,627
Don't sound so excited.

10
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,529
- Wish I could stay,
but duty calls.

11
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,199
- Hey, you okay?

12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,402
You were tossing and turning
like crazy last night.

13
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:39,671
- Yeah, all good,
and yes to dinner.

14
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,348
- You're not hearing me,
Dr. Halstead.

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,816
With the hospital
being sued--

16
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:55,054
- I'm under a microscope.
I get it.

17
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,422
Doesn't make it fair.

18
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:58,223
- You ignored
your patient's wishes

19
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,559
and put the hospital
in jeopardy.

20
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,294
It's absolutely fair,

21
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,296
and now you have to deal
with the consequences.

22
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:08,133
You're in for interrogatories,
depositions, mediation,

23
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,235
and then possibly
a civil trial,

24
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,771
and that doesn't even include
what you may have to

25
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,541
go through with
the state medical board.

26
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,142
- Yeah. Okay.

27
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,677
- Every move you make
will be scrutinized

28
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,080
by Jennifer Baker's
attorneys.

29
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,348
Stick to the script.

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,751
Don't give them
any more ammo.

31
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,287
Until the lawsuit is settled,

32
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,689
you are the perfect doctor.

33
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,391
Are we clear?

34
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:39,364
Because your future
at this hospital...

35
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,500
depends on it.

36
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,147
- Five, six,
seven, eight...

37
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,116
Uh-uh, girlfriend.
Go to Treatment 4, please.

38
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,617
- You got it.
- Thank you.

39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,419
- Right this way.

40
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,889
- All right.

41
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,458
Reese, why so glum?

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,427
- Residency Match picks.
- Ah.

43
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,828
- They have to be in
by end of day

44
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,196
and I have no clue
what to do.

45
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,464
I'm literally choosing

46
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,166
where I'll spend
the next four years of my life.

47
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,768
- And probably the rest
of your life after that.

48
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,903
- Be nice.

49
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,839
[phone beeps]
Dr. Choi, incoming!

50
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,709
- Where are we going, Maggie?
- Trauma 2.

51
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,811
- Dad?
- Bret Cooper, 17-year-old male,

52
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,614
down on the ice after a hip
check--GCS 10, improved to a 12.

53
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,284
- I'm his father.
I was there.

54
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,819
He didn't get his bell rung.
He barely got hit.

55
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,387
- Bret, I'm Dr. Choi.
Can you hear me?

56
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,256
Can you breathe?
- Get me off of here!

57
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,691
- All right, let's transfer him.
Reese, on your count.

58
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:42,394
- Okay, nice and easy.
One, two, three.

59
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,229
- [groans]
Uhh!

60
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,498
and let's get him up
on the monitors.

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,400
- On it.
- Check his sat levels.

62
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,568
- [whimpering]

63
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,236
- Okay. Pupils equal
bilaterally and reactive.

64
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:54,439
- He stayed on his skates
the whole time.

65
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,542
- Bret, I need you to focus
on me--is there any pain?

66
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,444
- Ah--there!
Right where you're touching.

67
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,779
- Your show, Reese.

68
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,648
- He needs a CT head
and spine,

69
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,316
and I would get him
a chest X-ray.

70
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,218
- Come on, really?
- We got this.

71
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,353
- Oh, my God--is it a
concussion--What happened, Jack?

72
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,889
- He was battling for a puck
along the boards--it's nothing.

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,860
- Mr. and Mrs. Cooper, I'm
gonna need you to step outside.

74
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,962
- Bret had a bad concussion
last month.

75
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:19,898
- Honey, it's not a concussion.

76
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,733
Look, Doc,
he's got a scholarship

77
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,435
on the table
for Boston College, okay?

78
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,304
Another concussion,
they might rescind the offer.

79
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,306
- My eyes--everything's blurry!

80
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:28,774
- Bret, you have to stay still.

81
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,276
Please, Bret, you have to hold
still--hold still, buddy.

82
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,778
- Dad!
- Son, you okay?

83
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,581
- Dad!
Dad, I can't see!

84
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,382
- Stay still, Bret.
- I can't see!

85
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,285
- Stay still, Bret.
Stay still.

86
00:03:40,287 --> 00:04:05,611
- Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

87
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,579
The cat nap's over.
- Oh, yeah.

88
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,714
- They're on their way in.

89
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,750
- How long was I down?
- About 20 minutes.

90
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,986
- Oh, it felt like 20 seconds.

91
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:16,388
- You know you're only supposed
to work 12-hour shifts, right?

92
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,656
It's the law.
- I know.

93
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,925
But Dr. Downey
makes his own rules.

94
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,930
- All right--
- Half a minute more.

95
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,999
[whimpering]
Come on.

96
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,800
- Down.

97
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,471
Ticktock.

98
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,878
- Doc, hey.
How is he?

99
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,447
- What happened to his eyesight?
- His vision's fine.

100
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,783
It was a transient impairment,
probably caused by anxiety.

101
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,619
- What about his head?
Is it another concussion?

102
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,021
- Can't say for sure yet.

103
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,590
We're doing a CT of his head
and cervical spine

104
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,991
to make sure
there's no bleeding.

105
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,426
That might require
surgery.

106
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,727
- Surgery?
Oh, God.

107
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,396
- I'm not saying
he needs surgery.

108
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,930
We just need
to rule everything out.

109
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,801
Let's not get worked up
before the tests come back.

110
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,805
It's--it--it's...

111
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,875
it's like...
it's like I...

112
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:14,012
It's like I said before.
It--it l-looks worse than it is.

113
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:17,516
Look, Doc, I played 18 seasons.
I took a hit or two.

114
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,587
I sat out a shift,
got right back in.

115
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,989
- Trust me, I get it.

116
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,425
Listen, as soon
as we get the tests back,

117
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,827
we'll figure out our next step.

118
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,329
- Okay.

119
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,797
- Thanks.
- Sure.

120
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,864
Ma'am.

121
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,369
- It's gonna be fine.

122
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,940
- Whoa.

123
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,115
- Tired, Dr. Rhodes?
- No, I feel great.

124
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,517
- Sign for the lungs,
and let's move.

125
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,419
- All right.

126
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,422
How long was he waiting?
- Half a minute.

127
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,029
- Watch out, please.
- Yes. Spoke with Dr. Bucchheit

128
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,531
about Loratazone--
think it's gonna work out.

129
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,000
Hey, Greg,
let me call you back.

130
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,872
Dr. Halstead--Will.

131
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,142
- Zoe, how are you?
Your hair's different.

132
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,744
I like it.
- Yeah?

133
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,479
- Yeah. Thank you.

134
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,482
- Had a great time
the other night.

135
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,884
You've officially converted me
to a rye whiskey girl.

136
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,521
- It cleanses the soul,
or at least the memory.

137
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,822
- Things any better?

138
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,457
- Well, they
haven't gotten worse.

139
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,892
Guess that's something.

140
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,629
- Good.
Cup half full--my kind of guy.

141
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,399
- Round two soon?

142
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,902
- I'll call you
when my shift's over.

143
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,604
- Yeah.
Okay.

144
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,409
- Mr. Anderson,
I'm Dr. Halstead.

145
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,543
- Oh, please, call me Tim.

146
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,044
- You got it, Tim.

147
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,980
So you're a diabetic?

148
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:58,016
- Yeah, since after college.
Lucky bastard, I know.

149
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,051
- I see you're
on the blood-thinner Warfarin.

150
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,020
How's your INR?
- Don't know.

151
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,089
I haven't had it checked
in a few weeks.

152
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,625
- Mm-hmm.
Let's have a listen.

153
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,062
Uh-huh.

154
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,533
Yeah, you've also had
a mitral valve replaced.

155
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,934
I can hear the clicking.

156
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,869
- Yeah, two stent operations,
an atherectomy,

157
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,604
and a laser angioplasty.

158
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,073
- And somehow
still putting us all to shame.

159
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,778
- Well, look good,
feel good, Dr. Manning.

160
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,713
I was wondering
if I would see you.

161
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,783
- Dr. Halstead,
you mind if I sit in?

162
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,885
- You don't have to ask.

163
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,153
- So what's going on
today?

164
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,855
Last time you were in
for a foot infection.

165
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,056
Any reoccurrence?
- No,

166
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,558
just a little shortness
of breath.

167
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,092
I was cleaning out my attic,

168
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,961
started feeling
a little light-headed.

169
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,930
Nothing, really,
to worry about,

170
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,164
but, still,
better safe than sorry.

171
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,799
- Anything else?

172
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,568
- My left leg's
been aching a bit.

173
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,870
- Mr. Anderson
is in congestive heart failure.

174
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,839
- Oh?
- It's mild.

175
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,074
At least, that's what
my last doctor told me.

176
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,077
- But you could still stand
to lose some of that fluid.

177
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,147
All right, what we're gonna
do--chest X-ray, EKG, labs.

178
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,550
Have IR do an angiogram,
check the flow of the leg.

179
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,154
for the Bulls game.

180
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,824
- Don't worry, Tim, we'll
get you the wi-fi password.

181
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,759
You can watch the game
on your phone.

182
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,932
- Hey.
- [murmuring]

183
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,568
- A little overboard.
His leg wasn't cold.

184
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,070
A vascular ultrasound,
maybe,

185
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,172
but an angiogram's
a bit much to start.

186
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,040
- He's a decade-long
vasculopath.

187
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,242
His blood vessels are shot.

188
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,110
- He's not indicating.

189
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,813
I hardly think he needs another
uncomfortable procedure.

190
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,781
- There's no telling
what he needs.

191
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,017
Look, I am not
dismissing you, Nat,

192
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,919
but I did the intake.

193
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,021
It's my call.

you're on the transplant?

- Ex-vivo--have you
ever seen one?

00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,910
The lungs are
perfused out--

204

- Outside the body, yeah.
I know the procedure.

205
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:11,917
- Yeah, the patient was
an NYFD first responder on 9/11.

206
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,053
He developed pulmonary fibrosis
from debris exposure.

207
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,255
So no good deed, right?

- Lunch later?
- Page me.

211
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,000
- So then I just break up
the center

212
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,769
and carry the puck
into the zone myself?

213
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,871
- Exactly. You catch the D-man
in the neutral zone.

214
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,806
- And I'll be left
with a two-on-one.

- Hey,
put that away now.

217
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:43,615
- Good news.
CT head and spine were clear.

218
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,283
- No concussion?
- No concussion.

219
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,352
- So I'm out of here?

220
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,287
- And off to Chestnut Hill.
Go, Eagles.

- Sure.

222

00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,066
Nothing.
The kid's a rock.

Like father, like son.
Doc, thanks so much.

- You got it.

227
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,177
- Okay, so let's go tell
those bad-news scouts

228
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,312
that the nation's number-one
recruit is good to go.

229
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,182
- Dr. Choi, is it possible
you missed something?

230
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,883
Bret complains of headaches.
- Mom.

231
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,785
- He's had this one
for two weeks.

232
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,621
- Joan, enough!

233
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,959
Look, the scan
came back clean, honey.

234
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,197
Stop looking for something
that isn't there.

00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,999
- LP?

236
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,635
- Headaches could be
a symptom of meningitis.

237
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,837
An infection like that wouldn't
show up on the CT.

238
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,305
Could explain why a minor hit

239
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,207
caused such a big
reaction earlier.

240
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,676
I think it's best
we do a spinal tap.

241
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,912
- Okay, but meningitis,
that is treatable, right?

242
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,148

- Okay, Joan.

244
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,786
- So, Bret,

245
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,988
if you could lie
on your side

246
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,057
and pull your knees
up to your chest,

247
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,959
I'm gonna numb you

Are you okay?

00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,029

Gonna be stiff tomorrow,
though, aren't I?

00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,983

but pain builds character.

00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,885

exactly?

261
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:35,193
bottom of the 9th--
put me back in, Coach.

262
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,728
- Butchered hockey,
football,

263
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,164
and baseball
in one sentence--impressive.

264
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,133
- Dr. Charles,
thanks for coming down.

265
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,469
Quick favor?
- Shoot.

266
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,271
- Uh, got a patient,
17-year-old hockey player.

267
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,273
- I heard.
Bret "Bear" Cooper.

268
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,808
Dad was a heavy.

269
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,076
Hear the kid's
even better.

270
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,777
- Wouldn't have taken you
for a jock.

271
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,480
- Oh, come on--sport's the
oldest form of group therapy.

272
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,948
We yell.
We scream.

273
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,184
Testosterone spikes.

274
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,453
Every now and then, we even
get to believe in a miracle.

275
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,221
Your patient...

276
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,724
- It's actually his father Jack
that I needed the consult on.

277
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,059
He's exhibiting memory loss,
hand tremors, agitation--

278
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,095
could be Chronic
Traumatic Encephalopathy,

279
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,864
but I'd like to rule out
anxiety and depression first.

280
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,065
- CTE sounds right.

281
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,233
Get hit in the head
that many times,

282
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,835
it's bound to catch up
with you.

283
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,170
- Yeah.
- Past always does.

284
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,341
- Listen,
sorry about the other day.

285
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,343
We got slammed.
- I get it.

286
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,112
E.D. never sleeps.

287
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,514
But if you keep skipping
our sessions, buddy,

288
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,150
I'm afraid
you won't either.

289
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,025
- So finally, as we reintroduce
blood into your lungs,

290
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,061
we will manually compress
the pulmonary artery

291
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:46,164
to avoid
initial volume overload.

292
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,500
- Hey, can I see those lungs
again, please, Doc?

293
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,268
- Yeah, of course.

294
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,373
- Science fiction
meets reality.

295
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,375
[both chuckle]

296
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,844
I just hope they work as well
once they're in me.

297
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,813
- Believe me,
you couldn't be in better hands

298
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,481
than Dr. Downey's.

299
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,050
- We'll see you in the O.R.,
Mr. Mosconi.

300
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,122
- Your lungs
got a Chicago Fire escort

301
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,891
like I have never seen.

302
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,826
- Brothers in arms.

303
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,965
This is really happening.

304
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,135
- It is.
We'll see you on the other side.

305
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,470
- Yeah.

306
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,142
- Quite the presentation,
Dr. Rhodes.

307
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,577
- I wanted to be thorough.

308
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,479
- Great.

309
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,315
Next time, in English.

310

311
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,487

<i>- Start of the second,</i>
<i>Bulls are looking strong...</i>

313
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,127
- What's the score?
- Bulls are up by 4.

314
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,361
- Nice.

315
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,933
- Dr. Manning,
Tim's blood work came back.

316
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,301
INR's high.

317
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,369
- Same thing happened
the last time he came in.

318
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,138
All right, let's ease him off
the blood thinners

319
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,106
and give him 10mg
of Vitamin K

320
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,842
to level off
his clotting factors.

321
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,243
- Put in the order.
- Thanks.

322
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,213
Oh, those tests
that Dr. Halstead ordered?

323
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,581
- All negative.

324
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,217
- Put Tim through
all that stress for nothing.

325
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:25,196
- They won't listen.
They're doing a lumbar puncture.

326
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,467
That is exactly what I was
trying to tell them.

327
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,170
Okay, yeah.
I'll keep you posted, Doc.

328
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,438
Thanks.

329
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,106
- Mr. Cooper?

330
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,376
Dan Charles.
Boy, what a pleasure.

331
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,445
- That's quite a grip.

332
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:43,047
Good for stick handling.
You ever played hockey?

333
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,550
- Oh, a million years ago.
Only Junior League goalie,

334
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,419
but had one shut-out.
Best day of my life.

335
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,622
- Ha. I loved
the Junior Leagues.

336
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,558
played the game for no other
reason than it was fun.

337
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,094
Don't read too much into that.

338
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,263
You are a shrink, right?

339
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,164
- Oh, boy,
what gave me away?

340
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,400
- Well, the team always
had a couple on the payroll.

341
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,435
Soft spoken, loved eye contact,

342
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,437
and not to mention
the sweater vest

343
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,339
and the Rockports didn't help.

344
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,541
- [laughs] Oh, geez.
Well, then you know

345
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,644
exactly what
my next question's gonna be.

346
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,545
- How am I feeling?

347
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,581
Conflicted.

348
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,483
I mean,
my son is in the E.D.,

349
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,285
so as a dad, I'm concerned.

350
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,020
But as a former player,

351
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:25,223
knowing that leaving it out
on the ice is what got us here,

352
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,058
couldn't be more proud.

353
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,928
- Sacrifice in the name
of sport--

354
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,130
wouldn't know
anything about that.

355
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,132
I never played hockey.
- You know, that's a shame.

356
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,967
I mean, you got
great width, you know?

357
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,002
You never thought
about playing goalie?

358
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,139
- Mm--more of a bookworm
than a bruiser.

359
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,674
- [chuckles]
Yeah, I got you.

360
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,542
- The spinal tap's done.

361
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,611
We'll get it off to the lab
and go from there.

362
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,046
- Great.

363
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,347
Well, nice to meet you,
Doc.

364
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,615
- Real pleasure.

365
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,152
- Short-term memory loss--
- As of now,

366
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,254
CTE's only diagnosable
postmortem,

367
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,656
but I'm afraid
your instincts are correct.

368
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,529
- You still at it?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,230
- Didn't your mom
ever tell you you'd go blind

370
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,732
staring at a screen
that long?

371
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,467
- My mother
was a litigation attorney

372
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,970
and worked 90-hour weeks.
She didn't tell me much.

373
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,671
- Well, guess
it's on the nurses then.

374
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,640
All right, this hospital's
too far from the city.

375
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,543
You wouldn't last a week
in the boonies.

376
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,611
- [laughs] Oh,
and this one's way too vanilla.

377
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,481
You've been rolling with us.
You got a little flavor now.

378
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,183
- This one's Boston?

379
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,051
Winters are terrible.

380
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,122
All right,
you got me on that one.

381
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:35,193
Maybe...we're angling
for you to stay.

382
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,327
- Chicago Med's definitely
in the running.

383
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,595
- Ah?

384
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,297
- It's my specialty
I'm torn over.

385
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,032
I always thought
I'd choose pathology,

386
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:45,003
but the E.D.'s really...
grown on me.

387
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,404
I can't believe
I just said that.

388
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,772
- Oh, that's okay,
sweetie.

389
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:51,075
You're not the first lab geek
that we've turned.

390
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,049
- You shouldn't be
the last one in.

391
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,150
- Patient's ready, Dr. Downey.

392

393

He's in sinus rhythm.

00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,352

- Thank you, Nurse.

407
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,158
- Get in there.

408
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,163
- Show me what I need to see.

409
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,532
- Look at the aortic
valve.

410
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,534
- Valve area's .6.

411
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,203
- Cardiologist said it was only
mild to moderately stenotic.

412
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,304
- I know,
but this is critical.

413
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,806
He needs a new valve.

414
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,175
- How long have the lungs
been perfusing?

415
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,544
- Including transport,
at least six hours.

416
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,080
They're good for another
five to six,

417
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,115
but we can't transplant
until we fix that valve.

418
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,150
- Keep him deep--between
his lungs and the blockage,

419
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,552
he won't tolerate
going under again.

420

Don't stop for anything.
April, where's that epi?

arterial venous malformations.
