1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:01,235
.

2
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,986
- How long have you been awake?

3
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,622
Ethan?

4
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,092
- Since 1:00.

5
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:26,560
- Well, I didn't leave
a toothbrush and eyeliner

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,761
in your medicine cabinet

7
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,331
so I could sleep in your bed
without you.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,470
- I've been in therapy.

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,509
Not just Dr. Charles, but the
group he sent me to at the V.A.

10
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,743
Thought I'd be further along.

11
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:47,315
Thought I'd at least
be sleeping.

12
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:50,251
Beginning to think
it's a waste of time.

13
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,786
- Ethan, you know...

14
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:57,425
PTSD--there's no quick fix.
It's a process.

15
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,668
Come back to bed.

16
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,147
- Gotta go for a run.

17
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,620
- [sighs]

18
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,590
- This is not my first rodeo.
I-I've been through this before.

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,560
You sit there deciding who gets
to see the doctor next.

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,196
And the answer is me.
I'm next.

21
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,431
- Mr. Coleman, there are people
in front of you.

22
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,768
- My heart is beating
inside my head.

23
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,171
- Find a magazine
and please wait your turn.

24
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:44,772
We've been through this.

25
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,574
- Tell me something.

26
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,877
Leah, where's your heart?

27
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:53,314
In your chest, right there,
behind your bra?

28
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,750
- You step back now.
- Not mine.

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,219
No, mine's floated up my neck

30
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,887
and it's beating
inside my skull.

31
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,322
It's just--it's beating
inside my skull

32
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,423
and it's driving me crazy.

33
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,192
Please, man!

34
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,193
- Hey!
- I need to see a doctor!

35
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:06,894
- Hey, sir!
- Excuse me!

36
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,562
- Security!
- Sir--

37
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,631
April, get security.
Sir--

38
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,099
- I need a doctor!

39
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,867
[panting]

40
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,336
Can someone please help me?

41
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,337
[grunts]

42
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,506
- Dr. Choi!
- Whoa, whoa.

43
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:21,542
- Sir, look at me.
Wait, wait, wait.

44
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,811
We need to get you
back into the waiting room.

45
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,012
- I could have lied;

46
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,380
I could have said
that I had chest pains.

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,548
You would have had to see me
then, but I'm not a liar.

48
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:28,982
- Okay, okay.

49
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,451
Sir, why don't you
just come with me?

50
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,819
Come with me.

51
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,422
It's okay.
- Someone's gotta make it stop.

52
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,823
- Okay.
- It's gotta stop.

53
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,758
- We will get to you
as soon as we can.

54
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,227
- No!

55
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:41,562
[shouting]

56
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,598
[screaming]

57
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,535
Will somebody see me now?

58
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,570
[sobbing]

59
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,804
- Page Dr. Charles.

60
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:04,418
.

61
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,320
- I'm not crazy!
I'm not!

62
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,257
- Mr. Colman, I'm Dr. Choi.
We need you to stay calm.

63
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:11,859
- Didn't help--
it's--it's still pounding!

64
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,927
- He says his heart is pounding
inside of his head.

65
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,863
- Mr. Coleman,
I need to examine your ear.

66
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,998
- I don't care about the ear!
[screaming]

67
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,166
- Let's get him something
for the pain.

68
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,602
5 of morphine IV, please.
- Got it.

69
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,938
- Mr. Coleman, I'm Dr. Charles,
psychiatrist.

70
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,440
- Just because I'm a vet

71
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,676
does not mean
that I am a mental case.

72
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,344
- You did walk in here
and stab yourself in the head.

73
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,846
- Because no one--
no one would help me.

74
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,948
- Well, look, I-I just need
to do a little evaluation,

75
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,750
ask you a couple questions;
that be all right?

76
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,288
- I'm not crazy.
I'm not a drug addict.

77
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,955
- You're wearing six shirts?

78
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,157
- Yeah, but just
one pair of pants.

79
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,360
Why's that?
- Isn't it obvious?

80
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,929
To--to muffle the sound
of my heart.

81
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,431
- Does it help?

82
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,033
- Nothing--nothing helps!

83
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,103
[panting]
Please...somebody...

84
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,005
[panting]

85
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,412
- Good morning.
I'm Dr. Manning.

86
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,315
I bet you're Bo.
- And I'm Griffin.

87
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:09,016
- Well, hello, Griffin.
Nice to meet you.

88
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,551
- Did you see that man?

89
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,052
He stuck a pencil in his ear.

90
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,588
- Yes, it was very bad,
wasn't it?

91
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,090
- Yeah.
- Sorry you had to see that.

92
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,726
- The boys were playing
in the driveway

93
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,728
waiting for the school bus.

94
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,730
- I see you fell off
your hoverboard.

95
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,432
I see a lot of hoverboarders
in here,

96
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,166
if that's even a word.

97
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,369
- Yeah, he hit
a patch of gravel.

98
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,837
I tried to keep it cold.

99
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,539
- Let me know if this hurts.

100
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,541
- [groaning]

101
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,577
- I see there's no abrasions
on the palm.

102
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,780
- It--it feels like
it's sleeping.

103
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,483
- Hmm.

104
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,051
You know what I think?

105
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,887
I think this is
a very broken wrist.

106
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,255
- I do too.

107
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,723
It made a bad noise.

108
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,059
- Griffin, honey, please.

109
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,127
- Did you hurt your hand
as well, Mrs. Taylor?

110
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,196
- No, no, no.
Kitchen accident.

111
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,198
Burnt myself.
It's fine.

112
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,969
- Well, I'd like to get an X-ray
of Bo's wrist.

113
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,937
- You know what,
I'd prefer you didn't.

114
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,540
I don't want to expose him
to unnecessary radiation.

115
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,043
- It's just a minute radiation
exposure and it is necessary.

116
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,446
A surgeon needs to go in there
and reposition the bones.

117
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,247
- But if they're already
operating,

118
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,083
why do you need a X-ray?

119
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,686
- An X-ray will tell the surgeon
exactly what needs to be done.

120
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,588
But I do need your permission.

121
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:23,591
- [sighs]
Okay, it's fine.

122
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,530
- All right, well, someone will
be in to take you up to X-ray.

123
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,931
Thanks.

124
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,168
- [groaning and stammering]

125
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,405
Fresh balloons every day.
- Yeah, I know.

126
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,740
His room is starting to look
like a party store.

127
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,141
- [chuckles]

128
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,243
I appreciate you checking in
on him the way you do.

129
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,546
- Oh, please.
Eric's my guy.

130
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,980
Tell him I'll be up
during my break.

131
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,649
- All right.

132
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,852
- Your ride's here.

133
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,255
- Hold that, hold it please.
Thank you.

134
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,793
- [laughs]

135
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,229
- Honey, the only thing
that's worse

136
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,965
than dating a patient
is dating an athlete.

137
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,734
- Well, his son is the patient,

138
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,069
and he's retired.

139
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,839
- Don't get me wrong.
I love athletes.

140
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,643
But in my experience, they're
little kids in men's bodies.

141
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,678
Bad long-term bets.

142
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:25,352
- Ventricular septal defect
repair.

143
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,888
Lots of people born
with holes in their hearts.

144
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,723
Procedure's a mainstay
in the CT repertoire.

145
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,792
Good one to get under your belt.
You mind my talking?

146
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:32,926
- No.

147
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,928
- Straightforward,
high success rate.

148
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,264
Mostly kids,
sometimes a newborn,

149
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:42,470
in which case, stay focused on
the simplicity of the procedure.

150
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,473
Try not to be distracted
by the fact

151
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:47,608
that an infant's heart

152
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:51,479
is smaller than a strawberry.

153
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,213
Can take you out of the moment.

154
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,115
- Right.

155
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,818
- So far so good.

156
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,367
- You punctured
the tympanic membrane

157
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,203
and went into the middle ear.

158
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,371
We can do the repair.
It's called a tympanoplasty.

159
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,508
- Just listen to my heart.

160
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,819
It's loud, right?

161
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,123
- Sounds normal to me.

162
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,725
- [scoffs]

163
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,126
That can't be!

164
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,228
- You know, Mr. Coleman,

165
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,597
I'm a vet too.

166
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,799
I know something about PTSD.

167
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,902
- It's not that.

168
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:52,139
I-I saw combat,
but I-I was okay.

169
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,174
- What happened?

170
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,111
- My convoy hit an IED.

171
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,615
I took a back full of shrapnel.
That was it.

172
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,651
- Mind if I take a look?

173
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,129
Looks like it was serious.
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,165
- I was out of the hospital
in a couple weeks.

175
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,067
That was three years ago.

176
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,401
I was doing fine.

177
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,070
This thing with my head
and my heart,

178
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,672
that started
just six months ago.

179
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,206
- I wish I could tell you

180
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,676
there's a physical reason
for the problem.

181
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,944
- [groaning]

182
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,415
- I can't see one.

183
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,486
- Morning.

184
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,790
- Hey.

185
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,759
- I heard Mr. Baker
dropped the lawsuit.

186
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,395
- Yeah.

187
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,298
- That must be a relief.

188
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,702
- Not exactly the happy ending,
but yeah.

189
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,882
- Reese, are you chewing gum?

190
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,483
- Oh, it's sugarless.

191
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,152
- Well, that's not the point.
It's unprofessional.

192
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,387
Spit it out before you go
see another patient.

193
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,495
- Dr. Reese.

194
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,732
- Not quite.
Hey, Joey.

195
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:28,501
- To congratulate you for
getting your Pathology Match.

196
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,743
- Oh, it's beautiful.

197
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,879
- Can you read it?
Bubonic plague bacillus.

198
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,281
- That's amazing.

199
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,217
- It's from the Royal London
Hospital; it's 1893.

200
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,653
- Wow.

201
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,154
- Do you like it?

202
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,156
- I love it.

203
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,859
- Joey, I am so sorry.
I have to steal her.

204
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,193
Dr. Halstead in 4.

205
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,828
- Thank you.

206
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,899
- Reese.

207
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,734
Spit out your gum.

208
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,440
- Any pain?
- Nope.

209
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,575
- Dr. Halstead?

210
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,878
- Mr. Kellogg,
this is Ms. Reese,

211
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,080
fourth year med student,
soon to be doctor.

212
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,214
- Congratulations.

213
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,249
- Grab a hammer, will you?

214
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,920
Mr. Kellogg is
a gymnastics teacher.

215
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,554
- I fell.

216
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,223
Honestly, I'm--
I'm not hurt actually.

217
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,025
It just--it happened
on school property,

218
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,927
so I gotta get a doctor's note.

219
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,595
- Pupils look good.

220
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,897
Ms. Reese is gonna check
your reflexes,

221
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,999
then we'll get you
out of here, okay?

222
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:39,673
- [exhales]

223
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,977
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

224
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,091
- [distorted]
You okay?

225
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,897
- Oh...
- Reese!

226
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,733
- Oh, whoa!

227
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,171
- So it's pretty clear what
bones in the wrist are affected.

228
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,506
But what I'm actually curious
about is this.

229
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:18,111
This is a previous fracture--
one that's already healed.

230
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,346
- Really?
- Yeah.

231
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,782
I don't remember seeing it
in Bo's history.

232
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,852
- Hey, sorry.
Got here as soon as I could.

233
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,087
How's Bo?
- His wrist got broken, Daddy.

234
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,122
- I'm afraid your son's
gonna need surgery.

235
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,092
- Oh, God, you hurt yourself
pretty good, huh, big guy?

236
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,061
- Dr. Manning was just
showing me Bo's X-ray.

237
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:38,932
Appears that he's broken his arm
before and we didn't realize it.

238
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,467
- Oh.

239
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,601
Well, that must have been
from last year

240
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,470
when he fell down the stairs.

241
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,906
He hardly complained;
we just thought it was a sprain.

242
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,407
Remember that?

243
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,042
- Mm-hmm.

244
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,879
- Poor Bo.
Bo's hand is cold.

245
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,480
- Griffin, don't touch
your brother's hand.

246
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,848
- Aaron--
- Sorry, I just--

247
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,483
I don't want him
making it worse.

248
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,919
- It is cold.

249
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,621
The capillary refill's delayed.
- Wait, what does that mean?

250
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,857
- He's losing circulation.
Not enough blood flow.

251
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,058
April, call the OR.

252
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,059
Tell them we're on our way up
right now.

253
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:23,977
.

254
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,446
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Don't be.

255
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,816
You fainted.

256
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,717
- Yeah, right on top of
that poor gymnastics teacher.

257
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,085
Did he say anything?

258
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,487
- Only that he was very
impressed with your dismount.

259
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,325
Reese, your EKG and BP
are normal,

260
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,027
so I think
what we're looking at--

261
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,295
- Is a vasovagal syncope, right?

262
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,396
- Probably.

263
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,065
Just gotta figure out
what the trigger is.

264
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,267
- Okay.
- You know, maybe blood sugar.

265
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,102
Let's get you some orange juice.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,403
- Thanks, Mel.

267
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,643
Well, I'm no Dr. Charles,
but is everything okay with you?

268
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,579
- Everything's great.

269
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,882
The--oh, the tuba player
living above me?

270
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,116
He finally moved out.

271
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,853
And of course,
I just got my Pathology match.

272
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,189
And, oh--
Look.

273
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:13,393
Joey gave me the bubonic plague.

274
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,095
- Wow.

275
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,629
He must really like you.

276
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,331
- He does.
[sighs]

277
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,301
And he's very excited about me
going into pathology.

278
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,870
We're both excited.

279
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,672
You know, Dr. Halstead,
I'm sure this was nothing.

280
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,140
- Probably.

281
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,976
But just to be safe,
let's order a CBC

282
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,410
and we'll take it from there,
all right?

283
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,778
- Okay.

284
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:42,655
- All right.
The patch is done.

285
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,692
And the heart's closed up.

286
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,660
- Okay, then.
Moment of truth.

287
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,397
Give warm blood cardioplegia
to restart the heart.

288
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,665
- I'll need sutures
for the chest.

289
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,570
- She's in third degree
complete heart block.

290
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,805
- I can see that, Marty.

291
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,507
- What do you want me to do?

292
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:04,211
- Dr. Rhodes?
- Relax. Hold on the pump.

293
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,580
One of the patch sutures must've
bagged the conducting system.

294
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,816
- Mm-hmm.
- Suture cutters.

295
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,488
- That one.
Here.

296
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,162
- Normal sinus rhythm.

297
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:25,665
- Good call.

298
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,200
- Because of the edema
in the boy's hand,

299
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,401
I'd say he broke his wrist

300
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,737
at least 24 hours ago,
if not longer.

301
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,740
Also, she said
he hit a patch of gravel.

302
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,742
You'd expect there
to be abrasions on his hand,

303
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:36,843
but there are none.

304
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,946
Combine that
with the previous fracture...

305
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,181
- You suspect abuse?

306
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,682
- I don't know.
Maybe.

307
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,952
- Where's the boy now?
- In surgery.

308
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,287
Dr. Reyes feels confident
he'll be able to save his hand.

309
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,056
- Thank goodness for that.
- Yeah.

310
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,959
- And you said there's
an older brother as well?

311
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,093
- Griffin.
He's ten.

312
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,495
- Well, if there's
a possibility of abuse,

313
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,197
we have to protect
those children.

314
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:00,200
- I just--I don't want
to rush to judgment.

315
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,702
I feel like my radar
has been off lately.

316
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,737
- You're referring
to the shaken baby case?

317
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,240
- We put that woman through
hell, and she was blameless.

318
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,642
- Well, before we call DCFS,

319
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,579
let's get a second opinion.

320
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,847
- I know we're supposed to keep
our emotions out of the OR

321
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,749
but every time we get
one of those newborns,

322
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,986
I'm just a wreck, even when it
turns out all right.

323
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:22,022
Amazing how
you keep your cool.

324
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,124
He's an ace, Dr. Downey.

325
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,858
- Yes, he is.

326
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,198
Nice work in there.
- Thank you.

327
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,700
- Where you going?

328
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,568
- I gotta get back down
to the ED.

329
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,737
- And miss the best part?

330
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,807
Telling the family
their baby's gonna be just fine.

331
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,444
The honor is yours,
Dr. Rhodes.

332
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,519
- Mr. Coleman'll be ready
to transfer in the morning.

333
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,222
- Good, I've got him set up
with psychiatry first thing.

334
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,689
Hopefully the right meds
and therapy

335
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,525
will help get this
under control.

336
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,027
- Good luck with that.

337
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,796
Mr. Coleman, this is Dr. Glass.

338
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,865
She'll be supervising your care
at the V.A.

339
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,934
- Oh, fantastic.

340
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,036
- Nice to meet you.

341
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,870
I heard the surgery
was a success.

342
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,405
- No, it wasn't.

343
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,041
I still hear the beating.

344
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,810
- Auditory hallucinations
are complicated.

345
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,647
- It's not an hallucination.

346
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,285
- Whatever it is,
we want to help figure that out.

347
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:29,056
Now Dr. Charles has contacted
a psychiatrist at the V.A.

348
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,258
Should follow up this afternoon.

349
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:34,261
- It's useless talking
to you people.

350
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:37,197
- Dr. Choi, would you like
to weight in?

351
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:44,337
- It's possible
Mr. Coleman is right.

352
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,974
I think we should get
a chest CT.

353
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,214
- What's the brother's name
again?

354
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,715
- Griffin.
Wait--wait a second.

355
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,484
I already challenged them
on the injury.

356
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,652
Now I walk in
with a psychiatrist?

357
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,356
So who're you gonna be?

358
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,792
- Still me.
Just, uh...

359
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,160
not advertising.

360
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,628
- Okay.

361
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,101
Hi.
- Dr. Manning, how's Bo?

362
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,435
- Are they still operating
on him?

363
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,004
- Last we heard,
he's doing very well.

364
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,107
You must be Griffin.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,608
- I'm Dr. Charles.
Nice to meet you.

366
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,942
- Nice to meet you too.

367
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,977
- As soon as Bo moves up
to the ICU, I'll let you know.

368
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,813
- When he comes home,
I'm gonna take care of him.

369
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,381
- Griffin.

370
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,117
- Ms. Taylor, Dr. Manning told
me that you burned your hand.

371
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,185
Would you like us to redress
that while you're here?

372
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,455
- No, no, no, it's--it's fine.
It's practically healed.

373
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,657
- [giggles]
Mommy's clumsy.

374
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,326
- Is there a reason you're here,
Doctor?

375
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,794
- Well, waiting for a child
to come out of surgery,

376
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,930
that's a stressful time
for--for any family,

377
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,632
and we like to make ourselves
available

378
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,435
for questions, concerns.

379
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,270
- I thought you just said
the surgery was going well.

380
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,438
- It is.

381
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,373
- So why would we need
to talk to anyone?

382
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,607
- Aaron, please.

383
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,008
- Look, can't you see
what this is?

384
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,378
This phony concern
for your hand?

385
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,846
- Is Daddy in trouble again,
Mommy?

386
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,982
- No--no, honey.
- Doctor, let's step outside.

387
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,152
- Can I come with you?
- You stay here, Griffin.

388
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,157
- I'm not stupid.
I've been waiting for this.

389
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,458
You think I abuse my family?

390
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,060
- We do have
a-a couple of questions.

391
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,329
- I didn't touch my boy
or my wife,

392
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,064
and if you think I did,
that's fine.

393
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,932
You call family services,
call the police,

394
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,534
have 'em give me
a lie detector test.

395
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,170
I don't care.

396
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,771
Now if you'll excuse me.

397
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,609
- What do you think?

398
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,379
- I don't know.
I mean, something's off, right?

399
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,747
- I think so.

400
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:42,355
.

401
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:45,558
- Hey, Reese.
How you feelin'?

402
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,694
- Fine.

403
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:48,928
- Haven't seen a swoon
like that

404
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,397
since I took my niece
to see Justin Bieber.

405
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,698
And she just...
Oh!

406
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:52,765
- I'm fine.
It was nothing.

407
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,202
- [chuckles]
Glad to hear it.

408
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,670
- Hey, is everything okay?

409
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,006
- Why do people keep
asking me that? Yes.

410
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,342
- Dr. Halstead ordered
a full panel on you.

411
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,443
Did something happen?

412
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,345
- How is that any
of your business, Joey?

413
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,746
I thought you were
supposed to be running the labs,

414
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,281
not interrogating patients.

415
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,049
- Sorry.
I was just concerned about you.

416
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,818
- It's just unprofessional,
Joey.

417
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,355
There is a protocol in the ED.
It's not like pathology.

418
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,757
- Okay.

419
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,125
Well, here.
Um...

420
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,262
Everything came back normal.

421
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,831
- See?

422
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,866
Well, don't give it me.

423
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,835
Give it to Dr. Halstead.

424
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,306
- Okay.

425
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,378
- Mr. Coleman, the CT scan
we took of your chest

426
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,548
showed a lot of scar tissue
from your shrapnel wounds.

427
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:42,982
- So?

428
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:46,419
- It's not affecting your health
or your heart functions.

429
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,356
But this scar tissue
has created a malformation

430
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,359
which acts like
an echo chamber.

431
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,862
It amplifies
the sound waves of your heart.

432
00:19:55,862 --> 00:20:00,267
I could see it affecting a dish
of Jell-O on your tray.

433
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,935
- So I was right.

434
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,237
It is physical.

435
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:07,674
- Yes, the vibration carries up
to your inner ear.

436
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:11,744
- You really are hearing your
heart pounding in your head.

437
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:15,147
- God.
Finally.

438
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,885
So what are you gonna do
to make it stop?

439
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,392
- I'm afraid
there's nothing we can do.

440
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,595
- Come on,
an--an operation maybe?

441
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,597
- There's too much scar tissue,

442
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:31,998
and it's too close
to the heart.

443
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,966
An operation
just isn't feasible.

444
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,804
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

445
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:42,074
- You gotta do something.
This is driving me crazy.

446
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,076
- Listen to me.

447
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,213
We'll talk to Ear, Nose,
and Throat.

448
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,415
See if there are any options.

449
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,182
- Please, please, do that.
[sobbing]

450
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,219
Please.
[grunting]

451
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,255
[panting]

452
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,335
- I've spoken to the Department
of Child and Family Services.

453
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:09,636
They'll be here in an hour.

454
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,070
- Thank you.

455
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,125
- Dr. Rhodes,
trauma one incoming.

456
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,361
Talk to me.

457
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,763
- 18-year-old female hit
a guard rail, flipped her car.

458
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,532
Open left tib/fib,
BP 90/75.

459
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,369
- Rotate.
- Heart rate 130, GCS 10.

460
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,636
- All right,
she's gonna need ortho.

461
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,472
Call X-ray.
Alert the OR.

462
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,639
- Got it.

463
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,942
- One, two, three.
- Transfer.

464
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,078
It's okay, sweetie.

465
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,513
Let go of the purse; it's okay.
- Give her the purse.

466
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,681
- Let go.
- It's okay.

467
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:55,782
- You can give her
the purse, okay?

468
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,116
You can give her
the purse, okay.

469
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,651
Hey, I'm Dr. Rhodes, okay?

470
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,119
Maggie, see if you can
find me a name.

471
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,187
- Looking for it now.

472
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,122
Dr. Rhodes.
Skyler.

473
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,391
- Hey, Skyler, listen to me.

474
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,493
You were in a car accident,
and you broke your leg,

475
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,395
but we're gonna
take care of you, okay?

476
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:09,762
Hey, see if you can find
her family.

477
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:10,963
- Got you.
Sweetie, I have your purse.

478
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,099
- Thank you.
[crying] Thank you.

479
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,634
- BP's crashing.

480
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,936
- Pulse ox is 78.
- She's lost consciousness.

481
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,406
- Give me 100 of Sux,
20 of Etomidate.

482
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,408
- Need a hand?
- Yep, throw in a tube.

483
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:22,975
- On it.
- Tube and scope ready, Doc.

484
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,212
- Hang a Mag and KRider.
- Got it.

485
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,415
- She's bleeding from somewhere.

486
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,783
Get the level one transfuser,
trigger the MTP.

487
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,853
I need the FAST scan
and a chest X-ray.

488
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,022
- On it.
- Move it here.

489
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,425
- Blood is on its way.

490
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:39,692
- I'm in.

491
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,861
- All right, there's no
free fluid in her belly.

492
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,796
Get the X-ray in here.

493
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,131
- Dr. Rhodes,
take over.

494
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,099
- Got it.
- Increase O2 to max.

495
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,200
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

496
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,770
- Get her on the board.
- Coming in.

497
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,839
- X-ray, clear.
- Clear!

498
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:56,108
- Her left side is whited-out,

499
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,744
and her mediastinum's
shifted to the right.

500
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:00,447
- Tension haemothorax.
Chest tube tray now. 36 French.

501
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:01,848
- Got it.

502
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,116
- Gown.
- Here you go.

503
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,785
Hand me the trauma shears.
- Here you go.

504
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,555
- Airway clear.

505
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,891
- Dr. Halstead.
- Thank you.

506
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,193
- Get the pleur vac.

507
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:17,464
Set up for suction.
- All right.

508
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:18,698
- Coming through.

509
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,370
- I've got it now.
Suction's prepped.

510
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,539
- Stand by.
- We need more sponges.

511
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,640
- Yes, doctor.
- More four by fours.

512
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,676
- She tore something major
in there.

513
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,377
- Transfuser's here.

514
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,345
- Hook it up--start with
the blood and the plasma.

515
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,614
- Got it.
- Starting now.

516
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,616
All right, we need
some more lab sponge in here.

517
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,685
- We're going up to the OR now.
- Yep.

518
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:21,193
- Hi, Dr. Charles.

519
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,330
- Hey, Griffin.
Where're your--your parents?

520
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,899
- Dad went to get some pop.
Mom had to go to the bathroom.

521
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,701
- Oh.

522
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:29,936
What'd you find?

523
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,237
- Nothing.

524
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,540
- I thought I saw you
pick something up.

525
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,075
- Oh.
A button.

526
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,410
It's that lady's.
- Oh, the one who got hurt.

527
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,612
- Uh-huh.

528
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,714
- Yeah.

529
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:44,551
What you gonna do with it?

530
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:47,887
- Give it to the nurse,
so the lady can get it back.

531
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,288
I'm not in trouble, am I?

532
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,758
- No.

533
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,292
But you know what,
let's...

534
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:56,663
Let's find Mom and Dad.
It's kind of a scary place.

535
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:59,599
- I'm not scared.

536
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,569
- No?

537
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:05,104
- I want to be a doctor.

538
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,940
- Really?

539
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,208
Why's that?

540
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,578
- The knives.

541
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:14,146
- What?

542
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,282
- To help people.

543
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:18,618
- There you are, honey.

544
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,587
I told you to stay put.

545
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:30,830
.

546
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,604
- Rib spreader.
- Yes, Doctor.

547
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,373
- Dr. Rhodes.

548
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,275
- Blunt force trauma,
massive left-sided bleeding.

549
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,845
4 PRBC's and 4 plasma given.

550
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,413
Had a hard time
getting her under,

551
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,616
but there's no time left.

552
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:51,183
So here we go.

553
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,819
Long metz and Debakeys to me.

554
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,621
- I'll get the lung
out of the way.

555
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,530
- She's moving.
Marty?

556
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,866
- I've given her plenty of Roc,
but it's not circulating.

557
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,067
I can't relax her.

558
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,936
- I'm opening the pericardium.

559
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,877
- Damn it.

560
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:20,012
Right atrium's torn
clear off the cava.

561
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:25,051
- Give me a Satinsky.
Gotta try to clamp it.

562
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:26,786
- [gasping]

563
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:37,063
[monitor flatlining]

564
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:46,305
- She's gone.

565
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,176
Dr. Rhodes?

566
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,152
- Time of death: 14:21.

567
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:15,567
- Just spoke to my guys
at the V.A.

568
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,970
There's nothing they can do
for Mr. Coleman.

569
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,505
How 'bout you?

570
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:22,709
- Our ENTs said the same thing.

571
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:26,779
So how do we keep this guy from
shooting himself in the head?

572
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:30,850
- The thing is, his condition
has a physical cause.

573
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,887
It's not some complex
psychological issue.

574
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:38,224
It's a matter of Mr. Coleman
learning how to cope with it.

575
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,393
- That's a tall order.

576
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,562
- I know.

577
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:46,465
But it's a problem he can see,
you know what I mean?

578
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,570
In a way, isn't it easier
to deal with things you can see?

579
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,442
- Yeah.

580
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:01,981
Yeah.

581
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,119
- So, it's not the father?

582
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,420
- In my opinion, no.

583
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,223
I think the father--
very possibly both parents

584
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,258
are protecting Griffin.

585
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,460
- A sociopath, really?

586
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,395
He's just a little boy;
he's only ten.

587
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,965
- Sociopathic traits
are identifiable

588
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:21,200
in very young children,
infants even.

589
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,601
- Couldn't the picking up
of the button

590
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,370
just be a normal curiosity?

591
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,974
- Most children when confronted
with such a horrific event

592
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,576
would be repelled.
They'd be frightened, upset.

593
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:32,478
He was drawn to it.

594
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,480
And then to--to focus
on an object

595
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,183
instead of the person who had
been so terribly injured...

596
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:40,853
I think that Griffin's
a danger to that boy--

597
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:41,988
the whole family.

598
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:44,523
I mean, the burn
on the mother's arm?

599
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,524
What--what's that about?

600
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,393
- Okay, so what can we do?

601
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,828
- Very little.

602
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:52,631
We inform DCFS
of Dr. Charles's opinion.

603
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,802
If they deem Griffin a threat
to his brother and his parents,

604
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:58,637
they'll recommend removing him
from the house.

605
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:01,808
But it's only a recommendation.

606
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:03,843
They can't force the issue.

607
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:06,312
The parents have to take
that step.

608
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,921
- Her pericardium was
filled with blood.

609
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,823
She was bleeding to death
inside of her chest.

610
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:18,724
- That's why the anesthesia
wasn't working.

611
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,893
It wasn't circulating.

612
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,829
- I better go notify the family.

613
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,264
- I'll do that.

614
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,999
You should get back to the ED.

615
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,036
- Okay.

616
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,745
- Reese, you okay?

617
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,848
- Uh-uh.

618
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,852
- It happen again?

619
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,221
- Vertigo.

620
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:51,557
- Maybe something is going on.

621
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:52,925
We should run some more tests.

622
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,931
- [sighs]
No. I know what it is.

623
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,871
Pathology.

624
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,047
- What--what is--
what are we doing?

625
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,282
What is all this?

626
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:18,050
- There's something
we'd like to show you.

627
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,992
There.

628
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:28,760
We wanted you to meet
your brother-in-arms.

629
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,696
- Brother-in-arms?
- Yes.

630
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:33,199
Your heart.

631
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:36,035
- Do you see how hard
your heart is fighting for you?

632
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,769
Fighting to keep you alive.

633
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:43,442
Mr. Coleman, we can't make you
the person you were before.

634
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:46,913
And dealing with this
is going to be a long process.

635
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:49,248
But it would help if you could
begin to think about

636
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,583
that pounding in your head
in a different way.

637
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,519
- More like a reminder.

638
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:58,724
- A reassuring,
comforting sound--

639
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,626
that your heart
is there for you.

640
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:19,979
- [crying]

641
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,686
- Wow!
You don't have to do this.

642
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:28,687
- I'm happy to.

643
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:29,956
What are you gonna make me?

644
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,057
- A rocket ship.

645
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,724
- Ooh, I can't wait.

646
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,160
- Thanks.

647
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,394
- I'll see you tonight.

648
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:40,132
- Mr. and Mrs. Taylor?

649
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,700
I understand Bo's surgery
went well.

650
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,801
Have you been up to see him?

651
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,971
- Yes.
He was still asleep, though.

652
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:48,640
- Listen, we owe you both
something of an apology.

653
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,177
We were wrong
about your situation.

654
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:52,644
Could we step into
the consultation room

655
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,980
so that I can explain?

656
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,781
- What about Griffin?

657
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,716
- You can watch him
from in there.

658
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,685
- All right.

659
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,054
- Griffin, honey, you stay here.
We'll be right back.

660
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,589
- Okay.

661
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:22,108
- Mr. Taylor, I don't believe
that you are an abuser.

662
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,378
But I do think that you are
covering up for one.

663
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,014
Your son, Griffin.

664
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:31,050
- [scoffs]
That's ridiculous.

665
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,219
- We're concerned
for Bo's safety.

666
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,021
- And yours, frankly.

667
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:37,056
- We're talking
about a little boy here.

668
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,557
- Who has been exhibiting

669
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:41,227
some very serious
anti-social behavior.

670
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:43,929
- Look, you just met our son.
You can judge him like that?

671
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,864
- I would love to be wrong
about this.

672
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,567
And you should have Griffin
thoroughly evaluated.

673
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,103
But if indeed we're talking
about psychopathy here--

674
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,771
- Psych--
psychopathy.

675
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:53,939
- He's still young.

676
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,707
His brain is still developing.

677
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,509
There are very real things
we can do

678
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,844
to intervene and help him.

679
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,679
Behavioral therapy has shown--

680
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,448
- No, no, we're not listening
to any more of this.

681
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,383
Nedra.
- I recommend you do.

682
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,218
Because if you don't,

683
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,188
ultimately, Griffin may have to
be removed from your home.

684
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:10,489
- No.
- Let's go.

685
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:25,371
.

686
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:27,739
[electronic alarm beeping]

687
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,078
- [whimpering]

688
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:35,081
- Griffin!
- Griffin!

689
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,086
Griffin?

690
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,357
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

691
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,093
- Blood pressure spiking.
Heart's racing.

692
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:49,261
- Get away from your brother.
- I didn't do anything!

693
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:50,962
- [sobbing]
Oh, my God, sweetie, it's okay.

694
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,332
Mommy's here.
Mommy's here. Mommy's here.

695
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,900
- Heart rate, BP's coming down.

696
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,402
- What's happening to Bo?

697
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:59,438
- He's terrified.

698
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:02,108
Fear response is
an involuntary reflex.

699
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:04,110
Even though
he's heavily medicated,

700
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,512
he's aware he's in danger.

701
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,247
- [sobbing]
Sweet boy.

702
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,819
My poor boy.

703
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:14,820
- Mrs. Taylor...

704
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,556
- [crying]

705
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,192
- Mrs. Taylor, you know
you have a problem.

706
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,394
Please let us help your family.

707
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:38,244
- I've been looking for you.

708
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:41,012
- Why, so you can
yell at me some more?

709
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,249
- No.
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

710
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:45,484
And to ask you something.

711
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:47,953
- Okay.

712
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,356
- First, I really do love
the plague slide.

713
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:53,992
It was very thoughtful.

714
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:55,294
- But...

715
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,229
- [exhales forcefully]

716
00:34:57,229 --> 00:35:00,699
Will you still like me
if I don't go into pathology?

717
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,834
- You're not going
into pathology?

718
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,337
- I want to be in the ED.

719
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,574
I actually like
treating patients.

720
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,442
- Okay.

721
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,444
- Really?
Okay?

722
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,881
- Reese, you gotta
get over yourself.

723
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,885
- I know I do.

724
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,787
You're so sweet.
Thanks.

725
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:41,573
- DCFS recommended that Griffin
be separated from the family.

726
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,775
- Good.
- No.

727
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:46,077
The Taylors aren't
going to do it.

728
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,579
- What?

729
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,748
I don't understand.
They saw.

730
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:52,718
- "Heart will not accept
what the eye can see."

731
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:55,954
Willful blindness, right?

732
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,689
I'm afraid this is not
gonna end well.

733
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:02,694
- I wish we could have
done more, Dr. Manning.

734
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,996
- Yeah.

735
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,300
- Hey!

736
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,602
Bet it felt good
to get out of that room.

737
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:11,903
- Uh-huh.

738
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:15,140
- Is that the amazing
rocket ship you made?

739
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,708
- Gotta get you to bed.

740
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,277
- Will you come say good night?

741
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:19,945
- You know I will.

742
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,748
- April, I've been thinking
about what you said,

743
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:25,384
the transference stuff.

744
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,253
I see you're a great nurse,

745
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:29,255
but that's not why I want
to go out with you.

746
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:30,522
Okay?

747
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,957
- Okay.

748
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,867
You're wrong about him.
He's a good guy

749
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,304
- Let's hope.

750
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,477
- Good night, Christy.

751
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:55,681
- Ms. Goodwin.
- Ms. Reese?

752
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,817
- I was wondering, is there any
way that I can undo my match?

753
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,118
- Come again?

754
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,588
- Undo my match in pathology.

755
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:05,090
- Matches are binding.

756
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,460
- I understand, but I thought if
you were to say something--

757
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,298
- Ms. Reese,
it's a legal contract.

758
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:13,932
Good night.

759
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,166
- Good night.

760
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,971
[exhales]

761
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,474
- Good night, Dr. Manning.

762
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:23,842
- Good night.

763
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,795
Mrs. Taylor.

764
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,431
- Sorry.
I'm going up to see Bo.

765
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:49,000
- I heard about your decision.

766
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,670
- It's a phase.
He'll grow out of it.

767
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,005
- You have to protect Bo.

768
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,745
- Do you have children?

769
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,380
- A son.

770
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,885
- And...

771
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:10,456
what would you do?

772
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,824
Would you send him away?

773
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,534
- Hey.

774
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:25,170
Tough loss today.

775
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,972
- Yeah.

776
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,507
- Sorry.

777
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,776
- Thanks.

778
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:33,278
- Buy you a drink?

779
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,180
- Uh...

780
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,882
Yeah, sure.

781
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,617
- Great.
Meet you at Molly's?

782
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,386
- See you there.

783
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:47,092
- You got group at V.A.
tomorrow?

784
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,595
- Yeah.

785
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,065
- You gonna go?

786
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,839
Remember Mr. Coleman.

787
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,544
You, Dr. Choi, have to fight

788
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,213
as hard for yourself
as your heart does.

789
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,918
- I'll go.

790
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,285
- Good.

791
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:36,708
- [sobbing]
She's gone.

792
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,479
My baby's gone.

793
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:43,515
I want her back.
[wailing]

794
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,404
- [exhales shakily]

795
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,612
[crying]

796
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,744
- Okay, if you say so.

797
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,513
- What?

798
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:49,414
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.

799
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:50,749
I better go.

800
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:53,151
Afraid he'll wake up
and I won't be there.

801
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,986
- Sure.

802
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,087
- God.

803
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:59,257
Sorry.
Not much of a first date.

804
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:05,531
- Mm.
It was perfect.

805
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:08,700
- Hey, two beautiful,
unescorted ladies.

806
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,169
You're not stepping out on Bert,
are you?

807
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,138
- No, he's taking
a night course.

808
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,774
Hindi.
Three times a week.

809
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,576
- Ooh, okay.
- Yeah.

810
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,547
- Bert's not still
on that travel kick, is he?

811
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:24,550
- More than ever.

812
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,117
- Huh.

813
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:35,260
- Hey, Will.
- Hey, Herrmann.

814
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,864
You seen Connor?
- Nah, not tonight.

815
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:41,900
Hey.
