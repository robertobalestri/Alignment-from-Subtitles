1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,737
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yup, right here.

2
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:08,073
Yup, yup, copy.

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,341
We'll be ready.

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,577
Okay, trauma is
a minute out,

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,746
including
a uniformed CPD officer.

6
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:17,082
I need rooms, people.
Rooms, stat.

7
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,218
Treatment 3, talk to me.
- Wrapped up the frostbite.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,285
Just waiting on
a discharge order.

9
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,553
- Okay, Dr. Choi?
- Got it.

10
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,355
But first, guy got spooked
in the ladies room.

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,524
Gotta get the skin
out of his zipper.

12
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,592
- All right, people.

13
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,694
I got a waiting room
full of snot,

14
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,662
and I have traumas en route.

15
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,064
No room for coddling, people.

16
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,199
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

17
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,667
Incoming!

18
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:39,805
- 18 year-old male,
GCS 12, tachy's to 130.

19
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,608
Suspected DUI, parked his Beemer
in someone's living room,

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,244
broke the gas line,
started a fire.

21
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,212
- Okay.
Dr. Rhodes, you got this?

22
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,580
- Got it.
- Thank you.

23
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,349
- X-ray!
- Talk to me.

24
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,352
- GCS 6, BP 12O over 80,
King airway in the field.

25
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,586
- All right, Dr. Choi,
Dr. Reese, now.

26
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,754
You're going to Trauma 2.

27
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,123
- He's hypoxic.
Inhaled a lot of smoke.

28
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,191
- All right, rotate.

29
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:00,225
- I pulled the driver,
the kid,

30
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,195
- My partner insisted
on clearing the house.

31
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,597
- Draw trauma labs, an ABG,
and a carboxyhemoglobin.

32
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,299
On my count.
- Thank you, officer.

33
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,668
- One, two, three.

34
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,737
I'll take over.
- Let's start a saline line.

35
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,338
Let's get him set up.
- Tough to bag him.

36
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,807
He's pretty spasmed down.
I need suction.

37
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,842
20 of Etomidate
and 100 of succs now.

38
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:20,079
We need a better airway.
- On it, prepping succs.

39
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,281
Watch his BP.
Heartrate's still tachy.

40
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,516
- Bilateral pubic rami fractures
on the x-ray.

41
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,319
Let's FAST him.
- Pressure's dropping.

42
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,626
- There's free fluid
in his belly.

43
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,795
Possible pelvic hematoma.

44
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,163
All right, let's get him
up to the OR now.

45
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,332
Start two units
of rapid transfuser.

46
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,767
Put trauma and angio on standby.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,603
- Let's go.

48
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,674
He's not going anywhere
till I get a DUI blood draw.

49
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,375
We're charging him.
- His belly is shredded.

50
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,810
If I don't operate right now,
you're not gonna have

51
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,147
- You already have him
on IV fluids.

52
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,548
I got ten minutes, at best,

53
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,383
to get an accurate
blood-alcohol level.

54
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,186
You take him to the OR,
it'll be too late.

55
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,588
- The officer wants
to do a draw

56
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,857
to test your blood-alcohol
content.

57
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,158
Do I have your consent?

58
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,193
- No.
- There's your answer.

59
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,262
- State law says
I don't need consent.

60
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,630
- Go.
- Hospital policy says you do.

61
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,765
- You need to stop--
- Move, move. Hey, uh-uh.

62
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,467
- My partner could've died
back there.

63
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,468
You step aside.

64
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,771
Our priority is to treat
patients, not to make arrests.

65
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,241
As soon as he's out of surgery
and awake, he's all yours.

66
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,243
- Get me that blood,
or you're under arrest.

67
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:27,513
- Obstructing
a police investigation.

68
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:28,881
- You're being ridiculous.

69
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:31,617
- Get me that blood.

70
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,654
- Do what you have to do.

71
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,359
- Maggie, Maggie...

72
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,728
- Take the phone.

73
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,496
- You don't have to do this.

74
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,598
- Stay back.

75
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,281
- I don't know.

76
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:06,818
He wanted you to ignore
her DNR, didn't he?

77
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,220
- It was complicated.

78
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,688
Everything happened so fast.

79
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,223
- Dr. Halstead,
we've been over this.

80
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,591
If you say that
at your deposition,

81
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,394
are gonna have your job
and your medical license.

82
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,695
- But that is not
what happened.

83
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,730
- Look, it is my job
is to protect this hospital,

84
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,699
and we have a strong case.

85
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,235
Now, Jennifer Baker is enrolled
in a promising drug trial.

86
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,271
That is not the behavior
of a woman who's ready to die.

87
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,373
And in order to win this case,
we need to point that out.

88
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,509
- Peter, we need an approach

89
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:33,412
that can both maintain
Dr. Halstead's integrity

90
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,681
and help our case.

91
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:39,251
- Okay, look,

92
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:42,354
if Sal Baker was as conflicted
as you've said,

93
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,956
might one infer

94
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,858
that at least a part of him
wanted his wife to live?

95
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,263
- Yes.

96
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:53,365
[phone ringing]

97
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,536
- Just wait.

98
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,305
- Goodwin.

99
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,344
I'm on my way.

100
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,714
Yes, thank you.

101
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,651
I just got off the phone
with the 21st district.

102
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,719
They're stonewalling.

103
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,953
- They're still holding her?

104
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,321
I can't believe that.
That's outrageous.

105
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,023
- Yeah, I'm going down there.

106
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,658
April, tag in for Maggie.

107
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,260
Get my waiting room cleared.

108
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,262
- Me? I got--
- I paged the on-call.

109
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,797
with the same flu
as all those people

110
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,566
in the waiting area.
Don't worry.

111
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:30,869
You got this.
- Okay.

112
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,871
- Let me grab a coat
and come with.

113
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:33,972
We all know
what happens when you

114
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,874
back a wild animal
into a corner.

115
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,976
- Maggie needs a friend,
not a shrink.

116
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,345
- I wasn't talking about Maggie.
- Well, I'm fine.

117
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,913
I'm just going to have
a little conversation

118
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,349
with Voight, see if
there's anything he can do.

119
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,419
By the way, you need
to change your shirt.

120
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,821
Coffee stain.
And where's your tie?

121
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,325
- Hmm, I must've
got dressed in a hurry.

122
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:56,962
Good luck.

123
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,997
- Let's see.
43-year-old migraine patient,

124
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,699
Treatment 1.
Dr. Choi?

125
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,901
- Copy that.
- All right, uh...

126
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,671
Reese, Treatment 3,
guy got clipped by a car

127
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:06,838
while crossing the street.

128
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,674
- Aye, captain.
- Help! My baby!

129
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,409
Somebody help!
- Got it.

130
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:14,313
[baby crying]

131
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,814
- She's been fussy
and crying all morning,

132
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,482
but every time I try
to put her down for a nap,

133
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,784
she just--she just wails.

134
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,786
I'm telling you,
something's really wrong.

135
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,354
- Her color's good.

136
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,822
She's responding
to external stimuli.

137
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,590
Who's your pediatrician?

138
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,793
- Um, uh, uh, Dr. Simon
at Advocate South.

139
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,795
- All right, April, let's get
those records sent over.

140
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,863
- Copy.

141
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,669
- It's okay.

142
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,074
- All right,
her ears are fine.

143
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,809
Looks like
retinal hemorrhages.

144
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,410
Could she have hit her head
on something?

145
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,712
- No, I don't--
I don't think so.

146
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,547
- All right, let's order
a babygram and head CT.

147
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,948
- I'll let them know
you're on the way.

148
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,016
- Don't worry, I'm going
to take really good care

149
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,117
of your baby, all right?
- Okay.

150
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:55,654
- Don't worry.
April?

151
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,789
[baby cries]

152
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,062
- You think I look bad?
You should've seen the car.

153
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,064
- Ah.
[both chuckling]

154
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,567
Let's take a look at that leg.

155
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,469
- I was rushing to my 11:00.

156
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:13,038
On my cell phone,
which I know is a horrible idea.

157
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,640
Didn't even look
before crossing the street.

158
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,409
I mean, it's totally my bad.

159
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,010
But still, whatever happened
to pedestrians

160
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,412
having the right of way?

161
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,115
- Mm, that's why
I take the bus.

162
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,683
Does it hurt
when I press here?

163
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,852
- No, not much.

164
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,522
- You don't get extra points for
tolerating pain, Mr. Dietrich.

165
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,057
- It's not bad.
It just clipped me

166
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,092
as I was jumping out
of the way, really.

167
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,728
- Well, good news is,
it doesn't appear to be broken.

168
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,063
But there is fluid
on your knee.

169
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,831
I think we should have
ortho take a look.

170
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,067
- Is that really necessary?

171
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,137
I've got to file an emergency
motion before lunch.

172
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,838
- I understand,
but we can't release you

173
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,873
without a complete workup.

174
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,542
I play tennis
with Bernie Goldstein,

175
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,043
Chief of Orthopedics
over at Northwestern.

176
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,080
If you can just brace my leg
and get me on some crutches,

177
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,517
for an office visit
first thing tomorrow morning.

178
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,954
- Make your appointment.
I'll check with my attending.

179
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,890
- Great.
Thanks.

180
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,211
- [exhales]

181
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,021
- Hi.

182
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,192
- I-I can wait
for the next one.

183
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,778
- Sorry, just needed to go out
for a quick smoke.

184
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:06,017
That's not the first time
I've got that look.

185
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,955
Don't worry, I didn't smoke
when I was pregnant.

186
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,790
- Well, you know, there is
also secondhand smoke--

187
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,825
- Yeah, or around the baby.

188
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,227
- Okay.

189
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,631
- I'm sorry.
Sorry.

190
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:23,235
It's just, uh--
it's just the stress.

191
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:27,239
It's been really tough
these last few months.

192
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,142
- Is there anyone
you'd like to call?

193
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,577
Maybe Grace's father, or--

194
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,146
- I wouldn't know
who to call.

195
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:39,017
- You don't know
who the father is?

196
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,086
- It's not so much
a matter of who.

197
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:44,089
It's more which.

198
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,557
There were a couple guys.

199
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,693
because they all bailed
when I told them I was pregnant,

200
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:53,298
so--and then my parents,
they thought I should terminate.

201
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,102
'Cause, you know,
"A baby needs a father."

202
00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:01,673
But no, no,
I just--I couldn't.

203
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,645
So here we are...

204
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,281
The two of us,

205
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,950
just doing the best we can.

206
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,594
- Chicago Med
has a strict policy

207
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,296
against forcible blood draws.

208
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,797
- I got that.

209
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,300
Maggie might've been
following hospital procedure,

210
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,201
but from patrol's
point of view,

211
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,971
she obstructed
a time-sensitive investigation.

212
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,340
- And if we had delayed
that operation,

213
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,742
we could have put
that boy's life in jeopardy.

214
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,212
- Did you come here to argue
or ask a favor?

215
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,982
Listen, Windham told me

216
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,252
that kid was doing
close to 80 in a 25 zone.

217
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,320
And that house he hit--

218
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:51,623
there was
a family inside.

219
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,858
If they can't get
DUI charges to stick,

220
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,260
that kid is gonna post

221
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,663
and be back behind the wheel
in a couple of days.

222
00:09:58,665 --> 00:09:59,864
They're not happy.

223
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:03,101
that one of my people
is sitting behind bars?

224
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,869
- Sharon,
you overestimate my pull.

225
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,739
- Hank, it's Maggie
that's in there.

226
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,741
And I'm asking you
as a friend,

227
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,743
find a way to get her out.

228
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,111
- Look, they're not gonna
release her

229
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,714
until after she's been
processed and arraigned.

230
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,083
I'll see if I can have her
moved up on the docket,

231
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:22,621
but other than that,
there's nothing I can do.

232
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,357
- Can I at least see her?

233
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,693
[indistinct chatter]

234
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,334
- Maggie?
- Sharon.

235
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,138
- Girl, I am so sorry.

236
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,008
- Hey, you got five minutes.

237
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,276
- So I guess you're not here
to take me home.

238
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,748
Voight said they can't release
you until you've been arraigned.

239
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,182
- They're actually
gonna charge me for this?

240
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,251
- Kalmick's got
the gloves off.

241
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:57,389
of getting the charges dropped
or at least reduced.

242
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,923
- Hell, I was doing my job.

243
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,861
- You handled the situation
exactly as I would've.

244
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,996
That blood draw
would've left the hospital

245
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,431
open for litigation.

246
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,734
Next time to fill out
a credit application,

247
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,002
that's what I'll tell them
when they ask me,

248
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,771
"Have you ever been arrested?"

249
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:15,440
- Maggie, we're gonna get you
through this.

250
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:19,344
- You better.
- Okay.

251
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,051
- Dr. Manning.
- Yeah?

252
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,986
- A word.
- Sure.

253
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,364
- Not only
retinal hemorrhages,

254
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,935
but we found a subdural hematoma
and cerebral edema.

255
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,405
- The classic diagnostic triad.

256
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,908
This is a case
of Shaken Baby Syndrome.

257
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,143
- Is there any other caregiver
in the baby's life?

258
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,312
A nanny,
her father?

259
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,382
- Nope.

260
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,950
She did this.

261
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,161
- And Dr. Grant agrees

262
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,398
with your diagnosis
of Shaken Baby Syndrome?

263
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,733
- She does.

264
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,001
We both reviewed
Grace's CT scans.

265
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,770
The findings are consistent

266
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,339
with the neuropathological
triad of SBS.

267
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:25,410
any other explanation
for the symptoms?

268
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:29,114
- I cannot draw any other
conclusion here

269
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,949
other than child abuse.

270
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,419
- [sighs]

271
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:39,958
Dr. Manning, once I pick up
that phone and notify DCFS,

272
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,894
it's out of our hands.

273
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:47,832
- A mother
intentionally harmed her child.

274
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,269
I think it's
the right call to make.

275
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,509
- Hey, how'd the surgery
with the DUI kid go?

276
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:01,546
at the dome of the bladder,
so it took a while to repair.

277
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,349
Uh, where's Maggie?
I was wondering

278
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,151
if she got ahold
of the kid's parents yet.

279
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,285
- You didn't hear?

280
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,386
Maggie got arrested.

281
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,422
after we took the kid upstairs,
they couldn't get the blood

282
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,159
and charged her
with obstruction.

283
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,360
I know.

284
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:19,564
Goodwin's working on
getting her cut loose.

285
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,168
- Ms. Reese,
beautiful day, right?

286
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,836
- I guess,
it's kinda cold.

287
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,071
- Hey, hey, is that for
the gentleman in 3?

288
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,040
- Yeah, Kevin Dietrich.
- You know what?

289
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,143
Those buckles are actually
a lot trickier than they look.

290
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,112
How about if I give you
a little hand?

291
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,582
- Okay, sure.

292
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,421
- Mr. Dietrich,
I'm Dr. Charles.

293
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,290
- Hey.

294
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,025
- How are you?
- Good, good.

295
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,261
- I have come
to render an assist

296
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,397
with this deceptively
tricky brace.

297
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,332
- Sure.

298
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,438
[chuckles]
Chief of Psychiatry?

299
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,906
- Technically, yeah.

300
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,542
Today, more like Chief
of Physical Therapy.

301
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,412
I blew out my knee out on
the slopes a couple years ago,

302
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,481
got stuck with one of
these suckers for a few months.

303
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:14,252
The trick is the buckles.
- Okay.

304
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,087
Great, good to know.
Thank you.

305
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,491
- So, uh,
how'd you do this?

306
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,260
- Oh, just one
of those mornings,

307
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,128
completely overbooked.

308
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,163
Point is,
I was running late--

309
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,898
- And on your cell phone.

310
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,200
- Right, I was on the phone
with my insurance broker--

311
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,435
need to up our homeowner's.

312
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,037
Anyway, so I stepped
out into the crossing,

313
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,640
tried to jump out of the way
but couldn't.

314
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:39,377
So, boom, I'm on the ground.
[chuckles]

315
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,913
- Wow, hell of a morning.

316
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,450
- Yeah, well, I'm just thankful
for the intrepid Ms. Reese here

317
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,086
for patching me up
so I can get on with my day.

318
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,021
- You know, you can't
really drive like this.

319
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,890
So what--should we
call your wife?

320
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:56,494
- No, no, the--

321
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,196
I just mean she's really busy.
- Ah.

322
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,231
- Billed nearly 80 hours
last week.

323
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,035
So I don't want to bother her
with something like this.

324
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,471
- Great.
Nice to meet ya.

325
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:09,274
- Yeah, a pleasure.
Thank you.

326
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,409
- Ms. Reese,
could I just see you for a sec?

327
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,444
- [mouthing]

328
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,081
- Could you do me a favor
and give me a heads up

329
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,617
before you discharge
Mr. Dietrich?

330
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,587
- Okay.
- Thank you.

331
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,926
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

332
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,327
- Okay, good.

333
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,995
All right, we'll get her back
as soon as possible.

334
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,264
- You're Mommy's doctor.

335
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,699
You saved her.

336
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:35,700
- Hi, Bailey.

337
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,969
What are you doing down here?

338
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,404
- I need more markers.

339
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,940
- Do your parents
know where you are?

340
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,441
- Uh-uh.

341
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,343
- I'm sorry,
we can't have that.

342
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,111
Come with me.

343
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,448
- Hey, Leah,

344
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,016
can you take Bailey
back upstairs

345
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:55,720
- I can't leave the desk,
but I will find someone who can.

346
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,522
- Okay, thanks.

347
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,191
- I need more colors
for my rainbow.

348
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,094
- Wow, that's very pretty.

349
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,097
- I'm making it for Mommy,
to make her feel better.

350
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,068
- Has she been sick?

351
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,136
- Real sick.

352
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,407
- Did something happen,
Bailey?

353
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,544
- She had to get a shot.

354
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,081
- Okay.

355
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,220
- Dr. Manning,
DCFS just arrived.

356
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,261
- Ms. Fisher,
this is Madeline Gastern

357
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,231
from the Department
of Child and Family Services.

358
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:43,534
- I'm here to investigate
a possible case of child abuse.

359
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,337
- Child abuse?
What, you think I hurt my baby?

360
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,606
That's crazy.
- We need you to come with us.

361
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,142
- What? No! No, no,
I don't want to leave my baby.

362
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,044
No, you can't do this!
I didn't hurt her!

363
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,746
You can't make me leave my baby!

364
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,748
I didn't hurt her!
You can't do this!

365
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,449
I didn't hurt her!

366
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,786
You can't make me
leave my baby!

367
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,521
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

368
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,091
Ah, Dr. Charles, good news.
I'm out of here.

369
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:10,395
- Before you go, could I
just talk to you for a sec?

370
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,729
- Um--
- Ms. Reese,

371
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,332
do you mind excusing us
for--for just a moment?

372
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,666
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

373
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,368
- Yeah, I really have to go.

374
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,604
- I will not keep you for
more than a minute.

375
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,206
I just want to understand
a little better

376
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,175
what happened this morning.

377
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,410
- I already explained.
It was an accident.

378
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,744
And I'm sorry,
but I'm really late.

379
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,212
- I understand.
You're a very busy man.

380
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:33,351
Listen,
off-the-wall question.

381
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:36,621
Have you been...
having a hard time

382
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:40,158
getting out of bed
in the morning recently?

383
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,660
- No.
I have to go.

384
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,296
Thanks.
- Mr. Dietrich.

385
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,333
- Excuse me.
[clears throat]

386
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,669
- Mr. Dietrich, I'm sorry.

387
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,271
I can't let you
leave just yet.

388
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,173
- What are you
talking about?

389
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,080
- I am not convinced
that it was an accident

390
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,449
when you stepped in front
of that car this morning.

391
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:07,151
I think you were trying
to kill yourself.

392
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,253
- [laughs] What?
- Dr. Charles.

393
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,621
- And I'm, um...
I'm worried

394
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,724
that you still might be
a suicide risk.

395
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,760
And if you insist on leaving--
- I do.

396
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,763
under a temporary
psychiatric hold.

397
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,766
- [scoffs]
This is ridiculous.

398
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,302
- Well, Earl here is going
to take you someplace quiet.

399
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,270
- I--
- And hopefully we can talk.

400
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,339
- I will sue you
and this entire hospital.

401
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,440
- Thank you, Earl.

402
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,741
- I'll have
your medical license.

403
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,210
You can't--
you can't do this.

404
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,313
- I can, actually.
- What?

405
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,190
- Back to work.

406
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,498
- I've got a charge nurse
in city hospital,

407
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,766
an ongoing child-abuse
investigation,

408
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,502
and now you bring me this?

409
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,470
- He tried to commit
suicide, Sharon.

410
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,872
I wasn't about to let
it happen again.

411
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,306
- He's a successful lawyer

412
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,742
with no past history
of depression.

413
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,378
- I know the type, okay?

414
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,647
Look, the way
he recounted what happened,

415
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,450
his need to sell
this way too-detailed version

416
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,685
of the narrative, right?

417
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,420
Look at this x-ray.

418
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:20,525
He took the impact directly
above the knee--directly.

419
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,927
That means he stood in
and took the brunt.

420
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,929
He wanted to get hit.

421
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,898
- That's conjecture, Daniel.

422
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,934
You're usually not this quick
to make a diagnosis.

423
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,537
- With this condition,
you become a master of disguise.

424
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,205
Just give me a little more time

425
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,840
to see if I can get him
to drop the mask, okay? Okay.

426
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,842
- All right.
Just find a way to do it

427
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,878
without further
complicating my life.

428
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,816
Is there something else?

429
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,758
- I'll sure be glad
when Maggie gets back.

430
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,427
Advocate just sent over
those medical files

431
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,828
you requested on baby Grace.

432
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,430
- Oh, right.
- And I'm sorry it took so long.

433
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,265
They're just as backed up
as we are today.

434
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,501
- Sure.

435
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:29,227
- Hey.
- Hey.

436
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,296
- Am I gonna be okay?
- Yeah, you are.

437
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,598
Surgery went well.

438
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,666
- Like, totally okay?

439
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,603
I want to be a pilot--
naval aviator.

440
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,837
- Do you realize
what you did today?

441
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,372
Hmm?

442
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,774
- Yeah, yeah, it was stupid.
- Trev, you're awake.

443
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,776
- Hey, Dad.

444
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,412
- Did you say anything
to the police at the scene?

445
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,014
- No.
- Attaboy.

446
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,717
He did the right thing,
refusing the blood draw.

447
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,385
Just talked to Sid Burstyn.

448
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:57,521
He thinks he might be able
to make this all go away.

449
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:02,627
so it looks like we can all just
move on, put this behind us.

450
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,429
- Somebody got hurt.

451
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,866
- You must be Dr. Rhodes.
Thank you for everything.

452
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,939
- We'll do
a cystogram next week

453
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,941
to see
how your bladder's healing.

454
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,377
You can schedule it
with radiology.

455
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,978
If you'll excuse me.

456
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,487
God, I wanted to pop that guy.

457
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:33,991
that same stupid sense
of entitlement.

458
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,695
My DUI kid, he's ruined.

459
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,563
- Connor, look,
we don't get along.

460
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,366
You don't like me.
But I need a favor,

461
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,001
and there's no one else
I can ask.

462
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,072
I have to access some records,

463
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,441
and I can't use
my code to log in.

464
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,976
- Why not?

465
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,846
- Because no one can know
I looked at them.

466
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,952
- You caught me
on the right day.

467
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:09,093
- Don't tell me; I don't want
to know anything about it.

468
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,396
[typing]

469
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,713
- I realize this is a very
uncomfortable situation, really.

470
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:31,115
- Do you?

471
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,517
I don't have to talk to you.

472
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,021
- Of course not.

473
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,824
I hope you will.

474
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,625
- What does it matter?

475
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,562
I could tell you
that I'm a happy man,

476
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,764
that I have a perfect life,
which I do.

477
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,766
But you've already got
your mind made up about me.

478
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,067
- Mr. Dietrich,

479
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,903
I don't have my mind
made up about anything.

480
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,372
I am genuinely here
to help.

481
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,674
- Help?
- Yeah.

482
00:22:56,676 --> 00:23:01,078
- No, this is
how you justify yourself.

483
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,947
Look at you.

484
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:07,051
So smug, so sure of yourself,
like you know me.

485
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,086
You don't know me.

486
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,522
So go ahead, tell me
what my problem is.

487
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,692
- Tell you
what your problem is?

488
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:15,993
- Yeah, come on.

489
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,596
Enlighten me, Dr. Freud.

490
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:19,864
- It doesn't really
work that way.

491
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,098
- Okay, wow.

492
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,467
So you don't know,
do you?

493
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:26,570
This is your job,
and you don't have a clue.

494
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:30,007
So you've got all those people
fooled out there, huh?

495
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,679
- You know what?
Um, I think we are

496
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,047
hitting a bit
of a wall, so--

497
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,016
- Yeah, you know why?
'Cause I shouldn't be here

498
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,685
in the first place.

499
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:42,720
- I'll check in
on you later.

500
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:45,156
- Okay, yup,

501
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:48,025
hope you've got your malpractice
premiums paid up.

502
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,838
- Dr. Charles,

503
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,140
has he admitted
he tried to kill himself?

504
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:07,978
- No, he says
he's a happy man

505
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,616
and has a perfect life.

506
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,520
- So what are you
going to do?

507
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,723
[sighs]

508
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,030
- I don't know.

509
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,602
- Great.

510
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,604
Thanks for
letting me know, Hank.

511
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:34,738
[knock at door]
Come in.

512
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,974
Tell her I'm on my way.

513
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,010
Dr. Rhodes, I hope
you can make this quick.

514
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,712
- I was the one
that kept the cops

515
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,981
from drawing
that kid's blood, not Maggie.

516
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,816
If anybody should
be held responsible, it's me.

517
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,651
And I'm gonna go
turn myself in.

518
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,920
- That's a nice gesture,
but things don't work that way.

519
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,822
Besides, Maggie
just made bail.

520
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,923
I'm going
to pick her up now.

521
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:56,560
- These are baby Grace's records
from Advocate South.

522
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,162
I made a horrible mistake.

523
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:02,500
We have to stop DCFS.

524
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,135
- I'll go get Maggie.

525
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:07,071
- Talk to me.

526
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,845
- So if it's not
Shaken Baby Syndrome--

527
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,747
- Grace suffered
an injury in utero--

528
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,048
an intracranial hemorrhage,

529
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,250
which I believe occurred
when her mother was

530
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,719
in a car accident
at 30 weeks gestation.

531
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,622
- And this happened
before the baby was even born?

532
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,023
- Yes, when her
prenatal ultrasounds

533
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,892
were sent over
from Advocate South,

534
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:29,894
I showed them to Dr. Heller,
head of radiology.

535
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:32,263
There's a small hematoma
on the images.

536
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,865
It's easy to miss,
but it is there.

537
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,835
- But wouldn't the doctors
have noticed it at birth?

538
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,570
- It likely healed soon
after the accident,

539
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:42,840
But even the slightest bump
on the head

540
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:45,109
or a roll in her crib could have
caused her to re-bleed.

541
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,111
- And mimic the SBS triad.

542
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,079
- Yes.
- Let's go.

543
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,318
[knock at door]

544
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,924
[knocking]

545
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,892
[door opens]

546
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,664
- Dr. Charles?

547
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,232
- Yeah?

548
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,767
- I'm sorry,
but I texted you

549
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,335
and didn't get an answer.

550
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:14,138
- What is it, Ms. Reese?

551
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,709
- Um, have you been back
to see Mr. Dietrich?

552
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,110
- No, I haven't.

553
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,079
- Oh.

554
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:44,134
Dr. Charles,
this isn't like you.

555
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:48,038
I mean, you never give up,

556
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,373
and you always know
what to say.

557
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,242
That's why we all
admire you so much.

558
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,614
- Ms. Reese,

559
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,284
did it occur to you
that you might be

560
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,353
overstepping the bounds

561
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:04,989
of a fourth-year
medical student?

562
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,197
- I'm sorry.

563
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,175
- [sighs]

564
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,986
- I told you
I didn't hurt her.

565
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,088
- I know.
I am very sorry.

566
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,289
- We all are.

567
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,924
- You people are horrible.

568
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,393
- Ms. Fisher,
please understand,

569
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:44,762
we were following
hospital protocol.

570
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:47,097
Whenever there's a case
of suspected abuse,

571
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,932
we have to
take it seriously.

572
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,902
- You started judging me
the second I walked in here.

573
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,776
So does this mean
my Gracie ain't sick?

574
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:00,744
- No, I'm sorry,

575
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,312
but, symptomatically,
your child is still

576
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,848
in the same condition.

577
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,418
We can't be certain

578
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,987
how her development
might be affected.

579
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,822
We'd like to keep her here
for monitoring--

580
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:15,192
- No, no, no, no,
I don't want you or anybody else

581
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,994
at this hospital
taking care of my baby.

582
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:18,228
How soon can I get her
out of here?

583
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,730
- We'll check with Dr. Grant

584
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,398
to see when
she can be discharged.

585
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,133
- I want to go
see her now.

586
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,069
- Of course.

587
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,983
- Mr. Dietrich,
how you doing?

588
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,493
why I think you threw yourself
in front of that car.

589
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:53,397
It's precisely because
you think you have

590
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,900
the perfect life,
and you're still miserable.

591
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,168
- So, what, I'm an ingrate?

592
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,971
- No, it's called
endogenous depression,

593
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,741
and it's caused
by your brain chemistry.

594
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,877
And like so many people
who suffer from depression,

595
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,412
you're ashamed
to tell anybody about it,

596
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,315
'cause you think
it's your fault.

597
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:13,016
- [laughs]

598
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:16,286
Okay, yeah, I'm--I bet.
Sure, sure.

599
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:20,290
- Okay, look,
why don't you call your wife?

600
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,960
Tell her where you are
and why you're here.

601
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,062
She's an attorney; she can get
you out of here in five minutes.

602
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:29,533
She knows what to do.

603
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:32,503
What, you don't want to--
what--

604
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:37,040
you don't want to call her?

605
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:40,844
Why? Are you worried
that maybe, if she finds out

606
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,546
that you're not the brave,
strong man she married,

607
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:46,383
she might not
love you anymore?

608
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,051
Do you know that
the single greatest challenge

609
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:51,555
that I face is trying
to convince people

610
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,457
that depression isn't
a sign of weakness?

611
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,493
- Okay, I'll remember that
if I'm ever depressed.

612
00:29:56,495 --> 00:30:00,397
- Okay.
[taps the bed]

613
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,498
You know, I got
to hand it to you.

614
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,303
You are--you're one hell
of a performer.

615
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,539
I mean, a real trouper.

616
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:10,874
I mean, keeping it up
for so long.

617
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,349
You know, selling this idea
of who you think you need to be,

618
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,485
all the time...

619
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:31,495
Carrying around the weight
of that...performance.

620
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,898
Isn't it tiring?

621
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,573
Aren't you exhausted?

622
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:44,541
I think it'd be exhausting.

623
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:54,051
- [soft laugh]

624
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,321
I have absolutely
no excuse to be sad.

625
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,455
- You don't need
an excuse, man.

626
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,490
You're a human being.

627
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,128
- [scoffs]

628
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,232
[crying]

629
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,077
[sniffles]
[cries]

630
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,579
- You're, um...

631
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:26,049
You're not alone,
Mr. Dietrich.

632
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,987
- [exhales]

633
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,099
- So what's the story?

634
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:45,302
Sharon didn't need to send
a trauma surgeon to pick me up.

635
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:48,672
- I wanted to do it.
I felt bad.

636
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,041
- Why, 'cause I'm the one
who got busted?

637
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,111
- Mm.

638
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,914
- Listen, I know you think that,
because you're a trauma surgeon,

639
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:01,351
But the ED's mine, and nothing
happens in my kingdom

640
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,020
that I don't
take responsibility for.

641
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,988
- You're right,
you're right.

642
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,092
Maybe--the system's rigged...

643
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,663
and it pisses me off.

644
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,537
- Pisses you off?

645
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:31,481
- I have sat in jail.

646
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:36,053
My buddy and I--
summer before I went to college,

647
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:38,288
we got busted trying
to buy drugs

648
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,091
off of an undercover cop.

649
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:45,562
- You?
- Yeah.

650
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,098
I mean,
come on, at that age,

651
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,035
you think
you're invincible, right?

652
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,737
Turns out,

653
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:56,039
only one of us was right.

654
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,741
My dad pulled some strings,

655
00:32:57,743 --> 00:33:01,311
and he got me off.

656
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:07,351
- What about your friend?

657
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:11,555
- Well, his dad didn't own
a department store.

658
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,193
Turns out the lifeboat
was only big enough

659
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:19,196
for one of us,
so I had a choice.

660
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:23,367
I could stand by my friend,

661
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,302
or I could jump in.

662
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,676
So I jumped in the boat.

663
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:44,354
- I'm honored that
you would share this with me,

664
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:48,158
but if you want to make amends,
you need to call your friend.

665
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:54,064
- I can't.

666
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:58,769
He died of an overdose
before I could--

667
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:02,572
before I could
work up the nerve.

668
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,819
- Zoe--
- Hey.

669
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:19,456
- Jennifer Baker had a pulmonary
embolism four days ago.

670
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,426
- How'd you hear that?
- I saw her chart.

671
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:23,827
- Will, the woman
is suing you.

672
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,063
If you accessed those records,
they'll know.

673
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:29,232
- Someone did it for me.
- Dr. Manning?

674
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,401
- No.
That's not important.

675
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,737
The records show that
her doctors prescribed heparin

676
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,771
to dissolve the clot.

677
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:35,806
- So?

678
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:39,443
for use with the medication
being used in her drug trial.

679
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,611
That means Jennifer's not
on the medication.

680
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,447
She's on the placebo.

681
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,682
- Oh, Will, I'm so sorry.

682
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,217
- She's going to die
if we don't get

683
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,787
Is there anything you can do
to make that happen?

684
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,857
- You know the oncologist
running the trial, right?

685
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,225
Maybe you can petition.

686
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:56,426
- I-I-I can't.

687
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,663
- All right, then we'll do
something without him knowing.

688
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:01,131
Like back-date a scan.

689
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,633
- No, Will, please.
God.

690
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:07,204
Listen, I am asking you
for this--for this one thing,

691
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:12,476
for me--
to let this go.

692
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:15,645
- I'm sorry.

693
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,747
I can't.

694
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:24,354
- [sighs]

695
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,489
- What's wrong with her?

696
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,890
- What's going on?
- She's seizing.

697
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,359
- What's wrong?
Please, help her!

698
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,861
- Get the crash cart
and page Dr. Grant.

699
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:33,163
What's her Broselow?
- She's pink on the tape.

700
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,631
- Push .7 milligrams
of lorazepam.

701
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,666
- .7, I got it.
- All right, sats are 66.

702
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:37,834
Start bagging her.

703
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,669
- What's wrong with her?
What's going on?

704
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,771
- She's stopped breathing.

705
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,175
- [sobs]

706
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,644
- Sats are coming up.
- Is she breathing?

707
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,446
- She's postictal
and protecting her airway.

708
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:52,249
Let's get another head CT
and page pediatric neurology.

709
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:54,251
- This is what you were
talking about, huh?

710
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:57,687
- Yes, seizures can be
a part of her condition.

711
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,489
- How long will she have 'em?

712
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,760
- I don't know.
- Her whole life?

713
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,629
- I don't know.

714
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:09,866
[baby crying]

715
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,342
- That woman has a long road
ahead of her.

716
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,278
They both do.

717
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,447
- You know, there are maybe
17 different agencies

718
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:27,684
ready to jump
in when they suspect abuse.

719
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,386
But who jumps in to help

720
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:33,690
when it's a single mother
who's struggling?

721
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,559
- You know, she's right.

722
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,861
I did judge her.

723
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,529
And you know why?

724
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,265
Because I can imagine it.

725
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,935
Owen is bawling his head off

726
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,603
at 3:00 in the morning.

727
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,206
and I am exhausted,

728
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,708
and I have no one
I can hand him to.

729
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,779
So yeah, I can imagine it.

730
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:58,381
- And there isn't a mother
alive who hasn't.

731
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,484
The difference is,
you won't do it.

732
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,420
- And neither did she.

733
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,868
- It's Maggie.
- Look who's back.

734
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,572
- Maggie.

735
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,608
- Dr. Rhodes said
you were covering for me.

736
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,009
- Yes, and thank God
you are back.

737
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,345
- I'm sorry
I couldn't pick you up.

738
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,013
- That's okay.
If he was driving Uber,

739
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:33,016
he'd get five stars.

740
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,017
- I was worried about you.

741
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,787
- I'm fine.

742
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,556
Why is everybody
standing around?

743
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,458
Back to work, Reese.

744
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,426
Chop chop.

745
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,639
- You're Dr. Rhodes?

746
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:57,040
- Yeah.
- I had it checked.

747
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,541
Dr. Halstead used your code

748
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,378
to access Jennifer Baker's
records, didn't he?

749
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,780
- Look, I-I didn't--
- I don't care about any of it.

750
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,383
He found out that
she's only on a placebo.

751
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,318
I'm afraid he's
going to tell her.

752
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,661
- I'll handle it.

753
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,934
[panting]

754
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:29,806
Eighth floor.
Clinical trial wing, seriously?

755
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,675
When I helped you out
earlier,

756
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:34,611
I didn't think it was
gonna lead to this.

757
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:37,981
- What do you care?

758
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,482
- Well, I'm not going
to stand by

759
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,418
and watch another guy
ruin his life.

760
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,919
- Hey!
- No.

761
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,020
[alarm ringing]
- You're not gonna stop me.

762
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,889
- Actually, I am.

763
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,958
Hey.
[struggling]

764
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,493
- Damn it!
[grunts]

765
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,796
- You're not supposed
to go near her.

766
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:54,331
You tell her
she's on a placebo,

767
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,600
that's your license, okay?

768
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,571
- She can go home!

769
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:05,408
- You're a good doctor.

770
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,645
The world needs good doctors,
you ass.

771
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,882
[panting]

772
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,827
[alarm stops,
elevator hums]

773
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,823
- Ms. Reese.
- Hmm?

774
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,493
- Um, I was unkind to you,

775
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:02,065
and I hope that you'll
allow me to apologize.

776
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,503
- It's okay.

777
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:10,106
You were sleeping.

778
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:12,475
I woke you.

779
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:16,045
- That is
a good way to put it.

780
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,558
<i>- You don't like</i>
<i>Chicago-style popcorn?</i>

781
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,927
<i>- Mixing caramel</i>
<i>with cheese flavors?</i>

782
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,897
- Sweet and salty--
it's the greatest duo.

783
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:36,733
- I thought the great duo
was Jordan and Pippen.

784
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,001
- Oh.

785
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,903
[sighs]

786
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:43,840
- I've been off my meds.

787
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,475
- Since when?

788
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,712
- I started titrating myself
down about ten days ago.

789
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,649
I'm sorry. It was
a little chemistry experiment.

790
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:56,953
I really should have told you
during our last session.

791
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,523
- How's the experiment going?
- Not great.

792
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,792
The black cloud
is descending.

793
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,728
There ain't no denying it.

794
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,699
- Why did you go off?

795
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:14,237
- About a month ago, I just-- I
started to feel fuzzy, you know?

796
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,807
Like I was losing my edge,
like my antenna--

797
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,244
I mean, you know the focus
that it takes to treat patients.

798
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:24,848
I was worried that I was
gonna make a mistake.

799
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,117
- Danny, you also can't treat
patients if you're depressed.

800
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,787
- You'd think I would've
figured that out by now.

801
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,755
- Let me adjust your dose.

802
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,125
We'll figure out a balance.

803
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,961
- Okay.

804
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,600
- Hey, there you go.

805
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:46,236
So, how was your day?
You save some lives?

806
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,076
Okay, got it.

807
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:55,778
Not feeling chatty.
