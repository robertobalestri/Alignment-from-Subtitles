00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,580
Everyone, listen up.

196
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,920
We're missing

197
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,920
a gold wedding band.

198
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,680
So take a room and

199
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,680
search every inch of it.

200
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,920
From now on,

201
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,920
nothing leaves the ED.

202
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,360
Every sheet, every gown,

203
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,360
every piece of trash

204
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,860
gets bagged and

205
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,860
stored until I search it.

206
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,860
Got that?

207
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,860
WOMAN: Got it, Maggie.

208
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,120
Hey.

209
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,090
We're gonna find it, okay?

210
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm gonna check in the lounge.

211
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,540
Okay.

212
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,700
Thank you.

213
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,700
Okay.

214
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,880
So this is Rose Wechsler, 83.

215
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,140
Arrived from her

216
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,140
nursing facility

217
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,140
confused and agitated.

218
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,670
Ms. Wechsler, good morning.

219
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,740
ROSE: Baloney.

220
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,310
Are you here for the sink?

221
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,610
You know I'm not.

222
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,320
But it would help

223
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,320
me out a great deal

224
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,750
if you could tell

225
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,750
me what year it was.

226
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,760
Check your damn calendar.

227
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,760
No wonder you people

228
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,760
never show up on time.

229
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,020
That's completely my fault.

230
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,020
Do you mind if I

231
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,020
just shine...

232
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,660
What are you,

233
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,660
some kind of a maniac?

234
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,030
Get the hell out of here!

235
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,030
Thank you.

236
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,600
Out!

237
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,600
Lovely to meet you.

238
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,060
What do you think?

239
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,060
(SIGHS)

240
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,900
Nursing home delirium.

241
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,710
Acute cognitive

242
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,710
dysfunction from some

243
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,210
combination of dehydration,

244
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,210
stasis,

245
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,910
overmedication,

246
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,910
and a lack of

247
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,910
human engagement.

248
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,380
Could be.

249
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,010
She's neurologically intact,

250
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,010
but her mucous membranes

251
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,010
are dry.

252
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,280
If you're right,

253
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,280
fluids will perk her up.

254
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,620
Hmm, yeah. For now.

255
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,210
What?

256
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,890
Uh, I'm sorry.

257
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,890
It's just that her records

258
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,160
indicate she led

259
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,160
a remarkable life.

260
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,860
Was one of the first

261
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,860
female test pilots.

262
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,860
Trained at NASA.

263
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,730
Even if fluids work,

264
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,730
it's sad seeing

265
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,670
someone like that

266
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,670
wind up like this.

267
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,430
Well...

268
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,430
MAGGIE: Incoming!

269
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,510
Dr. Choi, we're going

270
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,510
to Baghdad.

273
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,200
to the ED, stat.

274
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,340
On it.

275
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,410
MAGGIE: Talk to me.

276
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,740
CESAR: Frank McCormick.

277
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,740
Here's his EKG.

278
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,380
42. Lost his

279
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,380
rhythm again in the van.

280
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,010
Shocked from

281
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,010
V-fib in the field.

282
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Hang in there, Frank.

283
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
It's gonna be okay.

284
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Excuse us, ma'am.

285
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,550
Let's rotate.

286
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,230
All right. Let's transfer him

287
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,230
on my count.

288
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,960
One, two, three. Transfer.

289
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,650
Dr. Choi, what do you got?

290
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,790
STEMI. A big one.

291
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,360

(EKG FLATLINING)

296
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,670
He flipped back into V-fib.

297
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,670
On it.

298
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,170
Sats are dropping.

299
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,170
Frank.

300
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,370
Paddles to Dr. Choi.

301
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,770
Ma'am, is this your husband?

302
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,770
JUDY: Yes.

303
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
He had a heart attack.

304
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
Please step outside.

305
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,540
Oh, my God.

306
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,910
Please come with me

307
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,910
and stand right there.

Heart rate's back to 65.

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,770
Pressure's 115 over 60.

321
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,230
All right, let's get

322
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,230
him up to the cath lab.

323
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,860
Based on his EKG,

324
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,860
he's gonna need a bypass.

325
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,900
DORIS: Okay, let's go.

326
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,900
Watch the lines.

327
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,910
Wait. Did you say

328
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,910
he needs a bypass?

329
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,350
Yes, ma'am.

330
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,350
We got your

331
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,350
husband's rhythm back,

332
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,910
but he's still not

333
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,910
out of the woods.

334
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,420
We need to find the blockage

335
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,420
that caused his heart attack.

336
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,250
Then most likely,

337
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,250
we'll graft new

338
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,250
vessels on around it.

339
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,350
But that means going on

340
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,350
a heart-lung machine, right?

341
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,360
Yes, it does.

342
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,360
Then I'll have to refuse.

343
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,420
Refuse? What?

344
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,060
My husband can't

345
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,060
have any surgery

346
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,690

hallucinating again.

I'm gonna

357
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,140
increase your sedatives.

I don't want sedatives.

How many times I

361
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,170
gotta tell you that?

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,110
I need a drink.

You know I can't do that.

365
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,020
Then get the hell

366
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,020
out of here!

368
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,590
have I known you? Years.

370
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,360
you are sicker.

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,830
One of these times,

372
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,830
you're gonna be

373
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,830

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,500
But you don't listen.

389
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm gonna

390
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,660
increase your sedatives.

391
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,970
I'm gonna get you

392
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,970
a clean blanket.

393
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,140
I don't need

394
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,140
a clean blanket.

395
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,080
I need a drink.

396
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,920
Because you're killing

397
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,920
me with all your help!

398
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,100
Frank, we respect

399
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,100
your beliefs. We do.

400
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,860
But the fact is,

401
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,860
you're going to have

402
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,860
another heart attack.

403
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,920
The only question is when.

404
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,370
You paged me?

405
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,000
This is Dr. Downey, our top

406
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,000
cardio-thoracic surgeon.

407
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,440
I was just explaining

408
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,440
to the McCormicks

409
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,440
that, unfortunately,

410
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,600
surgery is the only

411
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,600
option that we have left.

412
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,010
And I was explaining

413
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,010
that we need an alternative

414
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,010
that doesn't involve

415
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,010
the administration of blood.

416
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,050
It is his own blood.

417
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,350
It's recirculated.

418
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,710
Blood contains

419
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,710
the gift of life.

420
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,980
Once it leaves the body,

421
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,980
it's contaminated forever.

422
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,610
I know you think

423
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,610
we're being difficult.

424
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,720
But this isn't

425
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,720
just about the danger

426
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,720
that Frank's body

427
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,720
is in right now.

428
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,730
It's about he and I

429
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,730
being able to spend

430
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,730
eternity together.

431
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,320
We understand, but...

432
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,990
What about bloodless surgery?

433
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,130
What's that?

434
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,000
It's where we

435
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,000
do it off-pump.

436
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,160
Operate on the heart

437
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,160
while it's still beating.

438
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,840
You can do that?

439
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,040
Yes.

440
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,040
Though it comes

441
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,040
with significant risks.

442
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,310
For the McCormicks,

443
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,310
the heart-lung

444
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,310
machine is a risk.

445
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,280
Stopping the heart,

446
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,280
removing the blood

447
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,280
to oxygenate it,

448
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,950
and putting it back

449
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,950
violates their faith.

450
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,250
So let's do it

451
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,250
without the machine.

452
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,020
Excuse us for a moment.

453
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,770
He's got bad

454
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,770
three-vessel disease.

455
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,770
He is a terrible candidate.

456
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,310
It's too high of a risk.

457
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,910
Higher than not

458
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,910
doing anything at all?

459
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,810
Let's at least

460
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,810
give them some time

461
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,780
to see if they wanna

462
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,780
choose the safer option.

463
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,350
We don't wanna wait.

464
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,350
We wanna do

465
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,350
the bloodless surgery.

466
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,910
Okay.

467
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,150
I'll inform the OR.

468
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,760
Please.

469
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,760
This is a lot of... Please.

470
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,370
You need to up his benzos.

471
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,940
I already did. Twice.

472
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,760
Then give him

473
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,760
a milligram of Haldol, too.

474
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,010
I'll tell you,

475
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,010
when I was a clinical nurse,

476
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,010
I used to dread DT patients.

477
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,580
I know. Such misery.

478
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,940
And most of the time,

479
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,940
they're back

480
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,510
in two months to do

481
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,510
it all over again.

482
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,510
MAGGIE: Mmm-hmm.

483
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,620
I lost my

484
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,620
wedding ring recently.

485
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,620
Didn't find it for three days.

486
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,850
What did Bert say?

487
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,020
You know, he didn't

488
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,020
say anything, which was weird

489
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,720
because he's

490
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,720
usually so observant.

491
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,520
Excuse me. Daniel.

492
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,360
What are you doing tonight?

493
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,760
Working. Why?

494
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,240
Well, an old friend

495
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,240
of Bert's and mine

496
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,240
has moved to town,

497
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,140
and I thought we

498
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,140
could all go to dinner.

499
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,210
You know,

500
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,210
sounds like a blast,

501
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,210
but I really am slammed.

502
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,700
Oh, come on, Daniel.

503
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,700
Bert's been so grumpy lately,

504
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,010
and he always cheers up

505
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,010
when he talks to you.

506
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,140
What's going on?

507
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,910
It's a long story,

508
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,910
but you'd really

509
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,910
be helping me out.

510
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,620
Besides, Maribel loves

511
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,620
scotch and ballroom dancing.

512
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,750
You haven't been

513
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,750
out in a while.

514
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,120
You know,

515
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,120
there's a reason for that.

516
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,120
There's this new study out.

517
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,890
Says dating can

518
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,890
lead to marriage.

519
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,730
It's just a friendly dinner.

520
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,860
Yeah. And I'm still paying

521
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,860
two and a half alimonies.

522
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,800
So these friendly

523
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,800
dinners can get expensive.

524
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,330
Ms. Reese, any word

525
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,330
on that nursing home patient?

526
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,740
Actually, there is.

527
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,740
Daniel.

528
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,470
I gotta go. Thank you

529
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,470
so much for the invite.

530
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,270
Best to Bert.

531
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,270
We'll do it next time.

532
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,740
So the good news is,

533
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,740
Ms. Wechsler's

534
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,440
doing much better

535
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,440
after some fluids.

536
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,710
She's awake and alert.

537
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,910
That is good news.

538
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,910
Yes.

539
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,540
Though she does

540
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,540
still have a fever

541
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,240
and is reporting

542
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,240
lower abdominal pain.

543
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,880
Fluids and scans?

544
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,880
All negative.

545
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,650
Except for a slightly

546
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,650
elevated white count,

547
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,750
but I'm already doing

548
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,750
an infectious workup now.

549
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,060
Sounds like a great plan.

550
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,060
What's the bad news?

551
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,690
This is Wanda Stern.

552
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,570
In from the same

553
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,570
nursing home.

554
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,730
She has a 101 fever

555
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,500
and feels Nixon is

556
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,500
just what this country

557
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,500
needs to run out the commies.

558
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,840
Fluids and labs?

559
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,100
Fluids and labs.

560
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,650
Hey.

561
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,410
I'm sorry about your ring.

562
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,080
So stupid.

563
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,080
I can't believe I lost it.

564
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,520
No, no, no. Come on.

565
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,520
These things, they happen.

566
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,030
No. Illnesses happen.

567
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,030
Bad weather happens.

568
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,830
This is on me.

569
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,630
Look, I'm on

570
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,630
all your patients.

571
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,630
So don't worry, okay?

572
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,800
Just try to take it easy.

573
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,910
(INHALES SHARPLY)

574
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,910
I feel so terrible.

575
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,110
Like I betrayed Jeff.

576
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,110
Like I didn't care enough.

577
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,080
Hey, April.

578
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,250
April.

579
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,830
What's in the bag?

580
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,830
Nothing. It's

581
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,830
a personal item.

582
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,600
Is that a bottle of booze?

583
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,420
(SIGHS)

584
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,570
You were gonna give

585
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,570
that to Mr. Gleason?

586
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,230
My nursing supervisor

587
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,230
did it all the time.

588
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,840
April, it's against protocol.

589
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,540
Since when do you

590
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,540
care about that?

591
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,870
I care about getting

592
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,870
our patient through this.

593
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,280
Does he look like he's

594
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,280
getting through this?

595
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,480
He needs a drink.

596
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,750
I didn't say

597
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,750
it would be easy.

598
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,450
But that?

599
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,450
That's just a Band-Aid.

600
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,490
I come in here

601
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,490
every day and I put

602
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,490
Band-Aids on patients,

603
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,760
and most of them

604
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,760
thank me for it.

605
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,160
And he may thank you.

606
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,290
But you're not helping him.

607
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,760
And you are?

608
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,930
Standing around while

609
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,930
he dies in front of us?

610
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,470
This man has

611
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,470
a chance to get past

612
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,940
his problem and

613
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,940
make a new start.

614
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,630
He's telling us that

615
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,630
he doesn't want that.

616
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,670
It's up to us to listen.

617
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,670
No, no, no, no.

618
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,800
It's not my job to listen.

619
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,800
I'm a doctor.

620
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,910
It's my job to decide

621
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,910
what is best for him.

622
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,110
That is exactly

623
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,110
why I'm a nurse.

624
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,950
Hey. Uh, Frank McCormick

625
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,950
is going into surgery.

626
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,930
I need you to load his

627
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,930
angio into the system.

628
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,400
You Dr. Rhodes?

629
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,400
Uh, yep.

630
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,000
Should be up now.

631
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,280
Yeah, thanks.

632
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,030
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

633
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,190
No luck yet, huh?

634
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,190
Not yet.

635
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,990
But we haven't even

636
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,990
gone through the trash.

637
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,090
Are you okay?

638
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,430
Yeah. Uh...

(CLEARS THROAT)

640
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,570
My head is spinning.

641
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,570
I feel like I'm

642
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,570
gonna throw up.

643
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,610
Oh, Maggie.

644
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,040
Natalie, I'm gonna

645
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,040
find your ring.

646
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,580
But in the meantime,

647
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,580
I want you to go in there,

648
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,380
have a drink of

649
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,380
water and lie down.

650
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,910
Okay? All right.

651
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,910
Mmm-hmm.

652
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,820

00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,280
Natalie.

654
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,460
I don't know why you guys

655
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,460
are ordering all these tests.

656
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,700
I'm anemic.

657
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,700
It was nothing.

658
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,490
Well, that's not

659
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,490
what the EKG's saying.

660
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,100
I'm seeing

661
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,100
elevated ST segments

00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,570

Where?

Tell echo we're

666
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,900
bringing her upstairs.

667
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,600

no cardiac history,

no risk factors.

00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,010
You guys are just being

671
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,010
overly cautious

672
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,010
because it's me.

Nat, darn right

674
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,980
that's what we're doing.

Stop being stubborn

676
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,620
and listen to the man.

677
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,620
Please?

678
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,780
Let's go.

Ugh!

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,060
On Wednesdays,

681
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,060
I go downstairs

682
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,060
to the beauty shop.

683
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,620
And my neighbor,

she always does my hair.

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,350
Okay.

686
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,590
How about the card room?

687
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,590
I play a lot of canasta.

688
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,260
In the south lobby?

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,900
No, darling. In the north.

690
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,030
Oh.

691
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,140
How we doing, ladies?

692
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,140
Any luck?

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,700
Wanda here is lovely.

694
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,800
And though I

695
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,800
appreciate your theory

696
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,780
that our conditions

697
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,780
may arise from

698
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,780
the same source,

699
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm afraid the only thing

700
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,440
we have in common

701
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,440
is Sinai Gardens.

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,980
Ah.

703
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,650
Ms. Reese, could I

704
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,650
talk to you for a moment?

705
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,080
Keep at it.

707
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,770
Their labs are all negative.

708
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,770
They both are febrile

709
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,770
with leukocytosis.

710
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,170
And infections in

711
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,170
the elderly can present

712
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,170
quite differently than normal.

713
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,110
I think we need to

714
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,110
start looking for zebras.

715
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,500
Rickettsia.

716
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,500
Leptospirosis.

717
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,440
Ms. Stern has a

718
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,440
redness in her left eye.

719
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,440
Did you notice that?

720
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,540
Probably from

721
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,540
the chlorine in the pool.

722
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,910

723
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,910
water aerobics.

724
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,650

in an 85-year-old,

731
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,280
it could be anything.

If these women were

733
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,490
closer to you in age,

734
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,490
what might you suspect?

No, no, no. No.

00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,100
Why not?

739
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,870
No, because

740
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,870
they're old ladies.

Are you trying to tell me

743
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,340
that because they're old,

744
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,280
they can no longer

745
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,280
be sexually active?

746
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,610
Oh, come on,

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,610
they barely have the energy

748
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,620
to play canasta,

00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,620
whatever that is.

something in common

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,100
after all.

778

dilated and tortured.

779
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,990
But why is this all

780
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,990
happening right now?

781
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,860

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,000
All right. Tube.

on the vessels is enough

825
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,390
to staunch the bleeding.

826
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,620

I've been saying.

971
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,690
I'm sorry. One last thing.

972
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,780
Mmm-hmm.

973
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,760
Do you know where

974
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,760
Jeff got my ring?

975
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,820
Well, not right offhand,

976
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,430
but I can look that up.

977
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,730
Please.

978
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,760
You're not thinking about

979
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,760
replacing the ring, are you?

980
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,230
Yes, I am.

981
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,080
Do you really think

982
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,080
that's a good idea?

983
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,010
Why wouldn't it be?

984
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,880
Natalie.

985
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,880
I know you love Jeff,

986
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,880
Jeff loved you,

987
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,720
but maybe losing

988
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,720
the ring is a sign.

989
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,190
A sign?

990
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,620
Natalie.

991
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,060
What do they call this?

992
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,190
Broken-heart syndrome.

993
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,900
Your grieving is so great

994
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,310
that it has put you

995
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,310
in a hospital bed,

996
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,210
and it's keeping

997
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,210
you from coming home

998
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,210
to see your son.

999
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,380
So maybe you just...

1000
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,610
You need to let

1001
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,610
go a little bit.

1002
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,440
How could you say that?

1003
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,440
I will never let go of Jeff.

1004
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,010
I don't mean let go of him.

1005
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,380
Just

1006
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,820
move forward.

(SOBBING)

1008
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,720
You just...

1009
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,740
You call me

1010
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,740
and let me know if you

1011
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,740
need anything from home.

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,540
The clap?

1013
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,610
Yikes.

1014
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,190
Have Rose and Wanda

1015
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,190
been told?

1016
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,350
How did they take it?

1017
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,580
You'd have to ask them.

1018
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,550
Mr. Glickman,

1019
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,550
partner notification

1020
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,720
is an important part

1021
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,720
of gonorrhea treatment.

1022
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,790
And while,

1023
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,790
we really don't

1024
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,790
wanna be intrusive...

1025
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,330
A gentleman never tells.

1026
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,190
But if there are others,

1027
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,190
they should be informed.

1028
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,270
There's Cookie.

1029
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,200
Beautiful blue eyes.

1030
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,400
Cookie?

1031
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,600
Sylvia. Marvelous

1032

sense of humor.

1033
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,150
So you're sleeping

1034
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,150
with four different women?

1035
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,410
Ms. Reese.

1036
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,470
You make it sound tawdry.

1037
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,240
It's not like that.

1038
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,820
At our age,

1039
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,820
there are very few men left.

1040
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,850
And people

1041
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,850
need companionship.

1042
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,720
I make them happy.

1043
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,720
They make me happy.

1044
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,730
And I love them.

1045
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,730
All of them.

1046
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,430
All of them.

1047
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,270
I think of it as

1048
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,270
assisted loving.

1049
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,770
We'll get you

1050
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,770
a shot of Ceftriaxone

1051
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,770
and Azithromycin.

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,030

1058
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,380
this back to you.

What do you mean?

1060
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,820
Made such a racket,

1061
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,820
wouldn't let him

1062
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,820
get any sleep.

1063
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,190
Said he's gonna

1064
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,190
get a gerbil.

Hey, what am I

1069
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,630
supposed to do with it?

1070
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,630
I don't know. Put him

1071
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,630
in the Doctors' Lounge.

I was so scared.

Told you it'd be all right.

It was his will.

These doctors.

1083
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,880
Maybe you should do

1084
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,880

1087
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,790
You should know

1088
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,790
that there were

1089
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,760
complications

1090
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,760
with the surgery.

1091
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,460
What kind of complications?

1092
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,940
We had to use

1093
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,940
the bypass machine after all.

1094
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,440
I thought we made

1095
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,440
our wishes clear.

1096
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,950
Did they tell you

1097
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,950
they were doing this?

1098
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,070
They did.

1099
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,120
And you gave them

1100
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,120
your permission?

1101
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,510
How can you do this to me?

They can accept all

the fractions of blood,

1120
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,270
but they can't accept

1121
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,270
them all together.

1122
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,830
Does that make

1123
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,830
any sense to you?

1124
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,470
It doesn't have to

1125
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,470
make sense to us.

1126
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,170
If he believed he

1127
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,170
would live longer

1128
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,110
if his wounds were

1129
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,110
dressed in green bandages,

1130
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,280
then we give him

1131
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,280
green bandages.

1132
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,820
Not if the green bandages

1133
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,820
are going to kill him.

1134
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,860
Yeah! Even if it

1135
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,860
kills him.

David.

1137
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,260
Do you really believe that?

1138
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,990
Or is this just

1139
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,990
because this is the day

1140
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,930
that your liver is

1141
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,930
going to be ablated?

on the board in IR.

1147
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,970
and reduce it again.

1148
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,440
In fact, I should

1149
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,440
mosey down there.

1150
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,070

But saving a life

1153
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,010
isn't always the answer.

1154
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,110
And you will never

1155
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,110
be a great surgeon

1156
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,650
until you understand that.

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,980
stuck to the hem

1162
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,980
of a fitted sheet.

1163
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,420
That's why you

1164
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,420
quadruple check, right?

1165
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,550
Thank you, Maggie.

1166
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,390
I thought it was

1167
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,390
gone for good.

1168
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,730
Well, now it's back.

1169
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,610
CLYDE: We're gonna beat

1170
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,610
them to the finish line.

1171
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,740
Here it comes.

1172
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,740
Hold on tight. Up we go.

1173
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,510
And thank you very much.

1174
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,950
Thank you again

1175
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,950
for all your help.

1176
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,560
Ms. Wechsler,

1177
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,560
can I ask you something?

1178
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,160
Sure.

1179
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,360
(EXHALES)

1180
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,900
You're a strong,

1181
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,900
successful woman.

1182
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,730
You flew jets.

1183
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,770
Aren't you angry with him?

1184
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,380
I tell you, Ms. Reese,

1185
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,680
some men spend

1186
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,680
their whole lives

1187
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,680
with women

1188
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,790
but never bother to learn

1189
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,790
what pleases them.

1190
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,750
Clyde learned.

1191
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,850
Let's go, Rosebud.

1192
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,230
Before this thing

1193
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,230
turns back into a pumpkin.

1194
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,230
Thank you very much.

1195
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,330
We're going flying.

1196
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,780
He seems like

1197
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,780
a nice enough guy,

1198
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,550
but no one is worth lying,

1199
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,550
cheating or disease.

1200
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,250
Where you getting

1201
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,250
lying and cheating?

1202
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,290
You heard what he said.

1203
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,290
Didn't hear that.

1204
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,120
This looks like

1205
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,120
more of an open

1206
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,120
relationship to me.

1207
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,630
Well, you would

1208
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,630
think by their age,

1209
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,630
they'd be past that.

1210
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,100
Past wanting

1211
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,100
physical intimacy?

1212
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,370
If my boyfriend

1213
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,370
ever suggested

1214
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,370
an open relationship,

1215
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,770
I'd kill him.

1216
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,600
Huh.

1217
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,310
You might be

1218
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,310
surprised how things

1219
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,220
you once thought

1220
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,220
were so important

1221
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,690
become less so

1222
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,690
when you get older.

1223
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,150
My life has

1224
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,150
definitely become

1225
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,250
bigger, messier,

1226
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,250
far more interesting than

1227
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,250
I ever thought it could,

1228
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,370
when I was younger.

1229
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,500
And you know what?

1230
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,500
It hasn't always

1231
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,500
been such a bad thing.

1232
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,840
Well, I'm not that young.

1233
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,900
I'm almost 26.

1234
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,360
So, you know,

1235
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,360
I was thinking, if you guys,

1236
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,360
you know, your friend,

1237
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,200
are still going

1238
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,200
out to dinner,

1239
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,200
I wouldn't be opposed.

1240
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,600
Great.

1241
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,600
You changed your mind.

1242
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah. Got hungry.

1243
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,470
Well, not too hungry, I hope.

1244
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,470
My friend's a vegan.

1245
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,840
A vegan? And you're

1246
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,840
telling me now?

1247
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,940
That's curious.

1248
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,070
The important thing is,

1249
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,070
it'll make Bert happy.

1250
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,050
You know I live to serve.

1251
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,860
Pair of jeans.

1252
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,860
I paid for it.

1253
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,630
How much?

1254
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,630
(LAUGHING)

1255
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,700
Mr. Gleason seems

1256
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,700
much improved.

1257
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,170
Yeah.

1258
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,400
When did his

1259
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,400
tremors subside?

1260
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,000
Uh, about 20 minutes ago.

1261
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,540
And no more hallucinations?

1262
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,840
DORIS: Mmm-mmm.

1263
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,280
Did we up his benzos?

1264
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,110
No. Why?

1265
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,610
Nurse Sexton.

1266
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,530
Pretty miraculous turnaround

1267
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,530
for our frequent flyer,

1268
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,530
don't you think?

1269
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,690
It looks like he'll

1270
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,690
pull through, yeah.

1271
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,130
Did you give him a drink?

1272
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,760
No.

1273
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,100
Well, someone did,

1274
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,100
so who was it?

1275
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,940
Goodwin?

1276
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,140
I guess, once a nurse,

1277
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,140
always a nurse.

1278
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,460
Excuse me. A word please.

1279
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,090
Sure.

1280
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,260
You gave Mr. Gleason

1281
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,260
a drink?

1282
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,610
He was likely going

1283
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,610
to die without one.

1284
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,610
I've seen it happen.

1285
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,610
So it doesn't matter

1286
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,610
if that was against

1287
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,610
hospital policy?

1288
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,370
Because I'm pretty

1289
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,370
sure if that were me,

1290
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,240
I'd be raked over the coals

1291
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,240
right now by you.

1292
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,310
Damned if you do

1293
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,310
and damned if you don't.

1294
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,820
I admit it's a bit

1295
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,820
of a double standard.

1296
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,940
What can I say?

1297
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,180
This patient...

1298
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,420
He had a chance to

1299
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,420
kick his addiction.

1300
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,420
Now it's gone.

1301
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,420
Dr. Halstead,

1302
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,420
an addict doesn't

1303
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,420
just kick a habit.

1304
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,230
He's gotta want to quit.

1305
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,230
And right now, he doesn't.

1306
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,170
Listen, you can't

1307
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,170
force a person to move on

1308
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,140
from something

1309
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,140
if they're not ready.

1310
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,400
You know, they found

1311
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,400
Dr. Manning's ring.

1312
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,240
You wanna come up

1313
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,240
with me to see her?

1314
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,080
I'll be up a little later.

1316
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,620
of breath?

1317
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,730
Mr. McCormick.

1318
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,930
I am sorry.

1319
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,600
We were just trying to deal

1320
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,600
with the circumstances...

1321
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,740
The best you could. I know.

1322
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,950
Do you even think

1323
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,950
about God's will

1324
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,950
or just your own?

1325
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,320
You familiar with

1326
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,120
Peter 5:2?

1327
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,620
"Be a shepherd to the flock

1328
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,620
that is under your care,

1329
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,620
watch over them.

1330
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,660
"Not for what

1331
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,660
you'll get out of it

1332
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,060
"but because you are

1333
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,060
eager to serve God."

1334
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,240
You entrusted me to

1335
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,240
watch over not just

1336
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,240
your body but your soul.

1337
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,240
You're alive.

1338
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,050
Because I couldn't

1339
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,050
imagine life without you.

1340
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,720
I misplaced my faith.

1341
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,160
Today, I didn't serve God.

1342
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,230
But I have to believe

1343
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,230
that a God of love

1344
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,700
is also a God

1345
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,700
of forgiveness.
