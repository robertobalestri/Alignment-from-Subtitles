1
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,330
Okay.

2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,360
You are really gonna

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,360
love these.

4
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,990
New patient

5
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,990
satisfaction forms.

6
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,160
Oh, damn.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,030
"On a scale of zero to 10,

8
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,170
"did the nurses treat you

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,170
with courtesy and respect?"

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,900
"Did the doctors

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,900
explain things

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,780
"in a way

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,780
you could understand?"

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,010
Good morning.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,010
Morning.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,280
Morning, Dr. Choi.

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,510
Every patient should be asked

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,510
if they'd like to fill

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,510
one out.

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,520
Just what we need,

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,520
more paperwork.

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,740
Incoming!

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,190
All attending,

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,190
to the ED, stat.

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,320
What've we got?

26
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,620
Found her in a coffee shop,

27
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,620
unresponsive after

28
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,620
a fainting episode.

29
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,790
Initial GCS of five,

30
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,790
but improved to a 10 en route.

31
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,230
Let's go to Treatment Five.

32
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,230
BP?

33
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,700
94 over 60, heart rate 144.

34
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,430
Afib with RVR on the monitor.

35
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,940
We gave her five milligrams of

36
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,940
diltiazem three minutes ago.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,440
All right, gross deformity

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,440
to the left wrist

39
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,770
and a pretty good lac

40
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,770
on her forehead.

41
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
On me.

42
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,670
One, two, three.

43
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,770
Transfer.

44
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,070
Chemo patient?

45
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,170
Looks that way.

46
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,340
All right,

47
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,340
let's get her on the monitors.

48
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,640
You got it.

49
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,640
EKG and labs.

50
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,240
CBC, CMP, and ABG.

51
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,150
Yes, Dr. Halstead.

52
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,150
She's got a broken wrist,

53
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,150
Colles fracture.

54
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,380
Can you tell me

55
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,380
how this happened?

56
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,120
She's still in rapid Afib.

57
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,720
April,

58
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,720
10 milligrams of Dilt, stat.

59
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,280
Ma'am,

60
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,280
can you hear me?

61
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,620
Can you tell me your name?

62
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,520
Start her on a drip.

63
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,090
Titrate it

64
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,090
to get her heart rate down.

65
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,600
Dilt is in.

66
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,940
Heart rate's coming down,

67
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,940
110, 106...

68
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,340
Do we have an ID?

69
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,810
Find any family?

70
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,180
Right here.

71
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,450
I'm her husband. Sal Baker.

72
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,510
Any idea what happened to her?

73
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,610
No.

74
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,160
I mean,

75
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,160
Jen just went for a walk,

76
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,850
and said she was getting us

77
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,850
all breakfast.

78
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,420
Is Mommy okay?

79
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,720
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

80
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,490
Just wait right here.

81
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,490
All right, Bailey?

82
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,050
Can we talk for a minute?

83
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,050
Sure.

84
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,070
My wife has

85
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,070
end-stage lymphoma.

86
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,470
All right?

87
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,200
I have power of attorney,

88
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,140
so, I need to instruct you

89
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,140
that if she starts

90
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,140
to die again,

91
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,970
per her wishes,

92
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,310
that you do not

93
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,310
resuscitate her.

94
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,520
Mrs. Baker?

95
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,760
I'm Dr. Halstead.

96
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,230
And this is my colleague,

97
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,230
Dr. Manning.

98
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,160
Hi, how are you feeling?

99
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,330
Okay.

100
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,030
Your husband said you have

101
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,030
non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

102
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,600
Yes. Diagnosed

103
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,600
four years ago now.

104
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,780
Okay, your husband also said

105
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,780
that you have

106
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,780
a do not resuscitate in place.

107
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,310
That's right.

108
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,300
What course of treatment

109
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,300
have you taken?

110
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,420
Everything.

111
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,610
Actually we've learned to

112
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,610
keep her records with us,

113
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,610
just in case.

114
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,250
Thank you.

115
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,250
Yeah.

116
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,620
We'd like to admit you,

117
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,990
and to wean you off

118
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,990
the IV meds that are

119
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,390
controlling

120
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,390
your heart rate...

121
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,900
I'm sorry,

122
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,900
Dr. Halstead,

123
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,900
but absolutely not.

124
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,060
I won't be admitted.

125
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,360
Well,

126
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,360
just until you're stable.

127
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,360
You're still in Afib.

128
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,730
I know you mean well.

129
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,570
But I'd rather go home

130
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,570
with my family.

131
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,540
We understand,

132
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,540
but we need to set your arm,

133
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,070
close up that cut,

134
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,070
and get your rhythm

135
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,070
under control.

136
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,580
All right.

137
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,270
But do it down here.

138
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,540
I feel like

139
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,540
once I go upstairs,

140
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,540
I'll never leave.

141
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,340
Okay.

142
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,510
We'll do our best

143
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,510
to keep you down here.

144
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,490
Thank you.

145
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,620
Talk to me.

146
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,130
Fourteen-year-old boy,

147
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,130
three penetrating wounds,

148
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,560
two in the chest,

149
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,560
one in the abdomen.

150
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,430
GCS of 10.

151
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,430
Go to Trauma Three.

152
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,700
Hypotensive since we got him.

153
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,700
IO in his left leg.

154
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,670
500 mils of saline given,

155
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,670
but his pressure's

156
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,670
still crappy.

157
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,070
This kid get stabbed?

158
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,070
No.

159
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,730
Jumped the fence

160
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,730
at a construction site.

161
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,540
He impaled himself

162
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,540
on some rebar.

163
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,670
Jeeze.

164
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,780
Okay. Ready?

165
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,780
On my count, one, two, three.

166
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,340
Yeah, we got it from here.

167
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,340
Thank you.

168
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,540
April, keep bagging.

169
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,350
Reese, put in a groin line.

170
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,350
Yes, sir.

171
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,480
Stat trauma labs.

172
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,480
And bring in

173
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,480
the level-one transfuser.

174
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,550
Mmm-hmm.

175
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,430
Suture kit's ready.

176
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,230
Okay.

177
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,870
Line's in.

178
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,430
Fast. Good job.

179
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,440
We got to tube this kid,

180
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,440
quick. Think you can do it?

181
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,700
Yes.

182
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,340
Let's hang

183
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,340
another leader.

184
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,810
Dr. Choi,

185
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,810
Treatment One, stat.

186
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,110
What do we know?

187
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,240
Olivia Gray,

188
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,240
math professor,

189
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,440
found unconscious

190
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,440
at her desk at work.

191
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,210
Blood sugar normal,

192
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,210
sinus tach on monitor,

193
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,210
no external signs of trauma.

194
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,190
Still unresponsive.

195
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,190
Looks like she's had

196
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,190
a seizure.

197
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,690
Let's get an EKG, labs, trops

198
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,690
and an ABG just in case.

199
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,450
Put her on oxygen.

200
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,450
Right.

201
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,190
Professor Gray,

202
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,190
can you hear me?

203
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,130
Lungs are really coarse,

204
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,130
grab the ultrasound.

205
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,190
Call cardio for an echo,

206
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,190
order a CT head.

207
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,640
Just lost the pulse.

208
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,760
Milligram of epi.

209
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,760
Chest tray,

210
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,760
we're gonna open him up.

211
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,970
Reese, on it.

212
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,970
Okay.

213
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,940
Doyen scissors.

214
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,480
Still no pulse.

215
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,990
Spreaders.

216
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,990
Here, Doctor.

217
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,360
Crash cart is charged.

218
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,730
There's a hole

219
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,730
in the right ventricle.

220
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,870
Skin stapler.

221
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,870
Stapler.

222
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,590
All right.

223
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,590
He's got a rhythm back.

224
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,620
We need a

225
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,620
cardiothoracic surgeon

226
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,620
to help with this.

227
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,050
Call the OR,

228
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,050
tell them we're on our way

229
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,050
up with an open chest.

230
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,990
Let's go.

231
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,990
Got it.

232
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,200
Getting pretty good in there.

233
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,740
Queen of the groin line.

234
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,270
Hey, you two.

235
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,030
Come on, gather around!

236
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,030
Gather around!

237
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,370
New

238
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,370
patient satisfaction forms.

239
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,680
You need to get every patient

240
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,680
who's been treated

241
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,680
to fill this out.

242
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,550
Wait for it, it gets better,

243
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,880
we have

244
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,880
a P and P in Isolation.

245
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,150
Oh, yeah!

246
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,350
What's a P and P?

247
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,220
Oh!

248
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,220
Reese should do it.

249
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,420
Yeah.

250
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,760
She's gotta learn.

251
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,760
Yeah.

252
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,230
Give it to Reese.

253
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,660
Let's go.

254
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,060
P and P,

255
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,060
pediculosis and phthiriasis.

256
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,200
Lice infestation?

257
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,240
Among other things.

258
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,650
What exactly do I do?

259
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,810
First, gown up.

260
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,910
You strip him,

261
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,910
scrub him three times,

262
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,510
then put permethrin

263
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,510
over every millimeter

264
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,510
of his body.

265
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,820
Welcome to my world.

266
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,820
Okay.

267
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,630
Don't worry, I'll help.

268
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,530
Thank you.

269
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,030
Jennifer Baker,

270
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,030
cancer patient,

271
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,030
where're we at with her?

272
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,550
Her arm is set, and she's back

273
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,550
in normal sinus rhythm.

274
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,710
I'm actually looking

275
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,710
at her history right now.

276
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,840
And?

277
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,050
And she's been through hell

278
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,050
the past few years.

279
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,920
Yeah, but a DNR?

280
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,680
Is she considering her family?

281
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,560
At this point, she may

282
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,560
think it's the best thing.

283
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,100
I don't know.

284
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,090
Zoe.

285
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,400
Dr. Halstead.

286
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,400
Good morning.

287
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,700
I know I was supposed to

288
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,700
call you back, I should've.

289
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,870
I'm sorry.

290
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,570
I understand.

291
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,570
You're busy.

292
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,470
Hey, S and B has an

293
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,470
outstanding new asthma drug.

294
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,340
Would you care

295
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,340
for some chew samples?

296
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,340
No, thanks.

297
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,550
Listen, I read a prospectus

298
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,550
on a clinical trial

299
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,550
you're doing.

300
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,590
For non-Hodgkins lymphoma,

301
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,590
a radio immunotherapy drug.

302
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,630
Veltarmomab.

303
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,630
Very promising.

304
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,890
That's the one.

305
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,660
Listen, I've got this patient,

306
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,660
she's tried everything,

307
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,660
nothing's worked.

308
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,720
I'm pretty sure

309
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,720
she fits the profile

310
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,720
for your study.

311
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,530
I'm sorry,

312
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,530
but the trial is closed.

313
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,530
It's full.

314
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,940
Zoe, this woman is end-stage.

315
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,940
She's got a kid.

316
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,070
I'm looking for anything

317
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,070
to give her more time.

318
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,510
I get it, but...

319
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,510
It's not a...

320
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,510
Just try.

321
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,770
Please.

322
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,880
Let me make a call

323
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,880
to our medical director.

324
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,920
No promises, though.

325
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,680
Thanks.

326
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,450
Her labs are back.

327
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,050
Electrolytes are way off,

328
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,050
BUN and creatinine sky high.

329
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,860
She's uremic.

330
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,860
Kidney failure?

331
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,730
Yeah. But it doesn't

332
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,730
make sense.

333
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,530
A woman this young.

334
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,530
I don't get it.

335
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,900
Call the renal service,

336
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,310
she needs to be admitted to

337
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,310
the MICU for dialysis.

338
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,470
Okay.

339
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,170
Staple across the hole

340
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,170
in the stomach, and then

341
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,170
we'll run the bowel.

342
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,620
TA 55 blue stapler.

343
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,920
Stapler.

344
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,880
Dr. Zanetti. Dr. Rhodes.

345
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,730
Dr. Downey.

346
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,730
I thought they were sending

347
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,730
a resident.

348
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,920
Had a window

349
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,920
before my next surgery.

350
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,920
You don't mind?

351
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,330
No.

352
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,330
This kid just caught

353
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,330
some good luck.

354
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,100
Who butchered him?

355
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,000
Fell off some scaffolding.

356
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,270
I meant the cracked chest.

357
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,830
Yeah, that was me.

358
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,830
Hmm.

359
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,100
Can we get to work

360
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,100
on the heart?

361
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,100
How's the gut?

362
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,580
Just had to fix a hole

363
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,580
in the stomach but we're done.

364
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,480
Give the 5000 heparin.

365
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,480
Yes, Dr. Downey.

366
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,780
Get a 60 Prolene

367
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,780
with pledgets loaded up.

368
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,080
Rhodes, change your gloves.

369
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,550
I want you

370
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,550
to help me up here.

371
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,880
He's about to

372
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,880
close the abdomen.

373
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,620
I'll assist.

374
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,620
You close.

375
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,690
Rhodes, I want you to

376
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,690
fix the ventricle.

377
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,550
Well, Dr. Zanetti really

378
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,550
has more experience...

379
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,620
You made this mess,

380
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,620
you clean it up.

381
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,000
Unless

382
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,000
you don't feel up to it.

383
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,660
Right.

384
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,180
Not too deep with the needle.

385
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,850
You hit the AV node,

386
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,850
you're gonna have to

387
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,850
explain to the parents

388
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,690
why their son

389
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,690
needs a pacemaker

390
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,690
for the rest of his life.

391
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,430
Let me see the repair.

392
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,030
That works.

393
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,640
Close up the chest when

394
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,640
you're done with the abdomen,

395
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,640
will you?

396
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,430
Yes, Dr. Downey.

397
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,810
You don't have any tremor.

398
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,680
Even for a young guy,

399
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,680
that's pretty good.

400
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,020
Not that I'm jealous

401
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,020
or anything,

402
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,920
but you just received

403
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,920
high praise from David Downey.

404
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,220
Why did he have me

405
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,220
do the heart?

406
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,890
I am asking myself

407
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,890
the same question.

408
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,060
Sorry to cause you

409
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,060
so much trouble.

410
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,000
That's all right, sir.

411
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,000
After you bag the clothes,

412
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,000
take them in for analysis.

413
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,600
Guess I let things

414
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,600
get out of hand.

415
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,010
Hard to keep clean.

416
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,700
Pants too, please.

417
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,140
Where do you live?

418
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,540
Lots of places.

419
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,520
In the winter, Lower Wacker,

420
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,520
by the heat vents.

421
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,820
Why not a shelter?

422
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,790
Don't like 'em.

423
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,390
Too many rules.

424
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,700
What about my skivvies?

425
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,130
Those, too.

426
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,380
Dr. Halstead.

427
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,370
Yeah.

428
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,140
I just spoke

429
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,140
to the medical director.

430
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,690
He's going to

431
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,690
let your patient

432
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,690
into the trial.

433
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,410
Oh, that is great.

434
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
You might've

435
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
just saved her life.

436
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,580
Thank you, Zoe.

437
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,020
Sure.

438
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,000
There you go.

439
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,770
Mrs. Baker,

440
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,770
I have some very good news.

441
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,570
A pharmaceutical company

442
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,570
is conducting

443
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,550
a clinical trial

444
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,550
that you qualify for,

445
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,600
a new cancer drug.

446
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,770
I was able to get you in.

447
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,850
Mrs. Baker?

448
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,590
Sal,

449
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,590
can you take Bailey outside?

450
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,930
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

451
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,970
Come on, honey girl.

452
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,970
Let's go find something

453
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,970
to eat.

454
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,130
But I'm drawing.

455
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,670
All right, you can do that

456
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,670
when you come back.

457
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,830
Okay.

458
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,240
Oh, thank you.

459
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,800
The trial's oncologist

460
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,800
is gonna need to examine you.

461
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,850
I'd like to set that up

462
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,850
as soon as possible.

463
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,380
I'm sorry.

464
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,380
No more trials.

465
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,210
Mrs. Baker...

466
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,210
You know how I feel.

467
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,910
But this is very promising.

468
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,650
A new

469
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,650
radio immunotherapy drug,

470
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,350
very similar to Tositumomab,

471
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,350
which you've done before.

472
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,590
But this works by...

473
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,590
Dr. Halstead,

474
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,590
you're not listening to me.

475
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,260
I'm done.

476
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,630
I have tried everything.

477
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,230
You have nothing to lose.

478
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,630
Yes, I do.

479
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,330
The drugs make me sick

480
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,330
and weak and exhausted.

481
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,900
I throw up,

482
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,900
I'm in constant pain.

483
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,170
And my family suffers

484
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,170
as much as I do.

485
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,940
But you may react

486
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,940
differently to this.

487
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,380
It could be a game changer.

488
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,410
That's what the last

489
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,410
half dozen doctors said

490
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,410
and yet, here we are.

491
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,020
Dr. Manning?

492
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,720
I think we should

493
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,720
let Mrs. Baker rest.

494
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,630
I know you're trying to help.

495
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,530
But I can't do this anymore.

496
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,580
I want to live out

497
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,580
the rest of my life

498
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,580
with the people I love

499
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,140
and not in a hospital.

500
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,110
We understand.

501
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,850
We'll check back later.

502
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,960
Dr. Halstead?

503
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,660
Yeah,

504
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,660
thanks for the help in there.

505
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,200
What is with you?

506
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,430
Last time I checked,

507
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,430
we're supposed to be

508
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,430
saving lives.

509
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,530
She has made her wishes

510
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,530
very clear.

511
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,510
She can't just give up.

512
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,700
My mother died of cancer.

513
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,770
If she had access

514
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,770
to a drug like this,

515
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,770
she might still be alive.

516
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,590
Did you page me?

517
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,560
Yeah. I'd like you to assist.

518
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,130
The ED hasn't sent up

519
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,130
any trauma patients

520
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,130
in the last hour.

521
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,430
Isn't a trauma,

522
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,430
65-year-old woman,

523
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,430
aortic valve replacement.

524
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,240
AV replacement?

525
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,240
You want me to assist?

526
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,640
Work on your suturing

527
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,640
technique.

528
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,610
You could move

529
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,610
a little faster.

530
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,640
Dr. Downey,

531
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,640
I'm a trauma surgeon,

532
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,640
not a cardiothoracic surgeon.

533
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,350
Sewing is sewing.

534
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,680
I cleared this with Sharon.

535
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,950
Wash your hands.

536
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,950
Meet me inside.

537
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,090
Put on something nice.

538
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,500
Mr. Baker.

539
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,370
Hi, Jen's felling

540
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,370
a little nauseous,

541
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,370
so...

542
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,830
Pop usually

543
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,830
makes her feel better.

544
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,040
That clinical trial

545
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,040
I mentioned.

546
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,100
It's really worth a shot.

547
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,280
Would you talk to her?

548
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,750
Listen,

549
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,750
I know what she's gonna say.

550
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,450
All right,

551
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,450
this is off the record,

552
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,110
but I spoke

553
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,110
to the pharmaceutical rep,

554
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,820
and she told me they've had

555
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,820
some remissions,

556
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,820
total remissions.

557
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,330
Please.

558
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,530
You know, I would do anything

559
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,530
to keep my wife alive,

560
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,870
but she's had

561
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,870
so many false hopes.

562
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,470
Okay.

563
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,520
You know what, I'll try.

564
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,010
I'll try.

565
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,520
Shower felt good.

566
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,060
Hadn't had one

567
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,060
since last summer.

568
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,660
This cream will kill

569
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,660
anything we missed,

570
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,660
including eggs.

571
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,090
Yeah.

572
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,930
I'm not itching now.

573
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
Arms up, please.

574
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,010
And that should do it.

575
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,340
An orderly will take you

576
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,340
to a treatment room.

577
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,110
And we'll go find you

578
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,110
some clothes.

579
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,910
I'm afraid

580
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,910
we had to burn your old ones.

581
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,430
Dr. Choi to the ICU.

582
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,400
Your patient?

583
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,400
Yeah. What's happening?

584
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,990
Some kind of psychotic

585
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,990
episode.

586
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,670
Get away from me!

587
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,670
I have to do this! Get away!

588
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,370
Professor Gray,

589
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,370
I'm Dr. Charles,

590
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,370
I'm here to help you.

591
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,680
I can't have these tubes.

592
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,080
They're trying to escape.

593
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,640
Wait.

594
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,640
Who's trying to escape?

595
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,550
The numbers.

596
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,550
They're trying to get out.

597
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,450
So, you're pulling out

598
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,450
your catheter

599
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,450
to keep the numbers inside?

600
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,580
Okay, okay, easy, easy.

601
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,990
I need the numbers. No!

602
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,720
Easy, easy.

603
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,720
No, no, no!

604
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,350
Give it to her!

605
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,350
No, you can't!

606
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,020
You can't... No!

607
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,030
I need the numbers!

608
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,590
You cannot do...

609
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,590
I'm gonna lose 'em.

610
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,490
Olivia Gray

611
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,490
has bipolar disorder,

612
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,290
diagnosed when she was 18.

613
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,300
So we're dealing with

614
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,300
more than a medical issue.

615
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,890
She's unstable.

616
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,330
All due respect,

617
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,330
it's entirely a medical issue.

618
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,360
And she's been

619
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,360
dealing with her condition,

620
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,360
with lithium, pretty well.

621
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,410
For almost 20 years.

622
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,270
So, when we put her

623
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,270
on dialysis,

624
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,750
it allowed her kidneys

625
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,750
to rest, but it also cleared

626
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,750
the lithium from her system.

627
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,180
Right. Which sent her

628
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,180
into that manic state

629
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,180
we witnessed.

630
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,980
Olivia can't go back

631
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,980
on the lithium.

632
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,980
What are her options?

633
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,250
Hard to say.

634
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,290
You know,

635
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,290
each one of these cases...

636
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,290
Treated differently.

637
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,350
I mean,

638
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,220
her records indicate

639
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,220
she's tried Wellbutrin,

640
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,330
Prozac, Effexor.

641
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,760
Apparently

642
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,760
side effects were too severe,

643
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,760
so she stuck with lithium.

644
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,630
Well,

645
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,630
the side effects of lithium

646
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,630
can kill her.

647
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,640
At the very least,

648
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,640
she'll need a new kidney.

649
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,240
You, uh, had much experience

650
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,240
with bipolar disorder, Ethan?

651
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,810
No.

652
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,050
Look at this,

653
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,050
woman gives us a zero,

654
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,050
because her gown didn't fit.

655
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,360
And this guy bitches,

656
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,360
because he couldn't change

657
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,360
the channel on the TV.

658
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,920
We ought to get a chance

659
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,920
to grade them.

660
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,660
Threw up in

661
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,660
the waiting room, zero.

662
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,630
Peed on the floor, zero.

663
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,270
Ms. Goodwin.

664
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,530
Yeah.

665
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,160
Hey, uh, I just got out

666
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,160
of the OR,

667
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,160
assisting Dr. Downey,

668
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,900
and he said that you approved.

669
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,140
I did.

670
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,540
Why?

671
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,540
You'll have to ask him.

672
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,640
But you're fine with it?

673
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,150
It's Dr. Downey,

674
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,150
and I'm fine

675
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,150
with whatever he wants.

676
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,880
You have a problem?

677
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,350
Yeah.

678
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,910
Yeah, I do, actually.

679
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,320
Excuse me.

680
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,800
Mr. Brennan?

681
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,830
I got some things

682
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,830
I hope will fit you.

683
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,200
You look like a medium.

684
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,940
I think so.

685
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,400
All right.

686
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,740
Why don't you get dressed,

687
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,740
and then we'll sign you out.

688
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,740
So clean.

689
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,690
Is it okay if I lie

690
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,690
just a few more minutes?

691
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,220
I guess.

692
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,720
Oh, um...

693
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,830
Would you mind filling out

694
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,830
a patient satisfaction card?

695
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,360
Sure.

696
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,730
Okay.

697
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,440
I'll be back

698
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,440
in a little while.

699
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,990
Yeah?

700
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,660
Dr. Downey?

701
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,660
Uh...

702
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,970
Maybe this isn't

703
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,970
such a good time.

704
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,970
No, it's fine.

705
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,340
Okay.

706
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,180
So, look,

707
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,180
I just spoke with Ms. Goodwin.

708
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,510
Mmm-hmm.

709
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,850
I am a trauma fellow.

710
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,480
Right.

711
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,060
So if I'm scrubbing in

712
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,060
with you,

713
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,150
I'm neglecting

714
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,150
my other responsibilities.

715
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,230
Yeah.

716
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,800
Let me tell you

717
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,800
why I love what I do.

718
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,780
The heart,

719
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,780
it's not just a pump...

720
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,150
Magic.

721
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,750
This couple,

722
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,750
they were in their car,

723
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,320
and they're having

724
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,320
a terrible fight.

725
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,490
And in the midst of it,

726
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,490
they get in an accident,

727
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,760
the husband's killed,

728
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,760
and they transplant his heart

729
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,760
into another man.

730
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,300
When the recipient

731
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,300
of this heart wakes up...

732
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,100
He's...

733
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,330
He's very troubled.

734
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,240
As soon as

735
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,240
he gets out of the hospital,

736
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,240
he looks up the donor's wife.

737
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,150
And he finds himself

738
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,150
apologizing

739
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,380
that his last words

740
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,380
were so angry to her.

741
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,790
He wants her to know

742
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,020
that he loves her.

743
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,190
That wasn't this man talking.

744
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,430
That was the heart.

745
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,860
I like that story.

746
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,770
I think I remember it from

747
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,770
when I was in eighth grade?

748
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,830
Doesn't make it not true.

749
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,940
Dr. Downey, the thing is,

750
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,940
I am really more comfortable

751
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,940
in trauma.

752
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,090
Comfort is important.

753
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,520
Okay.

754
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,690
Okay?

755
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,900
I'll leave you where you are.

756
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,840
Thank you.

757
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,680
Code Blue.

758
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,280
Treatment Five.

759
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,950
Code Blue. Treatment Five.

760
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,220
Mommy! Mommy!

761
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,490
It's okay.

762
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,590
It's okay,

763
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,590
she's in a better place.

764
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,970
Did you ask her?

765
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,130
She wouldn't.

766
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,970
She's wrong. Mr. Baker,

767
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,970
let me resuscitate.

768
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,970
Will, she's got a DNR.

769
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,970
She doesn't have to die.

770
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,030
I don't know.

771
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,410
You want her to live.

772
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,410
You told me.

773
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,470
I don't know.

774
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,470
Will, don't.

775
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,640
Tell me to resuscitate.

776
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,940
Daddy!

777
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,940
I don't know.

778
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,310
Please. Let me try.

779
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,320
Please help her.

780
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,320
Will, don't do this.

781
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,610
Get the cart in here.

782
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,810
Will, stop!

783
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,880
I have to. April, the cart.

784
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,050
No.

785
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,050
Mommy! Mommy!

786
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,680
Now!

787
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,820
What are you doing?

788
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,920
Daddy.

789
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,980
Please help her.

790
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,260
No.

791
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,660
One milligram of epi.

792
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,960
Mr. Baker,

793
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,960
take your daughter out.

794
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,360
Okay, come on, honey.

795
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,600
No. Will, you can't do this.

796
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,070
Will, stop.

797
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,970
I'm tubing her.

798
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,970
Natalie, please take over

799
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,970
compressions.

800
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,410
No, I won't. Don't do this.

801
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,870
Doris, you take over

802
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,870
compressions.

803
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,140
No. Will, this is illegal.

804
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,200
I'll take responsibility.

805
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,780
Do it!

806
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,980
No.

807
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,580
7.5 ET tube.

808
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,580
Four MAC laryngoscope.

809
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,560
Yes, Dr. Halstead.

810
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,720
She's still in vfib.

811
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,060
I'm charging 200.

812
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,260
Will.

813
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,030
Will, let her go.

814
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,230
Clear.

815
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,330
Clear!

816
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,770
Will, stop!

817
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,200
Stop!

818
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,940
I said clear.

819
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,770
Continue CPR.

820
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,080
Charging to 200.

821
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,150
Charged.

822
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,090
Clear!

823
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,920
Got a pulse.

824
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,090
Good.

825
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,530
Get an EKG and redraw labs.

826
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,030
CMP and trops.

827
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,030
Yes, Doctor.

828
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,830
What have you done?

829
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,600
Her heart rate

830
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,600
is erratic.

831
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,110
She's going to thank me.

832
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,380
It's why I love fractals.

833
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,890
The perfect union

834
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,890
of math and art.

835
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,010
Well, the Art Institute

836
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,010
would certainly agree.

837
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,920
Did you see

838
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,920
the Mandelbrot exhibit?

839
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,760
Hello. He's only the reason

840
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,760
I studied Brownian motion.

841
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,490
Who wants to

842
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,490
see another iteration

843
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,490
of finite subdivisions?

844
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,260
Not me, baby.

845
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,860
Professor Gray, I'm Dr. Choi.

846
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,160
I've been treating you.

847
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,970
Oh, hi. Sorry, I understand

848
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,970
I've been a lot to handle.

849
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,270
I'm glad

850
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,270
you're feeling better.

851
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,540
I am.

852
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,480
Dr. Charles,

853
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,480
can I have a word?

854
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,040
Be right back.

855
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,040
Okay.

856
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,210
Amazing turnaround.

857
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,720
What did you replace

858
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,720
the lithium with?

859
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,020
Lithium.

860
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,280
Excuse me?

861
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,950
Well, Olivia and I talked

862
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,950
and decided that, for now,

863
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,320
it's the best course

864
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,320
of treatment.

865
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,550
But she can't tolerate it.

866
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,790
It's destroying her kidneys.

867
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,160
Yeah, but that's a tradeoff

868
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,160
that she's willing to make.

869
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,170
She can't be

870
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,170
who she wants to be

871
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,900
or live the life

872
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,900
she wants to live

873
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,900
without lithium.

874
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,870
Here's a novel idea,

875
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,870
how about she learns to cope

876
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,870
with her condition?

877
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,270
Cope?

878
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,270
Learns to control it.

879
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,900
Buck up. People can do that.

880
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,170
Dr. Choi, you saw

881
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,810
what a full-blown

882
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,810
manic episode looks like

883
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,810
for her.

884
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,610
And how much of that

885
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,610
is self-indulgence?

886
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,150
I'm just saying,

887
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,850
I don't think her dependence

888
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,850
on this destructive drug

889
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,850
is the answer.

890
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,920
Huh.

891
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,910
How we doin'?

892
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,760
Excuse me, Bailey.

893
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,130
I'm gonna check Mommy's heart.

894
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,400
Still stable.

895
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,170
She's off

896
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,170
all blood pressure drips.

897
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,260
We can start the process of

898
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,260
getting her in the trial.

899
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,190
We just wanna be

900
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,190
left alone right now.

901
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,530
Sure.

902
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,290
Dr. Halstead.

903
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,280
Ms. Goodwin would like to

904
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,280
see you in her office.

905
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,430
Did he tell you

906
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,430
to resuscitate his wife?

907
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,130
Her husband wants her

908
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,130
in the trial.

909
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,830
He agrees with me.

910
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,830
Yes or no.

911
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,210
Did he tell you

912
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,210
to resuscitate his wife?

913
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,940
No.

914
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,650
But he wanted me to.

915
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,010
And how exactly

916
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,010
did you divine that?

917
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,990
I couldn't just let her die

918
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,990
for no reason.

919
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,320
Well, there is a reason.

920
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:30,460
She has

921
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:30,460
a legally binding document

922
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:30,460
ordering you not to do so.

923
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,690
And don't I, as her doctor,

924
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,100
have a moral responsibility

925
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,100
that supersedes that document?

926
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,430
No, you do not.

927
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,990
And you know that.

928
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,370
Ms. Goodwin,

929
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,370
she was out of her mind

930
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,370
from the pain and the illness.

931
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,670
She did not understand

932
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,670
what this drug could do

933
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,670
for her.

934
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,580
I did.

935
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,580
This is not about you.

936
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,210
It's about her,

937
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,210
and what she wanted.

938
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,210
She...

939
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,880
You have put this hospital

940
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,880
and yourself

941
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,750
in an extremely dangerous

942
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,750
position.

943
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,090
I hope you understand

944
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,090
the gravity of your actions.

945
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,090
Get her out of the ED

946
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,090
and up to the MICU.

947
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,760
Dr. Manning

948
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,760
will be primary now.

949
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,840
I want you to stay away

950
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,840
from Jennifer Baker,

951
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,840
and her family.

952
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,710
Are we clear on that?

953
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,150
Yes.

954
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,290
Reese.

955
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,290
Hmm?

956
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,330
This isn't a hotel.

957
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,600
You need to get Mr. Brennan

958
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,600
out of Treatment Four.

959
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,750
Mr. Brennan,

960
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,750
I'm afraid you have to go.

961
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,610
Mr. Brennan.

962
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,610
Mr. Brennan,

963
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,610
can you hear me?

964
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,460
Maggie.

965
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,140
He dressed?

966
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,470
He's dead.

967
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,240
So, Dr. Downey

968
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,240
is a very strange guy.

969
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,150
Now what?

970
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,820
He got Goodwin to assign

971
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,820
me to him on some kind of

972
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,820
ongoing basis.

973
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,350
What?

974
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,920
Yeah. It's crazy, right?

975
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,990
Wait. Dr. Downey

976
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,990
asked you to assist him.

977
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,830
You?

978
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,830
Yeah.

979
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,770
The premier cardiac surgeon

980
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,770
in the country asks you

981
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,770
to assist him, and you pass?

982
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,070
I'm a trauma surgeon.

983
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,230
Unbelievable.

984
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,230
What?

985
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,810
No, come on,

986
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,810
what is so strange

987
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,870
about me wanting to do

988
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,870
what I was trained to do?

989
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,640
In fact,

990
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,640
what I was brought here for?

991
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,840
That's your excuse?

992
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,650
It's not an excuse.

993
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,140
Mmm-hmm.

994
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,710
Oh, come on, what?

995
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,890
I can't stand cowards.

996
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,790
That's how you see me?

997
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,260
Well, what are you afraid of?

998
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,420
That you're not good enough?

999
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,130
That you'll fail?

1000
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,530
Is this your dad thing, again?

1001
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,430
It's disgusting.

1002
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,830
Is she still stable?

1003
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,970
Nat?

1004
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,140
She's not your patient.

1005
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,810
Look, you know

1006
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,810
I only did it because I care.

1007
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,440
I told you

1008
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,440
not to resuscitate her.

1009
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,320
Why do you dismiss me?

1010
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,220
What?

1011
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,220
You say you respect me.

1012
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,310
You say I'm your friend...

1013
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,310
I don't dismiss you.

1014
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,550
Yes, you do.

1015
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,550
And not just today.

1016
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,550
All the time.

1017
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,120
Look, things can't always

1018
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,120
just be on your terms, Will.

1019
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,330
I'm tired of this.

1020
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,600
Trauma incoming.

1021
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,370
All attending to the ED.

1022
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,000
58-year-old male,

1023
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,000
restrained driver car crash,

1024
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,000
front end collision.

1025
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,100
GCS 12.

1026
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,410
Vitals stable

1027
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,410
since we got to him.

1028
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,140
Go to Trauma Four.

1029
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,140
Anybody else hurt?

1030
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,700
No, he crashed into a pylon.

1031
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,540
Looks like he blacked out

1032
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,540
and lost control of the car.

1033
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,450
It's Dr. Downey.

1034
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,450
Let Ms. Goodwin know.

1035
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,920
Dr. Downey,

1036
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,920
can you hear me?

1037
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,220
Dr. Downey?

1038
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,150
All right.

1039
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,150
Let's get him in here.

1040
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,160
Let's get him unstrapped

1041
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,160
and get him on the bed.

1042
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,350
All right.

1043
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,590
On my count, one, two, three.

1044
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,730
All right, airway's intact,

1045
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,730
get IVs in

1046
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,730
and get X-ray in here.

1047
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,460
On it.

1048
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,460
IV's going in.

1049
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,170
All right,

1050
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,170
breath sounds bilaterally.

1051
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,870
His belly's soft. Vitals?

1052
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,380
BP 124 over 78.

1053
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
Heart rate 92, sat's 100%.

1054
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,340
Call Oncology.

1055
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,340
Yes, ma'am.

1056
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,610
Oncology?

1057
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,610
This is trauma.

1058
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,910
Maybe.

1059
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,910
But Dr. Downey

1060
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,910
has liver cancer.

1061
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,720
How's he doing?

1062
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,560
He's pretty banged up,

1063
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,560
but remarkably,

1064
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,560
no real injuries.

1065
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,770
We're gonna keep him sedated

1066
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,770
for the moment,

1067
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,770
so that he rests.

1068
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,780
How long have you known?

1069
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,610
Well, he was diagnosed

1070
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,610
six months ago.

1071
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,270
He told me then.

1072
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,640
He asked me

1073
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,640
to keep it confidential.

1074
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,020
He's not gonna be

1075
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,020
happy about this.

1076
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,880
What's his prognosis?

1077
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,320
Not good.

1078
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,390
I thought he was a pothead.

1079
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,660
Right.

1080
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,960
It's not a coincidence,

1081
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,960
is it?

1082
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,330
No.

1083
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,410
When he realized

1084
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,410
the seriousness

1085
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,410
of his condition,

1086
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,500
he decided to find someone

1087
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,500
he could teach,

1088
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,240
someone who had the ability

1089
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,240
to do what he does.

1090
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,710
So, what do I have

1091
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,710
that all the other surgeons

1092
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,710
in this place don't?

1093
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,450
He saw something.

1094
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,890
You have to ask him

1095
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,890
when he wakes up.

1096
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,030
Excuse me.

1097
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,400
I just got word,

1098
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,540
the Bakers

1099
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,540
are suing the hospital

1100
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,550
and pressing charges

1101
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,550
against you.

1102
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,050
It's called

1103
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,050
"Wrongful Life and Battery."

1104
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,850
Hospital counsel

1105
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,850
will get in touch

1106
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,850
tomorrow morning.

1107
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,530
Am I suspended?

1108
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,530
No.

1109
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,620
Not that I'm not tempted.

1110
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,560
But the hospital

1111
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,560
can't allow even a hint

1112
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,560
of possible wrongdoing.

1113
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,360
So, you will continue working,

1114
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,360
and we will support you.

1115
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,770
But depending on

1116
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,770
how this goes,

1117
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,610
the board may well

1118
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,610
decide to terminate you.

1119
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,400
I don't understand

1120
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,400
what happened.

1121
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,300
He came here to die.

1122
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,970
Really?

1123
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,210
People do that sometimes.

1124
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,040
They sense

1125
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,040
they're at the end,

1126
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,040
and they...

1127
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,340
Just wanna die

1128
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,340
in a clean bed.

1129
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,880
Reese.

1130
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,150
Mr. Brennan filled out

1131
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,150
a patient satisfaction form.

1132
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,210
You got a perfect score.

1133
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,620
All 10s.

1134
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,970
Dr. Halstead.

1135
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,030
Hey.

1136
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,340
I heard.

1137
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,410
It's out there already?

1138
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,010
I think it's awful.

1139
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,010
You did the right thing.

1140
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,750
At least somebody thinks so.

1141
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,150
Well, once she starts

1142
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,150
the drug and feels better,

1143
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,150
she'll drop the suit.

1144
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,590
You'll see.

1145
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,550
Yeah. Let's hope.

1146
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,150
Dr. Halstead?

1147
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,230
Can I buy you a drink?

1148
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,500
Sure.

1149
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,810
I'd like that.

1150
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,810
Okay.

1151
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,550
Dr. Charles?

1152
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,850
You got a minute?

1153
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,690
Hey, man, what's up?

1154
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,470
Seat?

1155
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,440
Afghanistan.

1156
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,410
A field hospital

1157
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,410
in Helmand Province.

1158
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
We'd been up 48 hours straight

1159
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
treating casualty.

1160
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,540
Uh-huh.

1161
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,720
This woman came in.

1162
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,630
She'd walked from her village

1163
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,630
10 miles away.

1164
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,130
Had her daughter in her arms.

1165
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,700
A three-year-old.

1166
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,840
Little girl

1167
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,840
didn't have a scratch on her.

1168
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,990
Looked like she was sleeping,

1169
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,990
this sleeping angel.

1170
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,480
But she was dead.

1171
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,700
A blast wave

1172
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,700
from a mortar round

1173
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,700
burst her lungs.

1174
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,540
I can't stop seeing her.

1175
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,230
I try to cope.

1176
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,870
But I can't sleep.

1177
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,640
I have nightmares.

1178
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,860
I can't stop seeing her.

1179
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,800
Glad you stopped by.

1180
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,020
Dr. Rhodes.

1181
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,060
Dr. Downey.

1182
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,630
How are you feeling?

1183
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,070
I guess

1184
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,070
the cat's out of the bag.

1185
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,300
I'm sorry.

1186
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,010
Can I get you anything?

1187
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,980
Can I take your presence

1188
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,980
as a good sign?

1189
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,380
Yes, sir.

1190
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,590
You know, the Hawaiians...

1191
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,400
Have a deep reverence

1192
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,400
for the sea.

1193
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,810
They believe

1194
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,280
it's the best medicine

1195
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,280
there is.

1196
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,810
They think a swim in the ocean

1197
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,810
can cure anything.

1198
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,590
Wouldn't a swim be nice

1199
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,590
right now?
