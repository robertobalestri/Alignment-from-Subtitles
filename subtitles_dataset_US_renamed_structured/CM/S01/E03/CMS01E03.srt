00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:16,748
            <i> - Okay,</i>
    <i> let's bring it up a bit.</i>

3
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,156
          - I love it.

4
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:31,130
My dad is gonna hit the roof
when he gets the bill.

5
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:33,265
     - What's he gonna do,
           fire you?

6
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,234
- I wish he would.

7
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,802
          - You liar.

8
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,171
All right, it needs
to go 6 inches lower.

9
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,340
The street level sight line.

10
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,175
          - Look out!

11
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,616
- Russel!

12
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:51,617
You're okay.

13
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,651
Oh my God,
you're okay.

14
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,186
                      No, don't.
                Don't touch him.

15
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,254
Go call 911.

16
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,423
You're okay,
you're okay.

17
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:58,424
No, no, no, look at me.

18
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,491
Look at me, honey.

19
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,660
Could someone
please help over here?

20
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,195
          - [gasping]

21
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,596
          - Trauma 4.
          - Incoming.

22
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,332
- 45-year-old male,

23
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,067
multiple penetrating
injuries to the chest.

24
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,069
GCS 12, BP's 90 over palp.

25
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,403
- Did you give him
anything for pain?

26
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,338
               - We've given him
      4 morphine and 500 saline.

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,340
        - What happened?

28
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,341
- Chandelier fell from about
20 feet and landed right on him.

29
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,710
    - How long ago was this?

30
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,245
- Maybe 30 minutes.

31
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,779
  - Did he lose consciousness?
             - No.

32
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:22,815
          - All right.

33
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:24,450
  Let's get ready to move 'em.

34
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:25,684
    Very gently on my count.

35
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,820
One, two, three.

36
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,488
             - Ah!

37
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,858
          - All right,
   can you tell me your name?

38
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,293
        - [shaky voice]
        Russel Rollins.

39
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,761
           - Russel?

40
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,463
    - Connor, oh, thank God.

41
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:38,530
            Help me.

42
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,698
          - All right,
      we're going to, bud.

43
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,732
- All right,
airway's in tact.

44
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,101
Get me a set of vitals.

45
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,535
       Someone draw a gas
     and get a chest X ray.

46
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,204
         You know him?
      - Since I was a kid.

47
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:46,772
      Russel, can you move
     your fingers and toes?

48
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,640
           - I think.

49
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,576
    - Where did this happen?
        - At the store.

50
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,879
           - Claire?

51
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,747
- Sat's 90.
Heart rate's 124.

52
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,316
          - All right,
       everybody, quiet.

53
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,685
   Russel, take a deep breath
          for me, huh?

54
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:02,754
          - [screams]

55
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,289
- I don't hear much
on the left side.

56
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,125
We're gonna need
a chest X ray.

57
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,227
       It's not optimal,
but we're gonna do it from here.

58
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,495
      - Am I going to die?

59
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:11,530
  - Hey, Russel, listen to me.
        No, you are not.

60
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,132
      - No, you are gonna
        be fine, Russel.

61
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,167
     You're gonna be fine.
 - You have to wait over here.

62
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,704
  - All right, I'm gonna hold
      the plate from here.

63
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:22,441
You just shoot as
head on as possible, okay?

64
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:23,709
         - You got it?
         - Here, Russ.

65
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:26,211
Listen to me.
You're doing great, buddy.

66
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,780
I just need you to keep
as still as possible, please.

67
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,682
            - X-ray.
        Everyone clear?

68
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,917
          both: Clear.

69

71
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,357
     - Big hemopneumothorax
        with some shift.

72
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,358
     He needs a chest tube.

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,459
          - I got it.

74
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,530
              - Who's the trauma
              attending on call?

75
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,948
         - Dr. Zanetti.

76
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,365
- Page her. Tell her we need her
            down here right now.

77
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:48,767
                       - Got it.

78
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,335
- I'm sorry, are you family?

79
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,537
        - I'm--I'm his employer.

80
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,205
                   Claire Rhodes
              from Dolan Rhodes.

81
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,274
    - The department store?
            - Yeah.

82
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,877
     - Dr. Rhodes, is he--
       - He's my brother.

83
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,325
       [monitors beeping]

84
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:14,326
   - What are we looking at?

85
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,761
- 45-year-old male.

86
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:17,462
Impaled glass
in his left chest.

87
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,232
Arrived hypotensive, but
responded to blood and fluids.

88
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,533
Left tension pneumo.

89
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,768
      - That's a cluster.

90
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,869
                      - Oh, God.

91
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,607
- Ma'am, let me show you
where you can wait.

92
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,776
- Got a chest tube
in on the left side.

93
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:31,910
Pressure's improved.

94
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,712
Base deficit was 8.

95
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,513
- We need to get this thing off
to see what we're dealing with.

96
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,032
 What did you sedate him with?

97
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,549
      - Got two of versed
      with the chest tube.

98
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,718
- Which one of you is in charge?

99
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,487
- That's me.

100
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,255
           - I need to remove it
     without allowing this piece

101
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,657
    to vibrate in the slightest,
                 so I'm thinking

102
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,828
      cuts here, here, and here.

103
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,963
         - Yes, ma'am.

104
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,664
     [elevator bell dings]

105
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,369
- Nat.

106
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,570
Guess who Connor is.

107
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,339
       - I'm not talking to you.

108
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,241
         - Oh, come on.

109
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,310
- What was it you said?

110
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,378
"Try thinking like a doctor,
not a pregnant woman?"

111
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,680
      - I was crazed, all right?

112
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,249
               I didn't mean it.

113
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,485
- You meant it.

114
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,488
       - Look, I need to ask you
                about a patient.

115
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,325
          You wrote that article
       review on vertigo, right?

116
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:23,629
- Yes, that and other pediatric
   vestibular disorders, why?

117
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,331
     - Well, I got a 24-year-old
    in four who lost her balance

118
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,332
              and took a header.

119
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,900
      I'd like a second opinion.

120
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,746
     Get that package yet?
        - What package?

121
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,581
- I sent you
an olive branch.

122
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,549
Not a real olive branch
obviously,

123
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,318
although now that I'm
thinking about that,

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,289
maybe that was the way to go.

125
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,724
        I'm trying to apologize.

126
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,360
- What's the patient's name?

127
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,462
                        - Dylan.
              Her name is Dylan.

128
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,073
   - Captain Trevor Jackson.
             Ma'am.

129
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,742
             Army?
   - Ranger. First Battalion.

130
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,444
         75th Regiment.
            - Cool.

131
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,713
      Follow my pen line.
         - You served?

132
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,348
            - Navy.
         Reservist now.

133
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,517
You're a long way from Georgia.
   What brings you in today?

134
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,519
        - Fender bender.
        It was my fault.

135
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,788
I got light-headed.
Thought I was gonna pass out.

136
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,356
        - Well, you been
       drinking, soldier?

137
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,391
- No, sir.

138
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,760
         - Blood work.

139
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,529
        You two in town
    for business, pleasure?

140
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,431
           - Visiting my family.
                   Lincoln Park.

141
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,799
- I got to get back to duty.

142
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,935
Mother-in-law's cooking
packing on the pounds.

143
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,537
            - Kids?
           - Not yet.

144
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,539
- One day, baby, one day.

145
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,074
      I don't want her to
    have to raise kids alone

146
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,475
while I'm still being deployed.

147
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,544
       - Captain Jackson,
       are you diabetic?

148
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,046
             - No.

149
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,547
   - I'm afraid these numbers
     indicate differently.

150
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,649
   Your blood sugar's at 350.
          - What? No.

151
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,950
There's no way
I have diabetes.

152
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,052
                  - Baby, listen
                  to the doctor.

153
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,487
     - If I have diabetes,

154
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,123
     they won't deploy me,
         and that's it.

155
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:02,794
    I'm done, and I can't be
       a soldier anymore.

156
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,797
You understand.

157
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,600
- Well, it's true you don't have
   the classic risk factors--

158
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,802
   obesity, family history--

159
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,571
and your white blood
count is elevated,

160
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,406
    so it's possible there's
   some underlying infection

161
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:15,574
 driving your blood glucose up.

162
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,409
            - Okay.

163
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,877
  - We'll run some more tests,
    see if that's the case.

164
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,545
- Please.

165
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,949
          - All right,
      we'll be right back.

166
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,151
    - It's gonna be okay, honey.

167
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,629
- Can you smile
for me, Dylan?

168
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,398
     All right, now I'd like you
               to tilt your head

169
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,900
            to your left for me,
                      all right?

170
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,003
  - I tried an Epley already.
    It didn't seem to help.

00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,940
      [tuning fork chimes]

172
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,543
      - Can you hear this?
             - Yes.

173
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,744
                - How about now?

174
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,983
- Not as well as the other.

175
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,051
       - You a musician?
           - Mm-hmm.

176
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,953
  Getting my master's at CCPA.

177
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,689
             - The Conservatory?
                     Impressive.

178
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,893
Follow my finger for me,
all right?

179
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,012
      I don't mean to scare you,

180
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,130
       but becoming a doctor was
      actually my fallback plan.

181
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:16,001
      I wanted to be a musician;
           a violinist, in fact.

182
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,170
- I don't have
a fallback plan.

183
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,871
Music's all I ever
wanted to do.

184
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,840
          - You see, that's what
                  I was missing.

185
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,575
                   Here, can you
               squeeze my hands?

186
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,678
Plus, Paganini's C minor
Caprice broke my will.

187
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,947
            - You and just about
                  everyone else.

188
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,549
          It's a bear.
            - Yeah.

189
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,551
         [both humming]

190
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,020
        - I played snare
in marching band freshman year.

191
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,192
- What do you call the guy
who hangs out with the band

192
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,861
but isn't a musician?

193
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,029
          The drummer.

194
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,064
           - Thanks.

195
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,833
     - I've got my recital
          next month,

196
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,634
       all Bach program.

197
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,604
      Maybe you can come.
      - Sure, I'd love to.

198
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,574
                   Dr. Halstead.

199
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,044
      - She's got a slight
      nystagmus in her...

200
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,145
- In her right eye,
I know.

201
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,481
And the hearing loss
in the left.

202
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,982
I'm thinking
it could be syndromic.

203
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,984
              - Well, apparently
      you didn't need a consult.

204
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,820
- Come on,
I value your opinion.

205
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,659
How come you never told me
you wanted to be a musician?

206
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,079
          - You want an opinion?

207
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,498
             Call a neurosurgeon
and send her for a stat head CT.

208
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,272
         - I want a CTA
       of his chest ASAP.

209
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,840
       Figure out exactly
        what's bleeding.

210
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,576
- Got to get him on his back
before we get him upstairs.

211
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,944
    - Oh, you're gonna use--
         - Yes, he is.

212
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,579
        Can you hold the patient
       steady please? Thank you.

213
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,847
                    - All right,
            hang in there, Russ.

214
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,917
         [saw buzzing]

215
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,689
        - All right, we're gonna
     flip him over onto his back

216
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,891
             gently on my count.

217
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,727
                One, two, three.

218
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,531
                         - Okay.

219
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,065
        - All right, let's start
              to package him up.

220
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,101
   Newbie, start a femoral line.

221
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:59,204
       [monitor beeping]

222
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,778
          I got this.

223
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,850
          - Reese, get over here
                     and help me

224
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:15,253
                splint the glass
               to keep it still.

225
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,122
   One wrong move on the way,

226
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,958
       and he could have
     a massive hemorrhage.

227
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,560
           - Maggie?
             - Yep.

228
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,295
- Call the blood bank.

229
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,029
        Tell them I want
 five more blood, five plasma,

230
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,232
       and six platelets
       typed and crossed.

231
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,700
         - Yes, ma'am.

232
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,168
- All right,
are we ready?

233
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,978
- Look, I wish I had
more to tell you.

234
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,713
Russel's on his way
to CAT scan right now,

235
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,048
so we can figure out
what's injured.

236
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,816
We think that it has
something to do

237
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,151
with the subclavian artery.

238
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,786
                      - English?

239
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,755
- The one that supplies
blood to the arm.

240
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,924
He's gonna need an operation.

241
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,159
We have to remove
the glass and--

242
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,595
           - You haven't removed
                      the glass?

243
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,831
- It's actually keeping him
from bleeding to death.

244
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,701
We are trying to get good
imaging so that when we operate,

245
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:03,835
we're not going in blind.

246
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,370
                    - So get it.

247
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:13,144
- Is this how it's gonna be?

248
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,247
          - What did you expect?

249
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,717
- I had to leave, okay?

250
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,285
The way things were with Dad,
there was no--

251
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,054
          - Right, you left him,
                         Connor,

252
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,090
            but you left me too.

253
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,164
    Just go take care of Russel.

254
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:54,152
- Did you hear?
He's<i> that</i> Rhodes.

255
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,255
  - Oh, a prince in disguise.

256
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,398
- Your friend with
the glass shards?

257
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,433
                       - Uh-huh.

258
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:12,871
- These are them.
Unusual case.

259
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,105
Couldn't help myself.

260
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,441
- Yeah, I get it.

261
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,144
- Looks like this thing goes
through the left subclavian.

262
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,780
  - There's just so much scatter
          with the leaded glass.

263
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,082
It's impossible
to make out the details.

264
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,984
     I think we're gonna have to
            go to interventional

265
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,253
               for an angiogram.

266
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,822
- Want my opinion?

267
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,724
                   - Yeah, sure.

268
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,293
- Try Surgical Theater's SNAP.

269
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,228
                  - What's that?

270
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,797
- S-N-A-P?

271
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,468
Surgical Navigation
Advanced Platform?

272
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,236
You ought to crack a journal
once in a while.

273
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,705
                 - Yeah, well...

274
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,407
- SNAP three-dimensionalizes
CT images.

275
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,676
Because it's 3-D,

276
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,944
you see your surgical point
from every angle.

277
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,382
             - Okay, well, where
            do I find this SNAP?

278
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,486
- There is one
in the main OR neuro room.

279
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,488
             - Great, thank you.

280
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,291
                 - Dolan Rhodes.

281
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,059
                   I bought some
               socks there once,

282
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,496
  the only thing I could afford.

283
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:15,867
- If this works out,
I'll get you a tie.

284
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,503
    <i> - Dr. Travis, you have a</i>
   <i> visitor in the main lobby.</i>

285
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,739
              - Captain Jackson,
                   Mrs. Jackson,

286
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,741
                I'm Dr. Manning,
                Natalie Manning.

287
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,142
- Ma'am?

288
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,510
                  - I understand
                you're a Ranger.

        First Battalion?
         - Yes, ma'am.

290
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,515
                - My husband was
         in the First Battalion.

00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,884
        Captain Jeffrey Manning.

292
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,419
             - Was?

293
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,088
       - He was killed in action

294
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,758
                 six months ago,

295

              Kandahar Province.

00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,096
- I'm very sorry, ma'am.

297
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,765
I didn't know your husband.

298
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,536
               - Jeff always got
                so uncomfortable

299
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,805
          when people would say,
   "Thank you for your service."

00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:57,208
         But I guess that's what
                  I want to say.

301
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,377
- Appreciate it.

302
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,214
                 - And thank you
             for your sacrifice.

303
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,221
                          - Nat?

304
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,930
- I thought I would
pay my respects,

305
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,933
but it was really about Jeff-

306
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,435
me looking for Jeff.

307
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,513
      [indistinct chatter]

308
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,821
             - Dad.
           - Doctor.

309
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,523
How's our patient doing?

310
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,459
 - Russel's stabilized for now.

311
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,561
I have found something

312
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,196
that could help us
with the surgery.

313
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,898
     It's an imaging system
 called Surgical Theatre SNAP.

314
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,550
                         - Okay.

315
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:57,201
      - It's FDA approved,
so insurance is gonna cover it,

316
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,905
but Russel is going to be
looking at a lengthy

317
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,874
hospital stay afterwards,

318
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,142
                 and I just want
             to make sure that--

319
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,312
        - That somebody
       covers the co-pay?

320
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,148
           - We will.
- Hang on there, Bernie Sanders.

321
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,151
Now, I love Russel
as much as you do,

322
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,386
but we have to be
responsible to the company.

323
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:18,122
Are you prepared to do this
for every one of our employees?

324
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:22,126
        - We are talking
       about Russel here.

325
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,929
    God, he's worked for us
   since he was 14 years old.

326
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:28,433
          He's family.
             - Us?

327
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,268
When did it become "us"?

328
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,046
       - That's your dad?
             - Yep.

329
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,449
- Fathers like that
keep me in business, baby.

330
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,520
                  - Dr. Charles,
           do you have a minute?

331
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,289
                     - Sit down.

332
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,591
            Don't mind if I eat.
             I missed breakfast.

333
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,326
                       - Please.

334
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,462
                It's my patient,
                Captain Jackson.

335
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,431
           He's a physically fit
     active service army ranger,

336
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,601
            but his blood sugars
       indicate he has diabetes.

337
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,670
- You run labs?
Do a CT?

338
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,639
      - His pancreas is healthy.

339
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,107
   There are no signs of tumors.

340
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,775
        His labs came back clear

341
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,442
                   for infection
         and autoimmune disease.

342
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,145
           I can't find a reason
               for his diabetes,

343
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:17,315
            but I did find this.

344
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,985
                He fractured two
             thoracic vertebrae.

345
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,186
            - Ouch.
           - Exactly.

346
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,322
                So why hasn't he
                  said anything?

347
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,524
- Why do you think
he hasn't said anything?

348
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,559
                     - Overseas,
      I saw a number of soldiers

349
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,928
                   who were away
                from home a lot.

350
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,563
            They were depressed.

351
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,197
- Depressed patients
tend to mask or hide pain.

352
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,400
                        - Right.

353
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,602
                   The thing is,
          diabetes is a red flag

354
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,037
               for the military.

355
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,339
              You test positive,
    you don't go back to combat.

356
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,708
- So if you were depressed
about overseas deployment...

357
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,944
           - You'd think he'd be
         happy to have diabetes.

358
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,412
             He's home for good.

359
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,980
      Well, that's not the case.

360
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,015
       Jackson's extremely upset
              at the possibility

361
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,718
               of not going back
              to active service.

362
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,055
            Something's going on
                       with him.

363
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,257
- Let's go say hello
to Captain Jackson.

364
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,959
       - Thank you, sir.

365
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,097
                        Captain,
            this is Dr. Charles.

366
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,598
         He's a senior attending
                 physician here.

367
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,434
I've asked him to consult,

368
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,502
               just to make sure
   we're covering all our bases.

369
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,272
          - Yes, sir.
     - Please, as you were.

370
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,440
      You're Mrs. Jackson?
             - Yes.

371
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,492
        - It's nice to meet you.

372
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,543
 I just wanted to make sure that
   I have your history straight.

373
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,713
 So you've seen combat before?

374
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,215
          - Yes, sir.
- And this was your first tour?

375
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,717
                      - Seventh.

376
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,219
           - Seventh.
             And...

377
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,387
- What was in
the test results?

378
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,255
             - You have a couple
             fractured vertebrae

379
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,623
    that will heal on their own,

380
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,460
        but all your other tests
    failed to give us an answer.

381
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,695
 We can't find a clinical reason
           for your high sugars.

382
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,197
- Clinical?
What does that mean?

383
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,333
- A physical cause.

384
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,235
- I'm sorry, what kind
of doctor are you?

385
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,337
          - He's a psychiatrist.

386
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,172
- A shrink?

387
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,074
I don't need a shrink;
I'm not crazy.

388
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,226
- Nobody's saying that you are.

389
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,377
     - Honey, they're just
      trying to help you.

390
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,745
- How is a shrink gonna help me?

391
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,581
     - As I said, we're covering
                  all our bases.

392
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,049
  - You think I'm faking this?
             - No.

393
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,183
     You can't fake blood sugar.

394
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,019
- So what are
you saying, huh?

395
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,453
You think I did
something to myself?

396
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,721
You think I'm a coward?

397
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,590
              - Not for a second
      is anybody saying you're--

398
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,158
           - Trevor.
   - Whoa, whoa, Mr. Jackson.

399
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,626
           - Captain.
       - I'm out of here.

400
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,294
        - Mr. Jackson...
     - Whoa, whoa, Captain.

401
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,630
         - Whoa, whoa.

402
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,232
       [metal clattering]

403
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:17,335
           - Jackson!
      - Captain! Captain!

404
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,670
 Nurse, please, a little help!
        - Come on, baby.

405
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:26,044
       - Watch your back.
             Left.

406
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,546
      Straight to surgery.
           Thank you.

407
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,315
                  - Hey, Maggie?
            Can you help me out?

408
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,617
- With what?

409
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:36,320
        - With, you know, an IV.

410
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,556
             The patient's veins
               are really small.

411
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,657
- How many goes
have you had?

412
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,792
                        - Three.

413
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,794
- Oh, man.

414
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,263
Okay, I got a kid
with a broken arm in two.

415
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,431
No needles.

416
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,833
   Think you can manage that?
         - Yes, ma'am.

417
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,672
- I'm not sure you're aware,

418
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:58,309
but Connor knows
Russel Rollins,

419
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,378
and it just didn't
seem appropriate to me

420
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,480
that my son be
the one treating him.

421
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,348
              - Well, the degree
                  of familiarity

422
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,351
          doesn't warrant taking
        Dr. Rhodes off the case,

423
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,321
                and Mr. Rollins,
              when he was lucid,

424
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:14,192
                 did not request
              another physician.

425
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:15,660
- Let me put it another way.

426
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:20,198
I would like Russel to receive
the very best medical care,

427
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,633
and I do not think
my son can provide that.

428
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,471
                      - Your son
        is a first-rate surgeon,

429
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,707
           otherwise I would not
                 have hired him.

430
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,342
- I want him off the case.

431
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,877
                 - It's not your
          decision to make, sir.

432
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:36,180
- Excuse me, but I'm the one
writing checks here.

433
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:40,651
 - And while we appreciate that,
                this is my shop,

434
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:44,722
       and I will not be pulling
       Dr. Rhodes from the case.

435
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:52,897
- I want you to remember
this conversation,

436
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,633
because if anything
happens to Russel,

437
00:18:55,635 --> 00:19:00,505
you will be repeating it
in a courtroom.

438
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,407
       - I will remember.

439
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,577
  And you, sir, have a nice day.

440
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,649
- This may not be
your shop for long.

441
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,489
        - Dr. Halstead.
            - Yeah?

442
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,459
               - Your violinist.
 Radiology just sent the report.

443
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,328
- Has anyone from
neurosurgery seen these yet?

444
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,930
               - They're talking
        about scheduling surgery

445
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,166
            as soon as possible.

446
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,236
      - Acoustic neuroma?

447
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,539
          - Tumors, essentially,

448
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,910
   caused by a genetic condition
       called neurofibromatosis.

449
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:42,346
      It disturbs nervous system
                    cell growth.

450
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,783
  So these neuromas are pressing
         against your inner ear,

451
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,219
      and that's why you've been
   experiencing the hearing loss

452
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,887
              and the dizziness.

453
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,957
          We need to remove them
 and stop the internal bleeding.

454
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,462
            - When?
     - As soon as possible.

455
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,668
- What are the side effects?

456
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,571
         - There's a good chance
       you'll lose your hearing.

457
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,940
- My hearing?

458
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:10,374
                          - Yes.

459
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,546
       [metal clattering]

460
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,351
     Dylan, I know it seems like

461
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,720
            your world is coming
                apart right now,

462
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,756
    but we got lucky here today.

463
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:29,794
        Okay, that fall you took
  might've just saved your life.

464
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:32,530
- I'm a musician.

465
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:33,731
     - This could've killed you,

466
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,866
        and you don't always get
                 a warning sign.

467
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,905
 I want to transfer you upstairs

468
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,974
              and admit you into
            the hospital proper.

469
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,842
          Is that okay with you?

470
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,944
      - No, I want to talk
          to the woman

471
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:51,549
   who was in here earlier--
         the violinist.

472
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,718
                  - Dr. Manning?

473
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,256
    - I'm not going anywhere
      until I talk to her.

474
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,359
          - Okay, I'll tell her.

475
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:18,042
       - How's he doing?
            - Okay.

476
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,610
- Don't think it'd be
a very good idea

477
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,045
for me to go back in there.

478
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,580
             - No.

479
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,652
- Wow, seven tours.
That must be tough.

480
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:30,788
                  - Well, I knew
      what I was signing up for.

481
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,624
    I'm proud of my husband.
          - Of course.

482
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,527
I just--I know you must
miss him and worry about him.

483
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,462
    - Like every soldier's wife.

484
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,003
- And I know
the illness is a blow,

485
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,939
but at least, you know,
you have him home,

486
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,741
and he's close, right?

487
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,426
                    - Thank you.

488
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,395
            The chairman is here
                    to see you--

489
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,531
                of the hospital.

490
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,366
      - That's never good.
           - Mm-hmm.

491
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,767
    He's waiting in your office.

492
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,705
            - Okay.

493
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,978
             Barry.
           - Sharon.

494
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,979
                - Nice surprise.

495
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,348
- Well, I was on my way

496
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,749
to the Art Institute
for a preview.

497
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:35,052
     I thought I'd drop by.
  - A little out of your way.

498
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:39,523
- I got a call
from Cornelius Rhodes.

499
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,593
He's friends with some members
of the board--golf buddies.

500
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,096
 Said he spoke with you today.
           - He did.

501
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:48,666
- Unfortunately, he feels
his concerns were not addressed.

502
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:52,503
                       - Oh, no,
            they were addressed.

503
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,805
- He feels he was dismissed.

504
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:58,409
                         - Good.
    I'm glad he got the message.

505
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:02,012
- Sharon, I would never tell you
how to run this hospital.

506
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,415
              - And I appreciate
        your faith in me, Barry.

507
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:06,817
            - But the Rhodes are
                 wealthy people.

508
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,919
          - Mm-hmm, and how much
                  has Mr. Rhodes

509
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,521
         given to this hospital?

510
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:12,089
- His mother's
donated quite a bit.

511
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:16,060
              - No, no, how much
                 has<i> he</i> donated?

512
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,663
- Mr. Rhodes was talking
about making a $200,000 gift.

513
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,532
               - Right. Talking.

514
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,068
- I don't think we can ignore
the fact that the Rhodes--

515
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,070
                - Barry, listen.

516
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,407
       I can understand the need
            to cultivate donors.

517
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:34,111
             Mr. Rhodes can make
            a $200 million gift,

518
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:37,148
            but I still will not
                 let him dictate

519
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,084
            who performs surgery
               in this hospital,

520
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:44,155
        and I think going to war
       for that conniving S.O.B.

521
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:46,924
             is not a good idea.

522
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,209
                   - Incredible.

523
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:08,045
                 - Wait till you
             get the headset on.

524
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,147
     It's like I'm moving around
             inside of his body.

525
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,617
       - Okay, so tell me
     how this thing works.

526
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,820
            - It combines images
           from the CT angiogram

527
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,622
 and creates a three-dimensional
 model of the patient's anatomy.

528
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,891
              With the HTC Vibe,
        you get virtual reality.

529
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,829
          It allows us to better
           tailor our operation.

530
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,063
   Are you having some concerns?

531
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,199
         - No, no, no,
      just--just curious.

532
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:31,902
  Oh, by the way, Dr. Rhodes,
    I met your father today.

533
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,537
- Yeah?
Did he charm you?

534
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,606
         - Not exactly.

535
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,142
             - Hey, Dr. Zanetti.

536
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,780
  Take a look at the middle-left
              subclavian artery.

537
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,748
            - The glass is going
               straight through.

538
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,116
   It's like a finger in a dike.

539
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,552
- I can't believe there's
still flow past the injury.

540
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:51,689
 - Rotate a little to the left.

541
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:52,890
                          There.

542
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,090
      Looks like our dike
         sprung a leak.

543
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,694
        - He's bleeding.
            - Yeah.

544
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:59,230
   - I think we can get away
  with a collarbone incision.

545
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:01,031
       Come on, let's go.

546
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:12,076
                  - Claire, Dad,
            this is Dr. Zanetti.

547
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,178
         Russel is being prepped
          for surgery right now,

548
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,547
              and she and I will
          perform the operation.

549
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,282
- Okay.

550
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:21,118
           - You must have a lot
                of faith in him.

551
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,786
- I do.

552
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,956
- Hmm, I never thought
I'd see the day;

553
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:29,226
my son saving lives.

554
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:37,067
     - Your father, is he as big
       a tube steak as he seems?

555
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,602
- That he is.

556
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:39,870
                 - You leave him
              out there, Rhodes.

557
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,972
        Don't bring him in here.

       [monitors beeping]

560
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:59,323
             Okay.

561
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,624
           All right.

562
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,826
    Ready to pull this out?
            - Ready.

563
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,094
     - Okay, take a deep breath,

564
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,931
            and whatever you do,
         do not break the glass.

565
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,247
           - Damn it.

566
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,849
                 - You lacerated
            the subclavian vein.

567
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,718
I need suction.

568
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,759
      - We have 20 seconds
     before he bleeds out.

569
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:39,897
                 - More suction.

570
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,315
- Systolic's 90.

571
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:42,732
What's going on?
Are you guys in trouble?

572
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,768
               - Shut up, Marty,
            just give him blood.

573
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,604
                    4-0 Proline.

574
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:47,705
Suction there.

575
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,974
          Right there.
      - No, that's not it.

576
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,342
           - Damn it,
     I can't see anything.

577
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:53,811
- He's 34 degrees.

578
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,813
          - I can't see a thing.
                   More suction.

579
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:58,048
- Dr. Zanetti, let me.
I got this.

580
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,286
            Let me.

00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,126

screw this up.

582
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,748
Gentle.

583
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,420
               - Okay, I got it.

584
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,088
- That wasn't about
your father, was it?

585
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,691
I really hope you weren't
trying to prove something.

586
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,436
          - The Captain has been
                 gaining weight,

587
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,738
         seems to bruise easily.

588
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,274
- That's totally consistent.

589
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,942
      - I just can't believe it.

590
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,382
               - Let me do this.

591
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,084
                   Mrs. Jackson?

592
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,819
- I'm sorry, I don't want
these to get cold.

593
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,789
     - I--I won't keep you long.

594
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,290
               In reviewing your
             husband's symptoms,

595
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,393
          I'm pretty sure I know
    what's causing his diabetes.

596
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,728
- Hmm.

597
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,097
                     - And, um--
         and I think you do too.

598
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:25,736
- What?
What are you talking about?

599
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,838
                 - You don't lie
         a whole lot, don't you?

600
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,473
        I mean, you're certainly
            not very good at it,

601
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,141
           to your great credit.

602
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,711
                    To lie well,
          you have to loosen up.

603
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,146
     You know, make eye contact,
                stuff like that.

604
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,815
- I don't understand
what you're saying.

605
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:40,984
I mean, lie?
Lie about what?

606
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,153
                - Somebody's got
                  to go in there

607
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,055
                   and tell your
              husband the truth.

608
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,857
                  I could do it.

609
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:57,134
      Let me hold those for you.

610
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:10,481
       - Maggie, any word
from Dr. Rhodes on the surgery?

611
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,217
- Nope, he's still in the OR.

612
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,752
     - I'm afraid I've got
         some bad news.

613
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:18,288
- Oh, please,
I am having a terrible day.

614
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,023
             - It's about to get
             a little bit worse.

615
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:23,894
      We have a case of domestic
             abuse on our hands.

616
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,863
- You couldn't!

617
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,032
Are you out of your mind?

618
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,200
 - That woman has been poisoning
    her husband with prednisone.

619
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:34,071
- Why would you do
something like that?

620
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,205
Oh, my God.

621
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:44,281
- I read on the Internet that
if I gave him some prednisone,

622
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:48,285
it would look like diabetes.

623
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:52,422
I just wanted him home safe.

624
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:55,192
It's been ten years

625
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,795
of worry,

626
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,363
of nightmares.

627
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,501
You can understand
why I did it, can't you?

628
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,471
    - Well, whether I understand
      or not, it doesn't matter.

629
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,306
- There's a doctor here.

630
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:14,311
Her husband was a ranger,
and she lost him.

631
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,046
He's dead.

632
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,516
Isn't it better
to be sick than dead?

633
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,952
                   - Why did you
               let it go so far?

634
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:24,087
                  Why didn't you
                talk to someone?

635
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,391
- What good
would talking do?

636
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:30,861
I wanted him home.

637
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,496
Talking wouldn't
bring him home.

638
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,165
      - Mrs. Jackson, I'm sorry.

639
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,502
        What you did is a crime,
        and I have to report it.

640
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,906
- Am I going to go to jail?

641
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:45,542
                 - I don't know.

642
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,154
               - She's not gonna
                 do the surgery,

643
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,489
              at least not until
        she's given the recital.

644
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:02,626
- You told her those tumors
might kill her first?

645
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:05,295
       - Hearing and being heard

646
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,631
        it's how Dylan interacts
                 with the world.

647
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,067
      She can't imagine her life
           without that ability.

648
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,135
             She needs more time
         to process all of this.

649
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,370
- She doesn't have more time.

650
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,538
- I don't know what to tell you.

651
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,373
It's not our decision to make.

652
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,441
         - I don't believe this.

653
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,508
                I miss something
               with one patient,

654
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,993
  and it's too late to fix it,

655
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:21,477
          then I catch something
             like this early on,

656
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,881
       and I still can't fix it.

657
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,716
     Nat, the medicine is clear.

658
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,550
       The patient should not be
 making this decision. I should.

659
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,053
- So you became a doctor
to tell people what to do?

660
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,257
             - I became a doctor
         to save people's lives.

661
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:35,125
It's all I've ever wanted to do.

662
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,594
    I don't have a fallback plan
         or some hidden passion.

663
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,664
              This is it for me.

664
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,033
          It's just...

665
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:46,503
  no one ever told me there'd be
        this much loss involved.

666
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:06,089
- I pulled this out of
the deep depths of my closet.

667
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,058
I reached out to
Anne-Sophie Mutter's people,

668
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,661
but it seems she's
on tour in China, so...

669
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,632
I'm guessing you know
Bach's "Concerto in D minor"

670
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,234
for two violins?

671
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:20,637
 In my day, we all learned it.
            - Sure.

672
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,341
- Get out your violin,
Dylan.

673
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:28,211
We're gonna have that recital.
Come on.

674
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:34,584
         - The tumor's that bad?

675
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:40,223
- Yes, but we're
gonna get it out.

676
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,526
               - And my hearing?

677
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:46,730
- Let me explain something.

678
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:49,299
The memory is not
just in the head.

679
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,636
We also have what's called
kinesthetic memory,

680
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,438
the body's memory.

681
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,374
It remembers movement,
resistance,

682
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:00,177
and the position of its parts.

683
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,679
So hearing or not,

684
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,983
your body can still
remember how to play.

685
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:33,043
Don't focus on the sound.

686
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:36,380
    Concentrate on the feel,
        the vibrations.

687
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:41,651
            Just close your eyes
                   and remember.

688
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:47,758
         [plays Bach's
     "Concerto in D minor"]

689
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:56,066
              ¶ ¶

690
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,869
- We'll taper off
the prednisone,

691
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,605
and your system will purge it
over the next few days.

692
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,873
                The side effects
                 will dissipate,

693
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:13,143
           and your blood sugars
          will return to normal.

694
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:15,345
    - Where are they taking her?

695
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:16,847
         - She's turning herself
               in to the police.

696
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:19,483
           - Lauren!

697
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:22,552
                - Captain, easy.

698
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:42,272
     - We'll get through this...

699
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:43,507
           together.

700
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,721
- Dr. Rhodes,
how's your patient?

701
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:01,191
- The surgery was successful,
and he should be okay.

702
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,359
- Oh, thank God.

703
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,494
        - Isn't that great news,
                     Mr. Rhodes?

704
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,531
              - Yes, I had every
                faith in my son.

705
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,866
- That's exactly what I told
the Chairman of the Board

706
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:12,369
                 when he dropped
             by to see me today.

707
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:15,472
- Thank you.

708
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:16,673
          - Of course.

709
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,444
   - Well, looks like we can go.

710
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,413
            Thank you very much.

711
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,751
- Dolan Rhodes.

712
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,953
               That's a big name
                     in Chicago.

713
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:33,423
   Growing up with that can give
  a person a skewed perspective,

714
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,493
like whatever he wants,
he ought to get.

715
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,496
  - My dad give you a hard time?

716
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:43,800
- [laughs]
Nothing I couldn't handle.

717
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,969
    - My grandfather was the one
       who started the business.

718
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,304
             - Oh?
            - Yeah.

719
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:50,240
               Salt of the earth
                    kind of guy.

720
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,410
           He used to say to me,
           "You're gonna have to

721
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,946
      work harder than everybody
                else," you know?

722
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:59,649
  "Be better than everybody else
      so that you don't turn out

723
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,751
                  like everybody
                expects you to."

724
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,286
- Hmm.

725
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:05,388
   - "So that you don't turn out
              like your father."

726
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,361
                 Took me a while
            to get that message.

727
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:15,599
- Well, congratulations,
Dr. Rhodes.

728
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,313
   - Dr. Halstead, messenger
    just left this for you.

729
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,881
Charvet.

730
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:39,489
Ooh, someone likes you.

731
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,625
Mm-hmm.

732
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,859
             - Yep.

733
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:48,832
            - Reese.

734
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,769
          Treatment 1.

735
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,446
     - Where's the patient?

736
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,682
        - You play golf?
             - No.

737
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:07,917
- Me neither.
Who's got the time?

738
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,786
There's something that
golfers get.

739
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,756
The "yips."
Some kind of mental block.

740
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:14,524
They can't make
the simplest putt.

741
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,559
Even really the golfers.

742
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,695
             - I'm not following
              this conversation.

743
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:19,863
- You got the yips
with needles,

744
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:22,032
and I'm gonna
help you get over it.

745
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:25,935
Let's get started.

746
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,905
       - You want me on--
         - Yep. Jab me.

747
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:31,708
Let's go.
I don't have all night.

748
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,454
Mm-hmm.

749
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,362
                   - Dr. Rhodes.

750
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,763
                 Back in the OR?

751
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:56,566
             Pretty ballsy move,
     pushing an attending aside.

752
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:59,402
      Someone with a fragile ego
 would've chopped your head off.

753
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:03,039
- Sorry.

754
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,375
              - Don't apologize.

755
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:06,943
                Never apologize.

756
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,990
                  - How'd it go?

757
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,792
- They got everything.

758
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,928
            She's gonna be fine.

759
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,863
- And her hearing?

760
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,435
                    - I'm sorry.

761
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:18,114
           - So what was in that
            package you sent me?

762
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,016
- Three bars of chocolate:

763
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,552
dark, milk, semisweet.

764
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:25,054
Wasn't sure which you'd prefer--

765
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,423
and a jar of olives.

766
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,675
- Olives?

767
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,926
      - Well, I know you've been
 craving brine these days, so...

768
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,798
- An olive branch.

769
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,802
I've got a patient
I got to check on in peds.

770
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:40,036
        You're forgiven.
