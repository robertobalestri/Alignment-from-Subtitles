 that long--it didn't end well.

157

Is that why you
passed out?

       buttered popcorn?

179

       always feel kind of blah.

             she won't eat them.

00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,946

     for a bleeding heart.

       - Didn't know you
     were trying to peg me.

     Bleeding's coming from

  Pringle Maneuvers I've done.

- Chicago and guns.
Winning combination.

00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,396
             - And making us all

The bullet decimated

We keep it on,
we sacrifice his liver.

299

 - Well, then we can't let him
        bleed to death.

No food allergies,

- I've seen it before.

My best friend in college,
she was anorexic.

Starved herself to death.

Her mom?
Just like this one.

        we're dealing with here?

       - Great, this way.

- Ashley, Mrs. Cole,
this is Dr. Charles.

00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,996
I've asked him to consult.

       Some tummy issues?
            - Yeah.

00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,375
- So you and food not on
the best of terms right now?

330
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,911
         - I love food.
      I just can't eat it.

331
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,714
         - Why is that?
    - It makes me throw up.

332
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,382

333
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,851
         - Everything.
     - Well that's no fun.

334
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,187

          thinking about eating.

336
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,989

       that's in trouble.

- What if I were to
give Ashley something

342
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,801
to make her not feel sick?

343
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,403
          Do you think you might
            be able to eat then?

344
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,906
                   - I guess so.

345
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,408
- Yeah, FDA's just approved
a new anti-nausea drug.

         A hamburger with fries?

350

        all that grease.

351
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,020
     - The cafeteria grills
     a pretty mean burger.

352
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,956
    We could give one a try.
            - Sure.

   to go with me on this one?

Okay, I suppose.

00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,468
      I have some samples
        up in my office,

358
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,936
   I'll have them sent down,

359
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,838
      and then we'll order
        you that burger.

360
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,440
          Nice to meet you both.

361
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,208

362
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,412
            Hey, what's the name
             of that medication?

363
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,048
- I've got a board member
in my office in five seconds.

364
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,451
Page me at burger time.

365
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,195
         - Well, there she goes.

366
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,799
- Something doesn't
make sense.

367
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,800
                  - What's that?

368
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,068
- Shooting in a movie theater,

369
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,037
and we've only had one GSW,

370
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,306
and that was the shooter.

371
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,409
Where are the rest
of the gunshot victims?

372
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,581
   - You look very island-y.

373
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,883
          Are you sure
      you're not Jamaican?

374
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,485
               - Yes, I am sure.

375
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,222

the girl who cleans my house.

00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,127

         Says you were
     in the movie theater.

379

  so I wouldn't have to wait.

380
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,901
       You see all those
       people out there?

381
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,170
- So, just the headaches, then?

382
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,606
       - Oh, I get tired
           sometimes,

383
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:04,008
       and I cough a lot,

384
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,478
     and I don't always remember
          where I put my things.

385
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:12,317
       Bring me a cup of
 chamomile tea, will you, dear?

386
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,353
           - Oh, I will let your
             server know, ma'am.

387
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,524
          150 over 90.

388
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,894

        EKG, and a CXR.

389
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,546
                      - You bet.

390
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,197
   - Your symptoms are pretty
      varied, Mrs. Kovach.

391
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,465
        Once we get you
       lab results back--

392
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,535
                  - Who is that?

393
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,403
          - Dr. Choi?

394
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,872
                      - Perfect.

395

               the best doctors.

         It's their math skills.

400
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,324
- So, did you ever lose
consciousness?

401
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,325
                      - Briefly.

402
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,627
                  I think, um...

403
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,495
        I have a little headache
          now, but it's probably

404
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,063
        just from the adrenalin.

405
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,665

to my attending about

got in the news.

you just acted?

It's trending.

417
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,124
- Mr. Miller.

418
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,992
       There are a couple
       of detectives here

419

        that need to ask
      you some questions.

        to come with me?

      I already spoke with
   the officers at the scene.

427

430

00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,185
     - And what was he carrying?

432
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,987
         - Um, an assault rifle.

433
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,188
- You saw the weapon?

434
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,591
              - Yes, he was, uh,
               waving it around.

435
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,327
- Can you describe
the weapon?

436
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,062
                         - Uh...

437
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,597
              I couldn't tell if
           it was a Kalashnikov.

438
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,433
                  I couldn't see
      the banana clip, you know?

439
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:11,602
        I think it was an M16A1.

440
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,071
       - Did you hear him
        fire the weapon?

441
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,707
               - Yes, that's why
                I pulled my gun.

442
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,346
     - Is it possible that
      the shots you heard

443
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,982
      were actually coming
        from the movie?

444
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,017
                           - No.

445
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,319
                          What--

446
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,620
                   what's, uh...

447
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,423
           what's going on here?

448
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,993
 - Peter, the kid that you shot

449
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,428
        is a prankster.

450
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,197
He thinks it's funny
to scare people.

451
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,199
He posts videos
on the Internet.

452
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,367
           - I don't understand.

453
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,737
- He didn't have
an assault rifle.

454
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,472
He didn't have
a rifle at all.

455
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:50,775
He had a leaf-blower.

              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

458
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,433
- So, they're gonna
charge Mr. Miller?

459
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,552
                           - No.

460
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,670
       The gun was legal, he had
   a license to concealed carry.

461
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,606
           He thought
    his life was in danger.

462
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,208
The prankster, Peter Wallace,
is another story.

463
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,611
He could face
some serious time.

464
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,146
         - If he lives.

465
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,714
                - So, her name's
                Gertrude Kovach.

466
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,251
         72 years old, presented
        with general discomfort,

467
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,353
             fatigue, headaches,
                  forgetfulness.

468
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,622
          - Dementia.
             - No.

469
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,358
               She knows exactly
              what she's saying.

470
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,627
    You sure you don't mind?
         - No worries.

471
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,329
                Always glad when
          someone gets it right.

472
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,532
          - Oh, good.
            Finally.

473
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,568
        - My assistant,
         Dr. Halstead,

474
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,336
         showed me your
          blood work.

475
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,472
      Your ACE and calcium
        levels are high,

476
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,441
     and your chest x-rays
    revealed the lymph nodes

477
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,476
        along your lungs
         are enlarged.

478
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,478
         It could be symptomatic
           of something serious,

479
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,847
    but before we go there,
       let's do a biopsy

480
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,282
    and see what comes back.

481
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,685
    - Oh, thank you, Doctor.

482
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,621
        I knew you'd be
      the one to help me.

483
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,391
       - You're too kind,

484
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,727
   but humility is the solid
   foundation of all virtues.

485
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,597
             - Oh.

486
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,671
                       - Really?
                      Confucius?

487
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,607
         You're Korean.
     - All the same to her.

488
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,342
              Hey, call me after
               you do the biopsy

489
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,212
           and make a diagnosis,
       so I can take the credit.

490
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,114
            - Ha-ha.

491
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,648
                - Hey. You hear?

492
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,417
         The kid at the theater,
           the one who got shot,

493
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,752
           he didn't have a gun,
           he had a leaf blower.

494
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:42,753
            - What?
            - Yeah.

495
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,689
                     It was some
                  kind of prank.

496
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,695
  [indistinct intercom voice]

[heart monitor beeping steadily]

498

  - We have clamped the entire
   blood supply to his liver.

499
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,471
        It's keeping him
         alive for now,

500
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,241
 but it's a temporary solution.

501
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,344
He needs a liver
transplant to survive.

502
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,579
           - Which he won't get.

503
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:13,151
Peter'll stay at the bottom
of the list, won't he?

504
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,520
     How long does he have?

505
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,526
- A day, maybe two.

506
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,868
           - He did a bad thing,

507
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,772
but he's not a bad person.

508
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,543
                He's just a boy.

509
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,945
                       Please...

                         around,

00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,769
                    you're gonna
                want to hear it.

514
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,672
- The kid, Peter Wallace,
he has a website for his pranks.

515
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:08,906
Look.
Look at this.

516
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:09,907
             Look.

517
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,242

           Excuse me,
        can I help you?

00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,495

                 Peter, the kid.

    - I'm sorry, Mr. Miller,
       we can't give out

531
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,400
      patient information.

532
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,937
         - Is he alive?

00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:47,378
                  and now, um...

536
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,013
              It looked so real.

537
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,647
- There's one patient ahead
of you for the CT.

538
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,916
It shouldn't be long.

539
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,718
I'll come get you.

540
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,586
                       - Thanks.

541
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,625
     I could swear he had a gun.

542
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,475
       - This is so good!

543
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,577
              Mmm.

544

545

       Don't eat so fast.

            would make her sick.

550
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:41,065
                So much for your
                     magic pill.

551
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,501

         Has it passed?

552
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,639
  - I'm sorry Ashley's having
  such a tough time, but uh...

553
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,442
   her response has actually
     tell us a great deal.

554
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,544
      - I should hope so.

555
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,046
                  - Dr. Charles.

556
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,781
         - Dr. Manning
      will be right back.

557
00:21:58,551 --> 00:21:59,850
         - Okay, honey.

558
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:00,885
     You're gonna be okay.

559
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,086
- What did you give her?

560
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,621
          - A Tic Tac.
          - A Tic Tac?

561
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,490
             - Yes.
- You gave my patient a placebo?

562
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,591
                          - Yup.

563
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,627
- That's not ethical.

564
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:10,795
                    - Oh, balls.

566
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,899
       I now have a much clearer
     picture of what's going on.

567
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,601
   I needed to get around mother
          and see that girl eat.

568
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,604
- I could report you.
I should report you.

569
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,907
    - Dr. Manning, have you ever
   heard of "bias confirmation"?

570
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,409
            - What?
      - Bias confirmation.

571
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,044
                    Interpreting
          information so that it

572
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,680
                     conforms to
           one's preconceptions.

573
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,918
     Look, you walked in and saw
         a thin 16-year-old girl

574
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,419
     with an overbearing mother,

575
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,121
                who reminded you
       of your college roommate.

576
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,957
           Who, very tragically,
               died of anorexia,

577
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,059
           so voila, the patient
                   has anorexia.

578
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,028
- She has the indicators.

579
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,030
                  - She also has
          the contra-indicators.

580
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,732
              If the mother were
               that overbearing,

581
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,100
                 she never would
             have allowed Ashley

582
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,269
                  to choose that
                particular meal,

583
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,437
    and if Ashley were anorexic,
  she never would have eaten it,

584
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,406
      let alone with such gusto.

585
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,674
            The mother is right.

586
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,075
              It's Ashley's body
              that's in trouble,

587
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,511
                     and that is
                your department.

588
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,012
                      Thank you.

589
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,183
- Is it true?

590
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,817
Lucy Simm's liver is on its
way back to the hospital?

591
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,421
        - The intended recipient
                 died in pre-op.

592
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,156
- Peter is an HLA match,
it can go to him.

593
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,859
    - Yeah, there are names
   ahead of him on the list.

594
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,695
                  - None of them
           are in this hospital.

595
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,430
                  It has already
               been three hours,

596
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,632
               livers are viable
               for less than 12.

597
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,768
            By the time the list
                gets sorted out,

598
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,139
      the patient prepped, organ
    shipped, it may be too late.

599
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:31,409
Lucy's husband can direct donate
         to whomever he chooses.

600
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,412
                 Ask him to give
                    it to Peter.

601
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,813
        - You're talking
         about the man

602
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,115
        responsible for
       his wife's death.

603
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,651
- And he has done a horribly
stupid thing, I know,

604
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,920
but he's a kid.

605
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,188
Peter deserves a chance
to turn his life around.

606
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,995
                  - Dr. Charles.

607
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,496
               We have a patient
          that I think you might

608
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:53,831
       want to have a chat with.

609
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,634
- Oh.
Thank you.

610
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,637
           - I got--
 I got mugged a few years ago,

611
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,606
so I started carrying
a gun for protection,

612
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,175
and I took the classes.

613
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:06,076
I passed
the background checks.

614
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,812
      I'm not a vigilante.

615
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,647
I don't go out
looking for trouble.

616
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:11,549
     - It was dark in that
       theater, you know.

617
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,218
      People were running
     around yelling, "Gun."

618
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,455
I completely understand why you
 thought he would have had one.

619
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,123
                 - That's right.

620
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,226
               I did what anyone
                would have done.

621
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:25,062
                  But tell them.

622
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:28,132
     "My buddy pranked me with a
whoopee cushion, so I shot him."

623
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,500
        "Another genius gun nut,

624
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,902
          shoots first, and asks
               questions later."

625
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:35,539
           "Save the rest of us,
          shoot yourself, hero."

626
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,907
        Those are the nice ones.

627
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,210
- Oh,
the Internet, right?

628
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:42,112
I mean, people use it
to vent anonymously.

629
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,581
None of them were
in that theater.

630
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,716
              - Yeah, well, uh--

631
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:45,850
                  People believe
              what they want to,

632
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:48,986
        and because I'm the only
        one that had a real gun,

633
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,156
                I'm the bad guy?
                          That--

634
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,824
                          that--

635
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:57,094
              that kid did this.

636
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,829
      I shouldn't be the pariah.

637
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,731
        [knock at door]

638
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,866
- Sorry to interrupt.

639
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,601
Mr. Miller, your CT
results are negative.

640
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:04,802
You're fine.

641
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,570
The stitches will need
to stay in for a week,

642
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:07,705
but you're free to go.

643
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,139
- Thank you.

644
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,076
[whispering]
Could have waited.

645
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,845
  We got a few more minutes--
           - No. No.

646
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,714
              Look, I got to go.

647
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,848
- You sure?

648
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,651
Um, why don't
you let me

649
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,219
call you in a mild
sedative, you know?

650
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,787
Something to maybe
help you sleep,

651
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:24,855
just so you have it.

652
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,558
                 - I'll be okay.

653
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,159
         - Well, here.

654
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,828
                 Let me at least
               give you my card.

655
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,196
                My cell's on it.

656
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,798
               Give me a call if
               you feel like it.

657
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,034
- Really, I'm fine.

658
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,069
It's the world
that's messed up,

659
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,672
but, um...

660
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:44,008
if you want me to, okay.

661
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,809
          - I'm here.
            - Okay.

662
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,255
       - Oh, there he is,
   there he is, there he is.

663
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,657
          Mr. Miller!
         - Mr. Miller!

664
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,125
       Mr. Miller, do you
      have anything to say

665
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,860
  to Peter Wallace's parents?
           - No, no.

666
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,594
- Detectives have confirmed
you were the only person armed.

667
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:07,598
      [indistinct yelling]

668
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,133
          - I did what
      I thought was right!

669
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,735
  And I don't regret anything,
      and I'd do it again!

670
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,003
       Get out of my way!

671
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,839
        - And there you have it,
                    Mr. Miller--

672
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,355
           - Are you kidding me?

673
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:35,092
- Mr. Simms, I am not
condoning what he did,

674
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,629
but Peter Wallace
will die without a transplant.

675
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,931
If the liver doesn't
come from your wife,

676
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,034
he won't get one.

677
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:50,207
                - Lucy and I met
                at a Cub's game.

678
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,875
                        [laughs]

679
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,278
        I heard this--this crazy
           laughter coming from,

680
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,849
                 like, five rows
                behind me and...

681
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,718
                       it just--

682
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,153
             it just reached out
                 and grabbed me.

683
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,658
                I'd look at her,
               and it would just

684
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,126
                  make me happy,

685
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,728
                       and then,
                 this afternoon,

686
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,833
      just watching the life get
           stomped out of her...

687
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,067
                       you know,

688
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,303
        his site has gotten more
           hits in the last hour

689
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,873
             than it's every had
                before, I mean--

690
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,943
                it's disgusting,
            it's all disgusting.

691
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,348
                         So, no.

692
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,384
          No, my wife's murderer

693
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:37,187
         does not get her liver.

694
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,189
        - I understand.

697
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:57,207
 - Can I at least talk to him?
       - No, you cannot.

698
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,009
           - There has got to be
            something we can do.

699
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,145
- And we've done it.

700
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,680
Let it go, Dr. Rhodes.

702
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,757
He signed them.

     <i> lauded as a hero for--</i>

       x-rays are normal.

710
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,149
   Ultrasound looks good too.

711
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,051
I'll call GI,
they'll want to schedule

712
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,754
an endoscopy and
probably a colonoscopy.

713
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:45,439
                       - Really?

714
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,123
    - Tests are unpleasant,
     but they're necessary.

715
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:50,227
I'm sorry.

716
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:56,200
- Ashley,
come on, sit up straight.

717
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,168
Slouching.

718
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,470
She's always slouching.

719
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:01,405
                - Can't help it,
        I'm almost a foot taller

720
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,173
            than all my friends.

721
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,211
- Ashley, after you eat,

722
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:08,879
does your stomach
hurt less when you

723
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:12,916
sit with your knees
to your chest?

724
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,418
          - A little.

725
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,753
- What about if you lay
on your side

726
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,254
and put your arms
over your head?

727
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,357
Will you do that for me?

728
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,863
         - Actually...

729
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,899
     this feels better too.

730
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,200
        - You know what,
       before I call GI,

731
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,903
                 I'd like to run
            one more test--a CT,

732
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:36,006
     and don't worry, it is
  nothing like a colonoscopy.

733
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,947
      [thermometer beeps]

734
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:47,885
- The boy who shot up
the movie theater, was he black?

735
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,554
  - He didn't shoot up anything,
             and no, he's white.

736
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:53,257
             - Hm.
        How about that.

737
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,461
- Biopsy's back
on Gertrude.

738
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,797
          - Lymphoma?
         - Not cancer.

739
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,799
Non-caseating
granulomas.

740
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,134
             - That's good news.

741
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,502
                     You want me
                    to tell her?

742
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,004
- No.

743
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,539
I'm waiting for one
more test to come back,

744
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:10,574
and if the results are
what I think they are,

745
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:13,911
I'd like to deliver
the news.

746
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,512
                         - Okay.

747
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:23,120
                          - Hey.
              I need a CT for 6.

748
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,888
            - Noon?
      - Yeah, that's fine.

749
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,091
          - Hey, Nat.
            - Yeah?

750
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,494
- I'm thinking,
I only live a mile from you.

751
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,863
When you go
into labor, call me.

752
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:33,864
I'll drive you here.

753
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,649
                - Thanks, but...

754
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,433
            you know it could be
           three in the morning.

755
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:40,237
- Sleep's overrated.

756
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,909
     - We're just friends.
           - Mm-hmm.

757
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:49,613
      "I want to take you
       to the hospital."

758
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,521
- Liver's in.
We're up.

759
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,123
Abdominal wall's really swollen.

760
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,458
What do you think,
VAC pack closure?

761
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,893

767
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,172
                         - Good.

768
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,274
- Ashley's problem
is right there.

769
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,276
Superior mesenteric artery.

770
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:21,211
The fat pad that
supports it has shrunk,

771
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,046
and it's now constricting
the duodenum,

772
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,116
so food passing through
her stomach gets stuck

773
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,451
in this pressure point.

774
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:28,619
             - Huh.
       - You were right.

775
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:31,054
It is physical.

776
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,155
You still could've told me

777
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,590
you were gonna give her
a placebo.

778
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:37,094
               - Long time since
            my last GI rotation.

779
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,962
   What are her options, anyway?

780
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,898
    - Well, Ashley can wear
      a nasal feeding tube

781
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,965
    for the next few months.

782
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,134
 Not the most attractive thing.

783
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,302
 There's also a surgical option
  which comes with some risks.

784
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,205
  Knowing how the mother feels
       about appearances,

785
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,973
          I'm pretty sure I know
        what the choice will be.

786
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,442
             - Oh.
            - Yeah.

787
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,477
                - Ladies, on me.

788
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,978
    - Reese, what do we go?

789
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,546
        - Blunt trauma.
     Open pelvic fracture.

790
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:59,316
Got a King airway and a 16-gauge
      IV in the right AC.

791
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,951
   Still got a radial pulse.

792
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,319
                - Wait a second.

793
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,621
            Oh, no.
        - You know him?

794
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,357
       - It's Mr. Miller,
the guy who shot the prankster.

795
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,459
       - Go, go, go, go,
          go, go, go.

00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:13,931
          On my count.

        One, two, three.

798
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,371
      - If he had a pulse,
      I can't find it now.

799
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:23,674
            Damn it.
        - What happened?

800
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:25,509

    right in front of a car.

          What's that?

859
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,247
- It's an inflammatory condition
 that causes your immune system

860
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:52,182
   to attack healthy tissue.

861
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,483
      It's very treatable.

862
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,918
     - Does Dr. Choi agree?

863
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,586
       - Oh, absolutely.

864
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,623
             - Oh,
            then...

865
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:00,857
        that's it, huh?

866
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:01,858
          - Not quite.

867
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,827
Oh.

868
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,663
- Your diagnosis was intriguing.

869
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,734
     See, sarcoids predominantly
  affect a specific demographic.

870
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,636
     You didn't seem to fit
          the profile,

871
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:16,239
    so I ran one more test.

872
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,341
- What am I looking at?

873
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,377
       - A graph of your
        genetic makeup.

874
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,579
          You're part
       African-American.

875
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,786
            - What?

876
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,288
              - Come on, sister,
                    put it here.

877
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,956
             - Uh--
        - Give it here.

878
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,225
       We got to stick together.

879
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,526
                        [laughs]

880
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,732
      - How'd she take the news?

881
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,702
- A little surprised.

882
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,637
     - You're really getting off
            on this, aren't you?

883
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,906
- Oh, come on.
Didn't it bother you?

884
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,374
The bigotry?

885
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,277
            - What do you think?

886
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,781
    But, you know, glass houses,
           cast the first stone,

887
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,883
             maybe it's not such
   a great idea to get worked up

888
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,652
     about other people's faults

889
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,255
           if you happen to have
           a couple of your own.

890
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:17,400
 - Is this because of her diet?

891
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,436
- No, her growth.

892
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,404
No matter what you eat,
right now your weight

893
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,390
cannot keep up with your height.

894
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:25,375
    - So she either walks around
      with that tube in her nose

895
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,777
      or she has surgery?
           - Mm-hmm.

896
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,380
There are less risks involved
with the feeding tube.

897
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,549
       - Honey, come on.
        Can you see it?

898
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,251
 Going to the Homecoming dance
          with a tube

899
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,252
   sticking out of your nose?

900
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:36,519
You know how kids are.

901
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,389
     One day, standing out
       will be an asset,

902
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,857
    but not in high school.

903
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,525
           Trust me.

904
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,031
     - I'll take the tube.
            - Honey.

905
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,667
       - I want the tube.

906
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:52,569
- Is that all right?

907
00:37:55,807 --> 00:38:00,277
                       - [sighs]
                  It's her life.

908
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,745
- Okay, great.

909
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:04,047
I'll send a GI resident down
to put one in.

910
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,790
- See you later.

911
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,959
 - Hey, your transplant patient.

912
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,528
                 How's he doing?

913
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,064
- He's gonna make it.

914
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,600
I suppose you think he didn't
deserve to get that liver.

915
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,736
            - Who am I to judge?

936
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,905
 Or because he was humiliated?

937
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,808
                 - I don't know.
  I mean, does it really matter?

938
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,145
- The time we live in,
it's crazy.

939
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:47,484
   - No. Look, The Crusades,
      the Mongol Conquest,

00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:50,620
                    World War I,

     stupid, vicious thing

       The world would be
     a much better place--

946
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,033
       a much safer place
   if people'd just shut up.

947
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,069
- [chuckles]

948
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,538
                  - I'm serious.
            I hate these things.

00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,173
                  Here, take it.

00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:11,408
               I'm done with it.

951
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,643
           - Serious?
       - I don't want it.

952
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,111
- I could use an upgrade.

00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:17,113

959
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:27,624
            You had a bad dream?
                     That sucks.

                   I'm so sorry.

961
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,728
                           Yeah.

00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,530
                         Uh-huh.
