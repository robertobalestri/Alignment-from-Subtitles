15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,820
maybe more.

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,860

Here you go.

24
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,570
Okay, bite down, bite down.

00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,570
Hold the pressure.

All right, here.

27
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,640
Let's move over here.

28
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,650
There you go.

29
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,650
Lay down.

30
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,440

00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,440

32
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,690
They're popping

34
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,690

Need medical on site.

36
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,250
Red, 30 yards in,

37
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,250
eye of the pileup.

38
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,680
We're on it.

39
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,680
Go.

40
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,920
Jeff.

41
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm with you.

42
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,630

47
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,720
Lot of intrusion

48
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,720

49
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,460
All polytrauma.

50
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,970
All right, we're on it.

51
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,970
Adam...

52
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,970
I got it.

53
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,200
My son. Save him.

54
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,200
My son.

55
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,370
All right,

56
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,370

57
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,370

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,580
Give me two hemostats.

64
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,580
I've gotta clamp it off.

65
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,180
Copy.

66
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,160
All right,

67
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,160
I'm on the boys.

68
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,630
Hang in there, guys.

69
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,860
Almost there, guys.

70
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,900

Hey, Adam, EVC collar.

00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,240
You're gonna be okay.

74
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,230
Jeff, what do you got?

75
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,610
I got some

76
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,610
serious leg damage.

77
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,970
Possible abdominal injuries.

78
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,030
Let's give them

79
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,030
some morphine.

80
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,580
Can you get a read

81
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,580

82
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,450
I don't know,

83
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,450

84
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,540
Push 4 milligrams IM.

85
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,540
I got it.

86
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,810
All right,

87
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,810
just take it easy.

88
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,380
Just take it easy.

89
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,160
Bleeding's under control.

90
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,160
Let's get him out of here.

91
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,590
Got it.

92
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,590
Hang in there, guys.

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,690
I'm gonna give you something

94
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,690
to make you feel better,

95
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,690
all right?

96
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,860
Place two 16-gauges

97
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,860
on the right,

98
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,200
and let them know

99
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,200
he's red-tagged.

100
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,260
Jeff, stay with the kids!

101
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,140
I got you!

102
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,580
Clear!

103
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,580
All right. Back up!

104
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,950
All right.

105
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,990
He needs oxygen!

106
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,250
Need a backboard!

107
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,160
All right, sir, we're gonna

108
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,160
get you out of here.

109
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,190
Sir, can you hear me?

110
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,190
Try to stay calm, okay?

111
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,470
One, two, three.

112
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
Pick him up.

113
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,580
All right,

114
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,580
you're doing really good...

115
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,410
Oh, God.

116
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,870
Hey, I need

117
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,870
a little help over here!

118
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
Pregnant woman!

119
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,580
Hey, you there?

120
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,060
Hey, a little help

121
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,060
over here! Hey!

122
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,170
Okay, everyone, listen up.

123
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,170
Glad you made it in.

124
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,670
It wasn't easy.

125
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,410
We've got

126
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,410
a predawn pileup.

127
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,950
Multiple traumas

128
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,950
en route.

129
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,650
White-out conditions,

130
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,650
staff snowed in at home,

131
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,980
no supplies coming in.

132
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,690
We need to make do

133
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,690
with who

134
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,090
and what we've

135
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,090
got on hand.

136
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,090
All right, Dr. Manning

137
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,090
and Halstead,

138
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,250
let's decompress the ED.

139
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,590
Anyone who's stable

140
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,720
kicks back into

141
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,720
the waiting area.

142
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,820
Copy.

143
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,820
Dr. Wheeler,

144
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,820
be ready to glove up.

145
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,160
Got it.

146
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,160
April, we need

147
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,160
every room we've got.

148
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's clear the hallways,

149
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,000
supply rooms,

150
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,370
anywhere we can fit a bed.

151
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,370
Let's go, people.

152
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,490
On it.

153
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,630
Uh, Doris, put out

154
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,630
a hospital-wide alert,

155
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,070
and page the triage team.

156
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,730
Okay.

157
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,330
Back to the waiting room?

158
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,330
I've already waited an hour.

159
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,670
I apologize, Mr. Kellogg,

160
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,480
but we'll get to you

161
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,480
as soon as we can,

162
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,480
all right?

163
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,380
What is the only

164
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,380
indication for AVR

165
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,950
in an asymptomatic patient

166
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,950
with severe stenosis?

167
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,890
Left ventricular

168
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,890
systolic dysfunction.

169
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,950
Correct, Dr. Bardovi.

170
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,020
This patient is stable.

171
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,020
Close his incision.

172
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,660
Why?

173
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,930
We are expecting an influx

174
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,930
of trauma patients.

175
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,530
Per emergency protocol,

176
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,530
you and I will be

177
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,530
in charge of triage.

178
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,410
We need to ensure that

179
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,410
operating rooms are available

180
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,470
to the most

181
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,470
critical patients.

182
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,910
This man is not

183
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,910
one of them.

184
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,910
Close him up.

185
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,910
Yes, Doctor.

186
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,910
All right, look alive!

187
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,910
Here we go! Incoming!

188
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,350
Thirty-eight-year-old male.

189
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,350
Pulled from his minivan.

190
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,890
Mom and two kids

191
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,890
are on the way.

192
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,450
Here's the triage team.

193
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,760
GCS 12, hypotensive.

194
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,850
Clamped his temporal artery,

195
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,850
belly's distended.

196
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,990
All right, he's surgical.

197
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,290
Stabilize him,

198
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,290
and get him up to the OR.

199
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,830
Dr. Manning?

200
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,830
Got it.

201
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,730
All right. Dr. Choi.

202
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,700
Forty-year-old male, GCS 15,

203
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,700
satting 90% on a face mask.

204
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,800
Dr. Halstead?

205
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,800
Got it.

206
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,000
No, I got this one.

207
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,100
Severe burn.

208
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,100
Make him warm, comfortable,

209
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,100
and move on.

210
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,440
There's nothing more

211
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,440
you can do.

212
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,010
Naïma?

213
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,010
Sixty-three-year-old female.

214
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,100
Went through the windshield.

215
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,450
Triple zeros,

216
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,450
down for nearly 20 minutes.

217
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,450
Stand down.

218
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,650
Coming from a vehicle with

219
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,650
a high-deceleration injury.

220
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,520
Most likely a torn aorta.

221
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,520
We can't be sure.

222
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,380
Regardless,

223
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,380
asystole for 20 minutes.

224
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,220
This is not

225
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,220
a survivable injury.

226
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,220
Hold compressions.

227
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,620
Wait, let's

228
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,620
warm her up first.

229
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,960
Dr. Rhodes,

230
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,960
understand that today

231
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,220
we need to focus

232
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,220
our efforts on patients

233
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,790
with the best chance

234
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,790
of survival.

235
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,010
Please.

236
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,580
I need Helene. My wife.

237
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,620
Mr. Winter, we'll find her.

238
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,350
Just try to relax.

239
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,730
He needs an IO.

240
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,840
Mr. Winter,

241
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,840
I'm gonna have trouble

242
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,840
finding a vein.

243
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,380
I need to put

244
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,380
an IV in your leg.

245
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,380
It'll only take a second.

246
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,210
Dr. Choi,

247
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,210
what are you doing?

248
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,380
Putting in an IO.

249
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,510
Can I speak

250
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,510
with you?

251
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,510
Hang on one second.

252
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,750
I'm almost...

253
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,750
Now.

254
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,530
I'm in.

255
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,530
He's 95% TBSA.

256
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,030
Calculate his fluid

257
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,030
based on Parkland,

258
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,090
and run everything

259
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,090
through the warmer.

260
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,460
Copy.

261
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,630
I thought I told you

262
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,630
to make him comfortable

263
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,630
and move on.

264
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,400
Dr. Latham, standing by

265
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,400
while a patient dies

266
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,530
is not in my

267
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,530
job description.

268
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,510
He has full thickness burns

269
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,510
over 90% of his body.

270
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,910
There is no chance

271
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,910
of recovery.

272
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,010
He's awake, talking,

273
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,010
lucid, not in any pain.

274
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,340
As you well know,

275
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,340
he's not in pain,

276
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,280
because his cutaneous nerves

277
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,280
have been destroyed

278
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,280
by the burn.

279
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,820
Very soon, his organs

280
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,820
will begin to shut down.

281
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,910
He is going to die.

282
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,080
And treating him

283
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,820
will only take

284
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,820
resources away

285
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,790
from patients who have

286
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,790
a chance of survival.

287
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,600
Maggie!

288
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,600
Jeffrey.

289
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,270
Twenty-six-year-old female,

290
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,270
found passed out in the snow.

291
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,170
Thirty-five weeks pregnant.

292
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,170
Vitals stable.

293
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,600
Dr. Wheeler,

294
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,600
you're going to

295
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,600
Treatment Two.

296
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,660
Got it.

297
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,770
Stop.

298
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,680
Green is not

299
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,680
the proper designation.

300
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,300
An expectant mother

301
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,300
always takes priority.

302
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,920
Is my baby gonna be okay?

303
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,270
Don't worry, we're gonna

304
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,270
make sure both of you

305
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,270
are taken care of.

306
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,650
Okay.

307
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,650
I'll get some blankets.

308
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,330
On my count.

309
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,330
One, two, three.

310
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
They said you lost

311
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
consciousness.

312
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,290
Do you know

313
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,290
what happened?

314
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,290
I don't remember.

315
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,230
It all happened so fast.

316
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,830
I saw a cut on my arm,

317
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,830
and I went for help.

318
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,160
Next thing I know,

319
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,160
they're bringing me here.

320
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,040
Oh, your vitals look good.

321
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,340
What about my baby?

322
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,340
I'm checking now.

323
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,910
Baby's heartbeat

324
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,910
is strong.

325
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,580
Dr. Wheeler,

326
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,580
traumas are coming in hot.

327
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,580
You done here?

328
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,710
Uh, let's get her undressed,

329
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,710
and put her on

330
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,710
a fetal monitor.

331
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,440
Everything looks good.

332
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,440
I'll be back soon.

333
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,150
Pulled from the minivan.

334
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,520
This is Mom, Susan,

335
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,520
38 years old, GCS 15.

336
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,760
Right arm fracture,

337
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,760
complaining of back pain.

338
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,460
Son and nephew

339
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,460
are coming in behind us.

340
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,390
My husband, Blake.

341
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,390
How is he?

342
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,200
We've sent him up

343
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,200
to the OR already.

344
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,200
Belly's clear.

345
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,300
Get her to CT for

346
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,300
head and TLS spine.

347
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,900
Make sure there are

348
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,900
no vertebral fractures.

349
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,600
Take care of the boys.

350
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,600
We will.

351
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,110
Nine-year-old nephew, Josh.

352
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,110
GCS 15, vitals stable.

353
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,880
Got pinned in the backseat.

354
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,540
Bilateral femoral fractures,

355
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,540
one open.

356
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,540
His parents are

357
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,540
traveling abroad.

358
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,920
He's been staying

359
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,920
with his aunt and uncle.

360
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,280
All right, Dr. Manning?

361
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,280
Yep.

362
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,650
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

363
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,210
I'm gonna take

364
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,210
good care of you, okay?

365
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,210
Mmm-hmm.

366
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,350
I'm gonna give her

367
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,350
a hand.

368
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,090
All right, you're

369
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,090
going to Treatment Five.

370
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,090
Yep.

371
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,360
Talk to me.

372
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,360
Benjamin,

373
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,360
10-year-old son, GCS 15.

374
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,300
Abdominal pain,

375
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,300
mildly hypotensive

376
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,300
from possible blood loss.

377
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,900
Systolic, 100 over palp.

378
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,300
Dr. Halstead, red tag.

379
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,870
April.

380
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,870
You're going to

381
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,870
Treatment Four.

382
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,540
My hips! My hips!

383
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,440
Hang in there, champ.

384
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,440
We're gonna get you fixed up.

385
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,110
Four. Here.

386
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,110
Okay.

387
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,720
Okay, on my count.

388
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,720
One, two, three.

389
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,290
Thank you, gentlemen.

390
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,490
Breath sounds clear

391
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,490
and present bilaterally.

392
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,160
Hang another liter of saline

393
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,160
on the level one.

394
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,390
Yep.

395
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,970
How'd you get

396
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,970
to be so strong?

397
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,800
You're doing great.

398
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,370
Chest and belly clear.

399
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,570
Okay, honey.

400
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,810
BP 86 over 47.

401
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,810
Heart rate 135.

402
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,480
I know, I know.

403
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,480
Okay, okay, that's it,

404
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,480
just breathe.

405
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,570
Unstable pelvis

406
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,570
and hypotensive.

407
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,670
Close it down to

408
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,670
stop the bleeding?

409
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,740
Yeah, grab a sheet.

410
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,880
I need some help in here!

411
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,940
What do you need?

412
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,320
This might hurt.

413
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,320
Give him 25 mics

414
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,320
of fentanyl.

415
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,920
Copy.

416
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,790
Okay, honey. Okay.

417
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,620
All right, all right.

418
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,530
Okay,

419
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,530
make sure it's tight.

420
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,230
Okay. Fine.

421
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,000
Heart rate's coming down.

422
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,860
Bleeding's temporized

423
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,860
for now.

424
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,270
Let's get X-rays.

425
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,270
Chest and pelvis.

426
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,140
Let me know the second

427
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,140
there's an opening in

428
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,140
interventional radiology.

429
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,480
We need to embolize

430
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,480
the bleed.

431
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,480
Got it.

432
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,410
Chest and abdomen

433
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,410
are clear.

434
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,450
Cold foot. I can't get

435
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,450
a pulse on this leg.

436
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,820
Fracture's probably kinking

437
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,820
the femoral artery.

438
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,990
We've gotta

439
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,990
reduce this now.

440
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,260
Let's push

441
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,260
2 milligrams of Versed

442
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,260
and 25 mics fentanyl.

443
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,760
Okay, Josh,

444
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,760
we're gonna have to do

445
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,760
something right now,

446
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,320
and I need you to be

447
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,320
so brave for me.

448
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,900
Can you do that?

449
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,900
Yeah?

450
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,900
Uh-huh.

451
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,360
Yeah?

452
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,360
Are you ready?

453
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,800
All right,

454
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,800
one, two, three.

455
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,070
It's all done. That's it.

456
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,870
It's over. Great job.

457
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,580
All right. Get

458
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,580
a post-mold splint on him.

459
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,410
Page Ortho. He's gonna

460
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,410
need surgery to wash out

461
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,410
and ex-fix that fracture

462
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,150
as soon as

463
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,150
we can get an OR.

464
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,080
Are you all right?

465
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,650
Okay, can you keep

466
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,650
being brave like that?

467
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,650
Dr. Rhodes.

468
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,660
You are so brave.

469
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,660
So brave.

470
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,290
What happened?

471
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,860
I don't know.

472
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,860
She was alert and talking

473
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,860
a few minutes ago.

474
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,930
No pulse.

475
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,930
All right,

476
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,930
Clarke, intubate her.

477
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,400
April,

478
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,400
a milligram of epi.

479
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,400
On it.

480
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,100
Wheeler, get on

481
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,100
her chest now.

482
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,830
She's hemorrhaging.

483
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,970
Abruption from

484
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,970
the trauma?

485
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,740
That might explain

486
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,740
just a vaginal bleed,

487
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,740
but not this.

488
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,640
She's bleeding

489
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,640
around her IV.

490
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,270
Dr. Rhodes.

491
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,340
All right, likely

492
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,340
an amniotic

493
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,340
fluid embolism.

494
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,880
Impact from

495
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,880
the accident forced

496
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,880
amniotic fluid

497
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,120
into her bloodstream,

498
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,120
disrupted her

499
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,120
clotting factors.

500
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,650
Trigger the MTP.

501
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,220
We need to get

502
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,220
this baby out now.

503
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,690
Page OB?

504
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,690
No, there's no time.

505
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,360
We've got about four

506
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,360
minutes to deliver,

507
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,820
or we're gonna

508
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,820
lose her and the baby.

509
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,460
Tube's in.

510
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,460
Take over bagging.

511
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,460
Yes, Doctor.

512
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,660
All right,

513
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,660
splash prep her abdomen.

514
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,660
Give me the knife.

515
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,450
Clarke, pull.

516
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,250
There we go.

517
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,660
It's a girl.

518
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,660
April, cut the cord.

519
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,970
Clarke, start packing

520
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,970
her abdomen.

521
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,970
On it.

522
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,460
Got it.

523
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay.

524
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,000
The baby looks good.

525
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,600
April,

526
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,600
let's get her up

527
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,600
to the NICU.

528
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,640
On my way.

529
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,640
Okay.

530
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
All right, Wheeler,

531
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
hold compressions.

532
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,500
She's in v-fib.

533
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,870
Paddles.

534
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,650
Charge to 200.

535
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,650
Charge.

536
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,950
No.

537
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,950
Charge again.

538
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,090
Charge.

539
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,090
Clear.

540
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,760
Sinus tach, BP 70 over 33,

541
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,760
heart rate 130, oxygen 95%.

542
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,070
Set up a neo drip

543
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,070
at a 100 mics.

544
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,070
100 mics.

545
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,580
She looks like she's lost

546
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,580
about three liters.

547
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,580
How much have we given her?

548
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,970
Two packed red blood cells,

549
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,970
one FFP, two cryo.

550
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,110
Second batch is on its way

551
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,110
with more blood and cryo.

552
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,510
All right.

553
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,510
She's still bleeding.

554
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,020
Tell the blood bank

555
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,020
to keep sending us O-neg.

556
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,550
We'll finish

557
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,550
packing her here,

558
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,110
and then

559
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,110
we'll send her up to OB,

560
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,110
so they can close her.

561
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,680
Right.

562
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,100
Hey, Mr. Winter.

563
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,590
How are you feeling?

564
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,470
Cold.

565
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,270
That's to be expected.

566
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,210
The damage to your skin

567
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,210
caused you to lose heat.

568
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,610
We have another warmer

569
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,610
coming in for you.

570
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,880
Mr. Winter.

571
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,260
You're in burn shock.

572
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,620
Your organs are gonna

573
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,620
shut down soon.

574
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm...

575
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm dying?

576
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,830
Yes.

577
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,740
Keep me alive till

578
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,740
my wife gets here.

579
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,740
I wanna say goodbye.

580
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,090
We'll do everything we can.

581
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,560
Mr. Winter, your airways

582
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,560
are starting to swell.

583
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,060
We need to intubate you,

584
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,060
put you on a ventilator.

585
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,600
But I won't be able...

586
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,000
To talk.

587
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,570
When your wife gets here,

588
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,570
I'll remove the tube,

589
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,700
and you'll be...

590
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,540
And you'll be able

591
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,540
to say goodbye.

592
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,120
Twenty of etomidate

593
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,120
and 15 of rocuronium.

594
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,450
All right,

595
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,450
now for waiting room drama.

596
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,990
His name is Jack Kellogg.

597
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,390
Came in for

598
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,390
a Xanax refill.

599
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,990
How long you have

600
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,990
to wait around here?

601
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,990
Got bumped from

602
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,990
his treatment room.

603
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,630
Doesn't seem like

604
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,630
an emergency to me.

605
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,030
He's fine...

606
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,030
Might just be

607
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,030
hunting for drugs.

608
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,760
But if you think differently,

609
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,760
I'll send him upstairs.

610
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,670
Did he threaten to hurt

611
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,670
anybody or himself?

612
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,670
No. He's just

613
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,670
a pain in the ass.

614
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,670
I'll talk to him.

615
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,670
All right.

616
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,100
Mr. Kellogg.

617
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,100
I'm Dr. Charles.

618
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,610
I've been waiting

619
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,610
for over two hours.

620
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,580
Nobody cares.

621
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,580
I'm just a number.

622
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,770
I'm very sorry.

623
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,340
We have a major pileup

624
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,340
on the highway, and we're

625
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,340
in a triage situation...

626
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,790
It's not my problem.

627
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,090
Okay. Well, what seems

628
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,090
to be the trouble?

629
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,990
Cut the crap, all right?

630
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,990
"Blah, blah, blah."

631
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,790
I'm out of my meds.

632
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,790
Did you call your doctor?

633
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,190
He's out.

634
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,190
Why else would I be here?

635
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,060
How hard is it for you

636
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,060
to write me a prescription?

637
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,930
Well, we wanna make sure

638
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,930
you get the right medication,

639
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,930
the proper dosage.

640
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,060
Dr. Charles...

641
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,200
Could you hold on

642
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,200
a second?

643
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,240
I'm sorry,

644
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,240
but there's an emergency

645
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,240
in the psych ward.

646
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,900
A patient attacked a nurse.

647
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,900
They need you.

648
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,410
Mr. Kellogg,

649
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,410
I'm very sorry.

650
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,070
We are gonna take

651
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,070
excellent care of you,

652
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,810
but you're gonna have

653
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,810
to wait a little bit longer.

654
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,870
Oh, for God's sake.

655
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,010
I will be right back,

656
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,920
and I'm gonna make you one

657
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,920
of our first priorities.

658
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,850
"First priority."

659
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,850
Yeah, sure.

660
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,980
Look at me!

661
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,980
I'm a human being.

662
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,990
I'm a human being!

663
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,190
A human being!

664
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,460
Should we put him

665
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,460
on a psych hold?

666
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,190
No, he's not dangerous,

667
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,190
just pissed off.

668
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,960
Daniel, we're slammed

669
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,960
and short personnel.

670
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,130
I need to pull

671
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,130
Dr. Reese off your service

672
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,130
and put her to work here.

673
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,430
Go to it.

674
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,600
Reese, with me.

675
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,600
Okay.

676
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,190
Heart rate's 150,

677
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,190
BP 70 over 40.

678
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,190
What are his injuries?

679
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,090
Femoral fractures

680
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,090
in both legs.

681
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,750
Lots of soft tissue

682
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,750
injuries.

683
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,760
Looks like bilateral

684
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,760
thigh hematomas.

685
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,990
So, blood's

686
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,990
accumulating in his legs.

687
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,990
We need to transfuse him.

688
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,930
Yes, but first let's get

689
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,930
a liter of lactated ringers,

690
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,930
dopamine at 10,

691
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,400
titrate to

692
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,400
systolic BP of 90.

693
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,210
Maggie, need

694
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,210
some help in here!

695
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,270
Coming!

696
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,080
Blood pressure's

697
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,080
coming up, 80 over 50.

698
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,320
90 over 60.

699
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,320
He's stable for now.

700
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,720
Call up to the blood bank,

701
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,920
and tell them

702
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,920
we need two units of

703
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,920
O-negative for this boy.

704
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,430
I need the same

705
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,430
for his cousin

706
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,430
in the next room.

707
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,360
Okay, hold on.

708
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,360
You're both gonna have to talk

709
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,360
to Ms. Goodwin about this.

710
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,290
Because of

711
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,290
emergency surgeries,

712
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,070
and a pregnant mother's

713
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,070
serious bleeding disorder,

714
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,770
we have used almost

715
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,770
all of our O-negative.

716
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,100
We can either treat

717
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,100
Benjamin or Josh,

718
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,100
but not both.

719
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,550
Benjamin needs an angio

720
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,550
embolization more urgently

721
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,550
than Josh needs surgery.

722
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,610
How can you say that?

723
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,780
Josh isn't compensating

724
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,780
for his blood loss as well.

725
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,980
He's in worse shape.

726
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,490
I understand you're trying

727
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,490
to protect your patient,

728
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,650
but you're being

729
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,650
emotional.

730
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,120
"Emotional"?

731
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,290
And what are you being?

732
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,660
Our recommendation

733
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,660
needs to be based solely

734
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,660
on clinical criteria.

735
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,890
So I'm handing it over

736
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,890
to the triage team.

737
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,330
Dr. Rhodes,

738
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,330
your opinion?

739
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,000
I have to agree

740
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,000
with Dr. Halstead

741
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,330
that Benjamin needs

742
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,330
angio embolization

743
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,340
more urgently than

744
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,340
Josh needs surgery.

745
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,240
Not the issue.

746
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,240
We're here to decide

747
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,110
who has the best chance

748
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,110
of survival, so...

749
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,120
Unfortunately,

750
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,120
even if Benjamin gets

751
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,120
the embolization,

752
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,590
there's only a 15% chance

753
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,590
that the bleeding in

754
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,590
his pelvis will stop.

755
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,980
Exactly.

756
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,120
Whereas with

757
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,120
Dr. Manning's patient,

758
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,120
as the pressure in

759
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,120
his thighs builds,

760
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,430
the bleeding will

761
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,430
eventually slow.

762
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,570
Worst case,

763
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,570
Josh loses a leg,

764
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,630
but there is no question

765
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,630
he has the best chance of

766
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,630
survival.

767
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,510
I don't understand.

768
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,510
We're very sorry.

769
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,550
But it's up

770
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,550
to you to decide which of

771
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,550
the boys gets the blood.

772
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,880
Decide who gets the blood?

773
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,250
The doctors have

774
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,250
their opinion,

775
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,120
but it is a decision

776
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,120
you and your husband

777
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,120
should make,

778
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,990
and he's still in surgery.

779
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,660
But, without blood,

780
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,660
is one of them gonna die?

781
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,000
It is a possibility,

782
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,500
but we are gonna do

783
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,500
whatever we can to

784
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,500
prevent that.

785
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,770
And you want me to

786
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,770
decide between my son

787
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,770
and my sister's?

788
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,600
But how?

789
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,380
Our recommendation

790
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,380
is to give the blood

791
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,380
to your nephew, Josh.

792
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,880
Josh? Why?

793
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,580
Because he has

794
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,580
the greater chance

795
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,580
of survival.

796
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,780
That means Ben...

797
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,410
We are gonna do

798
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,410
our best to keep him alive

799
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,410
until we have more blood.

800
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,750
How can you make me

801
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,750
do this?

802
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,790
I can't.

803
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,130
I can't.

804
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,130
If you'd prefer,

805
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,320
we can make the decision

806
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,320
on your behalf.

807
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,930
Mrs. Porter, I assure you,

808
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,700
we will do what's medically

809
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,700
and ethically correct.

810
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,750
You'll be all right.

811
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,750
No, no, stay still.

812
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,820
Dr. Rhodes, I hear

813
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,820
we're running

814
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,820
out of O-neg.

815
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,620
No, we have

816
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,620
run out of O-neg.

817
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,620
Wait.

818
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,530
Is this because of

819
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,530
the woman with the

820
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,530
amniotic fluid embolism?

821
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,760
Partly, yes.

822
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,760
Dr. Rhodes!

823
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,460
She didn't present with

824
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,460
any of the symptoms.

825
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,160
No hypotension,

826
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,160
shortness of

827
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,160
breath, chills...

828
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,230
Wheeler,

829
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,230
nobody's blaming you.

830
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,610
I understand.

831
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,610
We're going to do

832
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,610
all we can.

833
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,910
Leah, there was

834
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,910
a fella out here before,

835
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,910
a Mr. Kellogg?

836
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,820
That guy.

837
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,920
Yeah, did you see

838
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,920
what happened to him?

839
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,620
Stormed out. Said

840
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,620
he was tired of waiting.

841
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,660
You should've

842
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,660
heard the language.

843
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,130
I don't appreciate being

844
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,130
talked to like that.

845
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,490
Yeah.

846
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,010
His color's

847
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,010
already improving.

848
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,940
Heart rate's down to 119.

849
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,940
BP's up, 118 over 84.

850
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,360
Albumin and platelets

851
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,360
aren't gonna cut it.

852
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,360
That kid needs blood.

853
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,830
I know.

854
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,600
Hey.

855
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,670
We've contacted

856
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,670
Mr. Winter's wife.

857
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,850
She's doing her best

858
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,850
to get here.

859
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,320
Mr. Winter,

860
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,320
did you hear that?

861
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,690
BP's down to 80 over 40.

862
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,190
Hey. Hey.

863
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,030
Hang in there.

864
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,580
Hey.

865
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,100
How's Mr. Winter?

866
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,370
I'm sorry.

867
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,210
Yeah.

868
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,560
And I'm sorry

869
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,560
to have to tell you this,

870
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,560
but we're out of ventilators.

871
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,450
No.

872
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,450
We've got emergency cases

873
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,220
who are coming out of

874
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,220
surgery who need them.

875
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,060
The only choice we've got

876
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,060
is to take them from

877
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,060
our terminal patients.

878
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,630
I can't.

879
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,040
That ventilator's not

880
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,040
gonna save his life, Ethan.

881
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,040
You know that.

882
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,810
All he wants is

883
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,810
to stay alive long enough

884
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,810
to say goodbye to his wife.

885
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,010
She's trying to get here.

886
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,010
Man, I understand.

887
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,710
Look, in the field,

888
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,710
so many times,

889
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,310
a wounded soldier will

890
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,310
call out for a loved one,

891
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,310
a mother, a wife.

892
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,550
There's nothing

893
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,550
I could do.

894
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,020
Come on, man.

895
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,390
Let's give this man

896
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,390
his dying wish.

897
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,760
I'm sorry, man.

898
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,770
I can do it for you.

899
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,740
I can take him off

900
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,740
the ventilator myself.

901
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,480
No.

902
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,470
He's my patient.

903
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,080
I will.

904
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,900
Mr. Winter.

905
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,140
As you know,

906
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,940
your condition is going

907
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,940
to continue to deteriorate.

908
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,550
I'm sorry,

909
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,550
but the hospital is in

910
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,550
an emergency situation,

911
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,380
and I've just been informed

912
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,380
that I need to disconnect

913
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,380
you from this ventilator.

914
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,090
It's needed for other

915
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,090
patients who have a better

916
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,090
chance of surviving.

917
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,470
I know.

918
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,280
Here's what I can do.

919
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,240
I can help you

920
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,240
breathe manually,

921
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,720
until your wife

922
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,720
gets here, all right?

923
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,420
April, pull the ventilator.

924
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,420
Yeah.

925
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,290
I'll bag him myself.

926
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,470
Thank you, Doris.

927
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,410
I just told Dr. Choi

928
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,410
to take his patient

929
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,410
off the ventilator.

930
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,510
Hmm. Right.

931
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,820
Dr. Latham,

932
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,820
don't you feel anything?

933
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,630
Do you mean, am I empathetic?

934
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,630
Do I feel what others feel?

935
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,900
Dr. Rhodes,

936
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,900
one can lack empathy,

937
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,900
but still feel compassion.

938
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,580
Sarah.

939
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,020
You liking psychiatry?

940
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,030
Uh, parts of it.

941
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,030
Yeah.

942
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,360
I'm thinking

943
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,360
about psychiatry.

944
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,990
I'm not sure the ED

945
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,990
is the best fit.

946
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,830
Um, let me ask you

947
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,830
something.

948
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,400
Day's got me

949
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,400
a little stressed.

950
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,540
Could you write me

951
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,540
a prescription for

952
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,540
KlonoPlN?

953
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,670
Um...

954
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,270
Don't you have

955
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,270
your own doctor?

956
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,080
Actually, no. Uh,

957
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,080
I never felt the need.

958
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,850
I only want a few pills.

959
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,850
You know, take the edge off.

960
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,250
Jason, I'm sorry, but

961
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,250
I'd have to ask Dr. Charles.

962
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,690
Really?

963
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,030
Hey, you know what,

964
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,030
never mind.

965
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,190
I didn't mean to

966
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,190
put you on the spot.

967
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,190
It's no big deal.

968
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,370
Are you sure?

969
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,370
Yeah, I'll be fine.

970
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,730
Forget I asked.

971
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,800
Uh-huh.

972
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,870
Uh-huh. Wait, do you wanna

973
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,870
talk to his resident?

974
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,280
Wait, he's right here.

975
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,210
Dr. Charles,

976
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,210
the brother of the patient

977
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,450
that you saw in

978
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,450
the waiting room.

979
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,450
The one who left?

980
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,190
Oh, Jack Kellogg, great.

981
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,190
Mmm-hmm.

982
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,550
This is Dr. Charles.

983
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,550
Please tell your

984
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,550
brother that I'm...

985
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,960
What?

986
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,500
I am...

987
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,640
I'm so very...

988
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,980
Uh...

989
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,680
Is there anything

990
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,680
that we can...

991
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,470
Hello?

992
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,390
Jack Kellogg shot himself.

993
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,390
He's dead.

994
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,470
Dr. Charles?

995
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,980
I changed lanes.

996
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,110
Next thing I know,

997
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,110
we were hit.

998
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,150
Truck came

999
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,150
out of nowhere.

1000
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,610
I'm just glad

1001
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,610
you're okay.

1002
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,750
What about the boys?

1003
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,200
They're both at the hospital

1004
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,200
and receiving treatment.

1005
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,000
Thank God.

1006
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,800
Josh broke his legs,

1007
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,800
and Benjamin suffered

1008
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,800
a pelvic fracture.

1009
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,800
Pelvis?

1010
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,210
You can fix that, right?

1011
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,780
I'm afraid it's

1012
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,780
a bit more complicated

1013
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,780
than that, Mr. Porter.

1014
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,880
Both boys lost a lot

1015
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,880
of blood, and both

1016
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,880
needed transfusions.

1017
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,320
However, the accident

1018
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,320
combined with the storm

1019
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,320
created a shortage.

1020
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,620
We only had enough

1021
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,620
for one.

1022
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,120
For one?

1023
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,630
Honey, please... It was

1024
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,630
an impossible choice.

1025
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
I don't understand.

1026
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
What are you saying?

1027
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,530
You gave the blood to Josh?

1028
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,280
She didn't.

1029
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,280
We did.

1030
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,410
We decided that Josh had

1031
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,410
the best chance of survival.

1032
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,710
"Survival"?

1033
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,340
What about Benny?

1034
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,980
We are doing

1035
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,980
everything that we can,

1036
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,980
but he needs blood.

1037
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,990
Okay, I'll donate.

1038
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,990
I'm sorry, sir.

1039
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,020
But neither you nor

1040
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,020
your wife are a match.

1041
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,930
You must've

1042
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,930
approved this.

1043
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,930
I...

1044
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,430
I can't believe it.

1045
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,430
You should've made them

1046
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,430
give the blood to Ben.

1047
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,070
Josh, he's my sister's son.

1048
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,070
How could I just...

1049
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,800
So you're okay with

1050
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,800
letting our own son die?

1051
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,110
What kind of mother are you?

1052
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,010
I cannot imagine

1053
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,010
the difficulty this must

1054
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,010
be for the two of you,

1055
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,380
but again, we are doing

1056
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,380
everything that we can.

1057
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,020
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1058
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,920
Sixteen critical,

1059
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,920
twenty-four stable,

1060
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,920
seven treated and released.

1061
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,480
All remaining have

1062
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,480
been accounted for

1063
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,620
and assigned their

1064
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,620
proper designation.

1065
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,030
Thank you, Dr. Latham.

1066
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,730
Ms. Goodwin, if Benjamin

1067
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,730
doesn't get blood soon,

1068
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,890
he's not gonna make it.

1069
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,400
Dr. Manning,

1070
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,400
we discussed this.

1071
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,800
I know,

1072
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,800
but I have an idea.

1073
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,410
So, let's adjust her

1074
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,410
Ativan to Q2-hours,

1075
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,410
and with Q4-hour vitals.

1076
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,410
See if that doesn't

1077
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,410
calm her down.

1078
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,410
Yes, Doctor.

1079
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,240
Dr. Charles.

1080
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,950
Um, about what happened

1081
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,950
with that patient...

1082
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,580
Yeah, that

1083
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,580
was unfortunate.

1084
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,360
No, what I mean, um,

1085
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,490
is there was no way

1086
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,490
you could've known.

1087
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,330
It's emergency medicine,

1088
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,330
Dr. Reese.

1089
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,790
We make

1090
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,790
these evaluations

1091
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,790
very quickly,

1092
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,330
and these kind

1093
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,330
of things happen.

1094
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,260
Of course.

1095
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,800
I was just concerned

1096
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,800
because of your history.

1097
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,100
Oh.

1098
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,810
Look, I have lost patients

1099
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,810
to suicide before, and

1100
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,810
I undoubtedly will again.

1101
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,380
I appreciate your concern,

1102
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,940
but it's just the cost

1103
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,940
of doing business.

1104
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,810
Oh.

1105
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,150
Okay.

1106
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,370
Okay.

1107
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,370
Thank you.

1108
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,010
Good.

1109
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,310
Okay.

1110
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,980
Hey.

1111
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,550
Came as soon as I could.

1112
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,620
Yeah. Replenishing the bank,

1113
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,620
and hoping to find

1114
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,620
a match for your patient.

1115
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,950
Dr. Halstead jumps to

1116
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,950
the front of the line.

1117
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,260
Done.

1118
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,260
Thank you, Maggie.

1119
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,960
Don't thank me.

1120
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,590
Thank her.

1121
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,590
It was her idea.

1122
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,320
Paramedics just brought

1123
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,320
in a hemothorax.

1124
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,190
Dr. Rhodes needs you

1125
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,190
to put in a chest tube.

1126
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,550
What about his wife?

1127
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,550
Have we heard anything?

1128
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,060
She's stuck in the storm,

1129
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,060
still trying to get here.

1130
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,460
Then ask Dr. Rhodes to have

1131
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,460
one of the other residents

1132
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,460
do it.

1133
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,200
Dr. Choi...

1134
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,200
He just needs

1135
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,200
a little more time.

1136
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,300
I'm so sorry.

1137
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,290
Time of death, 15:37.

1138
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,390
BP's down,

1139
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,390
heart rate's up to 152.

1140
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,890
We could add

1141
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,890
another presser.

1142
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,290
He's peri-arrest.

1143
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,290
His heart's working

1144
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,290
to compensate.

1145
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,230
We've tried every

1146
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,230
stopgap we have.

1147
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,890
Without oxygen-rich

1148
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,890
red blood cells,

1149
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,140
I'm afraid

1150
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,140
there's nothing more

1151
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,140
we can do for him.

1152
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,370
Ms. Goodwin, we typed

1153
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,370
a few universal donors

1154
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,380
in the doctors' lounge.

1155
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,380
What is taking so long?

1156
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,110
Everything has to go

1157
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,110
through the lab.

1158
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,640
If we transfuse blood

1159
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,640
that hasn't been screened

1160
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,080
for HIV and hepatitis,

1161
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,950
we are in direct violation

1162
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,950
of FDA guidelines.

1163
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,590
We'll just have to wait.

1164
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,920
Now, hold on,

1165
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,920
I'm O-negative. I'm screened

1166
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,920
routinely by the Navy.

1167
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,960
I don't know

1168
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,960
if military testing

1169
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,960
meets our standards.

1170
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,060
Please. If this could

1171
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,060
save my boy...

1172
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,990
Heart rate's up to 160.

1173
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,460
Connect me to a bag now.

1174
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,770
We can push whole

1175
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,770
blood directly through

1176
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,770
the rapid transfuser.

1177
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,070
Ms. Goodwin?

1178
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,730
Okay. Do it.

1179
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,150
I've put him

1180
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,150
in room P-Ten.

1181
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,520
Earl, I got your text.

1182
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,520
What's the emergency?

1183
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,920
Yeah, found

1184
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,920
this guy holed up

1185
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,920
in a patient room.

1186
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,080
Not even registered.

1187
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,720
Had his feet up,

1188
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,720
watching TV like

1189
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,720
he owns the place.

1190
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,000
Said he was

1191
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,000
Dr. Charles' patient,

1192
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,000
so I brought him here.

1193
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,300
But your brother

1194
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,300
called and said...

1195
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,640
It wasn't my brother.

1196
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,640
It was me.

1197
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,300
Dr. Charles

1198
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,300
thought you were dead.

1199
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,370
Well, maybe I finally

1200
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,370
got through to him.

1201
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,080
Think he'll see me now?

1202
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,570
Mr. Kellogg.

1203
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,950
I am so grateful that

1204
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,950
you're still alive.

1205
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,160
And that I get

1206
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,160
to treat you.

1207
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,850
I just want my meds.

1208
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,850
Yeah.

1209
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,060
It doesn't really

1210
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,060
work that way.

1211
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,290
You see, your behavior

1212
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,290
indicates a pretty profound

1213
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,290
personality disorder.

1214
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,530
Off the cuff,

1215
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,530
among other things,

1216
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,060
I'd say you're probably

1217
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,060
a malignant narcissist with

1218
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,060
overt sadistic impulses.

1219
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,330
You've got no right

1220
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,330
to talk to me...

1221
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,970
Shut your mouth.

1222
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,970
Dr. Charles.

1223
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,740
Maybe I should just go.

1224
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,740
No, no, no.

1225
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,410
I'm so sorry,

1226
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,410
but I gotta put you on

1227
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,410
a 72-hour psychiatric hold

1228
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,110
for your own good.

1229
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,110
What? Seventy-two hours?

1230
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,680
You wanted my attention,

1231
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,680
and now you have it.

1232
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,100
BP's coming up.

1233
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,100
Heart rate's going down.

1234
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,960
Thank you, Ethan.

1235
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,000
Of course.

1236
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,140
Good news.

1237
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,110
We should be able to get

1238
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,110
him up to interventional

1239
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,110
radiology soon.

1240
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,090
Susan?

1241
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,630
His father was right.

1242
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,630
I was willing

1243
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,630
to let him die.

1244
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,890
No.

1245
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,830
No, we made the decision

1246
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,830
to give Josh the blood.

1247
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,260
But that doesn't mean

1248
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,260
we ever gave up on your son.

1249
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,470
I'm his mother.

1250
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,470
I should've fought for him.

1251
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,570
What will he think

1252
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,570
when he finds out?

1253
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,900
Hi, uh, I'm looking

1254
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,900
for my husband.

1255
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,530
They said he was burned

1256
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,530
in the accident.

1257
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,900
His name is Rod Winter.

1258
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,670
Oh, his doctor is not

1259
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,670
available right now,

1260
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,230
but if you can wait

1261
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,230
in the waiting room...

1262
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,330
Mrs. Winter.

1263
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,740
Uh, hi, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

1264
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,740
Uh, I can speak with you

1265
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,740
about your husband.

1266
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,870
Please.

1267
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,720
Blood finally arrived.

1268
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,720
Good.

1269
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,060
Hey,

1270
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,060
I'm sorry for calling you

1271
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,060
"emotional" earlier.

1272
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,160
You know,

1273
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,160
you spend a lot of time

1274
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,160
apologizing to me.

1275
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,200
Well, there are

1276
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,200
a very few people

1277
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,200
I care more about.

1278
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,410
Good night, Will.

1279
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,580
Night, Natalie.

1280
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,470
Snow's letting up.

1281
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,470
Supplies are

1282
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,470
coming in finally.

1283
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,540
Rough day.

1284
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,110
I was glad to be

1285
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,110
back in the ED.

1286
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,910
You can fix people's bodies,

1287
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,910
but their minds...

1288
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,610
I envied you today.

1289
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,980
Making those decisions

1290
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,980
clinically,

1291
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,490
not letting

1292
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,490
your emotions interfere.

1293
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,530
Dr. Rhodes,

1294
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,530
are you saying

1295
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,530
you envy my autism?

1296
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,360
A little bit, yeah.
