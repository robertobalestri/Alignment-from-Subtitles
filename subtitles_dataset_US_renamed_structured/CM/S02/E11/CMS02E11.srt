1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,360
Clear!

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,400
Continue. Charging, 360.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,400
Charging, 360.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,460
Clear!

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,000
Continue. Charging, 360.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,280
Clear!

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,280
Clear.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,520
Come on. Come on!

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,550
Asystole.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,270
I'm gonna call it.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,270
Any objections?

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,100
Time of death, 18:20.

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,030
He was looking

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,030
at me.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,770
He didn't want to die.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,640
Just shooting hoops.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,240
Some guys drove by

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,240
and popped him.

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,250
I'm sorry about that,

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,250
Dr. Choi.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,980
Goodwin just paged.

22
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,350
She wants to

23
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,350
discuss your request.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,260
Hey, I'm taking off.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,260
You coming?

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,530
No. I just got to wait

27
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,530
for Rita to get here,

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,530
but you go ahead.

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,200
All right.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,530
See you tomorrow.

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,530
Yeah. See you.

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,870
Aren't you taking off?

33
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,540
Nah. Pulling another shift.

34
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,580
Malpractice premiums are due.

35
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,210
Maybe it'll be an easy night.

36
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,650
Don't jinx it.

37
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,550
I look at her as just

38
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,550
another patient.

39
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,110
But clearly she isn't.

40
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,820
If there is a bad outcome,

41
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,800
does this thing become

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,800
an international incident?

43
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,530
We have consent

44
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,530
from all parties.

45
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,660
The State Department's

46
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,660
been apprised.

47
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,070
You know, there is

48
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,070
a potential upside to this,

49
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,700
as long as you pull it off.

50
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,810
So, all right.

51
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,810
Let's keep it under wraps.

52
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,280
Everyone involved

53
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,280
signs a non-disclosure.

54
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,770
Yes, ma'am.

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,350
Dr. Halstead,

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,350
incoming times three.

57
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,110
One, two, and three

58
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,110
are all open.

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,120
Desmond?

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,120
15-year-old male,

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,120
extremely combative.

62
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,680
Trashed our ambo

63
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,680
on the ride over.

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,660
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

65
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,960
No way

66
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,960
to get vitals.

67
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,090
Managed to stick him

68
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,090
with 5 of Versed

69
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,090
but no effect.

70
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,140
Looks like PCP maybe.

71
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,140
Got two more

72
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,140
in the ambo behind ours.

73
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,730
10 of Haldol IM.

74
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,530
The other two like this?

75
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,830
I think they all

76
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,830
took the same thing.

77
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,030
All right.

78
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,470
They're here.

79
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,140
Wheeler, stay with him.

80
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,140
Clarke with me.

81
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,940
Okay, watch his feet.

82
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,940
Got it.

83
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,640
"Easy night." She jinxed it.

84
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,720
Cesar?

85
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,720
15-year-old boy.

86
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,720
He seized on the ride over,

87
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,720
but responded well

88
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,720
to 5 of Versed IM.

89
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,690
We intubated en route.

90
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,690
All right. ABCs.

91
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,420
Check the tube placement,

92
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,420
get a quick exam.

93
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,290
Ativan drip,

94
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,290
then send him for head CT.

95
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,350
Got it.

96
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,190
Watch the lines.

97
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,190
Coming back.

98
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,560
Courtney?

99
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,970
Gave her 5 of Versed

100
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,970
in the ambo,

101
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,970
but didn't stop the seizing.

102
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,860
Have her on oxygen,

103
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,860
but couldn't

104
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,860
give her much else.

105
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,540
All right, Maggie, CBC, CMP,

106
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,540
and blood gas on all three.

107
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,870
Send blood and urine

108
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,870
for a tox screen.

109
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,470
Copy that.

110
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,740
On my count.

111
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,740
One, two, three.

112
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,450
Let's get an IV in

113
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,450
and an NPA.

114
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,450
Yes, Doctor.

115
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,750
All right,

116
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,750
I need an 18 catheter.

117
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,750
On it.

118
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,720
Get an NG tube.

119
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,720
All right.

120
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,680
He's 90 over 60.

121
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,280
Heart rate might be low.

122
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,980
Okay, let's move him.

123
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,090
Okay, here we go.

124
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,800
She's protecting

125
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,800
her airway.

126
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,030
Thank you.

127
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,870
Okay, we're in.

128
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,200
Sat of 97%.

129
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,260
All right.

130
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,740
Let's take advantage

131
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,740
of her postictal state

132
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,040
and get her head scanned.

133
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,840
Hey, bring Ativan with you.

134
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,240
Mmm-hmm.

135
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,150
Here we go.

136
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,150
Watch your back.

137
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,790
Look alive,

138
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,790
Dr. Halstead.

139
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,520
It's a broad presentation.

140
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,520
Are we sure they're all

141
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,520
on the same thing?

142
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,390
Till we get tox screens,

143
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,390
who knows?

144
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,400
I hope you don't mind that

145
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,400
I'm dating your boyfriend.

146
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,600
No, of course not.

147
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,600
Why would I mind?

148
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,310
Can we still

149
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,310
be friends?

150
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,870
Sure.

151
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,140
I'll be your maid of honor.

152
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,250
So, what do you think?

153
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,820
Well, I don't understand

154
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,820
why that woman doesn't mind.

155
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,020
Her friend betrayed her.

156
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,720
Hmm.

157
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,390
You sure she doesn't mind?

158
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,020
She said she didn't.

159
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,800
Um...

160
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,360
So, after reading

161
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,360
the material I gave you,

162
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,860
you told me that

163
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,860
you suspected...

164
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,240
That I'm on

165
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,240
the autism spectrum,

166
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,240
that I have Asperger's.

167
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,430
Right.

168
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,210
So, how'd you feel

169
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,210
if I told you

170
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,910
that I thought

171
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,910
that your diagnosis

172
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,310
could very well be correct?

173
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,610
Relieved, actually.

174
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,350
My whole life,

175
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,350
I've never understood

176
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,110
why people treated me

177
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,110
the way they did.

178
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,050
I felt there had to be

179
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,050
something wrong with me.

180
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,650
Not wrong.

181
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,850
I mean, it's just

182
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,850
different wiring, that's all.

183
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,060
Is there anything

184
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,060
we can do to change

185
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,060
that wiring?

186
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,750
Well, our wiring

187
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,750
is pretty much our wiring,

188
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,860
but there's a whole bevy of

189
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,860
strategies out there.

190
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,330
I mean, medications,

191
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,770
um, social skills training

192
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,770
to help you recognize

193
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,770
body language...

194
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,740
There's also a new therapy

195
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,740
called TMS,

196
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,870
but I'd probably

197
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,870
recommend you going

198
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,870
the traditional routes first.

199
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,270
TMS?

200
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,850
Transcranial

201
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,850
magnetic stimulation.

202
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,450
It's so far FDA approved

203
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,450
only for depression,

204
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,180
but there is

205
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,180
anecdotal evidence

206
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,960
that it can benefit people

207
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,960
with spectrum disorders.

208
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,590
I only mention it because

209
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,590
we have a machine here

210
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,590
at the hospital.

211
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,950
Well, I will do

212
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,950
some research.

213
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
I am needed in the OR.

214
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes. Um...

215
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,370
Dr. Charles, this has all

216
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,370
been very comforting.

217
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,300
Thank you.

218
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,300
Of course.

219
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,380
Hey, Maggie.

220
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,380
Hey.

221
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,820
Rita just called.

222
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,820
She came down with the flu.

223
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,480
We're gonna be

224
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,480
short tonight.

225
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,190
I know what that means.

226
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,190
Another shift.

227
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,160
Well, think how much money

228
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,160
you'll be making.

229
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,260
Ms. Goodwin?

230
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,260
Yes?

231
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,130
The patient's arriving.

232
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,130
Okay.

233
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,000
Bring her up

234
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,000
through the loading dock

235
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,160
and use

236
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,160
the service elevator.

237
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,640
Sure.

238
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,640
Loading dock?

239
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,740
Uh... I'll tell you later.

240
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,930
Okay.

241
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,710
Crows!

242
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,510
Get them away!

243
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,510
5 of Haldol, please.

244
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,410
They're in the...

245
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,410
It's all right.

246
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,410
We're taking care of those.

247
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,580
They're in the house!

248
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,210
No, no, no.

249
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,210
We're taking care

250
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,210
of those.

251
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,690
We're taking care

252
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,690
of those.

253
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,850
We're taking care

254
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,850
of those right now.

255
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,830
There we go.

256
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,460
There we go.

257
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,720
Okay.

258
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,390
You know, two out of

259
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,390
three patients in here

260
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,160
end up developing delirium?

261
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,230
From a fever?

262
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,230
She has pneumonia.

263
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,830
Well, it's

264
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,830
a contributing factor,

265
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,540
but it's also

266
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,540
the ICU itself.

267
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,640
Bright lights,

268
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,640
the endless beeping,

269
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,380
constant prodding

270
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,380
and poking.

271
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,910
I mean,

272
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,910
the woman's exhausted.

273
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,080
Hey, Hank, could we maybe

274
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,080
turn the lights down

275
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,080
in Ms. Novak's room?

276
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,350
Maybe quiet the monitors

277
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,350
a little bit?

278
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,440
Also, I don't think

279
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,440
you need to be

280
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,750
going in and out of there

281
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,750
every 20 minutes, okay?

282
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,840
The woman needs some rest.

283
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,050
Sure.

284
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,050
Thank you.

285
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,320
I spoke to my mom today,

286
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,320
told her I was

287
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,320
a psych resident.

288
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,190
What, just now

289
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,190
you're telling her?

290
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,130
Well, yeah.

291
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,130
I knew how she'd react,

292
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,860
and I was right.

293
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,860
She laughed.

294
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,670
She said I was

295
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,670
the last person

296
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,670
she could ever imagine

297
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,800
being a psychiatrist.

298
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,140
Wow, real vote of

299
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,140
confidence there.

300
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,140
Mmm-hmm.

301
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,540
Do I get to meet

302
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,540
your mom someday?

303
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,740
You seeing

304
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,740
what I'm seeing?

305
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,740
Yeah.

306
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,510
We need a CT surgeon now.

307
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,150
Page Dr. Latham?

308
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,720
He's in surgery.

309
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,720
Get Dr. Rhodes.

310
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,760
He's not on call.

311
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,760
Tell him

312
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,760
it's an emergency.

313
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,970
I'm puzzled by this chart,

314
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,970
Dr. Wheeler.

315
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,970
Did you do a rectal exam?

316
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,310
I didn't think in this case

317
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,310
it was necessary.

318
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,670
It's always necessary.

319
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,410
It's a part of

320
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,410
the physical exam,

321
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,410
and it's expected.

322
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,280
I've seen

323
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,280
too many things missed

324
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,910
because feckless residents

325
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,910
don't do a complete physical.

326
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,380
What's the troll

327
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,380
still doing here?

328
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,150
Doesn't he have

329
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,150
a bridge somewhere

330
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,150
to go home to?

331
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,320
How's your boy?

332
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,420
Still out.

333
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,090
All right.

334
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,090
CTs were all negative.

335
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,090
No swelling, no bleeds.

336
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,660
Tox screens

337
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,660
are also negative.

338
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,870
Rules out usual suspects,

339
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,870
heroin, meth, cocaine.

340
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,330
Then what?

341
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,100
Some synthetic cannabinoid.

342
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,170
What's your patient's

343
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,170
heart rate?

344
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,910
Slow. 50.

345
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,870
Bradycardia. Rules out MDMA.

346
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,370
Mmm-hmm.

347
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,810
See a lot of that

348
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,810
in the field.

349
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,610
You think we're looking

350
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,610
at spice?

351
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,610
Spice?

352
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,110
It's fake weed.

353
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,580
And it could be mixed

354
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,580
with a number of things.

355
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,540
Flakka, krokodil.

356
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,540
Right.

357
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,320
None of that would show up

358
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,320
on a tox screen either.

359
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,820
Nope.

360
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,480
I hope one of them

361
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,480
comes to and tells us.

362
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,930
Meanwhile, stay with

363
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,930
the standard OD protocol,

364
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,930
benzos and fluids.

365
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,450
Got it.

366
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,800
Oh, yes. Very nice.

367
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,900
Charity event at

368
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,900
the Art Institute.

369
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,230
Hi, Maggie.

370
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,360
Robin.

371
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,970
You concur?

372
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,970
Atrial septal defect.

373
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,670
But you feel

374
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,670
it's an emergency?

375
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,870
Well, the patient's

376
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,870
already anesthetized.

377
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,250
For just a CT?

378
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,250
Is she mentally compromised?

379
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,740
No.

380
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Wait. This doesn't

381
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
look right.

382
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,320
The ribcage.

383
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,320
Pectus carinatum.

384
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,320
Is she deformed?

385
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,020
Come meet her.

386
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,320
Okay.

387
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,560
I'm really sorry

388
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,560
about this.

389
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,560
It's okay.

390
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,300
I'll wait in

391
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,300
the doctors' lounge.

392
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,930
Come find you

393
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,930
in a little bit.

394
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,930
Mmm-hmm.

395
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, here he is. Dr. Rhodes.

396
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,000
Thank you for coming in.

397
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,910
This is Mr. Hseih

398
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,910
from the Chinese Embassy.

399
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,910
Dr. Rhodes.

400
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,810
Mr. Woodfield,

401
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,810
the director of

402
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,810
the Chicago Zoo.

403
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,310
Doctor.

404
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,980
And the chief veterinarian,

405
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,980
Dr. Evans.

406
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,520
Uh, zoo?

407
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,120
Your patient.

408
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,630
Meet Su Lin.

409
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,370
So, this was your idea?

410
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,280
Dr. Choi volunteers

411
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,280
at the zoo.

412
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,780
Normally, we wouldn't bring

413
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,780
an animal in here,

414
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,150
but we couldn't

415
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,150
diagnose without a CT.

416
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,620
Well, that's fine,

417
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,620
but I'm not a veterinarian.

418
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,080
She needs

419
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,080
a cardiothoracic surgeon.

420
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,430
You've done this

421
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,430
procedure many times.

422
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,520
Oh, yeah, I have.

423
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,520
On human beings.

424
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,260
Same plumbing, just bigger.

425
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,260
Crack her chest

426
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,260
and plug the hole.

427
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,600
I can't... No,

428
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,600
I can't just crack

429
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,600
her chest.

430
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,870
She'll lose too much blood,

431
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,870
and what am I supposed to

432
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,870
transfuse with?

433
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,170
Do we have panda

434
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,170
in the blood bank?

435
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,970
So, how do we treat her?

436
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,300
Um...

437
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,490
I guess I would have

438
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,490
to take her up

439
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,490
to the cath lab

440
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,220
and close the defect

441
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,220
with a balloon.

442
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,890
Okay. Then do it.

443
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Really?

444
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
Are we sure that

445
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
we're all comfortable

446
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
spending our time

447
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,470
and the hospital's resources

448
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,470
to save an animal?

449
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,270
Dr. Rhodes,

450
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,470
zoos rent pandas

451
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,470
from the Chinese government

452
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,470
for a million dollars a year.

453
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,550
Why? Because people

454
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,550
love pandas.

455
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,290
So, if we save this one,

456
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,290
it's a public relations coup

457
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,290
for this hospital.

458
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,590
One which will lead

459
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,590
to much-needed donations

460
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,590
to save human lives.

461
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,130
And there's an issue

462
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,130
beyond that.

463
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,200
I've learned that there are

464
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,200
less than 2,000 pandas

465
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,200
left in the world.

466
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,370
Connor.

467
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,240
We should do whatever we can

468
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,240
to keep her alive.

469
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,480
One parrot,

470
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,480
and he's Dr. Dolittle.

471
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,050
Okay.

472
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,720
Let's get Su Lin

473
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,720
up to the cath lab.

474
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,220
Thank you.

475
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,870
Hi. I'm Dr. Wheeler.

476
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,230
Do you know

477
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,230
where you are?

478
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,230
Do you understand?

479
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,780
Can you tell me

480
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,780
how you got here?

481
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,270
Help!

482
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,100
Grab him.

483
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,410
No!

484
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,610
Get away!

485
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,610
I got you.

486
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,310
5 Versed, 10 Haldol IM.

487
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,310
Got it.

488
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,750
I'll kill you!

489
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,460
All right, get the restraints

490
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,460
back on this kid.

491
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,120
What's wrong with him?

492
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,990
Delirium can sometimes

493
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,990
be a sign of

494
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,990
kidney failure.

495
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,660
Happens with these drugs.

496
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,600
The kids' parents

497
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,600
are on their way in.

498
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,560
There's nothing

499
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,560
good to tell them.

500
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,200
Okay, I'll be right back.

501
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,580
She's doing much better.

502
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,250
Very good.

503
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,420
Well, been a long day.

504
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,420
I'll see you tomorrow?

505
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,250
Mmm-mmm. I volunteered

506
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,250
to be on call tonight.

507
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,650
Really?

508
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,650
Mmm-hmm.

509
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,720
Wow. I applaud

510
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,720
your work ethic.

511
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,720
But, um, why?

512
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,350
This patient.

513
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,160
I'm afraid that

514
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,160
once the nurses

515
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,160
change shifts,

516
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,760
our instructions

517
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,760
won't get passed on.

518
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,730
You know, I think

519
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,730
that our excellent staff

520
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,730
will probably follow through.

521
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,070
I mean,

522
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,070
aren't you exhausted?

523
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,370
It's not a problem.

524
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,430
Coffee beans?

525
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,280
Mmm-mmm.

526
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,280
Robusta espresso beans.

527
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,340
If I eat five an hour,

528
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,340
I can go all night.

529
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,470
Got it.

530
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,740
You know, Dr. Reese,

531
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,310
I know your mother

532
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,310
might have some doubts

533
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,450
about your future

534
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,450
as a psychiatrist,

535
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,850
but I, for one, do not.

536
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,850
I mean, not even a tiny bit.

537
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,920
I'm just saying,

538
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,920
you have nothing

539
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,920
to prove to me.

540
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,010
Well, it's not that.

541
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,620
I just wanna make sure

542
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,620
our patient gets

543
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,620
the treatment that she needs.

544
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,860
Oh. Okay.

545
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,930
You know,

546
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,930
I've been meaning

547
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,930
to mention,

548
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,060
I recommend to

549
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,060
all of my residents,

550
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,060
as part of their training,

551
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,700
that they undergo

552
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,700
some form of psychotherapy.

553
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,670
Is that something

554
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,670
you'd ever consider?

555
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,670
Me?

556
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,130
No.

557
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,610
Well, I mean,

558
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,610
the idea being that

559
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,370
it might

560
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,370
benefit you professionally,

561
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,580
you know,

562
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,580
to see what it's like

563
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,580
to be on the other side.

564
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,950
I mean, it certainly

565
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,950
benefitted me.

566
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,410
I really can't see

567
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,410
myself in psychotherapy,

568
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,410
Dr. Charles.

569
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,510
Okay. Well, just a thought.

570
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,510
See you in the morning.

571
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,960
Sorry, Robin, but it looks

572
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,960
like it's gonna be

573
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,960
kind of a long night.

574
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,060
Tough case?

575
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,860
On the DL...

576
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,860
Yeah?

577
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,770
The patient

578
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,770
is a panda bear.

579
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,770
A panda?

580
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,840
Mmm-hmm.

581
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,840
Atrial septal defect.

582
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,840
Can you fix it?

583
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,640
Well, that's the idea.

584
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,410
You know, there are

585
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,410
less than 2,000 pandas

586
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,410
left in the world.

587
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,110
Somebody mentioned that.

588
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,640
Connor, what you are doing,

589
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,640
it is so great.

590
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,750
Yeah?

591
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,750
Yeah.

592
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,820
Very sexy.

593
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,690
Alpha CT surgeon

594
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,690
with a soft spot for animals.

595
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,960
I'll call you a cab.

596
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,260
No. What?

597
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,260
Are you kidding me? No.

598
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,170
I am sticking around.

599
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,170
I love pandas.

600
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,560
Okay.

601
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,560
Yeah.

602
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,700
I gotta go change.

603
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,860
This is weird.

604
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,120
Four West needs me

605
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,120
to come down and declare

606
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,120
a patient dead.

607
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,960
What?

608
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,290
Nobody likes that job,

609
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,270
so they dump it on

610
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,270
the on-call psych resident.

611
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,590
You.

612
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,300
Are you clear

613
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,300
on Mrs. Novak?

614
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,780
Yes, I'm clear.

615
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,870
All right.

616
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,050
It's a formality.

617
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,050
We need a doc to call it

618
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,050
and tell the family.

619
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,990
Haven't you ever

620
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,990
done this before?

621
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,990
No.

622
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,090
I'll help you. Here.

623
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,060
First thing,

624
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,060
introduce yourself

625
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,060
to the son.

626
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,700
I'm Dr. Reese.

627
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,630
I understand you're

628
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,630
the patient's son.

629
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,810
Okay.

630
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,940
I...

631
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,130
Uh...

632
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,680
I am here to check

633
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,680
on your father.

634
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,020
I'm afraid he's passed.

635
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,490
Time of death, 22:05.

636
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,560
I am very sorry

637
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,560
for your loss.

638
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,550
That was terrible.

639
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,550
I was terrible.

640
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,550
Hey, what are you doing?

641
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,720
Mmm, hospital called.

642
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,720
I got to go back in.

643
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,720
What? Why?

644
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,390
'Cause they're swamped.

645
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,390
They need me.

646
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,130
Can't they get

647
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,130
someone else?

648
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,130
No.

649
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,070
But it's so late,

650
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,670
and you already worked

651
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,670
a full day.

652
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,540
Yeah. I'm used to it.

653
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,540
I don't mind.

654
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,940
Shouldn't you be

655
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,940
taking it easy?

656
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,050
I mean, you know,

657
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,050
the baby.

658
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,410
Really, Tate?

659
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,410
We're gonna do this again?

660
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,250
How many times do

661
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,250
I have to say it?

662
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,250
Pregnant women can work.

663
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,920
What about

664
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,920
pregnant women with TB?

665
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,590
The drugs knocked it down,

666
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,590
and you know that.

667
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,300
I'm so sick of you

668
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,300
bringing up this work thing.

669
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,170
I worry about you

670
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,170
and the baby.

671
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,070
Well, stop. I'm good.

672
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,600
And the baby's good.

673
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,870
I'll see you

674
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,870
in the morning.

675
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,850
I think you're

676
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,850
a little posterior.

677
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,850
How's it look on fluoro?

678
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,390
Give me a view at 120.

679
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,820
One sec.

680
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,820
Right there. That's it.

681
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,290
All right.

682
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,290
We're almost there.

683
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,270
Hold on.

684
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,270
Heart rate's spiking.

685
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,460
Damn. I can't continue

686
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,460
if she's this tachycardic.

687
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,500
We got to slow

688
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,500
her heart down.

689
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,800
You gonna cardiovert?

690
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,640
No, all this fur,

691
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,640
we'd never get enough contact

692
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,640
with the skin.

693
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,640
Marty, give her 6 mg

694
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,640
of adenosine.

695
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,840
On its way.

696
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,380
Mean arterial pressure of 70,

697
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,790
60, 40.

698
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,660
No pulse.

699
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,660
Heart's arrested.

700
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,700
She's gonna

701
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,700
come back, right?

702
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,500
Humans do.

703
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,940
But this is the first time

704
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,940
that I've given adenosine

705
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,940
to a panda.

706
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,350
Got a pulse.

707
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,320
MAP back up to 50,

708
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,320
60.

709
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,320
Connor, no good.

710
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,920
She's still in SVT

711
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,920
and her pressure's down.

712
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,480
All right,

713
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,480
we've got no choice.

714
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,090
We've got to try

715
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,090
to cardiovert her.

716
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,160
Shave her!

717
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,130
Sync. Clear.

718
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,110
Still SVT.

719
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,110
All right. Charge to 150.

720
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,170
Sync.

721
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,280
Sinus rhythm.

722
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,480
All right,

723
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,480
we're stable enough.

724
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,480
Let's proceed.

725
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,730
Shouldn't you people

726
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,730
be working?

727
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,800
They're treating

728
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,800
a panda in the cath lab.

729
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,040
So much for non-disclosure.

730
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,150
How's it looking?

731
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,880
Dr. Rhodes just deployed

732
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,880
the ASD closure device.

733
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,780
I always learn so much

734
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,780
watching him.

735
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,230
Oh.

736
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,360
Hey, there.

737
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,360
Oh, hey, Dad.

738
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,870
Hear there's a panda

739
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,870
in there.

740
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,430
Yeah. ASD repair.

741
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,310
Mmm. Of course.

742
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
Wow. Looking sharp.

743
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,350
Connor and I were

744
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,350
at a charity event

745
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,350
when he got the call.

746
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,650
Good thing you got

747
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,650
your mom's looks.

748
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,650
That's all I can say.

749
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,880
Have a good time.

750
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,880
Hey, Dad?

751
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,490
I'm gonna be here a while.

752
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,760
How about a coffee?

753
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,300
Oh.

754
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,130
Yeah. Yeah, I got some time.

755
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,970
We're still

756
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,970
waiting on test results,

757
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,670
but we suspect

758
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,670
it's some type of OD.

759
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,140
Hey. Sorry to call you

760
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,140
back in.

761
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,400
No. I'm fine.

762
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,910
Tate's not, though.

763
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,910
Oh.

764
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,720
Girl, my work

765
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,720
is a problem for him.

766
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,180
I really thought

767
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,180
we were past it,

768
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,180
but he won't let it go.

769
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,850
Well, every couple's

770
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,850
got stuff they got

771
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,850
to deal with.

772
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,220
You're needed in two.

773
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,020
No way I'm gonna

774
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,020
stop working.

775
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,080
Hmm.

776
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,490
Mom? Dad?

777
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,860
I'm sorry.

778
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,760
Oh, Rudy.

779
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,760
BUN is 130.

780
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,300
Creatinine is 6.

781
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,700
You look at his output?

782
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,900
Renal failure.

783
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,480
I'm afraid

784
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,480
Rudy's going to need

785
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,480
emergency dialysis.

786
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,840
Put a temporary

787
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,840
dialysis catheter

788
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,840
in his left subclavian.

789
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,080
Okay.

790
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,720
Um, I'm sorry, folks.

791
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,720
We're gonna need you

792
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,720
to wait outside.

793
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,790
Thank you, April.

794
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,790
Yes.

795
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,490
Are you in?

796
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,630
No.

797
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,960
Must have hit the lung.

798
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,960
Pneumothorax.

799
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,960
Let's get a chest X-ray.

800
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,140
Oh, no.

801
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,670
All right.

802
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,480
Let's see if

803
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,480
this lung is down.

804
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,780
Yep, it is.

805
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,830
Okay.

806
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,830
No, I'll do the line.

807
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,650
I don't know

808
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,650
what happened.

809
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,990
Prep a chest tube.

810
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,220
Really, I thought

811
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,220
I had it.

812
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,220
Hey, it happens.

813
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,730
The lung will be fine.

814
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,730
You'll get it.

815
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,800
How's my son?

816
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,710
Um...

817
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,180
Dr. Halstead will

818
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,180
give you an update.

819
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,310
So, uh, how's this

820
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,310
new apartment?

821
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,550
Mmm. It's fine, except for

822
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,550
my upstairs neighbor.

823
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,760
He practices clarinet

824
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,760
two hours every night.

825
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,650
And it's always

826
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,650
the same two songs,

827
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,650
Summertime and Moondance.

828
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,760
Well, of course,

829
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,760
you know your mother and I's

830
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,630
first date was

831
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,630
a Van Morrison concert.

832
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,970
Hard for me to imagine

833
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,970
you two dating.

834
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,630
We had some very happy times,

835
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,630
especially when

836
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,630
you first came along.

837
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,840
You don't remember?

838
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,500
Mackinac Island?

839
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,740
All that

840
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,740
saltwater taffy?

841
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,740
No.

842
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,540
Frickin' paradise, man.

843
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,250
Walking on the beach.

844
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,480
When you were four, you...

845
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,420
You found this pebble

846
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,420
that you were

847
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,980
absolutely convinced

848
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,980
looked like a bunny.

849
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,290
A bunny?

850
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,290
Yeah.

851
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,860
You and your bunnies, man.

852
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,860
Loved your bunnies.

853
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,150
Robin, I'm so very sorry

854
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,150
I was an awful father.

855
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,190
I know, Dad.

856
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,600
I know that,

857
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,890
but to tell you the truth,

858
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,890
I never really felt that way.

859
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,670
Okay, all right.

860
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,670
I will admit that

861
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,670
I was angry, yes,

862
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,310
but it's just because

863
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,310
I wanted more of you.

864
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,280
I remember I used to read

865
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,280
my Nancy Drew mysteries

866
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,320
and imagine that I was

867
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,320
your detective.

868
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,860
You know,

869
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,860
following you around,

870
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,220
helping you solve cases.

871
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,630
Like how did my patient

872
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,630
develop a fixation

873
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,630
with doorknobs and stuff?

874
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,630
Yeah, yeah.

875
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,630
Something like that.

876
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,670
Actually, I'm surprised

877
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,670
that you,

878
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,670
my brilliant

879
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,670
psychiatrist father,

880
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,740
never figured it out.

881
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,010
Epidemiology is

882
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,010
detective work.

883
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,140
So, you see, Dad,

884
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,080
it's all about you.

885
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,620
I'm all about you.

886
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,140
You carry that around

887
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,140
with you?

888
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,270
Always.

889
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,870
Uh, we need you to

890
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,870
pronounce a patient.

891
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,370
Where's the doctor

892
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,370
who ran the code?

893
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,170
No code.

894
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,170
Patient had a DNR.

895
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,190
This is Dr. Latham's patient.

896
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,190
Why didn't you call him?

897
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,660
The family's in there.

898
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,660
He'd have to tell them.

899
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,890
So?

900
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,230
You know Dr. Latham.

901
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,430
He's a robot.

902
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,430
Creeps people out.

903
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,660
He'll just make them

904
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,660
feel worse.

905
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,510
Oh, great.

906
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,110
Second time tonight.

907
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,790
Dr. Latham.

908
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,130
Why is that resident in

909
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,130
with my patient?

910
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,050
I'm afraid

911
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,050
the patient has died.

912
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,930
Uh, Dr. Reese is

913
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,930
informing the family.

914
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,200
Why wasn't I called?

915
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,630
We didn't see

916
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,630
the need to bother you.

917
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,140
It's no bother.

918
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,140
It's my responsibility.

919
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,740
Guess we should have,

920
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,740
Dr. Latham.

921
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,470
I don't think

922
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,470
that's very funny.

923
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,310
A word, Doctor?

924
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,310
Mmm-hmm.

925
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,950
Can you explain

926
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,950
what that was about?

927
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,400
They didn't call you

928
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,530
because they don't think

929
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,530
you're very good

930
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,130
with emotionally

931
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,130
distraught people.

932
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,570
Huh.

933
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,800
Thank you

934
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,800
for your candor.

935
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,270
Mmm-hmm.

936
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,810
Well, the boy

937
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,810
has stopped seizing,

938
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,550
but he's got cerebral edema.

939
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,210
Rick. That's his name.

940
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,290
Hopefully, mannitol will

941
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,290
bring it down.

942
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,160
When Rick wakes, if he wakes,

943
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,160
we'll do cognitive tests.

944
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,590
But I'll tell you,

945
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,590
he's gonna have deficits.

946
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,590
Deficits?

947
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,190
Yeah, like walking, talking,

948
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,190
bladder and bowel control.

949
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,340
And the girl? Janna?

950
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,570
EEG shows

951
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,570
she continues to have

952
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,570
subclinical seizures.

953
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,240
We had to put her

954
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,240
in a barbiturate coma.

955
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,380
Possible she doesn't

956
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,380
wake up.

957
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,380
Never wakes up.

958
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,510
Renal failure.

959
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,510
Deficits. Coma.

960
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,180
Wheeler?

961
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,180
They're just kids.

962
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,420
What's the matter

963
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,420
with you?

964
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,180
Hey.

965
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,920
Wheeler, are you drunk?

966
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,590
Their lives are over.

967
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,590
Hey!

968
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,120
Are you drunk?

969
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,360
ED docs.

970
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,100
You're through tonight.

971
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,770
Let's get him

972
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,770
in the lounge.

973
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,100
Oh, God, wait!

974
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,640
Beautiful.

975
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,670
Thank you.

976
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,780
Let's go.

977
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,950
Excuse me.

978
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:25,520
So, normal BP

979
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:25,520
for a panda is 150/85.

980
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,590
She's down to 110/60,

981
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,590
and her heart rate's

982
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,590
twice what it should be.

983
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,060
Grab me the echo,

984
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,060
will you?

985
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,060
Yeah.

986
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,170
Here you go.

987
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,170
Thanks.

988
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,570
She has an effusion

989
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,570
around the heart.

990
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,570
Yeah.

991
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,530
Low-pressure bleed.

992
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,510
Damn, I must have nicked

993
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,510
the right atrial appendage

994
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,510
during the occlusion.

995
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,910
All right, we've got

996
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,910
to relieve the pressure.

997
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,950
And we shouldn't

998
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,950
open her up.

999
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,950
No.

1000
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,740
Can't risk

1001
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,740
the blood loss.

1002
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,740
Yeah.

1003
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,960
Okay, I'll needle her,

1004
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,960
put in a drain,

1005
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,130
and hopefully the bleed

1006
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,130
will stop on its own.

1007
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,960
Give me

1008
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,960
the PERIVAC Kit.

1009
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,960
Yes, Doctor.

1010
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,660
Thanks.

1011
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,020
All right.

1012
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,020
Keep your fingers crossed.

1013
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,640
Dr. Charles.

1014
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
I looked online

1015
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
at the therapies

1016
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
that you mentioned.

1017
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,640
I've decided to try TMS.

1018
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,170
In some cases,

1019
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,170
patients experience

1020
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,170
profound changes

1021
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,080
immediately after

1022
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,080
one treatment.

1023
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1024
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,810
Some cases.

1025
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,850
Most of those,

1026
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,850
a single treatment caused

1027
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,850
only temporary change.

1028
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,820
Fifteen minutes,

1029
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,820
half an hour.

1030
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,350
Even with

1031
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,350
multiple treatments,

1032
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,920
there's no guarantee

1033
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,920
of prolonged change.

1034
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,790
TMS. is not a magic bullet.

1035
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,120
Still, it's encouraging.

1036
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,520
It's very encouraging,

1037
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,590
but there's also

1038
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,590
the possibility

1039
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,590
that in success,

1040
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,190
your experience of TMS

1041
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,190
could be

1042
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,190
somewhat overwhelming.

1043
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,000
Are you ready for that?

1044
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,330
I am tired of

1045
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,330
living in a world

1046
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,330
I don't understand.

1047
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,010
Very well.

1048
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,750
I will refer you

1049
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,750
to my colleague

1050
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,750
in the morning.

1051
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,370
I want you there.

1052
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,140
You know that I can't

1053
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,140
prescribe treatments

1054
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,050
for doctors that work

1055
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,050
in the same hospital.

1056
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,580
You referred me.

1057
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,580
I don't see why

1058
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,580
you can't observe.

1059
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,380
Well, when you put it

1060
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,380
that way,

1061
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,580
I don't see

1062
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,580
why I couldn't, either.

1063
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,060
Good. Let's start tonight.

1064
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,750
Tonight?

1065
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,750
If you don't mind.

1066
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,190
It's 3:00 in the morning.

1067
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,790
I'm not gonna call

1068
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,790
Dr. Weyland at 3:00 a.m.

1069
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,860
I'll pick up the cost.

1070
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,860
That's not the point.

1071
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,830
Dr. Latham, are you sure

1072
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,830
that you don't wanna

1073
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,830
go home and sleep on this?

1074
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,190
Just think about it

1075
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,190
a little bit?

1076
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,000
Dr. Charles, please.

1077
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,990
Hey.

1078
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,530
How's she doing?

1079
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,960
About the same.

1080
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,330
No worse.

1081
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,830
So, you volunteer

1082
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,830
at the zoo, huh?

1083
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,130
Yeah.

1084
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,300
How come?

1085
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,930
You'll laugh.

1086
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,240
Just try me.

1087
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,710
All right.

1088
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,520
A few hours ago,

1089
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,520
I lost a kid who was shot.

1090
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,250
Another one.

1091
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,620
So much of my work,

1092
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,620
stabbings, shootings,

1093
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,630
it's dark, man.

1094
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,860
Worst of human nature.

1095
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,100
But animals...

1096
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,640
Not to say

1097
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,640
they don't kill each other,

1098
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,940
but they don't do it

1099
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,940
out of malice.

1100
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,880
They're innocent.

1101
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,510
They're light.

1102
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,460
How do you feel?

1103
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,170
Awful.

1104
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,170
All right.

1105
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,440
I'm not letting you

1106
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,440
drive home.

1107
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,200
Why don't you go lay down

1108
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,200
in the on-call room?

1109
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,730
Oh, God.

1110
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,470
Right in front of the troll.

1111
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,970
Am I finished?

1112
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,070
No.

1113
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,570
It's not up to him.

1114
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,950
You are gonna have to

1115
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,950
go to therapy,

1116
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,110
sign a contract saying

1117
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,110
it won't happen again,

1118
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,480
and if it does,

1119
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,480
you will be fired.

1120
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,790
My parents...

1121
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,090
How am I gonna tell them?

1122
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,720
Hey, Wheeler,

1123
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,720
it's not the end, okay?

1124
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,720
You can get past this.

1125
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,320
How is he?

1126
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,200
Oh, physically okay.

1127
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,200
Just hungover.

1128
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,690
So, what did Abrams mean

1129
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,690
by "ED docs"?

1130
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,940
Sad fact. Among the staff,

1131
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,940
highest rate of alcoholism,

1132
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,940
ED docs.

1133
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,640
Battle fatigue.

1134
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,910
The session lasts 24 minutes.

1135
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,080
Every 20 seconds,

1136
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,080
you'll receive a pulse,

1137
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,550
which lasts

1138
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,550
about two seconds.

1139
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,450
Ready?

1140
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,450
Yeah.

1141
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,130
You okay? Is it tolerable?

1142
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,760
Yes.

1143
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,750
Mrs. Novak.

1144
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,030
Hold compressions.

1145
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,390
Still VF on the monitor.

1146
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,190
Charge, 200.

1147
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,660
Clear.

1148
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,770
She's gone.

1149
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,770
She's dead?

1150
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,510
Your patient, right?

1151
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,510
Yes.

1152
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,740
Do you wanna call it?

1153
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,980
Did you follow

1154
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,980
my instructions?

1155
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,140
Of course.

1156
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,240
Then what happened?

1157
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,480
Respiratory failure.

1158
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,480
She had pneumonia,

1159
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,480
you know.

1160
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,790
Are you gonna call it?

1161
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,890
Time of death, 4:02.

1162
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,410
This wasn't

1163
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,410
supposed to happen.

1164
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,210
It's nobody's fault.

1165
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,310
Wasn't supposed

1166
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,310
to happen.

1167
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,750
So, uh,

1168
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,750
how are you feeling?

1169
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,750
Any change?

1170
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,890
Uh, not that I can tell.

1171
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,560
Yeah? No headache?

1172
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,560
No.

1173
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,130
Okay.

1174
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,700
I hope you don't mind that

1175
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,700
I'm dating your boyfriend.

1176
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,880
No, of course not.

1177
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,540
Why would I mind?

1178
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,940
Can we still be friends?

1179
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,240
Sure.

1180
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,880
I'll be your maid of honor.

1181
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,010
So, um...

1182
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,410
Anything striking you

1183
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,410
differently?

1184
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,680
That woman does mind.

1185
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,750
She says she doesn't,

1186
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,750
but she clearly does.

1187
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,020
Yeah.

1188
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,150
She's being sarcastic.

1189
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,160
You, um, didn't pick

1190
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,160
that up before.

1191
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,100
No.

1192
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,740
Looks like you could be

1193
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,740
an excellent candidate

1194
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,740
for this therapy.

1195
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,270
It's like I've been blind.

1196
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,180
Blood has

1197
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,180
stopped draining.

1198
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,730
BP and heart rate

1199
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,730
have normalized.

1200
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,390
We've dialed back

1201
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,390
on the sedation,

1202
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,390
see how she responds.

1203
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,090
No, no, no.

1204
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,090
We're not shooting

1205
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,090
a panda in my hospital.

1206
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,230
She's coming around.

1207
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,400
All right!

1208
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,400
Looks good.

1209
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,940
Well, we don't need a bear

1210
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,940
roaming the hospital.

1211
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,980
Marty, put her back under.

1212
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,610
Right.

1213
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,280
Congratulations, everyone.

1214
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,910
Dr. Reese,

1215
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,910
how's our patient?

1216
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:35,960
She died.

1217
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,770
They all died.

1218
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,010
All of them.

1219
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,010
Three in one night.

1220
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,250
Oh... That's terrible.

1221
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,250
I'm so sorry.

1222
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,920
It's too much, you know?

1223
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,920
It's all too much.

1224
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,190
We need to get you

1225
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,190
a little sleep.

1226
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,890
No. No, I, um...

1227
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,930
I'll do it.

1228
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,600
Dr. Charles,

1229
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,600
I want to do it.

1230
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,600
I need it.

1231
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,800
Do what?

1232
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,230
Therapy.

1233
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,370
I can't handle anything.

1234
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,780
I'm no good

1235
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,780
at anything. I'm...

1236
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,710
I'm a fraud. I'm just

1237
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,710
gonna disappoint you.

1238
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,350
Come here.

1239
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,180
Oh, it's okay.

1240
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,250
That's not gonna happen.

1241
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,250
That's not true at all.

1242
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,360
It's okay.

1243
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,600
Excuse me.

1244
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,600
Have a good day.

1245
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,830
So, we're gonna

1246
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,830
have to round

1247
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,830
on Wheeler's patients.

1248
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,770
I'll take half,

1249
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,770
you take the other?

1250
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,770
Okay.

1251
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,110
And good job last night.

1252
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,570
Thanks.

1253
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,880
You hung in there.

1254
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,880
You should consider

1255
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,880
Emergency Medicine.

1256
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,550
I will.

1257
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,180
Morning.

1258
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,750
Morning.

1259
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,450
How'd it go?

1260
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,290
The usual.

1261
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,820
Good.

1262
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,060
I guess I'm gonna

1263
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,060
start those rounds.

1264
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,060
Yeah.

1265
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,810
April!

1266
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,340
It's not that easy.

1267
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,920
I know how much

1268
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,920
your work means to you.

1269
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,920
I'm sorry.

1270
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,510
Tate, we keep having

1271
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,510
the same argument.

1272
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,190
We won't. Not anymore.

1273
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,190
I mean it.

1274
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,060
I am the way I am.

1275
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,060
If I don't make you happy...

1276
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,790
You do, April.

1277
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,590
I don't wanna

1278
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,590
change you. Okay?

1279
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,170
Let's go home.

1280
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,540
You can scramble me

1281
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,540
some eggs.

1282
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,020
And now I'd like to introduce

1283
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,020
you to Dr. Connor Rhodes,

1284
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,820
who performed the procedure.

1285
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,950
Dr. Rhodes.

1286
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,460
Thank you very much.

1287
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,460
Good morning to everybody.

1288
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,360
Su Lin was suffering

1289
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,360
from an atrial

1290
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,360
septal defect, which...

1291
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,340
Hey!

1292
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,050
I'm okay.
