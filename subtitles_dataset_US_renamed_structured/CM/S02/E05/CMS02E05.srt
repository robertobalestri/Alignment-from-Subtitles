00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,230
Windy City runners,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,230
welcome to Mile 12.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,100
You're looking great today.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,800
Now, remember to stay

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,800
hydrated out there

6
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,800
to beat the heat.

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,330
Keep it up.

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,540
See? Taking a header

9
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,540
at your first

10
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,540
marathon is nothing.

11
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,810
Now, taking a header

12
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,810
into a pool

13
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,810
in your wedding dress?

14
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,910
Epic fail.

15
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,910
Epic fail. Right?

16
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,820
No, that would be

17
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,820
taking 20 minutes

18
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,950
to put on a Band-Aid.

19
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,960
Sorry.

20
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,960
Totally my fault.

21
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,960
No, no, not at all.

22
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,280
Take as long as you need.

23
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,790
You, on the other hand,

24
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,450
have a superhero

25
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,450
with super

26
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,450
intestinal discomfort

27
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,390
who requires your

28
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,390
immediate attention.

29
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,510
Almost halfway.

30
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,510
You holding up?

31
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm sure that runner's high

32
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,480
is gonna kick in

33
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,480
any second now.

34
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,910
That or heatstroke.

35
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,180
Yeah. It's not

36
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,180
the best day for

37
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,180
a heat wave.

38
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,960
Yeah, I was thinking,

39
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,960
uh, maybe later we can

40
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,960
do something else.

41
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,890
What, like collapse?

42
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,300
No. Maybe

43
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,300
a bedroom activity.

44
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,830
Or kitchen table.

45
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,560
Shower.

46
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,260
Let's go, Doc.

47
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,260
Pick up the pace.

48
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,540
Now, try to keep it elevated,

49
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,540
and remember, ice, not heat.

50
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,140
Please, don't mention heat.

51
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,140
It's hot as balls out here.

52
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,810
We need help.

53
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,810
A guy got run over.

54
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,110
Grab an aid kit.

55
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,110
Got it.

56
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,680
Three, two, one.

57
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,960
My brakes went out.

58
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,960
You've got to help him.

59
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,160
We'll do all we can.

60
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,500
Ignacio.

61
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,500
Where does it hurt, Ignacio?

62
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,740
Maggie, we got

63
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,740
a bike versus auto.

64
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,870
Diminished breath sounds

65
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,870
on the left side.

66
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,210
Sounds like

67
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,210
it's full of fluid.

68
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,210
I think his lung collapsed.

69
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,450
Marathon traffic

70
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,450
and power outages

71
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,450
from the heat

72
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,780
have paramedics

73
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,780
backed up.

74
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,010
We're on our own

75
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,010
for a while.

76
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,180
He doesn't have a while.

77
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,280
He needs a chest tube now.

78
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,620
Not from you.

79
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,620
You've never put one in.

80
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,720
Be my guest.

81
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,720
Neither of us is

82
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,720
allowed to do it.

83
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,350
Then he's gonna die.

84
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,350
Maggie, I need Goodwin.

85
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,330
Sir, just hang on.

86
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,330
We're gonna do everything

87
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,330
we can for you, okay?

88
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,270
We're gonna help you, okay?

89
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,270
Just hang on.

90
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,480
Sit tight, April.

91
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,480
Dr. Halstead's on the way.

92
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,420
No, no, no.

93
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,420
You let him make that call.

94
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,250
All right.

95
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,250
You keep me posted.

96
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,480
How goes the battle?

97
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,480
Ugh.

98
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,590
It's supposed

99
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,590
to hit 105 today,

100
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,960
so we've got

101
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,960
a generator on standby

102
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,020
just in case our

103
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,020
grid goes dark.

104
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,700
Sharon, listen.

105
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,700
Bert called me.

106
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,160
Really?

107
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,160
Yeah.

108
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,140
He wants to get together

109
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,140
for drinks, and I just...

110
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,600
I wanted to check in with you

111
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,600
before I responded to him.

112
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,040
Daniel, you do

113
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,040
whatever you like.

114
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,570
I'm good.

115
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,540
Hey, Peter.

116
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,380
Um...

117
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,220
Your husband is

118
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,220
a divorce attorney,

119
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,220
isn't he?

120
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,350
Best in the city.

121
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,860
Text me his number.

122
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,700
I can do this.

123
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,700
With what?

124
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,870
We don't even

125
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,870
have a chest tube.

126
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,840
I got a suction tube.

127
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,680
No, you are not

128
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,680
gonna jury-rig your way

129
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,680
into this guy's chest.

130
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,150
He's got no chance

131
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,150
unless I do.

132
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,840
Goodwin said

133
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,840
to wait for Will.

134
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,410
How long is

135
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,410
that gonna take?

136
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,980
Got a neck pulse,

137
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,980
but it's thready.

138
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,190
He's out.

139
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,960
I've got to relieve

140
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,960
the pressure on his lung.

141
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,300
BP 82 over palp.

142
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,300
Sat at 82%.

143
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,730
I'm doing this.

144
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,730
Noah.

145
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,360
Noah!

146
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,120
Pulse is coming up.

147
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,120
You did it.

148
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,290
Yeah, but

149
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,290
the tube's not slowing down.

150
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,290
Damn, it's a bad bleed.

151
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,020
Come on. He needs surgery.

152
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,320
We need to intubate

153
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,320
and give him blood.

154
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,860
Where the hell is Will?

155
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,860
Hey, Nat.

156
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,840
Eight-year-old girl with

157
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,840
sudden onset deafness

158
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,840
in Treatment Two.

159
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,540
They said the heat wave's

160
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,540
supposed to be worse than '95.

161
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,050
Hi. I'm Dr. Manning.

162
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,610
I understand

163
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,610
Phoebe's experiencing

164
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,610
some hearing loss?

165
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,710
Yeah. Uh, we were headed

166
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,710
to cheer on the runners.

167
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,220
She was skipping ahead.

168
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,220
A semi started backing up.

169
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,260
I was screaming,

170
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,260
and she couldn't hear me.

171
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,790
A few seconds later...

172
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,790
What?

173
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,890
I don't want to

174
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,890
think about it.

175
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,800
It's okay, sweetie.

176
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,260
Can you

177
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,260
hear that, Phoebe?

178
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,560
Not really.

179
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,890
How about now?

180
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,640
Sort of. A little.

181
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,110
Okay,

182
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,110
her hearing is diminished

183
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,110
on the right side

184
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,510
and nearly absent

185
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,510
on the left.

186
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,740
Does she have

187
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,740
any prior history

188
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,310
of head trauma

189
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,310
or hearing loss?

190
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,640
No. Uh, not that

191
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,640
I can think of.

192
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,420
I mean, there have

193
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,420
been a few times

194
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,820
where I've had to

195
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,820
call her more than once

196
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,190
within these last few months,

197
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,190
but nothing like this.

198
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,290
Okay, well, I'd like to

199
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,290
order a head CT

200
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,060
just so we can figure out

201
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,060
what's going on, okay?

202
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,660
Okay.

203
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,660
Thank you.

204
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,990
Wait.

205
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,430
Are you going to fix my ears?

206
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,170
I'm sure gonna try.

207
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,230
Be back shortly.

208
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,370
Like, I can't...

209
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,370
I can't get it in.

210
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,750
You have to

211
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,750
capture the tongue.

212
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,010
Elevate the jaw.

213
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,980
What the hell

214
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,980
are you doing?

215
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,740
I'm trying to intubate.

216
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,050
He had a massive hemothorax,

217
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,050
and I had to put

218
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,050
in a chest tube.

219
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
No, what you

220
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
had to do was wait.

221
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,990
Dr. Halstead,

222
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,990
this man would have died.

223
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,080
Yeah, judging

224
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,080
by all the blood,

225
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,630
if we don't get him into

226
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,630
surgery in the next few

227
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,630
minutes, he will anyway.

228
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm in. Bag him.

229
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,840
Any ETA on transport?

230
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,930
Still saying

231
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,930
it'll be a while.

232
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,040
We could open his chest.

233
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,040
Try to address the bleed.

234
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,770
It might buy him enough time

235
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,770
for the ambulance to show up.

236
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,880
Yeah, it might.

237
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,880
There's no guarantee

238
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,880
I could even find it.

239
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,180
The only guarantee is

240
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,180
he'll die if we don't try.

241
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,540
No, I've been

242
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,540
down this road before

243
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,540
trying extreme measures.

244
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,880
It doesn't end well.

245
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,860
His pressure is down.

246
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,860
Trachea feels

247
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,860
deviated to the right.

248
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,690
I need a scalpel.

249
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,530
We're going to

250
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,530
Treatment Five.

251
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,530
You got it, Maggie.

252
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,440
Olga Barlow,

253
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,440
74, lives alone.

254
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,670
Complex cardiac history.

255
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,670
Called the EMS for dyspnea.

256
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,470
BP 82 over 44.

257
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,640
Chronic a-fib at rate 105.

258
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,640
Tachypneic at 30.

259
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,770
Those are her meds.

260
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,280
I'll page Dr. Choi.

261
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,280
Okay.

262
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Mrs. Barlow,

263
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,880
what happened today?

264
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,250
It's so hot out,

265
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,250
I was having a hard time

266
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,250
catching my breath.

267
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,610
Do you have an air conditioner

268
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,610
in your home?

269
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,990
Don't I wish?

270
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,990
Well, let's move her.

271
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,650
One, two, three.

272
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,990
There you go.

273
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,000
Pulse ox 89.

274
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,000
Temperature 101.

275
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,530
She's tachy up to 130.

276
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,530
I think we're looking

277
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,530
at heat exhaustion.

278
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,840
Let's pack her

279
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,840
axilla and groin in ice

280
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,710
and send a CBC,

281
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,710
CMP, LFTs and urine.

282
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,580
And give her

283
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,580
an amp of D50.

284
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,950
What's the story?

285
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,950
Uh, nonexertional

286
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,950
heat illness.

287
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,710
We're going to

288
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,710
lower her core temp

289
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,710
and keep her hydrated.

290
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,780
You check her meds?

291
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,290
Looks like she has

292
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,290
pulmonary hypertension.

293
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,590
That's right.

294
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,590
Jugular venous distention

295
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,720
means she's in

296
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,720
volume overload.

297
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,700
This fluid you ordered

298
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,700
could've sent her

299
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,700
into heart failure.

300
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,670
Am I gonna be okay?

301
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,230
We're gonna take

302
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,230
good care of you.

303
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,160
Let's get a chest film.

304
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,160
AP and lateral.

305
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,770
ECG and stat formal echo.

306
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,770
Yes, Doctor.

307
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,180
Start epoprostenol at two.

308
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,180
Dobutamine at three.

309
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,740
Is your arthritis

310
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,740
causing you pain?

311
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,780
Yes, it's

312
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,780
pretty... Pretty bad.

313
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,780
I bet.

314
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,280
That's a pretty

315
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,280
good dose of oxycodone.

316
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,580
Let's give her one...

317
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,580
No, 2 milligrams

318
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,580
of hydromorphone.

319
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,750
She won't even

320
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,750
notice 1 milligram.

321
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,750
Okay.

322
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,190
You're gonna be

323
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,190
feeling better soon.

324
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,890
Next time do

325
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,890
a complete history

326
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,690
and physical before

327
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,690
making a diagnosis.

328
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,820
Great. There you go.

329
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,960
Ms. Goodwin, a word?

330
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,000
Um, problem, Dr. Rhodes?

331
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,870
I filled in for

332
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,870
trauma last night.

333
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,870
Seven surgeries.

334
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,100
I was double-booked

335
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,100
going back and

336
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,100
forth between ORs.

337
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,150
Well, a month ago,

338
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,150
you were complaining

339
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,150
about not having enough to do.

340
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,810
Yeah, well, last night

341
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,810
cured me of that.

342
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,820
The hospital is

343
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,820
overscheduling,

344
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,820
Ms. Goodwin.

345
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,010
Well, maybe

346
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,010
someone thought

347
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,010
we needed the revenue.

348
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,780
I'll look into it.

349
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,780
Thank you.

350
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,310
Look, we're all having

351
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,310
our problems today,

352
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,310
Dr. Rhodes.

353
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,820
Go home. Get some sleep.

354
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,720
I can't.

355
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,720
I've got a consult

356
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,720
on a cold leg in IR

357
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,860
that needs

358
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,860
an aortofemoral bypass.

359
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,460
Retract his ribs.

360
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,460
Suction.

361
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,810
All right.

362
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,150
Anything?

363
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,150
Nothing but clots.

364
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,790
I don't see it.

365
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,790
I gotta get

366
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,790
behind the lungs.

367
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,450
Still has a carotid pulse.

368
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,760
Oh, man.

369
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,760
Rib perforated

370
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,760
the aorta.

371
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,330
Can you clamp it?

372
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,330
With what? My hand?

373
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,790
It'll buy us...

374
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,790
Him 20 minutes?

375
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,730
Any longer,

376
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,730
there's a good chance

377
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,730
he'll be paralyzed.

378
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,100
If you don't,

379
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,100
he'll bleed out.

380
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,270
All right.

381
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,780
Hemostatic?

382
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,780
Yeah, it stopped.

383
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,940
Now he needs more

384
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,940
blood and a miracle.

385
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Which could happen

386
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
if we get him on

387
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
portable bypass.

388
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,640
They've been

389
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,640
doing it in France.

390
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,120
We have a unit in

391
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,120
clinical trial at Med.

392
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,590
April, call Maggie.

393
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,590
On it.

394
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,480
We've got about 19 minutes

395
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,480
to get Ignacio hooked up

396
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,820
before he's

397
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,820
paralyzed or worse.

398
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,670
Hey, I meant to ask you.

399
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,670
Uh, are flowers too much

400
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,670
for your mom tonight?

401
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,740
Well, roses tend to

402
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,740
wilt in her presence.

403
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,210
But don't worry about it.

404
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,210
She actually

405
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,210
canceled her trip.

406
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,270
She's too busy.

407
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,310
This is her idea

408
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,310
of an apology.

409
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,750
1,000 bucks?

410
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,750
Mmm-hmm.

411
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,110
I wish my mom

412
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,110
apologized like that.

413
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,750
She just bakes cookies.

414
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,750
It takes time

415
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,750
to bake cookies.

416
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,060
This just took

417
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,060
a call to her accountant.

418
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,960
Code Blue.

419
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,290
Code Blue.

420
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,070
Her tongue has relaxed,

421
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,070
closing off her airway.

422
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,470
I'll do an oral airway.

423
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,300
I got it.

424
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,470
Intubation kit?

425
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,980
No, 2 milligrams

426
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,980
of naloxone IV.

427
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,170
I think this is an overdose.

428
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,040
Of what?

429
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,040
Hydromorphone.

430
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,210
I don't understand.

431
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,210
She shouldn't have had

432
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,210
this kind of reaction.

433
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,810
Respiration's

434
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,810
at eight per minute.

435
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,180
Take over?

436
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,180
Okay.

437
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,560
Dr. Choi. Dr. Choi.

438
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,560
Yeah.

439
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,720
I know I was off on

440
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,720
my original diagnosis,

441
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,720
but that won't happen again.

442
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,920
You can trust me.

443
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,600
Clarke, you're here to learn.

444
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,600
You're gonna make mistakes,

445
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,600
okay?

446
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,090
Jeff?

447
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,900
I need you to run

448
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,900
this portable bypass,

449
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,900
Satinsky clamps,

450
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,880
and 10 units of packed cells

451
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,880
out to Dr. Halstead

452
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,640
at the marathon

453
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,640
aid station, okay?

454
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,640
"Run"?

455
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,640
You doing anything else?

456
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,680
Ugh. Let's go.

457
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,680
This is gonna be great.

458
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,050
Sorry it's taking so...

459
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,050
I want to call Daddy.

460
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,620
I told you.

461
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,620
Is everything okay?

462
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,330
When can I call him?

463
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,060
He's traveling, Phoebes.

464
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,060
You know that.

465
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,690
I want to go home.

466
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,690
Hey.

467
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,600
Hey, Phoebe,

468
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,600
I promise, the CT is

469
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,600
not gonna hurt, okay?

470
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,470
It's just like

471
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,470
getting your

472
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,470
picture taken.

473
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,830
But, in the meantime,

474
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,830
will you do me a favor?

475
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,940
Can you color a picture

476
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,940
for the doctors' lounge?

477
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,500
Yeah?

478
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,950
Because of the marathon,

479
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,950
the hospital's way

480
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,950
busier than usual,

481
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,680
but it shouldn't

482
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,680
be too much longer.

483
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,680
Okay.

484
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,250
And do you mind if

485
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,250
we speak for a moment?

486
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,380
Sure.

487
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,380
Great.

488
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,450
Hey. I'll be right outside,

489
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,450
okay, sweetie?

490
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,020
So, you indicated

491
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,020
in Phoebe's chart that

492
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,020
her father was deceased.

493
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,660
I'm wondering

494
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,660
why she would

495
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,660
want to call him?

496
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,400
David had a massive coronary

497
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,400
and died a few months ago.

498
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,940
I haven't had

499
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,940
the heart to tell her.

500
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,110
I am so sorry.

501
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,110
He was away

502
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,110
on business.

503
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,210
I feel awful for lying,

504
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,210
but I just know

505
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,210
that she'll be crushed,

506
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,980
and I don't know how

507
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,980
to break it to her.

508
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,650
Yeah, um,

509
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,650
well, you know,

510
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,590
we have a really great doctor

511
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,590
that may be able

512
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,590
to help with that.

513
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,490
But, in the meantime,

514
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,490
just hang in there.

515
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,500
We'll get Phoebe

516
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,500
up to CT soon, okay?

517
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,100
Okay, thank you.

518
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,100
Yeah.

519
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,430
Dr. Rhodes?

520
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,570
Dr. Halstead

521
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,570
has a patient in the field

522
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,570
with a torn aorta.

523
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,740
He's putting him on

524
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,740
a portable bypass.

525
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,010
Seriously?

526
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,010
A portable bypass?

527
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,910
You can't regulate

528
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,910
blood flow to the brain.

529
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,540
Well, you can debate

530
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,540
the medicine

531
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,240
with Dr. Halstead

532
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,240
when he gets here.

533
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,020
Believe me, I will.

534
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,450
There's blood in the tube.

535
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,630
Saturation's 75%.

536
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,860
Must be

537
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,860
a pulmonary laceration.

538
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:21,920
We got to pack his lung

539
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
and get the blood

540
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
out of that tube

541
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
before he drowns.

542
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,920
You wanna pack the chest

543
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,920
when I suction the tube?

544
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,630
With what free hand?

545
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,630
I'll suction the tube.

546
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,760
I'll pack the chest.

547
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,760
Give me the suction.

548
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,400
Noah, grab both sides,

549
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,400
and try to keep 'em open.

550
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,270
All right.

551
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,270
My wrist is cramping up.

552
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,640
If you let go on the ribs,

553
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,640
I'm done.

554
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,310
Come on, man, pull.

555
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,310
I'm trying.

556
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,610
Hang in there.

557
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,310
Argh, it's closing

558
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,310
on my wrist.

559
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,310
I can't hold this.

560
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,110
Don't let go. Don't let go!

561
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,110
Come on, Noah, pull!

562
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,510
All right.

563
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,510
I got most of the blood.

564
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,320
Sats at 95%.

565
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,320
Ribs, ribs,

566
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,320
grab the ribs.

567
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,980
Got it.

568
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,980
Guys, guys, he's here.

569
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,190
Sorry it took so long.

570
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,190
Oh, man.

571
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,390
I need two clamps.

572
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,390
How long's it been?

573
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,690
Seventeen minutes.

574
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,690
Three to go. Hurry up.

575
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,100
Mrs. Barlow?

576
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,530
You gave us a scare.

577
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,530
How are you feeling?

578
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,170
Oh,

579
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,170
I'm much better,

580
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,170
Doctor. Thank you.

581
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,110
Your reaction to

582
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,110
the pain medication

583
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,110
surprised us,

584
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,340
because that dose

585
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,340
shouldn't have

586
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,340
been an issue for you.

587
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,040
Have you been taking

588
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,040
everything as prescribed?

589
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,720
I didn't mention it before,

590
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,720
because it's...

591
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,380
It's so embarrassing,

592
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,980
but I accidentally spilled

593
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,980
some pills into the toilet,

594
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,420
so I haven't taken everything

595
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,420
I was supposed to.

596
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,130
Mrs. Barlow, skipping doses

597
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,130
is very dangerous.

598
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,670
You should have

599
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,670
called your doctor.

600
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,360
Well,

601
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,360
I certainly know better now.

602
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,340
I won't let it happen again.

603
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,940
There's one other thing.

604
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,140
I was reviewing your labs,

605
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,140
and some of

606
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,140
the numbers indicate

607
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,150
that you haven't been eating

608
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,150
as well as you should.

609
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,840
No one,

610
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,840
except my late husband,

611
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,410
has ever accused me

612
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,410
of being a good cook.

613
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,580
Well, wait till you

614
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,580
taste the hospital food.

615
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,910
Excuse me.

616
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,560
Dr. Charles, I have a patient

617
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,560
I'd like you to evaluate.

618
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,330
She's 74, lives alone,

619
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,870
and, for some reason,

620
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,870
hasn't been taking her meds.

621
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,960
Her blood work indicates

622
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,960
she's undernourished.

623
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,140
It might be

624
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,140
dementia or depression.

625
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,140
I'm just not sure.

626
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,610
I'll have a little chat.

627
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,610
Shoot me her chart?

628
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,350
Yeah. Olga Barlow.

629
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,350
Treatment Five.

630
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,480
Great. Thank you.

631
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,840
Paramedics are close.

632
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,320
All right, we're good to go.

633
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,450
Circuit's primed.

634
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,690
Let's get some

635
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,690
more blood in him.

636
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,690
It's infusing.

637
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,630
Come on, Ignacio.

638
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,590
And it's up.

639
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,440
Time. How long

640
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,440
has he been clamped?

641
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,860
Twenty-four minutes.

642
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,760
Damn.

643
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,150
Mrs. Barlow?

644
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,150
I'm Dr. Charles.

645
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,150
How are we doing today?

646
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,710
Oh, pleased to meet you,

647
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,710
Dr. Charles.

648
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,020
Dr. Choi mentioned

649
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,020
that you were having

650
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,320
some trouble with

651
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,320
your medication,

652
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,550
and he asked me

653
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,550
to look in on you.

654
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,390
Of course, but this is

655
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,390
all just a big mistake.

656
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,520
Tell me, how did

657
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,520
you end up here today?

658
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,270
I spilled some pills

659
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,270
and didn't take

660
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,270
all my medication.

661
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,530
It's so boring.

662
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,530
Huh.

663
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,100
Charles.

664
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,100
That's an English

665
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,100
name, isn't it?

666
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,430
Yes, it is.

667
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,430
Mmm.

668
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,410
My late husband,

669
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,410
Robert, was English.

670
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,840
He had a Charles

671
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,840
on his mother's side.

672
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,170
Have you been? Hmm.

673
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,170
Not for a while.

674
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,140
Well, when I was

675
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,140
quite a bit younger,

676
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,120
Robert and I took

677
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,120
the final voyage

678
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,990
on the RMS Queen Elizabeth

679
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,990
across the pond from New York.

680
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,790
Wow. That sounds

681
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,790
like quite a trip.

682
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,790
Yeah. Oh, it was.

683
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,160
1968.

684
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,330
There was a sense

685
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,330
of design back then

686
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,330
that you just don't see today.

687
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,630
Now it's...

688
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,630
It's all screens,

689
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,630
and technology, and...

690
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,270
People have forgotten

691
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,270
the importance of style,

692
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,270
haven't they?

693
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,330
Boy, you can

694
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,330
say that again.

695
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,630
I'm sorry for

696
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,630
running on like that.

697
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,570
Was there something else

698
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,570
you wanted to ask me?

699
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,920
You know,

700
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,920
I think that I'm all set.

701
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,050
Thank you. It was

702
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,050
so nice to meet you.

703
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,820
It was really nice to

704
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,820
meet you, Dr. Charles.

705
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,660
So, in my opinion,

706
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,660
Mrs. Barlow is competent

707
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,290
and definitely

708
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,290
a bit of a charmer.

709
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,230
One who's not taking her meds

710
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,230
or eating properly.

711
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,330
Not suicidal.

712
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,330
Not depressed,

713
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,330
as far as I can tell.

714
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,930
I mean, what she is,

715
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,930
is she's nostalgic for

716
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,930
a more refined culture.

717
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,870
Which is a far cry

718
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,870
from eating cat food.

719
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,910
She told you

720
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,910
she was eating cat food?

721
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,570
Look at her blood work.

722
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,250
Raised taurine level.

723
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,250
That's the telltale sign.

724
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,780
I thought she was

725
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,780
lying about eating regularly,

726
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,780
but cat food?

727
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,640
Uh, this happens

728
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,640
when money's tight.

729
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,350
You know,

730
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,350
elderly woman,

731
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,350
fixed income.

732
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,790
She'd be way too embarrassed

733
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,790
to say anything.

734
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,050
And what about

735
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,050
dropping her pills

736
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,050
in the toilet?

737
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,320
You think that's

738
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,320
a lie, too?

739
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,820
Oxycodone, sildenafil, benzos,

740
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,820
all have a very high

741
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,820
street value, buddy.

742
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,460
You think this

743
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,460
sweet old lady's

744
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,460
selling them to get money?

745
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,870
Sweet old lady in need, man.

746
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,870
I've seen it before.

747
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,260
You know what

748
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,260
the sad part is?

749
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,330
It's that even

750
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,330
selling her meds,

751
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,710
she doesn't seem to

752
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,710
be making ends meet.

753
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,470
Twenty-five-year-old male.

754
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,470
High-velocity impact.

755
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,750
Found with aortic

756
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,750
and lung lacerations

757
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,750
from a rib.

758
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,220
Aortic cross clamp in place.

759
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,220
Bleeding controlled.

760
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,150
We've got eight units of

761
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,150
packed cells in the field

762
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,690
via a portable bypass

763
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,690
in progress at 3 liters.

764
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,220
Portable bypass?

765
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,220
That your call?

766
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,220
It was our only option.

767
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,920
I got it from here.

768
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,710
Sharon Goodwin,

769
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,710
this is Lawrence.

770
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,640
Wonderful to meet you.

771
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,740
Sorry it's under such

772
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,740
difficult circumstances.

773
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm gonna leave

774
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,440
you two alone.

775
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,750
Um, I don't have much time.

776
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,750
It's a busy day for us.

777
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,110
I understand.

778
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,390
Now, uh, would you

779
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,390
prefer that I call you

780
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,390
Ms. Goodwin or Sharon?

781
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,450
Oh, Sharon is fine.

782
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,320
Sharon,

783
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,320
before we go any further,

784
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,170
are you sure that

785
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,170
you don't want to

786
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,170
try to reconcile?

787
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,870
While legal separation

788
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,870
is not a divorce,

789
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,740
it is a big step

790
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,740
down that road.

791
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,940
We're past

792
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,940
trying to reconcile.

793
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,870
I know we talked a little bit

794
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,870
about this on the phone,

795
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,610
but pending court approval,

796
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,250
you and your spouse

797
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,250
are agreeing to live

798
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,250
independent of each other,

799
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,810
both financially

800
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,810
and physically.

801
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,720
Which we have been

802
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,720
for months.

803
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,830
Illinois law allows a spouse

804
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,830
who is without fault

805
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,560
to receive reasonable support

806
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,560
and maintenance

807
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,100
while parties

808
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,100
are living apart.

809
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,690
We would need to ask the court

810
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,690
to determine that amount.

811
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,860
I don't want

812
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,860
anything from him.

813
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,540
In that case,

814
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,540
when you're ready,

815
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,510
I need you to sign

816
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,510
at the bottom of both copies.

817
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,860
Ms. Kastpen?

818
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,860
Yes?

819
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,790
I'm Dr. Charles.

820
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,790
This is Dr. Reese.

821
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,020
Nice to meet you.

822
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,620
Dr. Manning mentioned

823
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,620
that you were struggling

824
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,820
with how to

825
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,820
break the news

826
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,260
of your husband's

827
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,260
death to your daughter.

828
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,130
Oh, yes.

829
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,530
We were thinking

830
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,530
that if we all sat down,

831
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,630
we might be able to help you

832
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,630
come up with a plan to

833
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,170
how to best discuss

834
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,170
this with Phoebe.

835
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,270
You know, I really appreciate

836
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,270
you're trying to help,

837
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,940
but the timing

838
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,940
is just all wrong.

839
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,580
Phoebe is scared

840
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,580
enough just being here.

841
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,280
I can't add stress

842
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,280
to her right now.

843
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,840
If you'll excuse me.

844
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,420
I think

845
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,420
she's lying to us.

846
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,920
The pause before answering,

847
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,920
throat clearing,

848
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,760
and hand-to-face activity

849
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,760
all point to her

850
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,760
not being truthful.

851
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,960
Just so you know,

852
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,930
all that behavioral cue stuff

853
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,930
about how to spot liars,

854
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,230
bunch of hooey.

855
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,800
Having said that,

856
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,000
I think you're

857
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,000
absolutely right.

858
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,000
She's hiding something.

859
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,330
What do you think?

860
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,180
I think an ED doc

861
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,180
opened him up in the field.

862
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,970
Can you repair it?

863
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,820
Well, it's not every day

864
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,820
that you see

865
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,820
a rib in the aorta,

866
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,420
but I'm gonna try to

867
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,420
repair it by graft.

868
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,600
Whether there is impaired

869
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,600
brain activity or paralysis,

870
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,730
well, that remains to be seen.

871
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,040
You must be one hell

872
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,040
of a poker player.

873
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,000
Why is that?

874
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,510
It was a hell of a gamble.

875
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,380
What's the word?

876
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,560
We had to try.

877
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,560
Did we?

878
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,700
Mrs. Barlow, there are

879
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,700
some things about your case

880
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,700
that are puzzling.

881
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,440
I was hoping I could

882
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,440
ask you a few questions.

883
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,040
Of course.

884
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,710
As I mentioned, your labs

885
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,710
show you're a little

886
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,710
undernourished.

887
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,780
I just want to make sure

888
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,780
you're getting enough to eat.

889
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,050
I am.

890
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,050
Good.

891
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,650
I'm glad to hear that.

892
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,350
Because sometimes

893
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,350
people skip meals

894
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,820
when they're finding it

895
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,820
hard to get by.

896
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,090
"Get by"?

897
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,090
Well, when money's an issue.

898
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,600
We've seen some patients

899
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,900
who felt they had no choice

900
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,900
but to sell their medications.

901
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,670
Are you insinuating...

902
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,670
No, ma'am.

903
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,700
I'm just trying to

904
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,700
understand these results.

905
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,910
I have no need

906
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,910
to sell anything,

907
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,940
and I resent

908
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,940
the implication.

909
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,710
Of course.

910
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,880
Mrs. Barlow,

911
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,790
I just want you to know

912
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,680
that there are

913
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,680
resources available for you,

914
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,680
if you need anything.

915
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,760
I already told you.

916
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,760
I just... I dropped my

917
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,760
pills down the toilet.

918
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,230
That's all there is to it.

919
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,500
Yes, ma'am.

920
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,960
Forgive me.

921
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,810
Olga Barlow,

922
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,810
you gave me such a fright.

923
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,550
Ruth, my hair.

924
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,550
I look terrible.

925
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,550
You look fine.

926
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,350
I've just brought you

927
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,350
your purse,

928
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,320
and wanted to see

929
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,320
if there was

930
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,320
anything you needed.

931
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,290
I'm sorry, Doctor.

932
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,290
I'm her neighbor.

933
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,290
Hi.

934
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,890
And you mustn't

935
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,890
worry about Princess.

936
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,890
I fed her.

937
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,900
I'll give you two some

938
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,900
privacy, Mrs. Barlow.

939
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,900
Excuse me.

940
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,200
Now, what's going on?

941
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,370
She won't admit to it.

942
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,520
Well, I'm not surprised.

943
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,750
People think sex

944
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,750
is a touchy subject.

945
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,950
Believe me,

946
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,950
money is a lot touchier.

947
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,880
Dr. Charles.

948
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,250
I've been doing

949
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,250
a little digging

950
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,230
into Phoebe's mother,

951
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,230
Michelle Kastpen.

952
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,000
I can't find anyone

953
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,000
in or around Chicago

954
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,000
with that name.

955
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,730
Hey. Phoebe's

956
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,730
CT results are back.

957
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,660
Mom has clearly not

958
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,660
given us a full history.

959
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,870
Ms. Kastpen, is there

960
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,870
any other information,

961
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,980
anything at all,

962
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,410
about Phoebe's

963
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,410
medical history that you'd

964
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,410
like to share with us?

965
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,310
Not that I can think of.

966
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,180
The reason we ask

967
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,180
is that Phoebe's CAT scans

968
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,920
revealed several

969
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,920
healed skull fractures.

970
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,850
These explain

971
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,850
Phoebe's hearing loss.

972
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,560
They're also

973
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,560
possible indicators

974
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,560
of child abuse.

975
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,160
Wait, you think it was me?

976
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,440
I would never do

977
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,440
anything to hurt Phoebe.

978
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,880
The way this works,

979
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,880
Ms. Kastpen,

980
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,250
is that unless you

981
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,250
can shine some light

982
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,250
on your daughter's injuries,

983
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,610
we don't really

984
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,610
have any choice

985
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,080
but to contact

986
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,080
the authorities.

987
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,680
I would never, never...

988
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,550
You have to understand

989
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,550
how we're seeing it

990
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,550
from our perspective.

991
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,760
It wasn't me.

992
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,130
I lied. I'm divorced.

993
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,130
It was my ex.

994
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,800
Phoebe would get hurt

995
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,800
when she was with him a lot.

996
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,640
A sprained ankle.

997
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,640
A broken arm.

998
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,640
Too many things to be random.

999
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,240
Did you ever confront him?

1000
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,010
I tried, but he has money.

1001
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,010
He out-lawyered me.

1002
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,450
So, it sounds to me like

1003
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,450
your ex-husband's still alive.

1004
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,520
I felt powerless,

1005
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,520
so I took her.

1006
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,360
You kidnapped your daughter?

1007
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,360
I had to.

1008
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,530
You can't call the police.

1009
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,530
Please.

1010
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,070
They'll just send Phoebe back,

1011
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,070
and I don't know what

1012
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,070
he's gonna do to her.

1013
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,240
You have to

1014
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,240
protect my daughter.

1015
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,240
Please. Please.

1016
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,910
This woman has

1017
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,910
given us a false name

1018
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,780
and admitted to

1019
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,780
kidnapping her daughter.

1020
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,120
But I think she's

1021
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,120
finally being honest.

1022
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,080
She is legitimately concerned

1023
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,080
for her daughter's safety.

1024
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,330
Just because she thinks

1025
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,330
she's telling the truth,

1026
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,330
Doctor,

1027
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,930
doesn't necessarily

1028
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,930
mean that she is.

1029
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,330
Yeah, but if she is,

1030
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,200
I'd hate to tear

1031
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,200
this child away

1032
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,200
from her mother.

1033
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,530
It's not our job to

1034
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,530
figure out what the truth is.

1035
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,660
If we suspect abuse,

1036
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,660
it's our duty to report it

1037
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,870
and let the proper

1038
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,870
authorities sort it out.

1039
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,940
Hey. Any news?

1040
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,150
I'm headed back up to check.

1041
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,220
We found Ignacio's family.

1042
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,220
They're in St. Louis.

1043
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,220
Be here in four hours.

1044
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,360
Let's hope it's

1045
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,360
a happy reunion.

1046
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,360
Sí, sí. In Chicago Med.

1047
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,740
Allow me.

1048
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,740
Oh, thank you.

1049
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,770
Thank you, Doctor.

1050
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,440
Ruth, wasn't it?

1051
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,440
Uh, yes.

1052
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,910
Those are beautiful earrings.

1053
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,910
Emerald?

1054
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,910
Oh, yes. Thank you.

1055
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,180
And nice bag.

1056
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,380
I noticed the one

1057
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,380
you brought Mrs. Barlow

1058
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,380
was a real beauty, too.

1059
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,750
Well, we both have a weakness

1060
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,750
for nice things.

1061
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,190
Ah.

1062
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,450
The thing...

1063
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,790
Never mind. Excuse me.

1064
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,790
No, no.

1065
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,130
What were you going to say?

1066
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,130
Um...

1067
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,470
It just doesn't fit.

1068
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,200
How Mrs. Barlow can afford

1069
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,200
to spend so much on a purse.

1070
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,870
Why?

1071
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,170
Please.

1072
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,190
I could be wrong,

1073
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,190
but I think she's

1074
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,190
economizing on food.

1075
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,710
Not eating.

1076
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,620
You think Olga has

1077
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,620
financial issues?

1078
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,220
Well, what do you think?

1079
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,390
I don't know, but now

1080
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,390
that you mention it...

1081
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,920
Yes?

1082
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,960
I was over there

1083
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,960
for coffee last week,

1084
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,100
and when I went

1085
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,100
to get the sugar,

1086
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,980
all she had were

1087
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,980
those little packets

1088
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,980
that you get in restaurants.

1089
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,180
Is it possible Mrs. Barlow

1090
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,180
might feel pressured

1091
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,080
to keep up

1092
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,080
appearances with you?

1093
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,850
Oh, dear. I...

1094
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,390
I... I may have given Olga

1095
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,390
the wrong impression.

1096
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,050
How's that?

1097
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,290
Actually,

1098
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,290
I don't have that much.

1099
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,930
It's my son.

1100
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,930
My son sends me

1101
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,930
nice things.

1102
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,300
Uh...

1103
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,000
And you never told

1104
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,000
Mrs. Barlow that?

1105
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,130
No.

1106
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,500
I see you care about her,

1107
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,500
and you want to help her.

1108
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,080
I do.

1109
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,040
Then please,

1110
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,040
let her know the truth.

1111
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,650
Excuse me.

1112
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,800
Hi. Can we speak

1113
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,800
for a moment?

1114
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,800
Mmm-hmm.

1115
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,830
You made the call.

1116
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,310
Yes. It is our duty

1117
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,310
in these types of cases

1118
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,310
to alert the authorities.

1119
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,500
Now may be a good time

1120
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,310
to have a conversation

1121
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,310
with Phoebe to prepare her.

1122
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,810
Oh, I'll get that.

1123
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,190
Well, that's a pretty drawing.

1124
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,350
I used to color better.

1125
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,150
Yeah? What changed?

1126
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,150
I don't know.

1127
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,400
Hey, Phoebe, you mind if

1128
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,400
I take a look at your hands?

1129
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,400
Mmm-hmm.

1130
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,990
All right.

1131
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,540
All right, now,

1132
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,540
can you squeeze my fingers

1133
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,540
as hard as you can?

1134
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,670
What are you doing?

1135
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,150
Just making sure

1136
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,150
we haven't missed anything.

1137
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,640
How about with this hand?

1138
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,160
He hasn't woken up yet.

1139
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,160
It could be a sign of

1140
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,160
impaired brain function.

1141
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,160
It's too soon

1142
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,160
to make that call.

1143
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,520
You do a Babinski?

1144
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,230
It's your patient.

1145
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,230
I didn't want to overstep.

1146
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,430
What did I do

1147
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,430
to this guy?

1148
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,390
Listen, Will,

1149
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,270
he's still got a good amount

1150
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,270
of paralytic in him.

1151
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,910
He's also

1152
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,910
acidotic and cold.

1153
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,410
You can't expect

1154
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,410
a good reaction just yet.

1155
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,110
Hi.

1156
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,380
So, after I observed

1157
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,380
the weakness

1158
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,380
in Phoebe's hand,

1159
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,780
I ran some tests on

1160
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,780
the blood work we took,

1161
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,190
and the results showed

1162
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,190
an explanation for

1163
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,190
her hearing loss.

1164
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,750
She has a genetic condition

1165
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,750
called Osteopetrosis.

1166
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,380
What?

1167
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,020
It's a bone disease

1168
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,020
that can cause

1169
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,020
progressive hearing loss.

1170
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,430
It also explains

1171
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,430
the carpal tunnel

1172
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,730
that's causing

1173
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,730
weakness in her wrists.

1174
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,430
But I don't have it,

1175
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,430
and neither does her father.

1176
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,200
It just means that

1177
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,200
you and her father are

1178
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,200
both genetic carriers.

1179
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,670
Is she gonna be deaf?

1180
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,710
Not necessarily.

1181
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,870
We've had some success

1182
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,870
in treating the condition

1183
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,540
with bone marrow

1184
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,540
transplants.

1185
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,540
Okay.

1186
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,250
What aren't you telling me?

1187
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,120
Osteopetrosis makes bones

1188
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,120
abnormally dense

1189
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,120
and prone to breakage,

1190
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,890
which explains

1191
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,890
her skull fractures.

1192
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,720
What I'm trying to say is

1193
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,090
I don't think

1194
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,090
she was ever abused.

1195
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,160
Oh, my God.

1196
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,560
He didn't hurt her?

1197
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,030
What have I done?

1198
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,500
What have I done?

1199
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,980
Ms. Kastpen?

1200
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,680
I'm Detective Olinsky.

1201
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,730
What have I done?

1202
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,160
Still hasn't come to.

1203
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,500
Dr. Halstead,

1204
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,500
we saved his life.

1205
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,500
For what?

1206
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,770
To lie like this

1207
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,770
on a ventilator

1208
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,770
for God knows how long?

1209
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,170
We don't know

1210
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,170
that's the case.

1211
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,710
He's been off sedation

1212
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,710
for an hour and a half.

1213
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,710
He should be coming around.

1214
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,640
Okay, so let's give

1215
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,640
him a little nudge.

1216
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,850
Flumazenil,

1217
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,850
0.2 milligrams IV push.

1218
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,950
Wait. We don't know

1219
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,950
his history.

1220
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,880
If he's an alcoholic

1221
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,880
or on a benzo,

1222
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,880
he could seize.

1223
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,150
That's not gonna happen.

1224
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,150
Please.

1225
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,150
Yes, Doctor.

1226
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,690
We need to know

1227
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,690
his mental status.

1228
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,970
Hold on.

1229
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,940
Mr. Garza, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

1230
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,940
You're at Chicago Med.

1231
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,250
You were in an accident.

1232
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,250
You were hit by a car.

1233
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,390
Do you need me

1234
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,390
to translate?

1235
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,790
Oh. Uh, no. Thank you.

1236
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,030
Good.

1237
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,110
Nice.

1238
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,110
You got a good grip there.

1239
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,020
Mr. Garza, I want you

1240
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,020
to push your foot down,

1241
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,720
like you're stepping

1242
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,720
on the gas pedal of a car.

1243
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,020
Okay. How about this?

1244
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,620
Mr. Garza,

1245
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,620
can you move your toes?

1246
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,660
Yes.

1247
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,770
You're a rock star,

1248
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,770
Mr. Garza.

1249
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,840
You did great.

1250
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,840
Now we're gonna let

1251
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,840
you get some rest.

1252
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,320
I'm so sorry.

1253
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,360
No, it's... It's okay.

1254
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,420
He's okay.

1255
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,530
Then why...

1256
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,640
I'm just so relieved.

1257
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,040
Oh...

1258
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,210
Hey.

1259
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,390
Good job getting

1260
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,390
the bypass out there.

1261
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,060
It's okay, baby.

1262
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,060
Don't go.

1263
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,470
It's okay, baby.

1264
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,470
Stay.

1265
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,830
No, don't go,

1266
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,830
Mommy! Don't go!

1267
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,830
Baby, it's okay, it's okay.

1268
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,970
Mom, come back! Mom!

1269
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,700
No! Come back, Mommy!

1270
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,670
Mom!

1271
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,850
She thought she was

1272
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,850
doing the right thing.

1273
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,540
She risked everything

1274
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,540
and lost everything

1275
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,090
to get her daughter

1276
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,090
out of harm's way,

1277
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,490
and we're

1278
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,490
sending her to jail.

1279
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,220
I understand

1280
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,220
why she did it,

1281
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,330
but couldn't she

1282
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,330
have had a doctor

1283
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,550
evaluate Phoebe

1284
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,550
before going on the run?

1285
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,560
She messed up

1286
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,560
so many lives.

1287
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,560
Yeah, but...

1288
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,630
It still feels wrong.

1289
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,590
I know.

1290
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,130
So, this was all just about

1291
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,130
keeping up with the Joneses.

1292
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,700
It was a good

1293
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,700
catch, Dr. Choi.

1294
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,770
A new one for me.

1295
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,740
Pride.

1296
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,380
It can literally kill you.

1297
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,640
I guess sometimes

1298
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,640
that's all we

1299
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,640
have left, right?

1300
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,350
Someone's happy.

1301
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,920
Ignacio is going to make it.

1302
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,230
Yes!

1303
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,230
We did that.

1304
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,130
Man, you really

1305
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,130
stepped up today.

1306
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,930
You impressed me out there.

1307
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,560
Hold up. Is...

1308
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,560
Is that a compliment?

1309
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,300
'Cause as I remember it,

1310
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,300
you were like,

1311
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,710
"Don't you even think about

1312
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,710
putting in that chest tube."

1313
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,840
Yeah. You know what?

1314
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,840
I was proud of you,

1315
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,510
and now you're

1316
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,510
just being a dick.

1317
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,840
Bye-bye.

1318
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,920
Nothing, Mom.

1319
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,920
I just wanted to say

1320
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,920
thanks for the check.

1321
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,220
No, I... I...

1322
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,220
I appreciate it, Mom.

1323
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,220
I appreciate everything.

1324
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,290
All right, bye.

1325
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,290
Seriously?

1326
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,570
I thought you were

1327
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,570
pissed off at her.

1328
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,570
Yeah, I was.

1329
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,740
I mean,

1330
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,740
you know, she wasn't...

1331
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,150
She wasn't a great mom,

1332
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,150
but she tried her best.

1333
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,150
I realize that.

1334
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,210
Okay.

1335
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,940
Uh...

1336
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,390
Anyway,

1337
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,390
I've got all this money,

1338
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,390
so where do you want to eat?

1339
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,620
I hear there's this

1340
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,620
great place uptown

1341
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,620
with a lobster mac to die for.

1342
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,680
All right.

1343
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,750
Rough day?

1344
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,750
You could say that.

1345
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,820
Yeah.

1346
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,490
Wait. I thought

1347
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,490
you had a win today?

1348
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,990
Only thing I did right

1349
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,990
today was double-time

1350
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,370
some heavy stuff

1351
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,370
across the city.

1352
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,230
Same thing any grunt

1353
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,230
could do in basic.

1354
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,730
Jeff...

1355
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,740
Whatever you did,

1356
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,740
it saved a life.

1357
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,740
That's something.

1358
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,090
Come in.

1359
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,490
Hey, I just thought

1360
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,490
you might like to know

1361
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,730
that Dr. Halstead's

1362
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,730
bypass patient,

1363
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,730
he's doing well.

1364
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,030
Oh.

1365
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,140
Good. So now you can finish

1366
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,140
your marathon shift.

1367
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,540
Go home, Dr. Rhodes.

1368
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,540
Put your feet up.

1369
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,350
Oh, actually, I had something

1370
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,350
a little different in mind.

1371
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,510
What about you?

1372
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,580
Uh, just gonna go home.

1373
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,850
Okay.

1374
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,590
You know, this place

1375
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,590
I'm going, it's... It's...

1376
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,160
It's pretty fun.

1377
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,960
Maybe you want to join me?

1378
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,410
A few more feet,

1379
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,410
you can officially check

1380
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,410
marathon off your bucket list.

1381
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,610
Yeah, "officially" is

1382
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,610
a bit of a stretch.

1383
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,970
Hold that thought.

1384
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,560
Doesn't get more

1385
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,560
official than this.

1386
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,950
With a time of 10 hours

1387
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,950
and six minutes,

1388
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,760
Dr. Nina Shore has just set

1389
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,760
a new marathon record.

1390
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,740
There it is.

1391
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,740
Ah.

1392
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,070
Now, this is different.

1393
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,700
Dr. Downey

1394
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,700
loved this place.

1395
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,750
He said it was as close

1396
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,750
as you could get

1397
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,750
to the real thing.

1398
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,210
Aloha!

1399
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,210
Oh!

1400
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,080
Oh, thank you.

1401
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,250
It's real.

1402
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,720
Any friend of Connor's.

1403
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,260
Ms. Goodwin, this is Keoni.

1404
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,260
He owns this place.

1405
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,520
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1406
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,720
Pleasure's all mine,

1407
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,720
and it's good to see you, bro.

1408
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,990
It's good to see you, too.

1409
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,060
Enjoy.

1410
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,060
Thank you.

1411
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,930
Do you know

1412
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,930
what aloha means?

1413
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,500
Isn't that what they say

1414
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,500
when you get off the plane?

1415
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,770
I thought it meant welcome.

1416
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,740
No?

1417
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,740
Not exactly.

1418
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,640
Okay.

1419
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,640
Uh...

1420
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,380
Aloha actually means

1421
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,540
to consciously manifest life

1422
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,540
joyously in the present.

1423
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,180
Hmm.

1424
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,730
Well, in that case, aloha.

1425
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,730
Aloha.

1426
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,700
There it is.

1427
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,700
Excellent.

1428
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,670
Yeah, right?
