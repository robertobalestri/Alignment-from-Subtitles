1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,730
I believe it was Cicero

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,730
who said,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,670
"In nothing do men

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,670
more nearly approach the Gods

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,830
"than in

6
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,830
giving health to men."

7
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,870
It's so humbling,

8
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,870
the responsibility.

9
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,340
They say

10
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,340
emergency medicine...

11
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,400
What's with the camera?

12
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,400
They're shooting...

13
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,380
The promo today.

14
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,380
The promo today. Yup.

15
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,440
A star is born.

16
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,880
Maggie?

17
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,880
Yeah.

18
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,220
This is Jason Dodd, 26.

19
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,220
Heart's racing pretty good.

20
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,620
Dr. Halstead,

21
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,620
you're up. April!

22
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,790
He was lugging

23
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,790
the crib out of IKEA

24
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,790
and he just collapsed.

25
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,220
All right,

26
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,220
you'll go to Treatment Two.

27
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,350
Hi, Jason.

28
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,350
I'm Dr. Halstead.

29
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,690
How are you feeling?

30
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,960
Kind of freaked out.

31
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,090
All right, we're gonna

32
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,090
take good care of you.

33
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,130
He's really tachy.

34
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,130
Might be SVT.

35
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,130
Copy.

36
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,040
Hey, we're gonna have

37
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,040
you lie down, okay?

38
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,040
Ready 6 milligrams

39
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,040
of adenosine

40
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,900
and get him up

41
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,900
on the monitors.

42
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,900
Got it.

43
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,140
Jason, you on

44
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,140
any medications?

45
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,140
No.

46
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,640
Any history we should

47
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,640
be aware of?

48
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,640
No.

49
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,800
All right, Jason.

50
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,180
I don't need to tell you

51
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,180
that your heart is racing.

52
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,340
What we're gonna do

53
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,340
is give you a drug

54
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,340
to reset your rhythm.

55
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,680
Reset?

56
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,680
Your heart,

57
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,980
it's gonna pause

58
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,980
for a few seconds.

59
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,980
Wait a minute, what?

60
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,110
It'll be all right.

61
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,940
Let's give

62
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,940
the doctors some room.

63
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,020
Get a flush, 10ccs.

64
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,220
Hold up. What's with

65
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,220
the monitors, April?

66
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,590
It's upside down.

67
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,590
Leads must be reversed.

68
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,790
No, they're fine.

69
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,630
Just breathe, Jason.

70
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,100
This is strange.

71
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,100
It's like everything's

72
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,100
on the wrong side.

73
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,640
Let's get

74
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,640
a chest X-ray.

75
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,640
On it.

76
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,980
What appears to be

77
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,980
the problem here, Doctor?

78
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,680
There appears to be

79
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,680
some irregularities

80
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,770
with the patient's heart.

81
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,380
What kind

82
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,380
of irregularities?

83
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,250
It's not where

84
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,250
it's supposed to be.

85
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,820
Basic anatomy is

86
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,820
usually covered

87
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,820
in the first year of

88
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,260
med school,

89
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,260
Dr. Halstead.

90
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,280
I think he might

91
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,280
be dextrocardic.

92
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,830
I'm about to get

93
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,830
a chest X-ray.

94
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,020
Let's wait on that.

95
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,860
Push the meds.

96
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,860
Mmm-hmm.

97
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,060
Uh, listen up, people.

98
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,000
We're tight on space,

99
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,000
so, if you're not

100
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,000
doing anything useful,

101
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,730
just take

102
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,730
a giant step back.

103
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,140
Heart rate's 120.

104
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,710
BP's ticking up,

105
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,710
100 over 87.

106
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,650
What just happened?

107
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,090
We just saved

108
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,090
your life.

109
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,930
Let's get that picture now.

110
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,930
And, uh, page CT.

111
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,100
I guess Cicero knew

112
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,100
what he was

113
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,100
talking about after all.

114
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,840
Why is this backwards?

115
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,840
It's not.

116
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,310
He's got situs

117
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,310
inversus totalis.

118
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,340
All his major

119
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,340
visceral organs...

120
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,540
Are reversed from

121
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,540
their normal position

122
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,540
inside of his body.

123
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,220
More like a mirror image,

124
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,220
but yeah.

125
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,860
So, uh,

126
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,860
how often do you

127
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,860
see someone with this?

128
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
Never.

129
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,390
Jason, Becca,

130
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,390
this is Dr. Rhodes.

131
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,400
Hi, I'm down from

132
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,400
cardiothoracic surgery.

133
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,230
I'm gonna accompany you

134
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,230
over to run some tests.

135
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,560
See if we can't figure out

136
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,560
what caused your

137
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,560
heart rate to spike.

138
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,830
Okay.

139
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,330
Shame he wouldn't

140
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,330
sign a release.

141
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,140
I wanted to shoot

142
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,140
the scan room in action.

143
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,330
That's the thing about the ED.

144
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,340
Another story's

145
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,340
just a heartbeat away.

146
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,740
Can you say that

147
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,740
again on camera?

148
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,780
Yeah, that'll be better.

149
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,080
Uh, Ms. Goodwin,

150
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,080
if you have a second?

151
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,280
You know, Dr. Halstead,

152
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,280
there was a meeting

153
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,280
last week, uh,

154
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,950
open to anyone who had

155
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,950
concerns about the video.

156
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,620
I don't recall

157
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,620
seeing you there.

158
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,120
I was not there, but...

159
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,850
Dr. Stohl has assured me

160
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,230
that the camera

161
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,230
won't get in the way

162
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,230
of us treating our patients,

163
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,550
if that's your worry.

164
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,460
That's one

165
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,460
of them, yeah.

166
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,030
I'm gonna tell you,

167
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,030
I'm proud of this ED.

168
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,560
I've assembled

169
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,560
the finest staff in the city,

170
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,110
and if even one patient

171
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,110
decides to come here

172
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,170
because they saw this video

173
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,170
on our website,

174
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,880
then I think

175
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,880
it's well worth it.

176
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,880
Don't you?

177
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,540
Dr. Halstead?

178
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,710
Come round with me.

179
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,850
Carry on.

180
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,460
Not the most

181
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,460
cooperative intake ever.

182
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,460
Woman in Treatment Six?

183
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,790
Yeah, Laura Green.

184
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,790
Age 39. MVC,

185
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,460
5 centimeter laceration

186
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,460
on her left upper forehead.

187
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,470
GS 15, no LOC.

188
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,470
Vitals stable.

189
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,060
Blood and personality,

190
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,060
both type A.

191
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,140
I'll take it from here.

192
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,140
Thank you, Jeff.

193
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,140
Sure.

194
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,670
So it's really over

195
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,670
between you two?

196
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,940
Uh-huh. Why?

197
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,750
Just impressed.

198
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
Personally, I could never

199
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
work alongside an ex.

200
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,110
Too much boil and bubble.

201
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,160
Jeff and I were good friends

202
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,160
before anything happened

203
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,160
between us.

204
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,580
Guess it makes it easier

205
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,580
to find that

206
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,580
equilibrium again.

207
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,890
Good for you.

208
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,130
No, no, no.

209
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,130
We're not waiving

210
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,130
the contingencies, no.

211
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,730
Oh, let me call you

212
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,730
right back.

213
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,130
I got another doctor

214
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,130
in here.

215
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,940
Hi, Ms. Green.

216
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,940
I'm Dr. Manning.

217
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,060
Can you tell me

218
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,060
what happened?

219
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,430
I hit a patch of black ice.

220
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,430
Driving too fast.

221
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,300
My daughter had

222
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,300
another meltdown

223
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,300
at school.

224
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,170
Got pulled out of a meeting

225
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,170
to go pick her up,

226
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,870
again.

227
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,410
Hello,

228
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,410
what's your name?

229
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,470
Ariel, a girl who has

230
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,470
zero appreciation

231
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,210
for what it's like to be

232
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,210
in her mother's shoes.

233
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,550
No wonder I have an ulcer.

234
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,550
An ulcer?

235
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,950
Nothing Tums

236
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,950
can't manage.

237
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,320
Look, can we make this quick?

238
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,320
I am super deep

239
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,320
in the weeds today.

240
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,890
Sure, let me take a look.

241
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,060
Sorry.

242
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,290
Ow!

243
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,970
Okay.

244
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,040
You okay, Ariel?

245
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,040
Did you get hurt

246
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,040
in the crash, too?

247
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,700
She's been complaining

248
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,700
like this for months.

249
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,140
I've taken her to every

250
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,140
GI specialist in the city

251
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,140
at considerable expense.

252
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,650
No one could find

253
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,650
anything wrong with her.

254
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,710
It's not my stomach

255
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,710
this time, Mom.

256
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,880
It's my head.

257
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,880
It's throbbing.

258
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,180
Now she's got a headache.

259
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,410
I think she's trying

260
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,410
to imitate me.

261
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,580
Some juvenile attempt to

262
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,580
mock her mother.

263
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,490
Okay, uh, Laura,

264
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,490
I would like plastics

265
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,490
to come down and sew you up

266
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,360
so you get the best

267
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,360
cosmetic result, okay?

268
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,950
I really do have to

269
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,950
get back to work.

270
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,290
I will try my best

271
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,290
to expedite things,

272
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,490
but since you're

273
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,490
already here,

274
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,760
perhaps I can take a look

275
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,760
at your daughter?

276
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Yeah, yeah,

277
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
that's fine.

278
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Okay.

279
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,200
CJ? Sorry.

280
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,200
Where were we?

281
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,440
I'm not just

282
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,440
making this up.

283
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,220
Oh, I get it.

284
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,220
You're creating a vacuum.

285
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,320
I read about this somewhere.

286
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,320
I, uh...

287
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,750
I don't know,

288
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,750
I really felt compelled

289
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,750
to say something.

290
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Remind me again why

291
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
you're here, Sarah.

292
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,100
Dr. Charles said

293
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,100
undergoing therapy

294
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,200
would help me become

295
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,200
a better psychiatrist.

296
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,070
And thus far,

297
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,070
I'd have to say he's right.

298
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm learning so much.

299
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,340
I hate to break this

300
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,340
to you, Sarah,

301
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,670
but what you're

302
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,670
doing here now is not

303
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,670
undergoing therapy.

304
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,340
It's not?

305
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,680
Feels more like you're

306
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,680
auditing a class.

307
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,990
Come here.

308
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,260
Come on.

309
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,930
Look.

310
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,570
What do you see?

311
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,100
Uh...

312
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,840
Do you feel

313
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,840
self-conscious?

314
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,280
A little.

315
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,280
Good.

316
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,850
Self-conscious is what

317
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,850
we're going for.

318
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,210
You know what makes you

319
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,210
better at this job?

320
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,150
Being present.

321
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,580
Being honest.

322
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,390
Especially with yourself.

323
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,650
Try it.

324
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,020
First thought,

325
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,020
best thought.

326
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,390
Um...

327
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,930
Yeah,

328
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,930
I don't know what to...

329
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,930
What to tell you.

330
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,600
I mean, I've led

331
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,600
such a mundane life.

332
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,500
My problems feel

333
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,500
so pedestrian.

334
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,600
Problems.

335
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,470
That's a great start.

336
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,400
Here.

337
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

338
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,920
Hour's up

339
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,920
at 10 of, right?

340
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,550
Normally.

341
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,050
Then, same time

342
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,050
next week?

343
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,530
You know where to find me.

344
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,030
So,

345
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,030
given the patient's age,

346
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,770
I was thinking a woven graft

347
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,770
with a mechanical valve.

348
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,740
And once we adjust

349
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,740
for the inversa,

350
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,400
it should be

351
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,400
a simple plug and play.

352
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,140
Simple?

353
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,910
Yeah, I was saying to

354
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,910
Dr. Bardovi earlier,

355
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,610
once you situate your brain

356
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,610
in the right way...

357
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,480
You were talking to

358
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,480
Dr. Bardovi

359
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,880
about the way

360
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,880
I situate my brain?

361
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,250
What?

362
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,410
You said the way

363
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,410
you situate your brain.

364
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,320
Oh, no, I meant it more,

365
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,320
like, "Once one situates..."

366
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,250
I think

367
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,250
you're underestimating

368
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,250
the challenges here,

369
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,390
severely.

370
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,590
You may be right.

371
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,440
Um... In that case,

372
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,440
I have a suggestion.

373
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,560
How about we put the team

374
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,560
through a dress rehearsal?

375
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,630
A rehearsal?

376
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,630
Mmm-hmm.

377
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,870
I'll have a tech

378
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,870
print us a 3-D model

379
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,870
of this heart,

380
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,180
and that should give us

381
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,180
a very clear idea

382
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,180
of how we'll proceed.

383
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,810
If you think

384
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,810
it'll be worthwhile.

385
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,380
Yeah, I think it'll be good

386
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,380
for everyone to walk

387
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,380
through it.

388
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,950
Mmm.

389
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,180
Keep your hands off me.

390
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,590
Hey, we're trying to help.

391
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,590
We just wanna

392
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,590
take a look, okay?

393
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,720
What do we have here?

394
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,990
Dr. Choi,

395
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,990
this is Rey Ochoa,

396
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,330
who insists that

397
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,330
there is nothing at all

398
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,330
wrong with him.

399
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,990
That's weird.

400
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,700
Charge nurse said

401
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,700
he was found doubled over

402
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,100
on the floor of

403
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,100
a gas station bathroom,

404
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,100
screaming out in pain.

405
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,160
I wasn't screaming in pain.

406
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,160
Only gay-ass punks do that.

407
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,200
Rey, you might not be aware,

408
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,110
but I'm a navy

409
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,110
flight surgeon,

410
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,110
still in active reserve.

411
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,450
And, Jeff,

412
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,450
here was an army ranger.

413
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,040
Seen plenty of men

414
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,040
screaming out in pain.

415
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,580
Tougher guys than me.

416
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,480
So how about

417
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,480
we take a look?

418
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,050
How about you suck me?

419
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,430
Rey...

420
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,430
Come on.

421
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,090
Seen this movie before.

422
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,090
Even when he says

423
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,090
he has something

424
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,090
lodged up his rectum.

425
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
Seriously?

426
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,510
See how he's hunched up

427
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,510
on the gurney,

428
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,210
trying to take the pressure

429
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,210
off the rear end?

430
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,670
Plus all the lip.

431
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,870
The embarrassment

432
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,870
makes them combative.

433
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,410
All right.

434
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,640
I'll try and get an X-ray.

435
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,640
Thanks.

436
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,190
Mr. Mikulski's here

437
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,190
with a fever

438
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,190
and some sinus pain.

439
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,610
Really bad sinus pain,

440
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,610
just FYI.

441
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,220
Diabetic?

442
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,950
How's his glucose?

443
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,950
Totally normal.

444
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,850
They said something

445
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,850
in the waiting area

446
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,360
about signing

447
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,360
some kind of release.

448
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,760
Not necessary,

449
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,760
Mr. Mikulski.

450
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,300
We'd like to send you

451
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,300
on your way ASAP.

452
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,300
Let's get him on a Z-Pak.

453
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,860
Sorry, one second.

454
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,730
You see the swelling?

455
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,670
Under the orbit

456
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,670
of his left eye?

457
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,800
It's practically

458
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,800
imperceptible,

459
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
but I think

460
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
we should get a...

461
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,010
A head and sinus CT,

462
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,010
just to rule out

463
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,010
anything more concerning.

464
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,420
Fever plus sinus pain

465
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,420
equals sinus infection.

466
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,550
Let's Z-Pak

467
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,550
and get you home.

468
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,330
Check back in two days

469
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,330
if your symptoms persist.

470
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,290
Hey, I really

471
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,290
feel like...

472
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,290
No, uh, he's discharged.

473
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,630
Let's find you something

474
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,630
more compelling.

475
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,130
Let's go.

476
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,970
Hey, Mags,

477
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,970
let's get a CBC here

478
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,970
on Mr. Mikulski.

479
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,340
And don't let him leave

480
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,340
until the results come back.

481
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,670
Uh-huh. Go maverick.

482
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,380
Mr. Clarke,

483
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,380
what are we looking at?

484
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,950
Mr. Clarke?

485
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,020
Sorry, we have

486
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,020
a safety issue.

487
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,020
Everybody please step out.

488
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,860
Step out. Okay, thank you.

489
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,860
Step out.

490
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,260
Laura. Hey, Laura,

491
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,260
that's you?

492
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,550
Uh, security, over here.

493
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,860
What's going on?

494
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,790
Dr. Choi was right.

495
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,790
There is something lodged

496
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,790
in the rectum.

497
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,800
What is that, a gun?

498
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,710
He says he has no idea

499
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,710
how the gun got up there.

500
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,390
All right.

501
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,390
What are our options?

502
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,150
It's not gonna be easy

503
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,150
getting it out.

504
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,150
It's just past his sphincter.

505
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,420
Plus, the hammer's cocked.

506
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,060
So if there's

507
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,060
a live round in there...

508
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,060
Seriously?

509
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,590
Could do some real damage.

510
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,590
.22 single-shot derringer.

511
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,730
That's a big kick

512
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,730
for a little gun.

513
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,670
So we work up a plan

514
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,670
to get him to the OR.

515
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,100
Page the surgeon on call.

516
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,900
Ms. Goodwin,

517
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,900
I think it'd be safer

518
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,900
to do it here.

519
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,000
Jeff and I both have

520
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,000
weapons experience.

521
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,600
We sedate him.

522
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,600
Try to slide it out.

523
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,470
If we can't make it,

524
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,470
then we call in surgery.

525
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,940
I'm in.

526
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,910
Should we call CPD?

527
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,910
Yes.

528
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,710
We'll need enough

529
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,710
body armor and gear

530
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,480
to protect

531
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,480
whoever's in there with him.

532
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,660
And let's keep

533
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,660
this area clear.

534
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,020
And I'll keep the cameraman

535
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,020
away from all this.

536
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,490
It's unsafe, and frankly,

537
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,490
it's distasteful.

538
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,790
Thank you.

539
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,220
The second

540
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,220
you focus on one pain,

541
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,220
it disappears,

542
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,130
or shifts

543
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,130
someplace else entirely.

544
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,670
First it was her stomach,

545
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,670
then her forehead.

546
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,240
We move her

547
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,240
into another room,

548
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,240
and now it's her sinuses.

549
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,840
Mmm. Tricky hitting

550
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,840
a moving target.

551
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,740
And listen, I am predisposed

552
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,740
to side with anyone

553
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,740
against the mother,

554
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,010
but I don't know

555
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,010
that she's wrong

556
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,010
about her daughter.

557
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,570
You think she might be

558
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,570
faking it?

559
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,910
I had her record

560
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,910
sent over,

561
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,220
and amongst other things,

562
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,550
she's been worked up

563
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,550
for achalasia,

564
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,550
abdominal migraine,

565
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,190
cyclic vomiting syndrome.

566
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,320
All negative.

567
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,830
It does not appear to be

568
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,830
anything physiological.

569
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,590
Why don't I have

570
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,590
a little chat?

571
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,420
I would appreciate that.

572
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,420
Thank you.

573
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,360
What's up

574
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,360
with the limp?

575
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,360
Rehab.

576
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,300
My physio's got me doing

577
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,300
these Swiss ball squats.

578
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,740
It's frickin' brutal.

579
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,540
CBC's back on

580
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,540
your sinus infection.

581
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,470
Mmm-hmm.

582
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,470
You were right.

583
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,470
White count's elevated.

584
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,780
Not sure it's

585
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,780
elevated enough to change

586
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,780
Stohl's mind, though.

587
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,050
Hand me one of

588
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,050
those video release forms,

589
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,050
will you?

590
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,990
For a guy who's always

591
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,990
complaining about money,

592
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,060
you sure put your job

593
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,060
on the line a lot.

594
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,820
My mom keeps saying

595
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,820
I'm doing this

596
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,820
for attention, but...

597
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,530
God, who likes

598
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,530
seeing doctors?

599
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,730
Your leg okay?

600
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,670
All of a sudden,

601
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,670
my knee hurts.

602
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,670
Hmm.

603
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,340
This place freaks me out

604
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,340
even worse than school.

605
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,170
What freaks you out

606
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,170
about school?

607
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,780
Everything.

608
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,280
There's so much drama.

609
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
It makes me crazy anxious.

610
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,620
Sometimes I hide.

611
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,620
Sometimes I get into fights.

612
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,520
That's what happened today?

613
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,790
I looked up

614
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,790
schizophrenia online.

615
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,330
It says it can start

616
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,330
in late adolescence.

617
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,800
Mmm. Not usually

618
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,800
as early as 14, but...

619
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,370
I mean, are you

620
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,370
hearing or seeing things

621
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,370
that other people aren't?

622
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,170
No.

623
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,620
But sometimes, it's like

624
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,620
my feelings aren't my own.

625
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,280
Like they're

626
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,280
someone else's.

627
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,420
Hmm.

628
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,460
Do you think I'm crazy?

629
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,350
Uh, not really

630
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,350
my favorite word, but no.

631
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,350
No, I don't.

632
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,360
Thank you.

633
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,930
Let's get you

634
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,930
what you need.

635
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,360
Excuse me, Dr. Stohl?

636
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,710
About Ed Mikulski,

637
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,710
in Room Four?

638
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,170
I thought I already

639
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,170
discharged him.

640
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,640
But that was before

641
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,640
his blood work came back

642
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,440
with a white count

643
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,440
of 18,000.

644
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,510
I just wanted your approval

645
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,510
before I send him over

646
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,510
for scans.

647
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,910
He was willing to sign

648
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,910
a video waiver,

649
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,810
by the way,

650
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,810
if that matters.

651
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,480
Well, we haven't found

652
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,480
anybody to follow yet,

653
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,520
and I did wanna film

654
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,520
the scanning facility.

655
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,180
Plus, Dr. Halstead here

656
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,180
pops on camera.

657
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,890
Must be the red hair.

658
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,890
All right, uh,

659
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,890
send him over.

660
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,900
Wait a second, will you?

661
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,900
We gotta swap out a battery.

662
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,070
Sure thing.

663
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,070
Dr. Halstead?

664
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,700
You wouldn't be trying

665
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,700
to show me up on camera,

666
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,700
would you?

667
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,400
What?

668
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,040
Never mind.

669
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,980
I'll begin by placing

670
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,980
the venus cannula

671
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,980
in the right atrium.

672
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,620
Uh, I'm sorry, sir,

673
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,550
but in this case,

674
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,550
it's actually

675
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,550
the one that's on the left.

676
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,090
We have to remember that

677
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,090
everything here is mirrored.

678
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,270
I am not in a good

679
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,270
position for this.

680
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,260
Okay.

681
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,000
Let's switch sides, then.

682
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,810
Atrial purse string suture.

683
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,240
Where am I supposed

684
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,240
to be now?

685
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,550
To my left.

686
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,980
But then I'll be

687
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,980
out of the field.

688
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,810
I can't move, guys,

689
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,810
so don't look at me.

690
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,810
Am I okay, here?

691
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,810
Am I

692
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,810
in the right spot?

693
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,220
Yeah, you're fine.

694
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,220
Where's that suture?

695
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,620
I don't wanna

696
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,620
reach over the patient.

697
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,960
Beth, why don't you just

698
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,960
go stand on his right?

699
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,930
You two, switch.

700
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,660
This is why we're here.

701
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,660
Right, folks?

702
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,830
We're just trying to

703
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,830
work out the kinks.

704
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,960
I have to reach

705
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,960
across my body.

706
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,960
This is all wasted motion.

707
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,700
But there's nowhere else

708
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,700
I can stand.

709
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,740
I am sick and tired

710
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,740
of being mocked!

711
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,010
I will not abide

712
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,010
insubordination!

713
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,510
I have put up

714
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,510
with that ingrate

715
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,510
for seven years.

716
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,610
No more.

717
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,020
Beth, he's gonna calm down.

718
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,350
I'm done!

719
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,860
Ethan?

720
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,860
Yeah.

721
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,370
I thought we had a policy

722
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,370
about dealing with

723
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,370
polyembolokoilamania?

724
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,970
I'm sorry?

725
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,510
The insertion of

726
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,510
a foreign object

727
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,510
into an orifice.

728
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,070
All patients

729
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,070
are supposed to be

730
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,070
psychiatrically evaluated.

731
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,480
We've got a bit of

732
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,480
a mitigating

733
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,480
circumstance here, Reese.

734
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,110
The gun. Exactly.

735
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,810
To do what he did,

736
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,810
this kid must be

737
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,810
seriously troubled.

738
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,050
And now,

739
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,050
he's alone and terrified.

740
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,990
Are the restraints

741
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,990
really necessary?

742
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,420
For the safety

743
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,420
of everyone, yes.

744
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,060
Well,

745
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,060
I wanna go talk to him.

746
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,060
How do we make that happen?

747
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,240
Rey, this is Dr. Reese.

748
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,240
She's gonna help

749
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,240
with the procedure.

750
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,830
Hello, Rey.

751
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,270
How much longer

752
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,270
is this gonna take?

753
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,910
Not too much.

754
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,910
We're gearing up now.

755
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,180
Is it okay if I sit with him

756
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,180
until we get started,

757
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,180
if that's okay with you?

758
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,540
Sure.

759
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,880
You can stay.

760
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,880
Okay.

761
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,060
Dr. Halstead,

762
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,060
you got a second?

763
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,830
Yeah, of course.

764
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,360
I just wanted to say,

765
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,360
I appreciate you

766
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,360
going the extra mile here.

767
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,400
With the diabetes,

768
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,400
let's just say

769
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,230
I've seen my share of

770
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,230
doctors over the years.

771
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,400
So few of them

772
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,400
really listen to you,

773
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,970
especially in

774
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,970
the emergency room.

775
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,970
I'm just doing my job,

776
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,970
Mr. Mikulski.

777
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,970
You don't need to thank me.

778
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,680
I know, but I want to.

779
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,150
It's the first time

780
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,150
I felt like someone was

781
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,150
in my corner.

782
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,040
I'll tell anyone

783
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,040
who's listening.

784
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,690
This is the best hospital

785
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,690
in the city, hands down.

786
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,860
Thank you

787
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,860
for saying that, Ed.

788
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,560
Any time.

789
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,730
Your guy's scans came back.

790
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,600
Sinus opacification

791
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,600
and invasion

792
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,600
through the cribriform plate.

793
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,440
It's mucormycosis,

794
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,440
most likely.

795
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,180
Stohl wanted to

796
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,180
send him home.

797
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,810
Who looks like

798
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,810
he doesn't know

799
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,810
basic anatomy now?

800
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,150
It's an amazing catch,

801
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,150
Dr. Halstead.

802
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,320
I knew it.

803
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,680
Yeah.

804
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,530
You the man, Will.

805
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,690
But this is bad news

806
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,690
for your patient, right?

807
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,100
Yeah.

808
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,140
I like your tattoos.

809
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,140
Who designed them?

810
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,140
Me.

811
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,840
You're really talented.

812
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,010
You go to school for that?

813
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,210
No.

814
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,750
Just fool around on my own.

815
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,680
Huh.

816
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,350
I saw you

817
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,350
looking at my scars.

818
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,550
You're not gonna

819
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,550
ask me about them?

820
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,050
Do you wanna

821
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,050
tell me about them?

822
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,120
What are you,

823
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,120
a shrink or something?

824
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,850
Not yet. Officially,

825
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,850
I'm still training.

826
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,400
Do you cut yourself, Rey?

827
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,490
I'm not crazy.

828
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,360
I know.

829
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,370
What I'm discovering

830
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,370
doing this is

831
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,510
how we all do things

832
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,510
that we can't explain.

833
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,780
Things we say,

834
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,780
things we do to ourselves.

835
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,850
Maybe we're

836
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,850
just experimenting

837
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,190
to see how it feels,

838
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,160
or maybe we're

839
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,160
reliving something

840
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,660
that happened to us

841
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,660
in the past.

842
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,470
Did something

843
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,470
happen to you, Rey?

844
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,530
Dr. Reese? Mr. Ochoa.

845
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,400
The hell is this?

846
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,710
People are saying

847
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,710
you're some kind of freak.

848
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,910
It's not what it

849
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,910
looks like, Papa.

850
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,110
It was for Wilmer.

851
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,110
Your cousin?

852
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,990
That fool's

853
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,990
in Crook County.

854
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,890
He asked me to

855
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,890
smuggle a gun in for him.

856
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,320
Said he needed to

857
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,320
protect himself.

858
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,130
The guy in front of me

859
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,130
beeped going through

860
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,130
the metal detector.

861
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,060
They tackled him

862
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,060
to the ground.

863
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,030
I guess I panicked.

864
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,360
Ran out before

865
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,360
they could search me.

866
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,530
The pain must have

867
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,530
made me pass out.

868
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,270
Sorry.

869
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,800
I know I messed up.

870
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,080
No. No, mijo.

871
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,780
You done good.

872
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,750
You tell them

873
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,750
it was okay to remove it?

874
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,120
It's my son. No.

875
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,120
We understand...

876
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,690
No, it's not gonna happen.

877
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,690
I'm sorry.

878
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,330
We'll have to put

879
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,330
the procedure on hold.

880
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,970
Why?

881
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,310
Our patient just

882
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,310
confessed to a crime.

883
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,810
That means the gun is

884
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,810
considered evidence.

885
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,210
And since his father

886
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,210
convinced him to

887
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,210
withdraw consent,

888
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,250
we'll have to secure

889
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,250
a warrant to remove it.

890
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,530
Breaking bad news

891
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,530
is the most sobering

892
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,530
of our obligations.

893
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
No matter how

894
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
many times you do it,

895
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
it never gets any easier.

896
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,240
Excuse me. One second.

897
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,380
Yeah?

898
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,380
Any chance we can

899
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,380
do this off-camera?

900
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,640
Off-camera?

901
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,350
He didn't sign up

902
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,350
for this.

903
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,440
And it's probably not

904
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,440
gonna make the video.

905
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,750
You're wrong.

906
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,750
People wanna see

907
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,750
how compassionate

908
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,750
we can be.

909
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,690
But it's so intrusive.

910
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,920
You can't have it both ways.

911
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,920
You wanted a release?

912
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,920
This is what happens

913
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,920
when they sign it.

914
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,960
A fungal infection

915
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,960
in my brain?

916
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,940
That doesn't sound good.

917
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,470
No, not at all what

918
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,470
we were hoping for.

919
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,510
But let's just take this

920
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,510
one step at a time, okay?

921
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,510
And, uh...

922
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,610
Just so I know what

923
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,610
we're talking about here,

924
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,340
is this the kind of thing

925
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,340
that could keep me

926
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,340
in the hospital?

927
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,280
I would plan on that, yes.

928
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,720
Should I plan

929
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,720
on ever leaving?

930
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,390
If it's advanced enough

931
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,390
to require surgery,

932
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,390
then you should know,

933
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,690
there's about

934
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,690
a 90% mortality rate.

935
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,200
Oh, my God.

936
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,770
I'm so sorry.

937
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,990
Yes, it's a lot

938
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,990
to process.

939
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,310
I'm just glad you spotted it

940
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,310
when you did.

941
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,040
Thank you.

942
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,980
Thank you, both.

943
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,150
State's Attorney's

944
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,150
secured the warrant.

945
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,150
We're a go.

946
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,990
I don't believe that story

947
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,990
Rey's telling

948
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,990
about the gun, do you?

949
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,000
About smuggling it

950
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,000
into jail? Who knows?

951
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,300
Did you notice the scars

952
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,300
on Rey's arms?

953
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,700
I'm pretty sure

954
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,700
he's been cutting himself.

955
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,000
He's no stranger

956
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,000
to self-harm.

957
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,270
I'm sympathetic,

958
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,270
Sarah, I truly am.

959
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't know what

960
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,000
you want me to do, though.

961
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,100
I just want another chance

962
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,100
to get him to open up

963
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,670
before he's swallowed up

964
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,670
by the system.

965
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,140
How about we start

966
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,140
by making sure

967
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,140
he survives this, okay?

968
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,590
That should do it.

969
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,790
Thank you, Dr. Pellino.

970
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,560
Looks good.

971
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,490
I am, however,

972
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,490
still concerned

973
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,490
about your ulcer.

974
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,070
Have you ever thought about

975
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,070
maybe speaking to somebody

976
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,570
about reducing your stress?

977
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,830
I can manage my stress.

978
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,140
If I don't,

979
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,140
then the next person will.

980
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,840
How's my daughter?

981
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,840
Did you find anything?

982
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,170
No, not yet.

983
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,310
Surprise, surprise.

984
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,450
Listen, Dr. Manning,

985
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,450
I appreciate your efforts,

986
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,010
but I'm going to need you

987
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,010
to discharge me

988
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,010
and my daughter.

989
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,480
I'll sign out against

990
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,480
medical advice if necessary.

991
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,150
Sure. I'll get

992
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,150
the paperwork started.

993
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,150
Thanks.

994
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,530
Hey. Any progress?

995
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,270
Definitely stressed out

996
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,270
and anxious.

997
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,790
Whether it rises to

998
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,790
the level of a disorder,

999
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,790
I don't know.

1000
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,610
She mentioned a potentially

1001
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,610
unhealthy association

1002
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,610
with food,

1003
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,870
but I'm not getting

1004
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,870
an eating disorder vibe

1005
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,870
from her. You know?

1006
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,680
No, me neither.

1007
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,680
Her weight is normal

1008
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,680
for her height.

1009
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,940
She's not showing

1010
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,940
any signs

1011
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,940
of malnourishment.

1012
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,070
And she says her

1013
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,070
stomach ache's gone,

1014
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,070
her headache's gone.

1015
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,550
Her knee

1016
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,550
is hurting her now.

1017
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,650
I was thinking we could

1018
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,650
give her a benzo.

1019
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,350
See if alleviating

1020
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,350
her anxiety

1021
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,520
might tell us something

1022
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,520
about her physical symptoms?

1023
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,390
Unfortunately,

1024
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,390
we don't have time.

1025
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,550
The mom wants to

1026
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,550
leave now.

1027
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,550
Dr. Charles?

1028
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,550
Dr. Latham called.

1029
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,060
Asked you to come

1030
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,060
to his office.

1031
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,190
He says it's urgent.

1032
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,660
Tell him

1033
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,660
I'll be right there.

1034
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,660
Okay.

1035
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,560
I've been staring

1036
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,560
at these scans

1037
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,560
all afternoon

1038
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,200
in a mirror trying to

1039
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,200
retrain my brain.

1040
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,310
It's not working.

1041
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,780
The TMS treatments

1042
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,780
have elicited

1043
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,780
a very positive response.

1044
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,150
It made my brain

1045
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,150
more flexible,

1046
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,150
my thinking more supple.

1047
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,540
Perhaps if I had

1048
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,540
another treatment?

1049
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,720
Wait.

1050
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,750
You're saying

1051
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,750
you want to undergo

1052
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,080
a TMS treatment to

1053
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,080
prepare you to operate?

1054
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,320
Yes.

1055
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,790
I was going to talk to

1056
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,790
Dr. Weyland today,

1057
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,790
but she's unavailable.

1058
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,090
Yeah, well,

1059
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,760
she would tell you

1060
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,760
the same thing

1061
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,560
that I'm about to,

1062
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,560
which is "No."

1063
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,240
Why not?

1064
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,240
You shouldn't do

1065
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,240
anything risky,

1066
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,140
let alone perform

1067
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,140
open-heart surgery.

1068
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,540
It would be derelict.

1069
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,240
Tell me, then,

1070
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,240
what is the solution?

1071
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:53,840
Well, the solution

1072
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:53,840
is to realize

1073
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,750
that you don't have to

1074
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,750
carry all the weight

1075
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,750
on your shoulders.

1076
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,750
You have an excellent team.

1077
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,750
Rely on your team.

1078
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,750
Rely on Connor.

1079
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,120
No, I can't. I see the world

1080
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,120
differently now.

1081
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,190
The sarcasm,

1082
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,190
the hidden agendas.

1083
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,830
Even when my window

1084
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,830
is closed,

1085
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,830
I know they're there.

1086
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,160
I have no one to

1087
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,160
rely on now but myself.

1088
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,300
I think you'll find

1089
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,300
that that's not the case.

1090
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,270
It's like trying

1091
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,270
to cut your hair

1092
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,270
in front of a mirror.

1093
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,470
Left is right,

1094
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,470
right is left. Impossible.

1095
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,740
Left to right,

1096
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,440
right to left?

1097
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,190
Dr. Halstead.

1098
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,120
He's having a seizure.

1099
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,120
Five of Ativan, stat.

1100
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,120
On it.

1101
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,920
Feet are flushed.

1102
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,960
Flow Y-O2.

1103
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,700
Suction ready.

1104
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,700
Ready.

1105
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,730
I'm going to be

1106
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,730
working late tonight,

1107
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,100
but Mai will stay

1108
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,100
with you until then.

1109
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,540
Don't even think

1110
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,540
about using this

1111
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,200
as an excuse not

1112
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,200
to do your homework.

1113
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,770
Watch his airway.

1114
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,840
Seriously, Ariel,

1115
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,840
you've made your point.

1116
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,210
Stop putting on a show.

1117
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,350
Ariel? Oh, my God.

1118
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,350
Ariel?

1119
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,380
She's having a seizure.

1120
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,580
No, I don't think so.

1121
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,650
There's no nystagmus,

1122
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,160
and her muscle movements

1123
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,160
are not asynchronous.

1124
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,450
Then what is wrong

1125
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,450
with her?

1126
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,820
We need to

1127
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,820
isolate her.

1128
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,820
What?

1129
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,160
She needs to be

1130
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,160
isolated now.

1131
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,020
I need an empty room, now!

1132
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,730
We're going to get

1133
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,730
started now, Rey.

1134
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,560
If you feel any discomfort,

1135
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,560
just tell us.

1136
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,340
I need you to stop

1137
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,340
moving your leg, Rey.

1138
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,570
Where am I?

1139
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,380
Just keep still, bud.

1140
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,380
Almost there.

1141
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,980
What?

1142
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,040
Jeff!

1143
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,040
Gun vacated!

1144
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,010
Go, go, go!

1145
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,010
You okay, Jeff?

1146
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,420
I'm all right.

1147
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,420
I'm all right. How's he?

1148
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,450
Exit wound in

1149
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,450
the right lower quadrant,

1150
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,450
we need a trauma lab.

1151
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,120
Pack the wound.

1152
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,120
Let's get him to the OR.

1153
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,290
Ready? One, two, three.

1154
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,590
All right,

1155
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,590
we're moving him.

1156
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,790
Let me take a look.

1157
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,860
All right,

1158
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,860
watch your backs.

1159
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,860
Coming through.

1160
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,350
How we doing?

1161
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,350
Okay.

1162
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,010
How's that knee doing?

1163
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,690
It feels fine, actually.

1164
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,720
What if I told you

1165
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,720
that that was because

1166
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,650
I just took an Advil?

1167
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,750
I don't understand.

1168
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,520
Ow!

1169
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,890
Why'd you do that?

1170
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,960
Feel like

1171
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,960
I just slapped you?

1172
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,960
Yes.

1173
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,630
I'm sorry.

1174
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,730
I don't like this game.

1175
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,470
I don't understand.

1176
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,430
Ow! Why'd you do that?

1177
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,010
Feel like

1178
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,010
I just slapped you?

1179
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,010
Yes.

1180
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,970
I'm sorry.

1181
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,850
What were you doing

1182
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,850
to my daughter?

1183
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,680
I was trying to confirm

1184
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,680
a diagnosis.

1185
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,920
Um, I want neurology

1186
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,920
to run some tests,

1187
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,650
but based on this

1188
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,650
and Ariel's history,

1189
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,720
I think that she has

1190
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,720
a condition called

1191
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,720
mirror-touch synesthesia.

1192
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,220
What?

1193
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,930
It's a condition that

1194
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,930
causes her to experience

1195
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,200
the physical sensations

1196
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,200
and emotions

1197
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,970
of the people that

1198
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,970
she's interacting with

1199
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,970
as her own.

1200
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,910
My left knee hurts,

1201
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,010
Ariel feels it

1202
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,010
in her right.

1203
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,310
I slap my right cheek,

1204
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,310
she feels like her left

1205
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,310
is being slapped.

1206
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,670
She's mirroring me.

1207
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,990
Her stomach,

1208
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,990
she's responding

1209
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,990
to your ulcer,

1210
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,080
not imitating you.

1211
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,690
She's literally

1212
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,690
feeling your pain.

1213
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,430
Whoever heard of

1214
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,430
such a thing?

1215
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,350
It's a pretty recent

1216
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,350
discovery,

1217
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,660
the existence of

1218
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,660
these mirror neurons.

1219
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,720
Is there a cure?

1220
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,830
Not yet, but there are

1221
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,830
coping strategies

1222
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,030
we can teach her to help her

1223
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,030
manage her condition.

1224
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,980
I'm sorry.

1225
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,750
I have to get this.

1226
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,280
Yeah.

1227
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,820
I cannot believe

1228
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,820
this woman.

1229
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,890
How's that old saying go?

1230
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,230
"You can lead

1231
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,230
a horse to water,

1232
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,930
"but you can't make it gaze

1233
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,930
at its own reflection."

1234
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,760
Page me

1235
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,760
when he's all set.

1236
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,760
Yes, Doctor.

1237
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,140
Oh, excuse me.

1238
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,070
Dr. Rhodes? Looks like

1239
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,070
I'm filling in for

1240
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,070
Beth today.

1241
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,670
Uh-huh.

1242
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,670
I understand

1243
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,670
there's some confusion

1244
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,080
about where we're

1245
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,080
supposed to be standing?

1246
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,580
Uh, yeah.

1247
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,750
Let me get back

1248
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,750
to you on that.

1249
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,550
Beth.

1250
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,020
Forget it.

1251
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,020
No, please, please.

1252
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,390
I'm not changing my mind.

1253
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,390
No, no, no.

1254
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,980
Just one second

1255
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,980
of your time.

1256
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,190
Look, I am not gonna try

1257
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,190
and defend

1258
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,190
Dr. Latham's behavior.

1259
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,530
He flung a tray

1260
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,530
past my head.

1261
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,400
Not the first time,

1262
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,400
by the way.

1263
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,800
But he is the guy

1264
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,800
that's gotta try to save

1265
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,800
that patient's life,

1266
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,400
and while you and I

1267
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,400
both know that he would

1268
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,400
never admit it out loud,

1269
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,840
he relies on you.

1270
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,910
I mean, come on,

1271
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,910
we rely on each other.

1272
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,910
We're a team.

1273
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,750
Someone should

1274
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,750
tell him that.

1275
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,750
He treats us like dirt.

1276
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,310
Yeah.

1277
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,550
But I do know this

1278
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,550
about Dr. Latham,

1279
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,990
he always has the patient's

1280
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,990
best interests at heart,

1281
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,150
and we should, too.

1282
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,460
Really?

1283
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,870
Dr. Rhodes,

1284
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,870
my office, please.

1285
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,870
Yes, sir.

1286
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,340
Close the door.

1287
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,650
Dr. Latham, I'm not sure

1288
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,650
how much of that

1289
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,650
you heard back there.

1290
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,910
I believe most of it.

1291
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,680
If I said anything

1292
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,680
that may have

1293
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,680
offended you, I'm sorry.

1294
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,480
I was only trying...

1295
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,180
There's something

1296
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,180
I should share

1297
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,180
with you.

1298
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,990
I have been recently

1299
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,990
diagnosed with an autism

1300
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,990
spectrum disorder.

1301
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,420
Asperger's.

1302
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,760
Okay.

1303
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,830
I'm not revealing this

1304
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,830
to elicit sympathy

1305
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,830
from you

1306
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,460
or as a means to

1307
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,460
justify my behavior.

1308
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,010
I simply feel it might be

1309
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,010
beneficial for you to know.

1310
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,670
I think it might be.

1311
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,550
I am unable to discern

1312
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,550
whether you're being

1313
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,550
sarcastic or not.

1314
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,850
That's part of

1315
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,850
the disorder.

1316
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,290
It also makes it difficult

1317
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,290
for me to improvise

1318
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,290
from my set routine.

1319
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,420
I confess, I...

1320
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,830
I'm uneasy about the surgery

1321
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,830
we're about to perform.

1322
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,890
Can I rely on you to

1323
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,890
help me through it?

1324
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,410
Tell me there was

1325
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,410
no brown in there.

1326
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,410
You're right.

1327
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,680
How's our

1328
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,680
human shield doing?

1329
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,080
Just finished

1330
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,080
washing it out now.

1331
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,380
That's what I get

1332
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,380
for trusting a squid

1333
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,380
with a firearm.

1334
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,990
Hah.

1335
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,990
Thank you, both. Really.

1336
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,580
Ms. Goodwin?

1337
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,780
If you have a second?

1338
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,890
The fungal infection

1339
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,890
is quite advanced.

1340
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,330
Okay, Mr. Mikulski's

1341
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,330
on his way up to the OR,

1342
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,560
and at this stage,

1343
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,560
he's not gonna survive this.

1344
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,130
There's nothing

1345
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,130
we could have done.

1346
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,130
It was a bad, bad break.

1347
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,300
I don't see how we can use

1348
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,300
any of the footage we shot.

1349
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,070
I disagree.

1350
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,870
We couldn't have gotten

1351
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,870
a better endorsement

1352
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,870
for you or the hospital.

1353
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,610
His endorsement

1354
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,610
is meaningless.

1355
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,740
He just said what he thought

1356
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,740
we wanted to hear.

1357
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,610
Not to mention,

1358
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,610
we're exploiting him.

1359
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,110
Exploiting?

1360
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,540
He signed the release.

1361
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,540
What are we arguing about?

1362
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,420
He only did it

1363
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,420
'cause I convinced him to.

1364
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,880
I'm not sure he really

1365
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,880
wanted to sign the release.

1366
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,120
All right, let's...

1367
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,130
Let's give

1368
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,130
the patient a chance

1369
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,130
to rescind the release.

1370
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,800
What? Why?

1371
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,960
Because it's

1372
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,960
the right thing to do.

1373
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,770
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

1374
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,170
Dr. Halstead.

1375
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,040
You convinced him

1376
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,040
to sign the release,

1377
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,850
yet you led me to believe

1378
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,850
you objected to all of this.

1379
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,920
I felt I needed some ammo

1380
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,920
when I told Stohl I was

1381
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,920
ordering the scans.

1382
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,720
A-ha.

1383
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,400
So, in other words,

1384
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,400
you used the release

1385
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,400
to get your way?

1386
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,630
No, no, no.

1387
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,430
Go talk to your patient,

1388
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,430
and we'll talk about

1389
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,430
your actions later.

1390
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,940
Last thing

1391
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,940
is to anastamose

1392
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,940
the right coronary.

1393
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,150
The right coronary...

1394
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,690
I have an angle

1395
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,690
to get you

1396
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,690
a better position,

1397
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,780
if you don't mind,

1398
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,780
Dr. Latham?

1399
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,590
No, please, go ahead.

1400
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,590
Mmm.

1401
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,630
It doesn't appear

1402
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,630
as though it's gonna be

1403
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,630
long enough to fit,

1404
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,930
unless you're seeing

1405
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,930
something different?

1406
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,030
Let's get some

1407
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,030
blood in there to see

1408
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,030
how the vessel lays

1409
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,510
when the heart's inflated.

1410
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,130
Clamp your venus, Paul.

1411
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,130
Give us some volume.

1412
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,530
Yes, sir.

1413
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,910
Looks like it'll fit.

1414
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,910
Good.

1415
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,820
Let's empty out

1416
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,820
the heart and finish up.

1417
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,410
6.0 Prolene?

1418
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,020
Thank you, Beth.

1419
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,230
There you go.

1420
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,230
I like it.

1421
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,100
Oh, hey, Dr. Halstead.

1422
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,100
Thanks for coming up.

1423
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,730
How do I look?

1424
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,200
Where's that camera guy?

1425
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,710
Hey, listen. About that...

1426
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,400
I'm sorry.

1427
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,820
This promo video

1428
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,820
has been a huge violation

1429
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,820
in your privacy.

1430
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,750
I know you were hesitant

1431
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,750
to sign the release, so...

1432
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,030
You rip that up if you want,

1433
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,030
and we will not use

1434
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,030
any of the footage.

1435
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,260
Let me ask you a question,

1436
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,260
Dr. Halstead.

1437
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,730
Do I look familiar to you?

1438
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,030
I mean, from before today?

1439
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,230
I don't think so. Why?

1440
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,600
I recognize you.

1441
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,810
You sometimes park

1442
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,810
in that lot

1443
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,810
across the street.

1444
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,740
I work there

1445
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,740
as an attendant.

1446
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,840
Almost 20 years now.

1447
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,950
Sorry, I never

1448
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,950
really paid attention.

1449
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,650
Oh, no, that's okay.

1450
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,450
I don't make much

1451
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,450
of an impression.

1452
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,360
I've had more than enough

1453
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,360
privacy for one person.

1454
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,660
So I'm okay having that

1455
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,660
violated now

1456
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,430
if it means I wasn't

1457
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,430
invisible to the very end.

1458
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,180
I just want my life to

1459
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,180
have meant something.

1460
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,780
Dr. Halstead?

1461
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,250
Are you ready, Mr. Mikulski?

1462
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,760
Yes, I am.

1463
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,800
Okay.

1464
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,170
Hey.

1465
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,540
I heard what happened.

1466
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,540
Are you okay?

1467
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,510
This?

1468
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,950
Might leave a scar,

1469
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,950
but that's it.

1470
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,520
Well, at least you'll have

1471
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,520
a good story to tell, right?

1472
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,060
I don't think

1473
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,060
anybody will believe

1474
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,060
this one.

1475
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,790
Okay, see you.

1476
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,660
Yeah, see you.

1477
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,070
It's a cylinder.

1478
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,070
It's shiny.

1479
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,940
Sorry to interrupt.

1480
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,410
Not at all.

1481
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,410
We're just, uh...

1482
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,810
We're just doing

1483
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,810
a visualization exercise.

1484
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,610
Again. Close your

1485
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,610
eyes again, Ariel.

1486
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,420
And do you see

1487
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,420
your shield?

1488
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,690
Okay. Now keep

1489
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,690
describing it to me.

1490
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,890
It's gold.

1491
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,860
It surrounds me.

1492
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,220
It protects me

1493
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,220
from other people's pain

1494
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,220
and emotions.

1495
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,930
Okay, keep seeing

1496
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,930
your shield.

1497
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,700
Now open your eyes.

1498
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,700
What happens

1499
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,700
when I do this?

1500
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,880
It feels like you're

1501
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,880
touching my arm still.

1502
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,910
The shield's not working.

1503
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,670
Visualization, it's a skill.

1504
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,670
It takes practice.

1505
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,510
And just so you know,

1506
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,510
when I visualize my shield,

1507
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,980
and be warned,

1508
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,980
'cause I'm a total geek

1509
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,980
about this...

1510
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,420
Hey, come on, now.

1511
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,120
You're not allowed to

1512
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,120
get down on yourself.

1513
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,420
This is our very first

1514
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,420
run at this.

1515
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,420
You're doing great.

1516
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,850
It's not that.

1517
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,060
I just got really sad.

1518
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,830
Don't know why.

1519
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,640
Will you excuse me?

1520
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,370
Okay,

1521
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,370
let's try it again.

1522
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,180
Close your eyes.

1523
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,240
Hey, Dr. Latham.

1524
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,080
A bunch of us are going

1525
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,080
for drinks over at Molly's.

1526
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,520
Maybe you want to join us?

1527
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,320
I don't go to bars.

1528
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,850
Maybe another time, then.

1529
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,610
I hear they're gonna

1530
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,610
transfer you

1531
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,010
to the hospital

1532
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,010
at the county jail.

1533
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,220
I don't believe that story

1534
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,220
you told earlier.

1535
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,290
I know you thought

1536
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,290
it's what your father

1537
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,290
wanted to hear,

1538
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,920
but it would be

1539
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,920
a shame to go to jail

1540
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,920
for something you didn't do.

1541
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,860
I'm not afraid

1542
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,860
of going to jail.

1543
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,990
That secret

1544
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,990
you're holding on to

1545
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,360
just put a hole

1546
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,360
in your gut.

1547
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,230
If you don't open up,

1548
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,230
imagine what might happen

1549
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,230
next time.

1550
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,840
All you have to do is call,

1551
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,840
and we can keep talking.

1552
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,630
You don't understand

1553
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,630
anything, do you?

1554
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,930
You want me to talk?

1555
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,700
Open up?

1556
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,830
And say what?

1557
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,700
That I'm some kind of freak?

1558
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,210
I'd rather go to jail.

1559
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,810
Forever.

1560
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,750
She can really feel the pain

1561
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,750
of everyone she sees?

1562
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,990
Yes.

1563
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,750
Oh, God.

1564
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,260
I can't imagine

1565
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,260
how hard

1566
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,260
this has been for her.

1567
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,530
I took her to

1568
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,530
every specialist.

1569
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,810
I did what the doctors

1570
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,810
told me to.

1571
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,510
I thought she was faking.

1572
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,370
There's no way

1573
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,370
you could've known.

1574
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,180
I am hurting

1575
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,180
my own daughter.

1576
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,850
How am I supposed to

1577
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,850
protect her from this if

1578
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,850
I'm part of the problem?

1579
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,750
It won't be easy.

1580
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,090
But she feels

1581
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,090
what she sees.

1582
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,760
If she sees a happy person,

1583
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,760
she feels happiness.

1584
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,060
And if she sees someone

1585
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,060
who's constantly anxious...

1586
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,520
You really don't know

1587
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,520
anything, do you?

1588
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,360
There you go, Bardi.

1589
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,360
There you go.

1590
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,470
Cheers, everybody.

1591
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,470
Cheers!

1592
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,450
Dr. Latham,

1593
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,080
you changed your mind.

1594
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,620
Not yet,

1595
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,620
but I am working on it.

1596
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,220
Come join us.
