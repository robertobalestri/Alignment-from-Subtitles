1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,290
Incoming, peds

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,290
in respiratory distress.

3
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,290
Thirty seconds out.

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,800
We got this.

5
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,100
Hey, love.

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,870
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,770
Aren't you

8
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,770
supposed to be home,

9
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,770
taking care of yourself?

10
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,710
I don't wanna stay at home.

11
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,710
Just can't stop

12
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,710
thinking about things.

13
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,910
I'd rather be here,

14
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,910
busy.

15
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,910
You sure?

16
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,150
Since we lost the baby,

17
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,150
things with me and Tate

18
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,150
are different.

19
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,510
I need to work.

20
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,020
All right, well,

21
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,020
you tell me if

22
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,020
you need anything.

23
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,220
Okay? You got this?

24
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,220
Mmm-hmm.

25
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,290
You're going

26
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,290
to Treatment Two.

27
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,220
Emergency landing at O'Hare.

28
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,220
Seven-year-old girl

29
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,220
collapsed mid-flight.

30
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,560
Acute shortness of breath

31
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,560
started on the plane.

32
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,400
One Albuterol

33
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,400
and one Racemic epi

34
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,400
given en route.

35
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,730
Sats?

36
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,730
Low 90s.

37
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,730
Meds didn't do much.

38
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,380
All right, gently.

39
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,580
One, two, three.

40
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,710
Mommy?

41
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,920
She's just telling

42
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,920
her daughter to be calm.

43
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,920
We speak English.

44
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,150
Lungs sound congested...

45
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,150
Rhonchi throughout.

46
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,350
Let's get a chest X-ray.

47
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,350
I'm Dr. Choi.

48
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,860
I'm gonna be taking

49
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,860
care of your daughter.

50
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,720
Where are you traveling from?

51
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,720
Ecuador.

52
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,660
Has your daughter

53
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,660
ingested any drugs?

54
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,660
Alcohol?

55
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,060
Anything we

56
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,060
should be aware of?

57
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,060
No.

58
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,720
Any medical issues

59
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,720
we should be aware of?

60
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,830
She can never

61
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,830
get enough air.

62
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,830
Her lips are always blue.

63
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,070
Her whole life...

64
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,070
The doctor in my village,

65
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,070
she says she can't help.

66
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,570
We were going to Minneapolis

67
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,570
to see a heart doctor.

68
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,540
Definitely volume overloaded.

69
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,540
Let's get five milligrams

70
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,540
of lasix IV.

71
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,210
BP, 108 over 82.

72
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,210
Heart rate, 110.

73
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,820
Could be

74
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,820
a pulmonary issue,

75
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,370
or any number

76
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,370
of congenital heart defects.

77
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,510
Let's get an EKG,

78
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,510
and call CT.

79
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,180
We're gonna do

80
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,180
everything we can

81
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,180
for your daughter.

82
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,580
Thank you.

83
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,990
Incoming. Dr. Manning?

84
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,990
Yep.

85
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,530
Teresa Azen, 25.

86
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,530
Persistent vegetative state.

87
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,500
Brought in by her

88
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,500
long-term care facility

89
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,040
after blood was

90
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,040
discovered in her urine.

91
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,860
Now, let's get vitals,

92
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,860
a temp, CBC, CMP,

93
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,060
UA with C&S.

94
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,470
Could just be a UTI,

95
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,270
but let's look at her kidneys

96
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,270
with an ultrasound

97
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,270
to rule out

98
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,270
hydro from a stone.

99
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,270
Got it.

100
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,510
All right, on my count.

101
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,510
One, two, three.

102
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,380
Brain injury?

103
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,380
Car crash.

104
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,950
Teresa, I'm Dr. Manning.

105
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,950
I'm gonna take good

106
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,950
care of you, okay?

107
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,460
G-tube looks good.

108
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,200
Temp, 100.6.

109
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,500
Unresponsive.

110
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,210
No kidney stones.

111
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,210
Let's look at the bladder.

112
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,590
How long did you say

113
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,590
she was in

114
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,590
a vegetative state for?

115
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,920
Five years.

116
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,430
We need to call the police.

117
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,430
This woman is pregnant.

118
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,310
There's vaginal trauma,

119
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,310
which explains

120
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,310
the blood in the urine.

121
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,940
Thank you.

122
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,090
Is this our victim?

123
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,090
Yeah. It's awful.

124
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,590
You ever see

125
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,590
anything like this?

126
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,590
I wish I could say I hadn't.

127
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,290
Okay, let's lift.

128
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,290
One, two, three.

129
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,700
So helpless.

130
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,200
We're looking into

131
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,200
all of the employees

132
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,200
at Teresa's facility.

133
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,800
We're checking visitor logs,

134
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,800
security footage.

135
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,000
We'll find out who

136
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,000
had access to her

137
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,000
and to her floor.

138
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,270
But the rape kit's

139
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,270
only supposed

140
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,270
to reveal DNA

141
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,940
for the past

142
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,940
five days.

143
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,570
How is this

144
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,570
gonna help?

145
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,210
I hate to say this,

146
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,210
but the likelihood

147
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,210
in a case like this

148
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,480
is that the offender's

149
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,480
been assaulting her regularly,

150
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,250
maybe even daily.

151
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,280
Hey.

152
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,850
Teresa's parents

153
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,850
are here.

154
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,160
Okay.

155
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,500
David and Angela Azen,

156
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,500
this is Detective Lindsay

157
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,500
and Dr. Manning.

158
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,070
I am so sorry

159
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,070
for what happened

160
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,070
to your daughter.

161
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,000
How could someone

162
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,000
do this to her?

163
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,100
Are you gonna

164
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,100
catch this monster?

165
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,180
Yes. We've already

166
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,180
opened an investigation,

167
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,450
and finding whoever did this

168
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,450
is a top priority for us.

169
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,920
I just want you to know,

170
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,920
we are gonna

171
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,920
give your daughter

172
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,720
the best possible care.

173
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,790
Why don't you go

174
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,790
spend some time

175
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,790
with your daughter?

176
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,930
We have 18 patients

177
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,930
on this floor,

178
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,670
all suffering from

179
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,670
serious mental illnesses.

180
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,510
Since age 13, Henry

181
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,510
has been battling

182
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,510
Anorexia Nervosa

183
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,880
coupled with borderline

184
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,880
personality disorder.

185
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,950
Evelyn struggles

186
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,950
with schizophrenia,

187
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,990
auditory hallucinations,

188
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,990
paranoia.

189
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,920
We have her on

190
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,920
a new anti-psychotic,

191
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,890
hoping that'll curb

192
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,890
her violent tendencies.

193
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,430
Patients might be here

194
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,430
anywhere from six weeks

195
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,430
to six months.

196
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,300
You're not listening!

197
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,300
You don't belong here.

198
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,300
Get out!

199
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,570
Get out!

200
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,570
That's enough, Tom.

201
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,840
Why don't we go work

202
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,840
on your art project?

203
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,340
Who are you?

204
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,510
Uh, I'm Dr. Reese.

205
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,510
I'm visiting

206
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,510
from Chicago Med.

207
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,550
He's right.

208
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,550
I don't belong here.

209
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,720
All the doctors think

210
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,720
I'm crazy, but I'm not.

211
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,990
Dr. Reese,

212
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,990
we're moving on.

213
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,160
She's the worst.

214
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,010
Hey, just so you know,

215
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,010
"Crazy" is a word I never use.

216
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
And we've got Ms. Perreira...

217
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
Post op day two.

218
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,710
We removed her chest tube

219
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,710
and wires this morning.

220
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,580
She is tolerating a diet,

221
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,580
and looking good.

222
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,180
She's on a solid

223
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,180
dose of morphine.

224
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,020
Ah. And what

225
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,020
about consults?

226
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,460
Uh, we have two

227
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,460
in the MICU,

228
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,260
one for an aortic valve,

229
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,260
and the other for

230
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,260
a potential bypass.

231
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,850
All right. Let's go

232
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,850
have a look, everybody.

233
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,290
Uh, just a moment.

234
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,420
One more thing.

235
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,420
More of a question,

236
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,420
really.

237
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,830
What does

238
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,830
a Jewish pirate say?

239
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,740
I beg your pardon,

240
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,740
Dr. Latham?

241
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,110
Ah. What does

242
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,110
a Jewish pirate say?

243
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,610
Ahoy vey.

244
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,950
Get it? Ahoy vey.

245
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,320
All right. That is

246
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,320
a good one, Dr. Latham.

247
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,350
Jewish humor. Long tradition.

248
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,350
Shall we move on to the MICU?

249
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,700
So, I take it that

250
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,700
your TMS treatments

251
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,700
are going well.

252
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,260
Yes, I've been picking up

253
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,260
on all sorts of subtleties

254
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,780
in the way

255
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,780
people communicate.

256
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
For instance,

257
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
it never dawned on me

258
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,640
the profound purpose

259
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,640
behind sharing a joke.

260
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,980
Oh! Well, what is it?

261
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,150
Camaraderie. Dr. Rhodes.

262
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,150
Camaraderie.

263
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,660
Hey, check out

264
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,660
what I got you.

265
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,760
Mousse de Maracujá.

266
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,900
Your favorite.

267
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,560
When I was, like, eight.

268
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,560
Well, still...

269
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,440
I thought it might

270
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,440
make you feel better.

271
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,370
He's trying, April.

272
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,280
No one knows

273
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,280
what to say.

274
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,920
There's nothing to say.

275
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,620
How were rounds at

276
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,620
the youth hospital?

277
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,620
Brutal.

278
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm sure there's

279
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,720
a more clinical term, but...

280
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,720
I hear ya.

281
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
It's really hard

282
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
to see so many teenagers

283
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,370
suffering from

284
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,370
psychological trauma.

285
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,370
Yeah, younger patients

286
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,370
are the hardest.

287
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,740
Very tough to draw a line

288
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,740
between an actual disorder

289
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,710
and good old-fashioned

290
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,710
adolescence.

291
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,440
How do you learn

292
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,440
to make that call?

293
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,070
Tourist asks

294
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,070
a New Yorker,

295
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,880
"How do you get

296
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,880
to Carnegie Hall?"

297
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,580
Practice.

298
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,520
Hi.

299
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,720
So, Teresa is

300
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,720
approximately 10 weeks

301
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,720
along in her pregnancy.

302
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,950
Oh, God.

303
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,830
Fortunately, termination

304
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,830
will be a painless procedure.

305
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,370
Wait, termination?

306
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,530
We don't want that.

307
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,530
We wanna keep the baby.

308
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,440
I'm sorry. I thought,

309
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,440
given the circumstances...

310
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,240
Mr. and Mrs. Azen,

311
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,240
nothing has to be

312
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,240
decided today.

313
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,810
No, we've made up

314
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,810
our mind.

315
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,080
It is terrible what

316
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,080
happened to our daughter,

317
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
but even if it

318
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
came from a rape,

319
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,690
the baby's still

320
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,690
part of Teresa.

321
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,660
The only part

322
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,660
we have left.

323
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,720
Yes,

324
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,720
I can understand that.

325
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,960
But in your

326
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,960
daughter's condition,

327
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,960
I have to tell you,

328
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,990
taking this pregnancy to term

329
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,990
would be extremely difficult.

330
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,330
Why?

331
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,570
Her brain has been injured,

332
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,570
but her body's healthy.

333
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,770
No.

334
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,180
At five years in a persistent

335
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,180
vegetative state, it's not.

336
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,240
This is a high risk situation

337
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,240
for pulmonary embolism,

338
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,940
sepsis, colonic obstruction,

339
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,940
respiratory failure.

340
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,650
But those are

341
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,650
just risks, right?

342
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,650
It could all work out.

343
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,520
They are

344
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,520
extremely high risks.

345
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,750
If you have your daughter

346
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,750
go through with

347
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,750
this pregnancy,

348
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,090
there is a chance that

349
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,090
she will not survive.

350
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,990
She's hardly living

351
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,990
as it is.

352
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,570
If she dies giving birth,

353
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,570
maybe that's

354
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,570
a merciful outcome.

355
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,270
Sometimes,

356
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,270
I've wished for that.

357
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,040
There is another

358
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,040
issue to consider.

359
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,170
Given the abuse

360
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,170
your daughter

361
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,170
has undergone,

362
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,150
do you believe

363
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,150
that she would want

364
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,150
to keep this pregnancy?

365
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,220
In any case,

366
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,130
you are Teresa's guardians,

367
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,130
and therefore

368
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,130
speak on her behalf.

369
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,360
Your wishes

370
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,360
will be honored.

371
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,090
So, based on the echo

372
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,090
and the CT scans,

373
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,200
your daughter

374
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,200
is suffering from

375
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,200
a congenital heart condition

376
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,940
known as

377
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,940
Tetralogy of Fallot.

378
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,880
It's a condition

379
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,880
that puts a significant

380
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,880
amount of stress on the heart,

381
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,010
and it's something

382
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,010
that needs to be

383
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,010
addressed surgically.

384
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,980
I can pay.

385
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,980
I bought travel insurance.

386
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,840
It's an emergency surgery.

387
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,840
We would operate regardless.

388
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,090
We'll take your daughter

389
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,090
to the pediatric ICU

390
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,090
and get her ready.

391
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,920
Are you all right?

392
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,920
I know this is a lot.

393
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,900
I'm fine.

394
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,900
Mommy?

395
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

396
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,330
You sure you're okay?

397
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,140
Maybe I should

398
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,140
take a look at you.

399
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,140
No, no.

400
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,840
I haven't had anything to eat.

401
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,710
No sleep. I'll be okay.

402
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,410
Hey, April, so sorry

403
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,410
to hear about the baby.

404
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,150
How you holding up?

405
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,150
It's okay. I'm okay.

406
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,100
T-2. Talk to me, Cesar.

407
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,470
Suicide attempt.

408
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,400
Fifteen-year-old female

409
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,400
from county psych.

410
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,410
She swallowed bleach,

411
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,410
sodium hydroxide,

412
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,410
and some sort of rust remover.

413
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
Hydrofluoric acid.

414
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,370
Okay, call Toxicology,

415
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,370
get an NG tube in her,

416
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,240
push an amp of

417
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,240
calcium gluconate,

418
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,240
and hang a magnesium drip.

419
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,550
Watch for v-tach,

420
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,550
and get a psych consult.

421
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,550
Got it.

422
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,780
You have to

423
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,780
get Dr. Reese for me.

424
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,780
I need to talk to her.

425
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,620
I wasn't trying

426
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,620
to commit suicide.

427
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,620
I was trying to see you.

428
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,760
Do you believe

429
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,760
it's okay

430
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,760
to hurt yourself?

431
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,460
How else could I get to you?

432
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,460
It's not like I can

433
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,460
ask for a phone call.

434
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,870
Nancy, you could have

435
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,870
seriously hurt

436
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,870
or even killed yourself.

437
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,380
You have to help me

438
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,380
get out of there.

439
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,570
They locked me up after

440
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,570
I got in a fight with my mom,

441
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,480
but she's Bipolar.

442
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,480
Has been for years.

443
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,140
Hey, I'm sorry, but

444
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,140
I'm not your psychiatrist.

445
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,350
My mom came at me

446
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,350
with a hammer

447
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,350
while I was sleeping.

448
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,150
I was trying to defend myself.

449
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,150
It doesn't make me crazy.

450
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,120
No. If that were

451
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,120
the situation, it would be

452
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,120
reasonable to defend yourself.

453
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,630
See?

454
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,800
You're the only

455
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,800
one who said that.

456
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,690
All the other doctors

457
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,690
think I'm psychotic,

458
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,630
but my mom's

459
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,630
the one who's crazy.

460
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,730
Dr. Reese?

461
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,080
Could I speak to you

462
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,080
for a second?

463
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,540
I'll be right back.

464
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,050
Yeah, could you...

465
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,050
Could you fill me in?

466
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,680
I understand that

467
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,680
you ran into Nancy

468
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,680
on rounds this morning?

469
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,820
Yes.

470
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,120
Uh-huh.

471
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,120
Could you have

472
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,120
said anything

473
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,460
to make her think it was

474
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,460
a good idea to come

475
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,460
over here and see you?

476
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,800
All I said was "crazy"

477
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,800
isn't a word I ever use.

478
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,500
Huh.

479
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,770
Gotta be very careful

480
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,770
the way we talk to

481
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,770
younger psych patients.

482
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,740
They're much more vulnerable

483
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,740
to mixed messages.

484
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,940
She seems to think

485
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,940
that you're

486
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,940
some sort of ally.

487
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,650
I am. Aren't we all?

488
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,180
To get her the right

489
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,180
treatment, of course,

490
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,880
but this is a young woman

491
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,880
who purposefully drank

492
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,880
extremely toxic chemicals.

493
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,950
I mean, Nancy's been

494
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,950
diagnosed with borderline

495
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,950
personality disorder.

496
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,890
She has severe bouts

497
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,890
of manic depression.

498
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,490
Uncontrollable hysteria,

499
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,490
paranoid delusions.

500
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,190
People who suffer

501
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,190
from these disorders

502
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,700
can be very persuasive,

503
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,700
very manipulative,

504
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,400
and a danger to themselves.

505
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,400
So, we just...

506
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,400
We have to be careful.

507
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,030
We wouldn't wanna

508
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,030
put her in a position

509
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,940
where she wanted

510
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,940
to harm herself again.

511
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,870
Ms. Cespedes?

512
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,960
Can I get your signature

513
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,960
on this consent?

514
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,750
This gives us

515
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,750
permission to operate.

516
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,700
Ms. Cespedes,

517
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,700
you don't look well to me.

518
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,240
You could've picked up

519
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,240
a virus while traveling.

520
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,370
May I please

521
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,370
check your pulse?

522
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
Is everything all right?

523
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
I told you I'm fine.

524
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,530
Please.

525
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,670
Let's go back to

526
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,670
the emergency department

527
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,670
and let me take a look at you.

528
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,510
Just show me where

529
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,510
the bathroom is, please.

530
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,410
Yeah.

531
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,410
Follow me.

532
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,270
Hey.

533
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,270
Her parents here?

534
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,990
No, making calls outside.

535
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,860
Looking for

536
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,860
a new care facility.

537
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:36,960
Hmm.

538
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,900
Did you hear they

539
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,900
wanna keep the pregnancy?

540
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,270
Mmm-hmm.

541
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,010
When you can't talk,

542
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,010
you don't get to say nothing.

543
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,210
Yeah, well, I don't

544
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,210
think it's the right thing.

545
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,610
Mmm.

546
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,510
Maggie?

547
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,110
Did you see that?

548
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,110
Mmm-hmm.

549
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,850
I know PVS patients do that,

550
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,850
and it's just a reflex,

551
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,620
but didn't it seem like

552
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,620
there was more going on?

553
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,500
Wishful thinking.

554
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,970
Teresa, can you hear me?

555
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,970
If you can hear me,

556
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,970
please open your eyes.

557
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,440
Teresa, if you can hear me,

558
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,440
squeeze my hand.

559
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
In my time at the Vent Farm,

560
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
I've seen this a lot.

561
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,060
Blinking, spasms,

562
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,060
sudden jerks of movement.

563
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,130
Never ends up meaning

564
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,130
what you want it to.

565
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,900
Let's get a CT brain.

566
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,210
On a five-year

567
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,210
coma patient?

568
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,210
Just in case.

569
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,790
Hey, Sarah.

570
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,790
You got a second?

571
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,790
Hmm.

572
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,190
I heard that

573
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,190
most of the psych

574
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,190
residents get therapy.

575
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,030
Yeah.

576
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,030
Have you tried it?

577
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,000
Uh-huh. Um...

578
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,530
I'm sorry.

579
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,530
Can we talk later?

580
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,530
Sure. Yeah.

581
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,270
How's she doing?

582
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,810
Well, we've

583
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,810
flushed her pretty good.

584
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,370
She'll be

585
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,370
medically cleared soon

586
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,810
and will have to go back

587
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,810
to the psych hospital.

588
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,480
You buy her story?

589
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,480
I don't know.

590
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,810
She's on

591
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,810
a six-month psych hold.

592
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,020
Does she seem like

593
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,020
she requires that

594
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,020
much time locked up?

595
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,820
Don't ask me.

596
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,820
Psych's way too spongy.

597
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,290
In med school,

598
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,290
my head-shrink professor

599
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,290
took us to the mall

600
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,230
and asked us to

601
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,230
point out people

602
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,230
we thought were mentally ill.

603
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,100
No one could agree.

604
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,100
Hmm.

605
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,770
That is when I knew

606
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,770
I wanted to be an ED doc.

607
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,270
Much clearer business.

608
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,270
Yeah.

609
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,470
I wish there was

610
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,470
a way to evaluate

611
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,470
Nancy like an ED doc.

612
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,680
Well, maybe there is.

613
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,180
Like I tell my residents,

614
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,180
always go back

615
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,180
to the history.

616
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,520
Mommy?

617
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,090
Mommy? Where's my mommy?

618
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,020
Hey, Bruna, she's out

619
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,020
in the waiting room right now.

620
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,220
I need her.

621
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,220
You're gonna be okay,

622
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,220
sweetheart.

623
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,260
We're gonna take

624
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,260
very good care of you.

625
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,330
Marty, now might be

626
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,330
a good time

627
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,330
start the sedation.

628
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,100
Please, I want my mommy.

629
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,100
Hold on, Marty.

630
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,500
I would want my mom, too,

631
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,500
if I were in a new place

632
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,500
with new people.

633
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,320
You know what?

634
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,120
Everyone here has one job,

635
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,120
and that is to

636
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,120
make you feel better.

637
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,190
And by the time

638
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,190
we're finished,

639
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,750
you won't have

640
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,750
trouble breathing.

641
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,630
You won't faint

642
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,630
on airplanes.

643
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,570
You'll be

644
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,570
a healthy little girl.

645
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,570
How does that sound to you?

646
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,690
You can really fix me?

647
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,690
Yes.

648
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,130
Now, I need you to

649
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,130
do something for me.

650
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,300
Can you count to 100?

651
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,000
In Spanish?

652
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,000
Mmm-hmm.

653
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,680
And by the time

654
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,680
you're finished,

655
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,510
your mother will be

656
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,510
right next to you.

657
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,470
I promise.

658
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,100
Hey, April.

659
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,100
Is she still in there?

660
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,470
Says she's okay,

661
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,470
but keeps vomiting.

662
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,540
Won't open the door,

663
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,540
so I called maintenance.

664
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,900
Zulmira.

665
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,200
Zulmira,

666
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,200
open the door, please.

667
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,300
Hold on. I got this.

668
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,050
Just give me a minute.

669
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,610
Stay away.

670
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,190
It was the only way

671
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,190
I could get her to America.

672
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,520
April,

673
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,520
what's going on?

674
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,520
I'll be fine.

675
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,160
She just needed

676
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,160
a good hospital.

677
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,130
Okay.

678
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,830
She's overdosing!

679
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,100
How do you know?

680
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,100
She's a drug mule.

681
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,750
Blood glucose is good,

682
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,750
but tachycardic as hell.

683
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,410
BP is 115 over 110.

684
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,410
Heart rate 150.

685
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,010
There is still two

686
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,010
packets in your stomach,

687
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,490
one of them

688
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,490
appears to be leaking.

689
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,620
We need to know.

690
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,620
Is it cocaine?

691
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,530
Just so we can help you.

692
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,800
Yes.

693
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,100
Okay,

694
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,100
we need to get these out now

695
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,100
before they burst.

696
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,230
Let's get an EGD scope

697
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,230
and 70 milligrams of ketamine.

698
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,540
You can't take it out.

699
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,540
You'll die of an overdose

700
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,130
if any more cocaine

701
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,130
leaks into your intestine.

702
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,600
Can you give me medicine?

703
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,600
No, we need to remove them.

704
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,640
Would you give it

705
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,640
to the police?

706
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,080
We'll explain

707
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,080
the situation to them.

708
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,650
No, I can't go to

709
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,650
prison in my country.

710
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,650
They'll kill me.

711
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,610
Bruna needs me.

712
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,610
She will starve without me.

713
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,590
Tell Goodwin we

714
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,590
need a court order

715
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,590
to remove the drug packets.

716
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,180
She'll be dead by

717
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,180
the time it's approved.

718
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,260
Call PD.

719
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,260
Maybe they can

720
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,260
bring a warrant in time.

721
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,400
Please, just leave me alone.

722
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,530
Zulmira, if you don't let us

723
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,530
remove those packets,

724
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,530
you will die.

725
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,870
I...

726
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,870
I can't go to prison.

727
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,040
Do you want Bruna to

728
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,040
wake up from surgery

729
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,070
and learn that

730
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,070
her mother has died?

731
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,280
You can't help her in

732
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,280
any way if you're dead.

733
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,880
Let us keep you alive,

734
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,880
please.

735
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,780
Okay.

736
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,780
All right,

737
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,780
come on, let's go.

738
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,950
Yeah.

739
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
You think

740
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
there's any chance

741
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
of brain activity?

742
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,240
I don't see how.

743
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,240
A lot of brain

744
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,240
volume loss and atrophy.

745
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,680
This is not the healthy

746
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,680
brain of a 25-year-old.

747
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,810
But even with some atrophy,

748
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,810
couldn't there still be

749
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,810
consciousness?

750
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
What was her

751
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
Glasgow Coma Score?

752
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,650
There was no response.

753
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,850
This woman is in

754
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,850
a persistent

755
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,850
vegetative state...

756
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,720
My guess,

757
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,720
for the rest of her life.

758
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,620
But I'm almost sure

759
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,620
I saw something in her eyes.

760
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,090
Like she was aware of us

761
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,090
talking about her

762
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,090
or something.

763
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,670
Maybe you want that so much,

764
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,670
you're projecting?

765
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,530
Um, I don't know.

766
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,440
I do feel terrible for her.

767
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,440
She's pregnant.

768
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,570
She was sexually assaulted

769
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,570
at her care facility,

770
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,510
and her parents wanna

771
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,510
keep the baby. I just...

772
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,950
If I could somehow

773
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,950
get through to Teresa,

774
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,750
she might finally have a say

775
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,750
in what happens to her.

776
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,050
I'm sorry, Natalie.

777
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,790
You know what,

778
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,790
I want a neurology consult.

779
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,790
Have Abrams take a look.

780
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,020
Dr. Charles,

781
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,020
do you have a minute?

782
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,200
I do.

783
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,090
In order to get

784
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,090
a more complete history,

785
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,800
I contacted the officer

786
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,800
who arrested

787
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,800
Nancy and her mother.

788
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,300
He sent me his report.

789
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,740
It said they often get

790
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,740
called to Nancy's house

791
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,110
on domestic disputes

792
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,110
involving the mother.

793
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,010
She's been in and out

794
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,010
of jail for assault.

795
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,550
In fact,

796
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,550
she is at County right now.

797
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,550
Please take a look.

798
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,020
This could just

799
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,020
mean that, you know,

800
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,210
mental illness runs

801
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,210
in Nancy's family,

802
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,420
and she and her mom suffer

803
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,420
from the same disorder.

804
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,450
Or it could mean that Nancy

805
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,450
was wrongfully committed

806
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,450
by an unstable mother.

807
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,320
The one thing

808
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,320
we know for sure,

809
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,830
it was her mother's testimony

810
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,830
that got Nancy committed,

811
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,030
and her mother's

812
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,030
an unreliable witness.

813
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,540
We have

814
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,540
a seven-year-old female,

815
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,240
here for reconstruction

816
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,240
of Tetralogy of Fallot.

817
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,040
Once we are

818
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,040
in the chest and on bypass,

819
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,550
we will relieve

820
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,550
the right ventricular

821
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,550
outflow tract stenosis.

822
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,410
Scalpel?

823
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,480
I want you to observe

824
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,480
as I start at

825
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,480
the sternal notch

826
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,960
and cut to the xiphoid.

827
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,730
Dr. Latham?

828
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,740
Dr. Latham,

829
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,740
is everything okay?

830
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,340
Yes, yes, Dr. Rhodes.

831
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,920
All right, I got it.

832
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,610
Okay, one left.

833
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,850
She'll be waking soon.

834
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,850
Dose her again with ketamine?

835
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,450
No, let's just finish this.

836
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,330
Okay.

837
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,330
Go ahead, Jeff.

838
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,770
Almost there.

839
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,410
All right, I got it.

840
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,410
Okay, pulling it out.

841
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,710
I think it burst

842
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,710
in her esophagus.

843
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,350
Give her 20 more of labetalol,

844
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,350
and start an esmolol drip.

845
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,020
Jeff,

846
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,020
get the crash cart ready,

847
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,020
and give me the nitro.

848
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,330
Got it.

849
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,890
Just lie back. Stay calm.

850
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,400
She's having

851
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,400
a cocaine-induced

852
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,400
heart attack.

853
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,400
Give her two of Versed IV.

854
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,240
Open your mouth.

855
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,840
I'm gonna spray nitroglycerin

856
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,840
under your tongue.

857
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,470
It'll make you feel better.

858
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,450
ST segments

859
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,450
are improving.

860
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,920
Does your chest still hurt?

861
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,920
No.

862
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,820
Sats are good.

863
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,820
Okay, heart rate, 120s.

864
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,600
She's out and stable.

865
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,090
Okay, what's the call?

866
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,130
We don't have a choice.

867
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,130
We got to report it.

868
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,000
But this was the only way

869
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,000
she could get her daughter

870
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,000
the operation she needed.

871
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,270
Why can't we destroy it?

872
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,270
Who would that harm?

873
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,610
Smuggling cocaine

874
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,610
is a serious crime.

875
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,590
If she made it to her dealers,

876
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,590
people would've been harmed,

877
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,460
possibly kids.

878
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,290
She can't just

879
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,290
get away with that.

880
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,180
She hasn't.

881
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,180
Look at her.

882
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,190
Five minutes ago,

883
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,190
her heart wasn't beating.

884
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,420
April...

885
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,420
No.

886
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,100
She wasn't

887
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,100
trying to deliver it.

888
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,100
She was trying to flush it.

889
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,470
Destroy evidence.

890
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,740
As of now,

891
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,740
it's a victimless crime.

892
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,070
She is a good mother

893
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,330
who did the only

894
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,330
thing she knew how

895
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,330
to help her daughter.

896
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,400
If we destroy this packet,

897
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,400
we'll be committing a crime.

898
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,580
We don't have a choice.

899
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,580
He's right.

900
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,390
Sorry.

901
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,500
Dr. Manning.

902
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,500
Yes.

903
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,060
Where are we with

904
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,060
Teresa's treatment?

905
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,770
I'd like to run

906
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,770
a few more blood tests

907
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,740
to rule out any

908
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,740
potential infection,

909
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,840
and I'd also like to look

910
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,840
into physical therapy.

911
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,470
Are there any medical issues

912
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,470
you're still treating?

913
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,180
No. Um...

914
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,470
We've treated

915
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,470
the vaginal bleeding.

916
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,580
Then it's time

917
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,580
to discharge her.

918
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,690
Her parents have

919
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,690
found a new care facility,

920
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,780
and they're eager to get

921
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,780
their daughter settled in.

922
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,620
How do we know

923
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,620
Teresa will be safe?

924
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,760
How do we know

925
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,760
she won't get abused again?

926
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,720
She has suffered so much.

927
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,720
I just...

928
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,260
Just what?

929
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,670
What can you do?

930
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,210
We all wish we could do more,

931
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,210
but our job is to

932
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,210
treat the ailment

933
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,000
that brought the patient in,

934
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,000
and that's all.

935
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,680
It's time to give her

936
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,680
back to her parents.

937
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,280
We've finished the repair

938
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,280
and now coming off bypass.

939
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,920
We're off bypass.

940
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,120
At the end of any surgery,

941
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,120
when the patient has been...

942
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,130
Pulmonary artery

943
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,130
pressure is 50.

944
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,260
Coming up to 70.

945
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,270
And the left ventricular?

946
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,270
One hundred.

947
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,240
Well, let's not get excited.

948
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,240
She'll ride it out.

949
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
It's dropping. Eighty.

950
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,060
Should we put

951
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,060
her back on bypass?

952
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,300
Uh, I think we should...

953
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,300
We should...

954
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,710
She's throwing PVCs.

955
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,710
Seventy-five.

956
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,810
Pulmonary

957
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,810
hypertension's getting worse.

958
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,810
Your graft has to be stenotic.

959
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,080
Bypass, Dr. Latham.

960
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,080
We need to fix the graft.

961
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,550
We could try

962
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,550
a pulmonary vasodilator.

963
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,020
Vasodilator's not gonna do it.

964
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,020
We need to open her back up.

965
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,020
Blood pressure's

966
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,020
dropping rapidly.

967
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,020
We're losing her.

968
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,990
Dr. Latham...

969
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,990
She's peri-arrest.

970
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,190
Dr. Latham...

971
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,260
Step away, Dr. Latham.

972
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,630
Step away.

973
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,400
Marty, re-dose of heparin.

974
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,400
Let's get her back on bypass.

975
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,740
I'm reopening the heart.

976
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,180
There you are.

977
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,560
Hey, how 'bout we...

978
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,560
How 'bout we

979
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,560
hang out after work?

980
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,190
Yeah, maybe go get some

981
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,190
of your favorite fries

982
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,190
or something.

983
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:56,170
Noah, please.

984
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:56,170
I get it, but just

985
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:56,170
give me some space, okay?

986
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,170
So, I understand

987
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,170
that you believe

988
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,370
that you've been

989
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,370
wrongfully committed.

990
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,610
Is that right?

991
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,610
Mmm-hmm.

992
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,610
Yes, definitely.

993
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,810
Ever been

994
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,810
hospitalized before, Nancy?

995
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,590
Besides for the night

996
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,590
my mom attacked me

997
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,590
with a hammer? No.

998
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,190
Hmm. You wanna tell me

999
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,190
a little bit about your mom?

1000
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,260
I would. Finally.

1001
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,390
Hi, Nancy. How are you?

1002
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,060
Okay.

1003
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,630
I'm Dr. Baker,

1004
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,630
Nancy's psychiatrist.

1005
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,700
Dan Charles.

1006
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,700
Nice to meet you.

1007
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,740
This is Dr. Halstead,

1008
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,740
and I think you know

1009
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,740
Dr. Reese.

1010
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,040
Yes, I'm glad to see

1011
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,040
our girl here

1012
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,040
is in good hands.

1013
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,110
When will she

1014
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,110
be discharged?

1015
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,110
She's clear.

1016
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,150
We just need to

1017
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,150
remove the NG tube,

1018
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,150
and she'll be ready to go.

1019
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,620
Good.

1020
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,780
Do you mind?

1021
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,780
Could I get

1022
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,780
a quick word outside?

1023
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,520
Of course.

1024
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,790
Are you aware

1025
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,790
that Nancy's mother

1026
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,590
has an extensive

1027
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,590
arrest record?

1028
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,990
No, I wasn't. Why?

1029
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,530
Well, it seems

1030
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,530
that she might've

1031
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,530
been committed

1032
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,540
largely based on

1033
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,540
her mother's

1034
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,540
version of events.

1035
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,660
Dr. Charles,

1036
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,660
Nancy was committed

1037
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,940
because I deemed her

1038
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,940
a threat to herself

1039
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,940
and others.

1040
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,810
I was just wondering

1041
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,810
if you thought that

1042
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,810
there was any chance that

1043
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,310
your assessment

1044
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,310
might've been colored by

1045
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,050
a potentially

1046
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,050
unreliable history

1047
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,050
given by the mother.

1048
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,580
My assessment was

1049
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,580
colored by 20 years

1050
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,580
of experience

1051
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,950
in adolescent psychiatry.

1052
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,420
And quite frankly,

1053
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,420
I don't appreciate

1054
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,920
being second-guessed

1055
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,920
by a doctor

1056
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,720
who's only known my patient

1057
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,720
for one afternoon.

1058
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,830
I just saw the potential

1059
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,830
for a biased narrative,

1060
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,590
and I wanted to make sure

1061
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,590
you had all the facts.

1062
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,460
A biased narrative.

1063
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,100
As Nancy's

1064
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,100
court-appointed doctor,

1065
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,470
I'd advise you to worry

1066
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,470
about your own patients,

1067
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,470
Dr. Charles.

1068
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,970
Hey, you're

1069
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,970
discharging her?

1070
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,340
I just finished

1071
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,340
the paperwork now.

1072
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,780
Dr. Manning.

1073
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,780
Yes.

1074
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,310
Your coma patient,

1075
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,550
given the abysmal treatment

1076
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,550
she received at that facility,

1077
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,650
I couldn't help but wonder

1078
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,650
what other ways they

1079
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,650
might've failed her,

1080
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,890
so I reviewed

1081
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,890
her history.

1082
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,190
Did you find anything?

1083
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,990
I'm afraid not,

1084
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,990
but I do have one question.

1085
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,730
What time of day

1086
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,730
did you perform

1087
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,730
that neuro exam?

1088
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,400
Morning. Why?

1089
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,670
Sometimes,

1090
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,670
traumatic brain injuries

1091
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,670
result in a patient developing

1092
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,830
irregular sleep/wake

1093
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,830
circadian cycles.

1094
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,430
So, it's possible

1095
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,430
Teresa's become nocturnal.

1096
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,780
I suggest we try

1097
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,780
that test again.

1098
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,170
Great.

1099
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,380
Mr. and Mrs. Azen.

1100
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,250
This is Dr. Abrams,

1101
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,250
Chief of Neurosurgery.

1102
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,050
Do you mind if we perform

1103
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,050
one more test

1104
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,050
on your daughter?

1105
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,060
Well, the EMTs

1106
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,060
from her new facility

1107
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,060
are on their way.

1108
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,690
It should just

1109
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,690
take a moment.

1110
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,100
Teresa, if you can hear me,

1111
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,100
please open your eyes.

1112
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,530
I've asked her that

1113
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,530
a million times.

1114
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,800
I know.

1115
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,800
Just bear with me a moment.

1116
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:57,010
Teresa, if you can hear me,

1117
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:57,010
please move your eyes

1118
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:57,010
side to side.

1119
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,250
I'm sorry.

1120
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,320
I finished

1121
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,320
Teresa's discharge.

1122
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,860
As soon as her

1123
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,860
transportation arrives...

1124
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,920
Hold on.

1125
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,160
There's a condition

1126
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,160
called Locked-in Syndrome.

1127
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,530
If your daughter has it,

1128
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,530
she'd be conscious,

1129
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,870
but she wouldn't be able

1130
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,870
to move her eyes side to side.

1131
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,040
She could,

1132
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,040
however, move them...

1133
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,040
Well, let's see.

1134
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,140
Teresa,

1135
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,010
I need you to move your eyes

1136
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,010
up and down for me, please.

1137
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,480
Up and down.

1138
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,840
Did you see that?

1139
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,840
What was that?

1140
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,290
Teresa, if you can hear me,

1141
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,290
please move your

1142
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,290
eyes up and down again.

1143
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,200
Oh, my God.

1144
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,010
I don't understand.

1145
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,010
How did you wake her

1146
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,010
from the coma?

1147
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,780
I didn't.

1148
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,780
I don't believe she

1149
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,780
ever was in a coma.

1150
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,480
What?

1151
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,620
We need more tests

1152
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,620
to be certain,

1153
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,090
but it's my opinion

1154
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,090
that her accident

1155
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,680
caused a stroke

1156
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,680
to the brain stem,

1157
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,590
which included

1158
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,590
the basilar artery.

1159
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,890
What does that mean?

1160
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,500
The stroke left her

1161
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,500
completely paralyzed,

1162
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,500
but still conscious.

1163
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,090
Locked-in Syndrome.

1164
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,370
She's awake,

1165
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,370
but locked in her body.

1166
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,540
All these years?

1167
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,870
She's always been awake?

1168
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,410
Yes.

1169
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,240
She heard

1170
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,240
everything we said...

1171
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,650
I said.

1172
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,520
And she was conscious

1173
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,520
while some monster

1174
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,520
assaulted her?

1175
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,760
My poor baby.

1176
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,060
I know, it's so terrible.

1177
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,060
I'm so sorry.

1178
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,860
But at least you

1179
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,860
haven't lost her.

1180
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,700
It's possible

1181
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,700
that some of her paralysis

1182
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,700
is the result of spasticity,

1183
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,080
and it's therefore treatable

1184
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,080
with muscle relaxants

1185
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,080
and physical therapy.

1186
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,210
Wait, will she

1187
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,210
get better?

1188
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,310
She'll never be

1189
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,310
fully functional,

1190
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,580
but she should

1191
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,580
regain some movement.

1192
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,620
We can also order

1193
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,620
an infrared

1194
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,620
eye-tracking device

1195
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,450
that'll allow

1196
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,450
Teresa to communicate

1197
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,450
through a computer.

1198
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,390
Communicate?

1199
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,390
Yeah.

1200
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,530
She'll be able to put together

1201
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,530
words and sentences.

1202
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,490
You'll be able to

1203
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,490
have a conversation

1204
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,490
with your daughter again.

1205
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,160
A conversation?

1206
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,940
With my little girl?

1207
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,570
Thank you.

1208
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,530
We'll give you time alone

1209
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,530
with your daughter now.

1210
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,550
Thank you.

1211
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,090
Sarah, they're

1212
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,090
telling me to get dressed.

1213
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,620
They're sending me back.

1214
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,620
I know. I'm sorry.

1215
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,660
Sarah, please.

1216
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,700
Help me.

1217
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,700
I tried.

1218
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,200
I did, but Dr. Baker has

1219
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,200
conservatorship over you.

1220
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,330
According to the courts,

1221
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,640
she has to be the one

1222
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,640
to change the diagnosis,

1223
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,470
and we couldn't

1224
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,470
change her mind.

1225
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,210
Hey, I'm not giving up

1226
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,210
and you can't either.

1227
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,480
Stay strong.

1228
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,580
We'll figure

1229
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,580
something else out.

1230
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,540
Okay?

1231
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,650
Give me a second.

1232
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,500
Dr. Charles, I know I don't

1233
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,500
have any definitive proof,

1234
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,500
but she is sane.

1235
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,630
I know it.

1236
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,630
We can't let her go back.

1237
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,760
Slow down, Dr. Reese.

1238
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,930
Dr. Baker just

1239
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,930
doesn't want to admit

1240
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,930
that she misdiagnosed her.

1241
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,110
You know what?

1242
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,110
I happen to agree with you.

1243
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,110
I'm filing an appeal.

1244
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,140
You don't think

1245
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,140
she's mentally ill?

1246
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,070
Can't be positive,

1247
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,070
but either way,

1248
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,240
she should not be locked up

1249
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,240
on a long-term hold

1250
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,940
based solely on her

1251
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,940
mother's testimony.

1252
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,210
Need some help!

1253
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,210
Treatment One.

1254
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,980
What happened?

1255
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,980
Give me some pressure.

1256
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,820
Must've grabbed

1257
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,820
the scalpel from the cart.

1258
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,660
Tourniquet her arm,

1259
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,660
and give me a hemostat.

1260
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,330
It's tied.

1261
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,330
I'm not crazy,

1262
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,330
Sarah. I'm not.

1263
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,810
Surgery turned out

1264
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,810
well today.

1265
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,150
Thanks to you,

1266
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,150
Dr. Rhodes.

1267
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,620
It's been a long day,

1268
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,620
Dr. Latham.

1269
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,620
How 'bout a drink?

1270
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,110
We need to talk

1271
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,110
to Goodwin.

1272
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,760
Trafficking of cocaine

1273
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,760
is a felony.

1274
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,570
That means calling

1275
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,570
the DEA, Homeland,

1276
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,570
the whole nine yards.

1277
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,420
All that over one packet?

1278
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,500
Well, if the evidence

1279
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,500
is just this one,

1280
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,510
that doesn't

1281
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,510
demonstrate intent

1282
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,510
to traffic and sell.

1283
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,240
Were there more?

1284
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,910
No.

1285
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,550
The one packet

1286
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,550
is all we found.

1287
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,190
That's correct.

1288
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,790
Dr. Choi?

1289
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,430
Anything to add?

1290
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,760
Dr. Choi...

1291
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,960
No.

1292
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,410
Then that's that.

1293
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,660
Thank you, Dr. Choi.

1294
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,020
Do not put me

1295
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,020
in that position again.

1296
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,730
Either of you.

1297
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,800
I don't know that

1298
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,800
I helped Zulmira.

1299
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,840
She still has to

1300
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,840
deal with the people

1301
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,840
whose drugs she lost.

1302
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,310
She is

1303
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,310
a resourceful woman.

1304
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,580
She's gonna do

1305
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,580
what she needs to take care

1306
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,580
of that little girl.

1307
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,750
I had to at least

1308
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,750
try to help her.

1309
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,150
If I had a child,

1310
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,150
I would've done

1311
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,150
the same thing.

1312
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,350
I know.

1313
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,520
Thank you.

1314
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,660
And thank you

1315
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,660
for earlier.

1316
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,160
About the baby.

1317
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,400
It's my fault.

1318
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,570
Why'd you say that?

1319
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,570
I gave her

1320
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,570
false hope.

1321
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,350
I told her

1322
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,350
I believed she was stable

1323
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,350
when she clearly isn't.

1324
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm not sure I agree.

1325
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,710
I mean,

1326
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,980
just made her case

1327
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,980
a little tougher,

1328
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,610
but I'm still

1329
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,610
gonna file the appeal.

1330
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,450
Why would you do that

1331
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,450
when she just

1332
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,450
tried to kill herself?

1333
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,160
Losing hope is not

1334
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,160
a sign of mental illness.

1335
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,160
It's a sign of being human.

1336
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,490
I mean, the poor girl...

1337
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,360
She has a violent,

1338
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,360
unstable mother,

1339
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,530
and her fate is

1340
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,530
in the hands of

1341
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,530
this psychiatrist

1342
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,830
who doesn't believe

1343
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,830
a word she says.

1344
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,640
Given those odds,

1345
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,640
I can absolutely

1346
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,640
understand

1347
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,610
why she'd fall

1348
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,610
into despair.

1349
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,930
Had to prove me wrong,

1350
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,930
didn't ya?

1351
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,070
Looks like you're

1352
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,070
gonna get your wish.

1353
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,930
She will have

1354
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,930
a say in her future.

1355
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,980
Dr. Latham, you decide

1356
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,980
on that drink after all?

1357
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,690
Maimonides.

1358
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,690
Twelfth century

1359
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,690
rabbi and physician.

1360
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,200
He said that the risk

1361
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,200
of a wrong decision

1362
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,600
is preferable to

1363
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,600
the terror of indecision.

1364
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,030
I have never had

1365
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,030
a moment like today

1366
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,040
before I started

1367
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,040
my TMS treatments.

1368
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,710
I wouldn't worry.

1369
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,710
I doubt it'll happen again.

1370
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,680
That girl was more than

1371
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,680
just a surgical challenge.

1372
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,550
She became

1373
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,550
a human being to me.

1374
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,510
I lost my detachment.

1375
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,510
I cannot afford that.

1376
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,220
I'm ending my treatments,

1377
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,220
at least for the time being.

1378
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,920
Well, I'm sorry

1379
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,920
that you feel like

1380
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,050
you have to

1381
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,050
make that decision,

1382
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,920
but I trust your judgment.

1383
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,390
Hmm.

1384
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,400
When you started

1385
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,400
your fellowship,

1386
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,770
I told you that you

1387
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,770
were not my first choice.

1388
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,440
After working with

1389
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,440
you these last months,

1390
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,700
I would like to say

1391
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,700
that I cannot imagine

1392
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,270
a finer surgeon or person

1393
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,270
than you, Dr. Rhodes.

1394
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,150
Thank you.

1395
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,910
Well, let's leave it

1396
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,910
at that.

1397
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,910
Yeah.

1398
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,750
I would like a drink.

1399
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,750
Scotch for me. Neat.

1400
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,660
And another for my friend.

1401
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,910
Hey.

1402
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,420
Look, I'm sorry.

1403
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,850
Okay, I...

1404
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,850
I don't know what to say.

1405
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:13,420
I got no clue what

1406
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:13,420
you're going through,

1407
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:13,420
but I wish I could help.
