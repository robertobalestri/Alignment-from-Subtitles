1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,830
Have you seen

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,830
this person?

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,970
Uh-uh.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,970
His name is Danny.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,200
Maybe he found

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,200
a shelter.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,440
Yeah, maybe.

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,000
Or he could be riding

9
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,000
the train all night

10
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,000
to stay warm.

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,210
Ethan, if you're trying

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,210
to make me feel better,

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,210
it's not going to work.

14
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,910
I'm not, I'm just saying.

15
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,780
We can't look everywhere,

16
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,780
and it's time to go to work.

17
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,250
Well, you go ahead.

18
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,250
I'm going to keep looking.

19
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,950
Um, excuse me.

20
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,590
Excuse me?

21
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,720
Sarah. Sarah, Sarah.

22
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,430
Lower Wacker is much

23
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,430
more popular

24
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,430
this time of year.

25
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,600
We'll check it out

26
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,600
tonight after our shift.

27
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,070
Okay.

28
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,910
You ordered a pâté

29
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,910
platter and sweet breads?

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,250
Yeah, pathologists

31
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,250
love organ meats.

32
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,850
You recognize

33
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,850
that's weird, right?

34
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,350
I think

35
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,350
it's a vitamin D thing.

36
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,350
We don't get much sunshine.

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,790
Have a good day.

38
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,560
Morning.

39
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,560
Hey, what's up?

40
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,290
Big moving-in

41
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,290
party tonight, huh?

42
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
Evite wouldn't lie.

43
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,840
Yeah, well, we'll be there.

44
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,340
So, how's it been so far,

45
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,340
living together?

46
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,710
Only a couple days,

47
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,710
but so far so good.

48
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,440
I bet.

49
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,740
I heard there's

50
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,740
a giant Whole Foods

51
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,740
across the street.

52
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,910
That's awesome.

53
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,910
Yeah, it is.

54
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,880
Good. Well, I'm really

55
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,880
happy for you guys.

56
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,690
Mmm-hmm?

57
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,690
Dr. Manning.

58
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,150
Got it.

59
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,150
Treatment 6.

60
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,700
You and Dr. Shore

61
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,700
better be the real deal.

62
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,000
I am bringing

63
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,000
a Chateau Pichon 2005.

64
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,300
Great, wine spritzers.

65
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,130
Don't you dare. Treatment One.

66
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,900
Hey, uh, did you get

67
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,900
those lab results yet?

68
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,030
They just came in.

69
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,200
Want me to come with you?

70
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,280
Um, I think I better

71
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,280
do this myself.

72
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,480
Okay, just tell her

73
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,480
if she needs

74
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,480
anything I'm here.

75
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,590
Don't come too close.

76
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,730
My TB's become active.

77
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,100
The spot on your lung's

78
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,100
a half a centimeter larger.

79
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,230
I'm sorry.

80
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,710
I took my meds.

81
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,710
I didn't overexert.

82
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,710
I just don't get it.

83
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,070
Thing is, uh,

84
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,150
that's not all.

85
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,850
Here, just read it.

86
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,850
Come on, Noah.

87
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,910
Just...

88
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,910
Just read it.

89
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,720
Wait...

90
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,230
I'm pregnant?

91
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,300
I'm pregnant.

92
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,040
Is it just me,

93
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,040
or these Santas

94
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,680
seem to come out

95
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,680
earlier every year?

96
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,780
Right?

97
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,450
The psych nurse

98
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,450
station still has

99
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,190
their Halloween

100
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,190
decorations up.

101
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
Any Thanksgiving plans?

102
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,830
Taking Robin out

103
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,830
for some sushi.

104
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,960
Good, so the two of you

105
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,960
are spending

106
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,960
some time together?

107
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,330
Yeah.

108
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,840
Here and there. Yeah.

109
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,610
Doing great, you know?

110
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,610
I mean, such a great kid.

111
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,540
But you know how it is.

112
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,540
You don't really

113
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,540
worry about them.

114
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,440
You worry about the people

115
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,440
they surround themselves with.

116
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,180
Sounds like

117
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,180
someone in particular.

118
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,920
No, not really.

119
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,280
I guess there's this

120
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,280
one guy.

121
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,190
You know, a great fella.

122
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,190
I mean, we work together.

123
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,920
Terrific surgeon.

124
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,850
But he's got these

125
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,850
family issues, man.

126
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,330
Big family issues.

127
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,330
And obviously with

128
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,330
Robin's family history,

129
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,330
it just can all

130
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,400
turn into a bit

131
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,400
of a powder keg.

132
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,060
Have you spoken

133
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,060
to her about this?

134
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,800
No.

135
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,100
Oh.

136
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,010
So, you're just

137
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,010
keeping it all

138
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,010
to yourself?

139
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,010
Daniel.

140
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,010
Didn't I just

141
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,010
tell my shrink?

142
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,450
I don't know.

143
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,450
I might have said

144
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,450
something to the guy.

145
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,740
Nothing intrusive.

146
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,250
Just, I don't know,

147
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,250
some friendly advice.

148
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,250
"Advice"?

149
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,020
Yeah.

150
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,020
Daniel.

151
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,690
Don't make the holidays

152
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,690
any more hard

153
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,690
than they have to be.

154
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,900
Hey, I know

155
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,900
this isn't ideal,

156
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,560
but a couple of weeks,

157
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,560
we should have your

158
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,560
TB back under control.

159
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,070
Yeah, you'll be back

160
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,070
in the ED throwing me

161
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,070
shade again in no time.

162
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,070
But how did this happen?

163
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,070
I take birth control.

164
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,710
My opinion,

165
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,880
your TB meds made

166
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,880
your birth

167
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,880
control less effective,

168
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,790
and then becoming pregnant

169
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,790
weakened your immune system

170
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,120
to let the TB

171
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,120
become active.

172
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,120
Oh, God.

173
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,510
No one could have

174
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,510
predicted this, April.

175
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,990
In a few months,

176
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,990
I'll be walking

177
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,790
down the aisle

178
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,790
with a baby bump.

179
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,720
Yeah, but it's all good.

180
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,720
Right?

181
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,060
Yeah.

182
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,700
No, it is, but...

183
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,230
What about Tate?

184
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,230
You know Tate.

185
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,400
He'll love it.

186
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,400
He's head over heels for you.

187
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,340
Yeah, right now.

188
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,540
But what if I get sick?

189
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,540
What if I can't

190
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,540
take care of this baby?

191
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,050
April...

192
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,050
He didn't sign up

193
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,050
for this.

194
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,980
It's okay. Go.

195
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,990
I'll check on you soon, okay?

196
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,670
Jim Vance,

197
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,670
38, end-stage

198
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,670
kidney failure,

199
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,170
suffered a

200
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,170
syncopal episode

201
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,170
following dialysis.

202
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,340
Too far down the list.

203
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,340
Transplant candidate?

204
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,100
Hi, Mr. Vance.

205
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,100
This is Dr. Halstead.

206
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,010
Heard you had

207
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,010
some trouble today.

208
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,750
Today, Tuesday,

209
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,750
last Friday.

210
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,090
Almost every time

211
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,090
I get dialysis now.

212
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,090
What happens?

213
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,790
My chest, uh,

214
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,790
it starts to flutter.

215
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,490
Uh-huh.

216
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,490
I feel really weak.

217
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,870
Um... Ventricular...

218
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,130
Ectopy. Yeah.

219
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,360
Ectopy.

220
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,870
May be IDH.

221
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,740
Intradialytic hypotension.

222
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,130
In some people,

223
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,130
dialysis can cause

224
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,700
an extreme drop

225
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,700
in blood pressure,

226
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,110
which prevents enough oxygen

227
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,110
from reaching the heart,

228
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,710
and over time,

229
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,710
that can cause dysrhythmias

230
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,710
or even a heart attack.

231
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,550
So, tell the

232
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,550
transplant people.

233
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,990
Maybe they can

234
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,990
move me up the list.

235
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,250
Well, we can try,

236
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,250
but I'm sorry to say,

237
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,380
heart disease

238
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,380
usually moves people

239
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,380
down the list, not up.

240
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,290
But I'm not even 40 yet.

241
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,290
I hear you.

242
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,290
And I promise

243
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,290
we're going to do

244
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,290
everything we can to help.

245
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,820
Yeah.

246
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,830
Let's get him on

247
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,830
15 PO of kayexalate

248
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,600
and start him on esmolol

249
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,600
to stabilize his rhythm.

250
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,840
Or we could do

251
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,840
low-volume dialysis.

252
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,540
We could.

253
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,050
Otherwise we're just

254
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,050
treating the symptoms

255
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,050
and not the actual problem.

256
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,580
Yeah. Okay.

257
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,580
Great.

258
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,680
I'll be back in a few.

259
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,050
We'll see you.

260
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,420
Natalie.

261
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,460
We don't usually disagree

262
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,460
in front of a patient.

263
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,690
I had to say something.

264
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,290
You really think

265
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,290
low-volume dialysis

266
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,290
will make a difference?

267
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,160
I mean,

268
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,160
it seems like six of one,

269
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,160
half a dozen the other...

270
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,060
I don't know.

271
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,060
Maybe. Let's find out.

272
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,670
Hey, you bringing

273
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,670
Clarke tonight?

274
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,670
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,950
Good. Pathology party.

276
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,950
Not much to look at.

277
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,080
So, how's it going

278
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,080
with him?

279
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,880
Good. You know, we're just

280
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,620
trying to let it happen,

281
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,620
not trying to force anything.

282
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,780
"Force anything"?

283
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,350
Like moving in together

284
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,350
for financial reasons

285
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,350
or convenience.

286
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,890
No, I wish Will all the best.

287
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,890
I just think it's weird.

288
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,160
Thirty-six-year-old male,

289
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,700
penetrating stab

290
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,700
wound to the abdomen.

291
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,250
You're going to Trauma One.

292
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,250
Got it.

293
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,960
What happened?

294
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,100
I got jumped in the yard.

295
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,100
Three guys.

296
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,330
Why would they do that?

297
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,330
All I do is make friends.

298
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,710
We need to transfer him.

299
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,710
Yeah, hold up.

300
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,810
Okay, he's ready.

301
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,810
On my count.

302
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,810
One, two, three.

303
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,510
Guys, I got a hole in my gut.

304
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,510
I ain't going anywhere.

305
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,880
Left lower quadrant

306
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,880
looks clean

307
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,480
and no major vessels,

308
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,480
no bowel.

309
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,550
I can take it.

310
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,120
You need to put me under,

311
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,120
you do what you gotta do.

312
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,820
No, I think you got lucky

313
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,820
on this one, Mr. Wallace.

314
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,930
CT abdomen,

315
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,930
then bring him back.

316
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
We can take care

317
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
of this one here.

318
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,260
Okay.

319
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,260
Okay, Doc.

320
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,410
I trust you, but I gotta ask.

321
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,410
After you're done,

322
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,600
am I gonna be able

323
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,600
to play the piano?

324
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,340
Hey, come on.

325
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,340
Don't leave me hanging here.

326
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,250
Let me guess.

327
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,250
You never could

328
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,250
play it before.

329
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,540
I like you, Doc.

330
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,220
You can stick

331
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,220
your fingers in me

332
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,220
any time you want.

333
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,430
How's he doing?

334
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,430
He'll be fine,

335
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,900
though with

336
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,900
a nice-looking scar.

337
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,090
Pretty fortunate,

338
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,090
considering it was

339
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,090
three against one.

340
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,260
That's actually not the case,

341
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,260
Dr. Choi.

342
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,430
Seems he stabbed

343
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,430
himself hoping to score

344
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,800
a holiday from prison.

345
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,800
What?

346
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,400
I guess when you're

347
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,400
up against 30 to life

348
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,400
for a double homicide,

349
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,270
you look for

350
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,270
little diversions.

351
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,380
Her name

352
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,380
is Karrina Goff.

353
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,540
She's 16 years old,

354
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,420
with a history notable

355
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,420
for Williams Syndrome.

356
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,390
Her mom found her

357
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,390
passed out on the couch.

358
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,790
Williams Syndrome.

359
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,790
You ever seen it?

360
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,650
No, never.

361
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,650
It's a genetic

362
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,650
disorder, right?

363
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,790
Uh-huh. It's commonly

364
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,790
associated with

365
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,790
cardiovascular disease,

366
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,660
but even more striking

367
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,660
is their personalities.

368
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,630
They produce enormous

369
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,630
amounts of oxytocin,

370
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,930
which is the hormone

371
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,930
commonly associated

372
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,660
with feelings of trust

373
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,660
and the desire to be social.

374
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,210
They're very

375
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,210
interesting people.

376
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,730
Hi, Dr. Clarke!

377
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,800
Hi, Karrina.

378
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,870
Wendy, this is

379
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,870
Dr. Latham and Dr. Rhodes.

380
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,470
Hi, Karrina.

381
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,470
Oh, I like your earrings.

382
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,780
It's a moon

383
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,780
and the stars.

384
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,780
I see that.

385
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,620
So, how are we

386
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,620
feeling today?

387
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,280
Tired.

388
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,380
Still awake enough to donate

389
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,380
her entire allowance

390
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,380
to UNICEF this morning.

391
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,450
Which is what?

392
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,450
The third time this month?

393
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,890
Is this the first time

394
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,890
she's fainted?

395
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,790
Yes.

396
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,930
May I listen to your heart?

397
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,780
Mid-systolic ejection murmur

398
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,780
over the right

399
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,780
second intercostal space.

400
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,710
Aortic stenosis?

401
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,310
Probably.

402
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,750
Let's get an echo.

403
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,750
Okay.

404
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,510
Can you make me better?

405
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,450
I am going to try my best.

406
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,990
Okay, dear.

407
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,990
Let the doctor breathe.

408
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,190
Doctor?

409
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,230
Uh, let us run a few tests,

410
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,230
and we'll be back

411
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,230
with our recommendations.

412
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,110
I thought maybe Sunday

413
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,110
we can go to the Field Museum.

414
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,010
That sounds good.

415
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,010
The DNA Center

416
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,010
has an exhibit

417
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,650
on the reproductive

418
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,650
habits of sharks

419
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,650
that's supposed to be great.

420
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,220
I'm sorry.

421
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,220
What were you saying?

422
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,330
Danny still hasn't checked in

423
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,330
on Facebook, has he?

424
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,860
No.

425
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,860
He'll turn up.

426
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,770
You don't know that.

427
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,770
He's helpless and

428
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,770
alone out there.

429
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,680
And you've been

430
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,680
out there every day

431
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,680
looking for him.

432
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,910
There's nothing

433
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,910
else you can do.

434
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,210
I could have let him

435
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,210
stay with me

436
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,210
when he asked.

437
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,440
No, Reese, you couldn't have.

438
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,320
That's not your

439
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,320
responsibility.

440
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,880
Mmm-hmm.

441
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,920
He found you

442
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,920
when he needed

443
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,920
you in the past.

444
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,090
He'll turn up.

445
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,290
I said get out of here.

446
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,100
I just want to

447
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,100
talk to the doctor.

448
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,100
You better get

449
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,100
out of my face, man,

450
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,100
I'm not playing.

451
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,040
I just wanted to

452
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,040
know if you're okay.

453
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,300
Do I look like

454
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,300
I'm okay, man?

455
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,530
Excuse me, sir?

456
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,700
Is everything okay in here?

457
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,530
Uh, yeah.

458
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,380
I'm Ian. Jim's brother.

459
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,040
Some brother.

460
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,310
Go ahead. Tell them.

461
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,320
Jim...

462
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,320
Go ahead

463
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,320
and tell them, man!

464
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,190
Tell them.

465
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm a perfect match

466
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,960
to donate my kidney.

467
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,060
Right.

468
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,030
And he'd rather watch me die

469
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,030
than give it to me.

470
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,350
I love my brother.

471
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,820
I'd love to

472
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,820
give him my kidney.

473
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,750
What's stopping you?

474
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,420
I'm HIV-positive.

475
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,330
But giving him a kidney

476
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,330
would be giving

477
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,330
him HIV as well.

478
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,300
I'm guessing by his reaction

479
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,300
that he doesn't know?

480
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,130
Not a clue.

481
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,100
May I ask,

482
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,100
why don't you tell him?

483
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,470
Because Jim is

484
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,470
incredibly homophobic.

485
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,610
He thinks homosexuality is

486
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,250
disgusting, deviant behavior.

487
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,720
Yeah, but right now,

488
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,720
he thinks you're

489
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,720
willing to let him die.

490
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,780
Well, right now...

491
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,790
Right now he hates me

492
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,790
for what I'm doing.

493
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,530
If I tell him this,

494
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,060
he'll hate me for who I am.

495
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,230
I understand.

496
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,330
But just so you know,

497
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,430
if you don't tell him soon,

498
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,430
it may be too late.

499
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,640
Hey, hello.

500
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,050
Hey. You better

501
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,050
put that mask on.

502
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,150
I brought you some

503
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,150
stuff from home, okay?

504
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,690
Thank you.

505
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,690
All right.

506
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,960
All right,

507
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,960
so, how you feeling?

508
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,120
Sit down.

509
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,120
Why?

510
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,730
What is it?

511
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm pregnant.

512
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,340
Pregnant? Are you sure?

513
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,340
You're on the pill.

514
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,370
My TB meds screwed things up.

515
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,670
I'm sorry.

516
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,280
I know we didn't

517
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,280
plan for this.

518
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,850
I know this

519
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,850
changes everything.

520
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,750
Yeah.

521
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,620
We're going to have a baby.

522
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,390
Oh, you can't see.

523
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,540
Okay, now put that back on.

524
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,640
Babe, we slept in

525
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,640
the same bed last night.

526
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,270
Put it back on.

527
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,850
It's a beautiful thing, honey.

528
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,850
It really is.

529
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,860
Ms. Charles, what brings you

530
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,860
to the ED today?

531
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,260
Yellow fever? Plague?

532
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,700
Nah, just a

533
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,700
plain old cough.

534
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,630
Things have not been the same

535
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,630
since the swine flu died down.

536
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,730
Well, don't worry.

537
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,730
There'll be another

538
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,730
epidemic one day.

539
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
That's what I keep

540
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
telling myself. You know,

541
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
gotta stay positive.

542
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,040
I never figured

543
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,040
you for an optimist.

544
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,440
Are you kidding me?

545
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,100
I still root

546
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,100
for the White Sox.

547
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,010
Wow.

548
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,010
I do.

549
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,140
How do you do it?

550
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,140
I would love to tell you.

551
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,080
I don't know.

552
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,080
Maybe over drinks tonight?

553
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,180
That sounds great.

554
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,180
Really, uh...

555
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,920
Just not sure

556
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,920
your father would approve.

557
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,720
What?

558
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,720
Did he say something to you?

559
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,290
No, not really.

560
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,300
He just mentioned

561
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,300
something in passing.

562
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,560
Huh.

563
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,660
I see.

564
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,040
Ms. Goff, hi.

565
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,810
So, we got

566
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,810
Karrina's test results.

567
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,780
The large vessel leaving

568
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,780
her heart has become

569
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,780
severely congested.

570
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,680
It's making her heart

571
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,680
work harder and harder

572
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,120
and decreasing

573
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,120
the amount of oxygen

574
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,120
that it can deliver.

575
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,730
That's why she's become

576
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,730
so tired and listless.

577
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,790
Oh, God. What do we do?

578
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,660
We recommend an operation

579
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,660
to either fix the aortic

580
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,660
valve or replace it.

581
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,130
Yes.

582
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,130
Heart surgery?

583
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,240
Hi, Dr. Rhodes!

584
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,310
What are you guys

585
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,310
talking about?

586
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,740
Dr. Rhodes

587
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,740
was just explaining

588
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,740
your test results.

589
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,510
Hey, Karrina, why don't we

590
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,510
get you back to bed?

591
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,440
There you are.

592
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,080
So, based on what

593
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,080
I am seeing,

594
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,310
I believe you need surgery.

595
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,350
Will that make me better?

596
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,090
Well, there are

597
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,090
never any guarantees.

598
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,590
But, if things go well,

599
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,590
then, yes, it will.

600
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,930
Good! Then I want to do it.

601
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,490
It's not that simple,

602
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,490
sweetheart.

603
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,490
We need to think about this.

604
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,630
Give the doctor

605
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,630
and I a minute.

606
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,760
Okay.

607
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,040
We'll be right back.

608
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,370
I know you think

609
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,370
surgery has the best odds,

610
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,920
but I also know

611
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,920
that Williams patients

612
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,580
have a much higher chance

613
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,580
of not surviving

614
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,580
general anesthesia.

615
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,820
I completely understand,

616
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,120
but the fact is

617
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,120
her condition is

618
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,120
quite advanced,

619
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,930
and she did express

620
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,930
that she wants the surgery.

621
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,590
She doesn't understand.

622
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,590
She says that

623
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,590
just to please you.

624
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,460
She may not be able to

625
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,460
make a completely

626
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,460
informed decision,

627
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,620
but she does know

628
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,620
how she feels.

629
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,190
She's under 18.

630
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,190
It's my decision to make.

631
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,260
Shouldn't we at least

632
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,260
let her be a part of

633
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,260
the conversation...

634
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,310
Dr. Rhodes, Karrina is not like

635
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,310
your other patients.

636
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,170
I want options.

637
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,070
Okay.

638
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,180
Um, let me talk

639
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,180
to Dr. Latham.

640
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,480
See if he has any ideas.

641
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,250
What did you tell Connor?

642
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,160
Come again?

643
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,160
Did you tell him to

644
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,160
stay away from me?

645
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,790
No.

646
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,790
You said something.

647
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,800
I might have...

648
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,800
Who I date

649
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,660
is not your concern.

650
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,210
You are

651
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,210
absolutely right, 100%.

652
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,900
You are unbelievable.

653
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,740
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

654
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,740
I worry about you,

655
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,740
I can't help it.

656
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,400
Okay, well,

657
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,400
that's going to need to stop.

658
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,210
Can't do it. I'm your dad.

659
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,150
I know I haven't

660
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,150
won any awards

661
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,150
in that department...

662
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,280
This is not

663
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,280
a referendum on you.

664
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,050
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

665
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,050
I'm sorry I wasn't a...

666
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,250
Okay, see that?

667
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,250
That right there.

668
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,120
Why does it

669
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,120
always go back to that?

670
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,450
Does it ever occur to you

671
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,450
that I have moved on?

672
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,430
I didn't...

673
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,430
Not only am I past it,

674
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,620
but I really...

675
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,620
I do not care.

676
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,230
So you can feel as

677
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,230
guilty as you want,

678
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,260
but you being

679
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,260
overinvolved in my life now

680
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,260
is not going to cut it.

681
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,210
Hey, Doc.

682
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,810
We gotta stop

683
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,810
meeting like this, right?

684
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,960
Oh, you giving me

685
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,960
the silent treatment, huh?

686
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,760
Hey, you think

687
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,760
I could get

688
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,760
a TV in here?

689
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,330
You and I could

690
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,330
watch a little, uh,

691
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,900
Family Feud.

692
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,890
Not enough time.

693
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,400
I'm stitching you up

694
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,400
and then you're leaving,

695
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,400
which means you

696
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,400
won't be needing those.

697
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,150
Ah, come on.

698
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,150
Why you gotta be like that?

699
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,780
Because you're not

700
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,780
here on vacation.

701
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,270
Hey, give me a break here.

702
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,270
I'm injured.

703
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,250
By your own hand, I hear.

704
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,090
You want to play that game?

705
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,750
I am extremely depressed,

706
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,350
and you know what?

707
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,960
That makes me

708
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,960
want to hurt myself.

709
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
Excuse me?

710
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
You heard me.

711
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,000
You heard me, too.

712
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,030
I am gonna

713
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,030
hurt myself!

714
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,110
And we all know

715
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,110
what that means.

716
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,710
We have no choice.

717
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,590
I'll call Dr. Charles

718
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,590
for a psych consult.

719
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,620
That's right you will.

720
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,400
He's in v-tach.

721
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,400
Stop the dialysis.

722
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,640
Pulse is thready.

723
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,640
Shortness of breath.

724
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,260
Lost his pulse.

725
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,260
We gotta defibrillate now.

726
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,430
Bag him.

727
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,430
Get me the paddles.

728
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,440
What's going on?

729
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,440
Charge to 200.

730
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,640
He's in cardiac arrest.

731
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,040
Clear.

732
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,710
Still in v-tach.

733
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,620
Come on. Charge to 300.

734
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,120
Sinus rhythm.

735
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,220
Jim, can you hear me?

736
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,500
He's stable for now.

737
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,560
Jim?

738
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,430
I need to talk to you.

739
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,140
I gotta tell you something.

740
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,150
There she is. Yeah.

741
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,150
Thank you.

742
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,350
Hey, is there somewhere

743
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,350
we can go talk for a minute?

744
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,650
Did you find Danny?

745
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,990
He's...

746
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,190
He's dead, isn't he?

747
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,320
Yes.

748
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,430
I'm so sorry.

749
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,370
Hey.

750
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,970
Hey, you did everything

751
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,970
you could.

752
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,960
This is Sarah Reese.

753
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,860
Hi, are you family?

754
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,860
A friend?

755
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,430
No, I'm his doctor.

756
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,730
I was his doctor.

757
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,080
Was he beaten to death?

758
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,890
It looks that way.

759
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,450
We won't know for sure

760
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,450
until we have

761
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,450
the results of the autopsy.

762
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,100
Hey.

763
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,880
Your sputum cultures

764
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,880
just came back.

765
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,650
It turns out you

766
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,650
don't have regular TB.

767
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,440
It's multi-drug resistant.

768
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,250
Okay, so...

769
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,850
I'm gonna have to be on

770
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,850
three or four meds

771
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,850
instead of one?

772
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,380
It's not quite that simple.

773
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,990
It's only susceptible

774
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,990
to one drug,

775
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,890
but it's

776
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,890
completely susceptible,

777
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,620
so it'll

778
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,620
definitely work, but...

779
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,190
This medication

780
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,890
can cause neural tube defects

781
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,890
in a growing fetus.

782
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
But not always.

783
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
There's just a chance.

784
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,210
Well, there must be

785
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,210
something else.

786
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,640
They couldn't have

787
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,640
tested everything.

788
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,030
They have.

789
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,510
Well, tell them

790
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,510
to test it again.

791
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,020
I mean, try something.

792
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,020
There's nothing else to try.

793
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,990
I just placed the order.

794
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,990
The first dose should be

795
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,990
up in a little while.

796
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,490
I'm sorry, April.

797
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,750
Spoke to your patient,

798
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,750
Mr. Wallace.

799
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,990
Let me guess,

800
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,990
not a suicide risk.

801
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,850
Garden-variety sociopath.

802
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,850
He's an opportunist.

803
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,860
Knows all the buzz words.

804
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,860
Not a sincere bone

805
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,860
in his body.

806
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,260
Good enough for me.

807
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,800
Let's start

808
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,800
discharge paperwork

809
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,800
on Treatment Four.

810
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,130
Chalk one up

811
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,130
for the good guys.

812
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,700
Hi, Mr. Vance.

813
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,700
Your rhythm looks good.

814
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,700
How are you feeling?

815
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,800
Disgusted.

816
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,110
Given your latest reaction,

817
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,110
I'd like to try

818
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,110
something different.

819
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,870
A medication called midodrine

820
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,870
to raise your blood pressure,

821
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,110
followed by a special course

822
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,110
of low-calcium dialysate.

823
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,910
Will it work?

824
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,320
Well, to be honest,

825
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,320
it's a long shot,

826
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,320
but it's our best option.

827
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,890
Just tell me.

828
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,690
How long have I got?

829
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,800
You're experiencing

830
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,800
cardiac events

831
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,800
with every dialysis,

832
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,770
and you need dialysis

833
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,770
three days a week,

834
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,770
so realistically,

835
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,730
it can happen at any time.

836
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,270
We are trying

837
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,270
everything we have.

838
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,600
Okay.

839
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,240
Wait.

840
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,280
You wouldn't

841
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,280
give me your kidney

842
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,580
'cause of the virus, right?

843
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,750
But what if I don't care?

844
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,720
Would you give it to me then?

845
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,550
But you'll get infected.

846
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,530
HIV, it's better than dying.

847
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,790
Would you do it?

848
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,730
Yeah. Of course.

849
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,940
Then let's do that.

850
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,930
I want his kidney.

851
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,500
Mr. Vance, you are

852
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,500
severely immunocompromised.

853
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,650
If you received

854
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,650
an HIV-positive organ,

855
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,710
if you contracted

856
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,710
HIV in any way,

857
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,410
it could immediately

858
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,410
progress to AIDS,

859
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,440
and that would

860
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,440
most likely kill you.

861
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,650
Let's just do it.

862
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,020
As your doctor,

863
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,020
I strongly...

864
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,080
Stop.

865
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,560
Will you excuse us

866
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,560
for a moment?

867
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,790
Thank you.

868
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,200
We should look into this.

869
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,400
Look into what?

870
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,610
Purposely giving someone HIV?

871
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,650
He knows the risks.

872
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,650
What does he have?

873
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,650
Days? A couple of weeks?

874
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,350
That's the thing.

875
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,350
We don't know.

876
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,480
He could surprise us,

877
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,490
and make it long enough

878
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,490
to get a healthy kidney.

879
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,460
We could put him on carnitine,

880
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,460
try sodium modeling.

881
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,960
That's grasping at straws.

882
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,960
Yes, a transplant

883
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,960
is dangerous,

884
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,000
but if it works,

885
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,000
it could give him years.

886
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,500
It's unethical and illegal.

887
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,360
Even if you found

888
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,360
a surgeon willing to do it,

889
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,460
the minute anyone found out,

890
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,460
our licenses would be revoked.

891
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,440
So we get

892
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,440
a special dispensation.

893
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,500
Look, that man

894
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,500
is dying in there.

895
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,060
The least we could do

896
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,060
is give him a chance.

897
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,410
Natalie, I'm sorry.

898
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,810
As the attending physician,

899
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,810
I cannot sign off on this.

900
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,510
Fine.

901
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,080
Then I'll

902
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,080
figure it out myself.

903
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,750
I'm going to call

904
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,750
the OR, see if they can bump

905
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,750
anybody till tomorrow.

906
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,380
Dr. Rhodes, any news?

907
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,160
We were actually

908
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,160
just about to see you.

909
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,460
Uh, the final reading

910
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,460
of the echo showed

911
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,120
even more significant

912
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,120
disease than we thought.

913
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,470
You need to consider

914
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,470
scheduling

915
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,470
surgery immediately.

916
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,130
Where's Karrina?

917
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,970
That patient in there,

918
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,970
where did she go?

919
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,000
I told her to stay in

920
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,000
her room. Where is she?

921
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,300
We'll find out.

922
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,300
Check the ambulance bay.

923
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,740
You don't know where she is?

924
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,740
Ma'am...

925
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,940
Karrina?

926
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,940
Karrina?

927
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,210
She's in here.

928
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,620
Sweetie, I need you to

929
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,620
step away from that man.

930
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,890
Get away from him!

931
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,790
Mom, it's okay.

932
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,790
No, it's not okay.

933
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,120
That man is dangerous.

934
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,390
I was just saying hi.

935
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,990
Okay, I know,

936
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,990
I know, sweetie.

937
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,220
Can't take my eyes

938
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,220
off you for one minute.

939
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,620
It's my fault.

940
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,960
No, that's not true.

941
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,320
Of course it is.

942
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,070
I told him we could

943
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,070
remove the chip.

944
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,170
I encouraged him to run away.

945
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,370
You empowered him

946
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,370
to make decisions.

947
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,200
It's what good doctors do.

948
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,200
But they were

949
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,200
the wrong decisions.

950
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,630
It's the wrong outcome.

951
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,110
And now he's dead.

952
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,410
I mean, who knows.

953
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,010
If I'd have told him

954
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,010
to wait,

955
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,490
maybe the police

956
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,490
would have come

957
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,220
and broken up

958
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,220
the ring and he'd be free.

959
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,030
I was careless with his life.

960
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,590
Dr. Reese...

961
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,670
You're anything but careless.

962
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,430
Sometimes the best advice,

963
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,430
you know,

964
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,040
it's just not enough.

965
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,040
Dangerous thing

966
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,040
about psychiatry,

967
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,510
it can sometimes give

968
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,510
those of us who practice it

969
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,880
the illusion of control.

970
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,480
But the human brain,

971
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,050
it's...

972
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,120
It is the most complex,

973
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,120
mysterious object

974
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,120
in the universe.

975
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,260
That means that

976
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,260
what we do, it...

977
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,260
It just doesn't come

978
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,260
with any guarantees.

979
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,470
I don't think that

980
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,470
makes me feel any better.

981
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,540
I know. Never does.

982
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,460
It must be hard.

983
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,060
It is.

984
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,300
She is such a bright light.

985
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,670
A breath of fresh air.

986
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,430
You should see

987
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,430
how people spark up

988
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,430
when they see her,

989
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,310
and how happy it makes

990
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,310
Karrina.

991
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,580
It's like she feeds off of it.

992
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,020
If you don't operate,

993
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,390
I'll be taking that from her.

994
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,360
Do the surgery.

995
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,570
We'll get her

996
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,570
upstairs shortly.

997
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,730
Dr. Halstead?

998
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,730
Yeah?

999
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,150
Um...

1000
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,690
April is refusing to

1001
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,690
take her new medication.

1002
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,630
She won't listen to me. I...

1003
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,230
I just don't know what to do.

1004
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,950
You know I'm

1005
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,950
here to convince you

1006
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,950
to change your mind.

1007
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,080
I'm a nurse.

1008
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,180
I stopped listening to doctors

1009
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,180
a long time ago.

1010
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,800
I know it doesn't make sense.

1011
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,700
But there's another

1012
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,700
life inside of me now.

1013
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,640
How can I take a medicine

1014
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,640
that could endanger it?

1015
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,070
Hopefully it won't.

1016
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,940
"Hopefully."

1017
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,310
I see a lot of

1018
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,310
hopeful people come in here,

1019
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,510
and we tell them

1020
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,510
we're doing everything we can.

1021
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,390
If I take that medication

1022
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,390
and something

1023
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,390
happens to this baby,

1024
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,920
then I didn't do

1025
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,920
everything I could.

1026
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,780
I can't live with that.

1027
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,400
April, you've been put into

1028
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,400
an impossible situation,

1029
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,100
and I can't tell you

1030
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,100
what to do,

1031
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,900
but if you don't

1032
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,900
take this medication,

1033
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,240
there is a very high chance

1034
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,070
both you and

1035
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,070
your baby will die.

1036
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,690
It's unbelievable.

1037
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,390
Health and Human Services

1038
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,390
won't okay that HIV

1039
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,390
kidney transplant?

1040
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,660
Won't even consider it.

1041
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,200
Our local contact at the FDA.

1042
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,540
Deals with compassionate use

1043
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,540
and experimental drugs.

1044
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,910
Might as well try everything.

1045
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,910
Thank you.

1046
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,170
Yeah.

1047
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,650
Looks like our

1048
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,650
time together is up.

1049
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,140
Mmm, yeah,

1050
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,140
you got me, Doc.

1051
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,550
Can't put

1052
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,550
anything over on you.

1053
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,530
I sent his prescription

1054
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,530
ahead to the

1055
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,530
prison pharmacy.

1056
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,620
Great.

1057
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,530
Yeah, you're a real

1058
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,530
tough guy, huh?

1059
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,090
Took my best shots.

1060
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,090
Bang, bang, bang.

1061
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,290
You just deflected them

1062
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,290
like Captain freaking America.

1063
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,160
I'm sorry your stay

1064
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,160
was not satisfactory.

1065
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,200
"Satisfactory"?

1066
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,370
What the hell?

1067
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,050
Get me a portable

1068
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,050
chest X-ray, stat.

1069
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,050
On it.

1070
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,710
Doctor's too smart

1071
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,710
for a stupid con like me.

1072
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,480
Lungs are clear.

1073
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,480
Doctor.

1074
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,060
Come on.

1075
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,850
Did he swallow anything?

1076
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,760
Not that I saw.

1077
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,630
Wait, what are those?

1078
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,610
They look like

1079
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,610
little stars.

1080
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,040
They must have

1081
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,040
lacerated his esophagus.

1082
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,910
Get him up to surgery now.

1083
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,420
Wires are in.

1084
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,420
Chest is dry.

1085
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,830
Let's close the sternum.

1086
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,770
Dr. Vorspan, was the patient

1087
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,770
wearing any earrings?

1088
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,460
No, why?

1089
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,840
They think

1090
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,840
she gave them to

1091
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,840
that convict downstairs,

1092
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,040
and he swallowed them.

1093
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,410
You think you've

1094
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,410
seen everything.

1095
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,350
We'll need wire cutters soon.

1096
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,350
Yes, Doctor.

1097
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,050
You know,

1098
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,050
they did a study

1099
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,050
once on oxytocin.

1100
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,250
College students

1101
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,250
exposed to high levels of it

1102
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,690
just started

1103
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,690
giving their money away.

1104
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,360
Did you see how freely

1105
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,360
she interacted with that man?

1106
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,520
Just a total stranger?

1107
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,200
I've never been

1108
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,200
good at that.

1109
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,360
It's just a symptom of

1110
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,360
her genetic condition.

1111
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,360
True.

1112
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,500
But maybe that's not

1113
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,500
entirely a bad thing.

1114
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,720
Any luck getting someone

1115
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,720
to approve the transplant?

1116
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,220
Nope. Got stonewalled

1117
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,220
by everybody.

1118
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,390
I'm sorry.

1119
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,020
Yeah.

1120
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,330
Time to go tell Jim

1121
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,330
the bad news.

1122
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,140
I'll come with.

1123
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,140
No.

1124
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,170
No, I'll do it.

1125
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm the one who got

1126
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,000
his hopes up, so...

1127
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,780
What are you

1128
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,780
going to tell him?

1129
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,120
The truth.

1130
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,520
That the one thing

1131
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,520
he needs most in the world

1132
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,220
is right in front of him

1133
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,220
and he can't have it,

1134
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,930
and he doesn't

1135
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,930
even have a choice.

1136
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,630
Natalie.

1137
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,940
There's still one thing

1138
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,940
we can do to make this legal.

1139
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,730
What are you

1140
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,730
talking about?

1141
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,100
He's already said he's willing

1142
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,100
to deal with HIV infection.

1143
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,570
Let's give him the option.

1144
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,680
Wait, are you serious?

1145
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,370
It's his decision.

1146
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,940
We'd just be

1147
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,940
giving him a choice.

1148
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,350
You realize

1149
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,350
the implications of this?

1150
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,810
I do.

1151
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,620
But if we want to

1152
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,620
save his life,

1153
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,620
is there any other way?

1154
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,090
Mr. Vance,

1155
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,090
I'm afraid that

1156
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,090
as things stand,

1157
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,360
there is no possible way

1158
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,360
you can receive

1159
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,360
your brother's kidney.

1160
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,040
Wait, so there's

1161
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,040
nothing at all

1162
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,040
that we can do?

1163
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,030
No, not as things

1164
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,030
currently stand.

1165
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,840
Even though

1166
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,840
I know the risk?

1167
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,070
Even though I want to do it?

1168
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,600
That's correct.

1169
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,340
It is illegal to

1170
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,340
give an infected organ

1171
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,340
to a noninfected recipient.

1172
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,820
That's the terrible irony,

1173
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,820
because if you

1174
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,820
already had HIV,

1175
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,480
the procedure

1176
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,480
would be legal.

1177
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,490
Now, obviously,

1178
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,490
we can't give you HIV.

1179
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,630
No, but...

1180
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,360
But he can.

1181
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,630
And you do have a choice.

1182
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,660
How's he doing?

1183
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,530
Gonna be off solid

1184
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,530
food for a while,

1185
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,530
could be a lot of scarring.

1186
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,070
We should know

1187
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,070
more in a few days.

1188
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,110
I guess he got his

1189
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,110
vacation after all.

1190
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,970
Yeah.

1191
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,310
I just can't believe

1192
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,310
I let him win.

1193
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,870
Really?

1194
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,610
Does this look

1195
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,610
like a win to you?

1196
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,780
He got what he wanted.

1197
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,350
So he's a patient

1198
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,350
who came here to be treated.

1199
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,140
That should have

1200
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,140
been your focus.

1201
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,210
Are you saying

1202
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,210
I should have let him

1203
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,210
have his way?

1204
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,520
You know,

1205
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,520
my grandfather used to say,

1206
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,530
"Never wrestle with a pig.

1207
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,300
"You both get dirty,

1208
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,300
but the pig likes it."

1209
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,770
She's going to be fine.

1210
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,770
Back to herself.

1211
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,150
Fortune favors the bold.

1212
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,520
Congratulations, Dr. Rhodes.

1213
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,690
Good night, Dr. Latham.

1214
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,080
Hey, Sox fan.

1215
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,300
Hey.

1216
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,940
Is it too late

1217
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,940
for those drinks?

1218
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,210
What about not

1219
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,210
upsetting my father?

1220
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,650
Why stop now?

1221
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,490
Okay.

1222
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,460
You need anything?

1223
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,460
Uh, no, I'm good.

1224
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,460
Thank you.

1225
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,940
Hey.

1226
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,010
This is a really

1227
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,010
great place.

1228
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,770
I love the breakfast nook.

1229
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,370
Yeah, thanks.

1230
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,370
Mmm-hmm.

1231
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,080
Are you feeling

1232
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,080
good about today?

1233
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,350
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1234
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,720
Good.

1235
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,880
Hey, everybody.

1236
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,950
Um, thank you

1237
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,950
so much for coming.

1238
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,960
Celebrating with the people

1239
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,960
who know Will and me best,

1240
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,230
it means a lot,

1241
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,000
but there is something that

1242
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,000
most of you may

1243
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,000
not know about Will.

1244
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,730
Uh, he's still got a lot

1245
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,730
of med school debt...

1246
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,340
But he paid part of his way

1247
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,340
through it by singing

1248
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,340
at Irish weddings.

1249
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,280
What?

1250
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,210
No, no.

1251
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,210
Come on.

1252
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,310
Come on.

1253
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,310
Yeah, you paying half

1254
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,310
the rent now, buddy.

1255
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,650
No, seriously.

1256
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,650
These people are

1257
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,650
trying to have a good time.

1258
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,850
Come on.

1259
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,150
Everybody wants you to.

1260
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,150
Just one song.

1261
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,450
Okay, Ms. Goodwin.

1262
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,260
One song. She's the boss.

1263
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,800
You guys think

1264
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,800
you're funny, don't you?

1265
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,190
I know

1266
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,190
we're funny.

1267
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,260
All right...

1268
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,110
Baby

1269
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,140
It's been a long day, baby

1270
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,180
Things ain't

1271
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,180
been goin' my way

1272
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,220
You know I need you here

1273
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,730
To ease my mind

1274
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,270
All of the time

1275
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,930
Baby

1276
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,510
The way you

1277
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,510
move me is crazy
