1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,130
So, here we go.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,630
What letter

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,630
are we up to now?

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,720
J's.

5
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,540
So, "Jeremiah" if it's a boy,

6
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,540
or "Jacinta" if it's a girl.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,170
Hmm.

8
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,170
Jeremiah Sexton-Jenkins.

9
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,300
I like it.

10
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,570
Oh, my God, it's a boy?

11
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,380
Or Jacinta Sexton Jenkins.

12
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,810
You're having fun

13
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,810
torturing me

14
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,820
by not telling me the gender

15
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,820
of the baby, aren't you?

16
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,580
A little, but hey,

17
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,580
if I can wait 21 more weeks,

18
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,020
so can you.

19
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,860
Dr. Rhodes?

20
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,390
Page me if you need me.

21
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,590
Case coming your way.

22
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,430
Window washer fell

23
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,430
33 stories.

24
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,330
Should be DOA,

25
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,330
but still alive, barely.

26
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,490
Thirty-three?

27
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,660
Press will be

28
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,660
all over this.

29
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,730
Hospital PR's

30
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,730
gonna be involved.

31
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,300
Get ready

32
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,300
for your close-up.

33
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,680
Okay, who's next?

34
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,340
Damian Butler.

35
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,010
Damian Butler?

36
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,010
That's me.

37
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,820
Oh, God.

38
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,820
Won't be

39
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,820
much longer.

40
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,290
I just have the flu.

41
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,290
It's low priority.

42
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,290
I get it.

43
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,580
Sir?

44
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,780
Maggie, how many

45
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,780
minutes out?

46
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,880
They're here.

47
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,620
Baghdad's prepped.

48
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,620
Thanks.

49
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,030
Justin Pepper, 23,

50
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,030
long fall,

51
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,490
axial load injury

52
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,870
after his window washing

53
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,870
platform gave out.

54
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,440
GCS 3. BP 70 over palp.

55
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,440
Heart rate 135.

56
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,570
All right, that long a fall,

57
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,570
we're looking at injuries

58
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,570
to the brain, spine,

59
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,910
chest, and abdomen,

60
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,910
let alone long bone fractures.

61
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,050
Maggie, I need extra hands

62
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,050
and an OR on alert.

63
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,380
Done.

64
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,880
What's he got

65
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,880
for IV access?

66
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,310
Sixteen gauge

67
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,310
on both arms.

68
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,020
All right,

69
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,020
very gently, everybody.

70
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,850
On my count,

71
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,850
one, two, three.

72
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,420
Good luck.

73
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,420
Thanks.

74
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,590
All right,

75
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,590
likely cavitary bleeding.

76
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,030
Wheeler, get a groin line.

77
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,030
Start the MTP.

78
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,930
Hang two units of O-Neg

79
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,930
on the rapid transfuser

80
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,930
until we type and cross.

81
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,940
X-rays... I need chest,

82
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,940
pelvis, and C-spine.

83
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,300
And let's get

84
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,300
the ultrasound over here

85
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,300
to FAST his belly.

86
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,270
Lungs are clear.

87
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,270
I'm gonna start

88
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,270
the groin line.

89
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,980
Help me reduce

90
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,980
this leg fracture.

91
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,080
Come on, come on.

92
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,080
One, two, three.

93
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,420
X-ray.

94
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,420
All right, step back.

95
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,060
Pelvis down.

96
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,690
C-spine.

97
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,690
On the box.

98
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,520
MALE X-RAY TECH:

99
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,520
Chest X-ray is up.

100
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,690
Tension hemopneumothorax.

101
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,840
Trachea shifted,

102
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,840
venous return is down.

103
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,840
Give me a chest tube.

104
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,060
Show me the pelvis.

105
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,060
Got it.

106
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,430
Vertical shear of

107
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,430
the left hemipelvis,

108
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,430
it needs traction.

109
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,340
Pull up the C-spine.

110
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,740
It's up.

111
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,840
Multiple C-spine fractures.

112
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,380
Wheeler, how's

113
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,380
that groin line?

114
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,380
Done.

115
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,350
All right, chest tube's

116
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,350
in, too. Let's move.

117
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,230
Justin didn't

118
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,230
survive a 330-foot fall

119
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,230
just to die in my trauma bay.

120
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,890
Let's go, let's go!

121
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,890
Go.

122
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,700
FEMALE NEWS REPORTER:

123
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,700
Witnesses report

124
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,700
that Mr. Pepper clung

125
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,210
to his window washing

126
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,210
platform as it fell,

127
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,540
almost riding it

128
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,540
like a surfboard.

129
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,010
Physicists surmise

130
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,010
this likely created

131
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,010
wind resistance

132
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,980
that not only

133
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,980
slowed his plummet,

134
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,620
but also absorbed

135
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,620
some of the force

136
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,620
from impact.

137
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,480
That might explain

138
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,480
how he survived

139
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,480
such a horrific fall.

140
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
I'm running the bowel.

141
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,260
Feeling tears. Hemostat.

142
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,930
Pelvic hematoma and

143
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,930
mesenteric bleeders

144
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,930
are tied off.

145
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,990
Let's resect the bowel

146
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,990
quickly and move on.

147
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,600
GIA 80 stapler with a reload.

148
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,670
50% of people

149
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,670
who fall four to five

150
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,670
stories die.

151
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,930
Ten or 11, it's almost 100%,

152
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,930
so this is a first.

153
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,970
There's an exception

154
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,970
to every rule.

155
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,510
All right, got some

156
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,510
more spaces.

157
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,510
Who's next?

158
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,250
Laura Pastino.

159
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,580
Laura Pastino?

160
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,620
No, Melody Sayers.

161
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,750
Okay, uh, treatment Three.

162
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,750
I'll be right there.

163
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,080
I'm sorry.

164
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,460
No, this one's on me.

165
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,320
I thought I could

166
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,320
sneak in and see

167
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,320
a doctor

168
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,390
on my lunch break.

169
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,270
It's bad planning.

170
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,260
Okay, I'm April.

171
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,260
Can I get you anything?

172
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,140
Water?

173
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,140
Snack from the meal cart?

174
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,770
No thanks.

175
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,770
Not much of an appetite.

176
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,410
If I need something,

177
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,410
I'll just...

178
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,650
Melody? Are you okay?

179
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,550
Yeah, sorry.

180
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,620
You just zoned out.

181
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,620
That ever happen before?

182
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,290
Probably.

183
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,650
I'm a first-year associate.

184
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,650
My law firm's specialty,

185
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,360
60-hour weeks.

186
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,590
Can I see your wrist?

187
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,160
Yeah.

188
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,800
Pulse is really weak.

189
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm just exhausted.

190
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm gonna go home

191
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
and sleep.

192
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,440
I'll come back tomorrow.

193
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,640
Your feet hurt?

194
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,050
Yeah, I've just been

195
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,050
sitting for a while.

196
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,580
Do you mind

197
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,580
if I take a look?

198
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,040
Sure.

199
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,790
Ankles are swollen.

200
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,290
Pitting edema.

201
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,090
Do me a favor.

202
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,220
Stick around for

203
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,220
a little longer.

204
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,390
I'm gonna get you in.

205
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,260
Okay.

206
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,960
Americano.

207
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,370
Thank you.

208
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,270
Wow, all this

209
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,270
for Connor's trauma?

210
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,210
If it bleeds, it leads.

211
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,680
Help! I need help!

212
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,680
My husband!

213
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,050
What happened?

214
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,050
He called

215
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,050
me at work.

216
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,990
He said he wasn't

217
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,990
feeling well, but then...

218
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,250
But when I came

219
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,250
home for lunch,

220
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,250
I found him like this.

221
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,000
Hey, hey, can you hear me?

222
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,000
Thready pulse, diaphoretic.

223
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,000
He's burning up.

224
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,620
Did he take any drugs?

225
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,620
Could it be an overdose?

226
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,360
No, never.

227
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,360
Septic shock?

228
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,760
I think so.

229
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,760
We gotta get him inside.

230
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,760
All right.

231
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,990
I'm gonna get techs

232
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,990
to bring out a gurney,

233
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,630
and set up for central

234
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,630
access if we need one.

235
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,660
I'm gonna help you

236
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,660
out of the car, okay?

237
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,500
No, get back.

238
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,500
I can do it myself.

239
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,700
No, Nick, let him help you.

240
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,170
Don't let him, please.

241
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,170
Easy.

242
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
Nick, please, no...

243
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,640
Julia, Julia,

244
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,700
I need your help.

245
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,080
I know, baby, I...

246
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,380
I'm sorry.

247
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,410
Okay, okay.

248
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,390
My legs don't work.

249
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,390
It's okay. I got you.

250
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,890
Here.

251
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,560
All right. Let's go.

252
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,470
Dr. Choi, you're going

253
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,470
to Treatment Five.

254
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,570
Dr. Manning's already there.

255
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,980
Thanks, Mags.

256
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,920
Dr. Reese?

257
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,150
Oh, my...

258
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,250
This woman needs aid.

259
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,920
Dr. Wheeler!

260
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,920
I saw her fall

261
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,920
crossing the street.

262
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,460
When I got to her,

263
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,460
she was unable to speak.

264
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,760
I think she's

265
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,760
having a stroke.

266
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,960
Treatment Two.

267
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,070
Weak pulse, right side

268
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,070
of the face is droopy.

269
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,970
Right side body, limp.

270
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,970
What do we got?

271
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,170
Possible stroke.

272
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,610
Okay. Thanks, Superdude.

273
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,510
You're safe now, ma'am.

274
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Oh, Lord.

275
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,160
We need a stretcher!

276
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,990
Right now,

277
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,990
your son is in shock.

278
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,430
There is massive blood loss

279
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,430
from extensive injuries

280
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,530
to his liver, his pelvis,

281
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,530
his intestines.

282
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,030
We've packed his abdomen

283
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,200
to control the bleeding

284
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,200
and removed a portion

285
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,200
of his bowel.

286
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,240
He's still open.

287
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,840
That's what we call

288
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,840
a negative pressure dressing.

289
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,980
It helps to temporize

290
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,980
the abdomen...

291
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,920
Is Justin

292
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,920
going to survive?

293
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,180
When he arrived in the ED,

294
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,180
he was minute-to-minute.

295
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,490
Right now, he is hour-to-hour,

296
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,490
and that is a very good

297
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,490
first step.

298
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,700
This is Dr. Rhodes.

299
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,430
Who is this,

300
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,430
and how did you

301
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,430
get this number?

302
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,830
No, my patient is very

303
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,830
much alive, thank you.

304
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,170
Sounds like the press

305
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,170
got to you before we did.

306
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,950
Dr. Connor Rhodes,

307
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,950
this is Evelyn Kumer,

308
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,910
public affairs rep

309
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,910
for the hospital.

310
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,380
She'll be coordinating

311
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,380
all media platforms.

312
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,120
So, reporters

313
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,120
got your number?

314
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,090
Yeah, they wanted to

315
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,090
know if Justin had died

316
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,090
on the operating table.

317
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,280
Where do they get this crap?

318
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,790
Who knows?

319
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,790
But the rumor

320
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,790
mill is grinding.

321
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,290
And you're

322
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,290
in the spotlight.

323
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,090
A man falls 33 stories

324
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,090
and is still alive?

325
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,530
People are gonna want to know,

326
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,530
is this a miracle or

327
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,530
a setup for tragedy?

328
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Excuse me.

329
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,160
Until we know for sure

330
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,160
how this is gonna turn out,

331
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,870
let's stick with

332
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,870
"no comment."

333
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,210
102.7.

334
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,220
BP, 80 over 55.

335
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,220
Whoa, that's really low.

336
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,050
Uh, Melody, I hear

337
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,050
a crackling in your chest.

338
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,960
This means fluid is

339
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,960
building up in the lungs.

340
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,620
A symptom of the flu?

341
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,120
I don't think so.

342
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,190
The exhaustion,

343
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,190
swelling in your legs,

344
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,190
low blood pressure,

345
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,390
are possible indicators

346
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,390
of a cardiac problem.

347
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,830
My heart? Oh, my God.

348
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,460
We're gonna take a look

349
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,460
and see what's going on, okay?

350
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,410
Okay.

351
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,200
That just doesn't

352
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,200
make any sense.

353
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,200
I'm only 25 years old.

354
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,640
I walk to work

355
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,640
instead of taking the train.

356
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,010
Eat salads.

357
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,010
Take spin classes.

358
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,850
Okay, dilated left ventricle,

359
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,850
poor wall motion.

360
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,150
April, let's get her

361
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,150
on the monitor.

362
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,980
Your heart is

363
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,980
pumping very poorly.

364
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,820
Uh, I'll need an echo,

365
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,820
but if I had to say,

366
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,790
I'd guess it's

367
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,790
working at 20, 25%.

368
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,560
My heart is failing?

369
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,250
It's unusual

370
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,250
for a young woman.

371
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,060
Could be a thyroid imbalance,

372
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,060
a kidney issue, virus.

373
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,290
We'll figure it out.

374
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,100
Before you know it,

375
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,100
you'll be back at spin class.

376
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,430
I'm gonna hold you to that.

377
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,630
Melody? Melody?

378
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,810
No pulse or breathing.

379
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,810
V-fib, get on her chest.

380
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,450
Charge to 200.

381
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,450
Two hundred.

382
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,320
Charged.

383
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,320
Hold CPR.

384
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,930
Clear.

385
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,420
Two hundred again.

386
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,590
Two hundred.

387
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,500
Hold CPR. Clear.

388
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,740
I got a pulse.

389
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,740
It's weak, but steady.

390
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,740
She's breathing.

391
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,280
Let's get her

392
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,280
to the cath lab.

393
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,880
Great catch, April.

394
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,880
Had she gone home,

395
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,680
no way help would've

396
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,680
gotten to her in time.

397
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,560
So, it's an infection?

398
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,560
Fever, elevated white cells,

399
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,260
inflammatory markers

400
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,260
and lactating.

401
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,260
I'd say so.

402
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,730
Most likely a UTI.

403
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,730
It's common in paraplegics.

404
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Been down that

405
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
road a few times.

406
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Life with a catheter, right?

407
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,600
We may need

408
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,600
to replace it.

409
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,600
Suprapubic?

410
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,740
T-boned by a drunk driver

411
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,740
who didn't stop

412
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,740
for a red light.

413
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,480
He walked away

414
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,480
with a few stitches.

415
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,480
That was then.

416
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,120
We're moving on.

417
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,120
Brighter days ahead.

418
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,720
Area around

419
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,720
the catheter looks clean.

420
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,880
No obvious abscess

421
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,880
or skin infection.

422
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,150
Answer's

423
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,150
in the pee then.

424
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,390
We'll get this and blood

425
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,390
cultures up to the lab,

426
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,790
find out what

427
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,790
we're dealing with.

428
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,430
Sorry about

429
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,430
lashing out earlier.

430
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,820
I sometimes forget

431
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,820
I'm half a man.

432
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,620
No, you're not.

433
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
I'm with her.

434
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,970
Yeah, well,

435
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,970
she's one of a kind.

436
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,230
Not letting her get away.

437
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,700
Good plan.

438
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,150
Hey, K.

439
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,310
If it's a boy, "Kalani."

440
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,380
If it's a girl,

441
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,380
"Kiersleigh."

442
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,920
What do you think?

443
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,920
Pass.

444
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,140
Ugh!

445
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,910
Any word from

446
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,910
the cath lab about Melody?

447
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,920
No, but I should

448
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,920
hear something soon.

449
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,390
Okay,

450
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,390
I have an OB appointment.

451
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,260
Should be fast, though,

452
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,260
20 minutes, tops.

453
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,350
I can push it.

454
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,630
Or I can text you

455
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,630
if I hear something.

456
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,930
Because of the TB,

457
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,930
Dr. Lee likes to see

458
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,930
me every two weeks.

459
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,070
Though, text me

460
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,070
about Melody.

461
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,070
Mmm-hmm.

462
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,860
Now, go. Don't be late

463
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,860
for your appointment.

464
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,970
We haven't officially met.

465
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,970
I'm Dr. Reese.

466
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,880
Hi. Edward Thompson.

467
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,840
That was quite

468
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,840
an entrance, Edward.

469
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,010
Yeah, I can imagine.

470
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,280
The suit, elderly

471
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,280
woman in my arms.

472
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,280
Yeah.

473
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,350
How is she?

474
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,350
Uh, doing well.

475
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,190
Thanks to you getting

476
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,190
her here so quickly.

477
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,190
Oh, that's great.

478
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,060
How are you?

479
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,060
How are you feeling?

480
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,360
Okay, I think.

481
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,130
But I never passed out before.

482
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,130
What happened?

483
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,990
Uh, your labs

484
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,990
and EKG are normal.

485
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,770
So, I think you were just

486
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,770
so excited in the moment

487
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,330
that when it was over,

488
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,330
you fainted.

489
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,800
And where are my clothes?

490
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,800
A nurse said she'd get 'em,

491
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,800
but she never came back.

492
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,500
Unfortunately, we had

493
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,500
to cut off the costume,

494
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,500
so that we could examine you.

495
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,880
Cut it off?

496
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,050
You mean, it's destroyed?

497
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,290
Uh, yes.

498
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,290
Oh, God.

499
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,490
You had no right.

500
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
I need it.

501
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
Edward, breathe.

502
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
Breathe.

503
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,990
All right, nice and...

504
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,990
All right.

505
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,700
Hey, look at me,

506
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,700
look at me.

507
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,810
Just like this.

508
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,810
Two seconds in.

509
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,770
Four seconds out.

510
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,340
Two seconds in.

511
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,340
Four seconds out.

512
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,450
I need it.

513
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,690
Thirty-three stories. God.

514
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,100
Massive subdural hemorrhage.

515
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,100
Significant left shift.

516
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,830
Big mass effect is

517
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,830
crushing his brain

518
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,830
inside of his skull.

519
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,960
Well, he did fall

520
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,960
off a building.

521
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,540
Craniotomy, right?

522
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,540
To what end?

523
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,540
He's coagulopathic.

524
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,840
I go in and take out the clot,

525
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,840
it'll just re-accumulate.

526
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,980
No, I don't think so.

527
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,980
I'm actively giving him

528
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,980
plasma, platelets, and cryo.

529
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,920
Which improve

530
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,920
his overall chances of

531
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,920
survival from 1% to 2.

532
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,180
I'm not opening up

533
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,180
his skull.

534
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,520
I question whether he's even

535
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,520
strong enough for this CT,

536
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,390
but that was your call.

537
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,330
If the pressure in his brain

538
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,330
isn't relieved, it's over.

539
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,790
That's 100%.

540
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,790
I got him this far.

541
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,790
He'll get through surgery.

542
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,670
All the king's horses

543
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,670
and all the king's men,

544
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,600
guess they should've

545
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,600
gone to you.

546
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,710
Full costume?

547
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,710
Cape and all.

548
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,410
When Edward learned

549
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,410
it had been destroyed,

550
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,480
he was so distraught,

551
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,480
he could hardly even breathe.

552
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,410
That's a pretty

553
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,410
extreme reaction,

554
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,480
but, you know,

555
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,480
wardrobe and self-esteem

556
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,480
can be deeply intertwined.

557
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,990
The costume, ultimately,

558
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,990
it's just a symbol

559
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,360
that represents something

560
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,360
crucially important to Edward.

561
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,260
Our job's

562
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,260
to figure out what.

563
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,240
The inciting incident

564
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,240
that made it necessary,

565
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,240
the origin story.

566
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,030
You know, because we're

567
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,030
talking about a superhero.

568
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,030
Mmm-hmm.

569
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,210
Like when Tony Stark

570
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,210
became Iron Man.

571
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,580
Why did Billy Batson

572
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,580
become Captain Marvel?

573
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,150
Nice. Pickle.

574
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,320
Urinalysis is clean,

575
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,320
so your infection

576
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,320
isn't from a UTI.

577
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,950
Clear.

578
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,000
Not pneumonia.

579
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,000
Meds?

580
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,230
Aspirin, midodrine,

581
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,230
tramadol.

582
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,570
No steroids,

583
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,570
immunosuppressants.

584
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,570
No red flags.

585
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,500
I'll check the D-dimer.

586
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,500
It could be a DVT.

587
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,500
Yeah.

588
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,910
Deep vein thrombosis?

589
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,870
D-dimer's negative.

590
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,870
No clots.

591
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,670
Abscess then.

592
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,670
The hot spot

593
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,670
would be the sacrum.

594
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,850
I can't...

595
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,850
Yeah, I got you.

596
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,020
Nothing dermal.

597
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,060
It must be hiding

598
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,060
deep down.

599
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,990
The scar...

600
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm thinking of getting

601
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,000
a tattoo to cover it.

602
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,770
He and she stick

603
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,770
figures riding Pops.

604
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,400
It's a surf spot

605
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,400
in Waikiki.

606
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,430
We took a lesson

607
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,430
on our honeymoon.

608
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,430
We stood up on our first wave.

609
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,280
Did you feel something?

610
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,420
Um, I don't know. Maybe.

611
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,130
Let's get a CT chest,

612
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,130
pelvis and abdomen.

613
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,570
Infection may be abdominal

614
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,570
or in a deep space.

615
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,270
Yeah. Hang tight.

616
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,170
We're getting closer.

617
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,170
We'll be back.

618
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,170
You felt that?

619
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,150
Good hemostasis.

620
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,150
No new bleeds.

621
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,780
He tolerated

622
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,780
the surgery well.

623
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,020
Appears luck's

624
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,020
on your side today.

625
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,930
If that's how

626
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,930
you wanna put it.

627
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,130
There's no heartbeat.

628
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,130
No.

629
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,100
No, no, please. Look again.

630
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,940
I'm so sorry.

631
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,940
No.

632
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,540
You'll need a D&C.

633
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,540
If there's a room available,

634
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,540
I can do it now.

635
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,800
Okay.

636
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,570
I need to get back to work.

637
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,540
April, no one would

638
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,540
expect you to...

639
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,540
I have to. I...

640
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,880
There's a patient

641
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,880
I'm worried about.

642
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,290
Are you sure?

643
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,050
Okay.

644
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,720
Well, you know

645
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,720
the nurses up there.

646
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,260
You just give them

647
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,260
a call when you're ready.

648
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,490
The sooner the better,

649
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,490
though.

650
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,930
End of the day.

651
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,270
Tomorrow at the latest.

652
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,040
Hey, April.

653
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,310
Cardiology make

654
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,310
a diagnosis?

655
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,640
Viral myocarditis.

656
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,850
She's only in the ED

657
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,850
until a bed opens up

658
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,850
in the CCU.

659
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,920
She needs

660
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,920
cardiopulmonary support.

661
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,920
Infection's that bad?

662
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,720
Well,

663
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,720
the hope is partial bypass

664
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,720
will rest her heart enough

665
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,630
to let the antiviral

666
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,630
meds get the upper hand.

667
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,060
That's doing most

668
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,060
of my heart's job now.

669
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,100
I know.

670
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,370
It's hard to keep

671
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,370
your mind from racing

672
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,370
to that dark place.

673
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,550
Is there anyone I can call?

674
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,550
A family?

675
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,510
My parents are divorced.

676
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,980
Mom's in Idaho.

677
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,980
Dad's in New Hampshire.

678
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,450
I'm not ready to

679
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,450
deal with all that yet.

680
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,790
But I don't wanna be alone.

681
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,830
Will you sit with me?

682
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,760
As long as you need.

683
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,280
Thank you.

684
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,290
What was her name?

685
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,290
Rachel. Way out of my league.

686
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,230
I've always

687
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,230
been the quiet one.

688
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,230
She was the opposite.

689
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,930
I rode her coattails,

690
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,930
yet she still loved me.

691
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,240
And then it was over.

692
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,240
My wife was gone.

693
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,410
When did Rachel pass?

694
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,170
Last year,

695
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,170
ovarian cancer.

696
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,980
It took her so fast.

697
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,590
I couldn't help her.

698
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,890
I couldn't ease her pain.

699
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,290
I could only watch.

700
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,970
I was useless, weak.

701
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,530
And the suit?

702
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,530
Stumbled across it online.

703
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,160
I don't know

704
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,160
why I ordered it.

705
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,840
But when it came,

706
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,840
I tried it on,

707
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,610
and I felt different,

708
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,610
stronger.

709
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,840
I just want to be useful.

710
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,550
I just wanna be able to help.

711
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,920
I understand. Uh...

712
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,590
We'll come up with a plan.

713
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,590
Let me talk to my supervisor.

714
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,000
Hey, how was

715
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,000
your ultrasound?

716
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,600
It was fine. I was just

717
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,600
thinking about Melody.

718
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,140
She thought she

719
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,140
only had the flu.

720
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,140
Yeah.

721
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,630
Okay.

722
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,770
Hey, walk with me.

723
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,770
The CPS working?

724
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,080
A-line pulsatility

725
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,080
is decreasing.

726
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,050
Heart's beating less

727
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,050
and less on its own.

728
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,450
But it's only

729
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,450
been a few hours.

730
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,680
The meds need a while

731
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,680
to build in her system.

732
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,650
And we can't

733
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,650
speed up the process?

734
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,060
We can?

735
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,230
IVIG and plasmapheresis.

736
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,320
It's method to block

737
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,320
Melody's immune system

738
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,100
from attacking heart muscle

739
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,100
as it tries to clear

740
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,100
the infection.

741
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,600
Well, why aren't

742
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,600
we doing it?

743
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,600
The science is unproven.

744
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,910
The unknowns worry me.

745
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,370
The risk of anaphylaxis,

746
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,370
additional infections,

747
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,880
inflammatory side effects.

748
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,270
Will, she already coded.

749
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,940
Another one could be

750
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,940
right around the corner.

751
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,510
Isn't it worth

752
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,510
trying anything?

753
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,240
Not if it does

754
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,240
more harm than good.

755
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,260
Yes, and the suit

756
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,260
was how Edward dealt

757
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,260
with his wife's death.

758
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,180
See, I'm concerned

759
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,180
that if he leaves,

760
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,450
he's just gonna

761
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,450
go get another one,

762
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,260
and that will lead

763
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,260
him right back here.

764
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,030
Some knucklehead will

765
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,030
see him in that costume

766
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,030
and pick a fight.

767
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,100
"Let's see how tough

768
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,100
you are, super-guy."

769
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,630
Hmm. It's possible,

770
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,630
but is he having

771
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,630
any suicidal thoughts?

772
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,500
No.

773
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,500
And he's certainly

774
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,500
not a danger to others.

775
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,910
He literally presented

776
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,910
saving a woman's life.

777
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,640
I mean, he just doesn't

778
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,640
meet the criteria for

779
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,640
a psychiatric hold.

780
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,980
Okay.

781
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,080
There you go.

782
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,080
Thank you.

783
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,590
Dr. Rhodes?

784
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,590
Dr. Rhodes, wait.

785
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,250
Can you tell us about

786
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,250
the miracle patient,

787
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,250
Justin Pepper?

788
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,990
Please, anything.

789
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,660
MALE NEWS REPORTER:

790
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,660
The people want to know.

791
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Well, uh the craniotomy

792
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,890
we performed was successful.

793
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,840
Uh, his blood pressure

794
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,840
is steady.

795
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,740
The bleeding in his chest

796
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,740
and belly has slowed.

797
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,500
So, fortunately,

798
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,200
we've been able to back off

799
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,200
of the transfusions.

800
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,710
Is he gonna pull through?

801
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,110
Well, it is still

802
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,110
too early to tell,

803
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,810
but we are fighting

804
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,810
the good fight.

805
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,910
Now, if all continues

806
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,910
to go well,

807
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,050
Ortho will be able

808
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,050
to start treating

809
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,050
his bone fractures tomorrow.

810
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,590
Now, if you'll excuse me,

811
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,590
I've got to get back

812
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,590
to my patient.

813
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,490
What the hell was that?

814
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,230
My patient's doing well.

815
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,230
I didn't see why

816
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,230
the press shouldn't know.

817
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,870
Any interaction

818
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,870
with the media

819
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,870
goes through me.

820
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,030
I wouldn't have

821
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,030
let you come out here

822
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,030
and grandstand like that.

823
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,630
What if the patient dies?

824
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,040
You gonna hold

825
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,040
a press conference then?

826
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,750
Hey.

827
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,750
Thoracic hardware's

828
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,750
stabilizing the spine

829
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,750
around the T4 fracture.

830
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,980
Otherwise,

831
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,980
everything looks normal.

832
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,040
Colon has descended.

833
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,850
It could be a colonic

834
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,850
pseudo-obstruction.

835
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,150
They are common

836
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,150
in paraplegics.

837
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,790
Yeah, but I don't see

838
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,790
any free air or fluid.

839
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,560
Hmm, the infection's gotta

840
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,560
be hiding somewhere.

841
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,790
Let's try a white

842
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,790
blood cell scan.

843
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,770
Tag some of his own

844
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,770
infection-fighting cells

845
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,560
with a tracer dye,

846
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,560
and see where they go.

847
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,040
Let his immune system show us

848
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,040
where the hot spot is.

849
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,000
Good idea. I'll get on it.

850
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,000
Hey, Nat.

851
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,200
Yeah?

852
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,640
When I pressed

853
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,640
on Nick's abdomen,

854
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,410
I was below

855
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,410
a sensory loss level.

856
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,910
He shouldn't

857
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,910
have felt anything.

858
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,670
His abdominal

859
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,670
wall is inflamed.

860
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,580
When you applied pressure,

861
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,580
it fired off a signal.

862
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,350
If anything,

863
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,350
Nick felt nausea,

864
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,350
but nothing tactile.

865
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,150
He couldn't have.

866
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,720
Yeah, I guess not.

867
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,400
103.5.

868
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,460
It's gone up.

869
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,670
What about my heart?

870
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,670
Improvement?

871
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,870
Unfortunately,

872
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,870
it's not responding

873
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,870
the way I'd hoped.

874
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,340
I googled "myocarditis."

875
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,040
Severe cases,

876
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,040
people needed

877
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,040
heart transplants.

878
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,520
Am I one of them?

879
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,810
Possibly.

880
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,650
But we're not there yet.

881
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,650
There is another

882
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,650
procedure we can try,

883
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,460
IVIG and plasmapheresis.

884
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,360
But I have to warn you,

885
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,360
there are some risks.

886
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,700
What do you think?

887
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,570
If your heart

888
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,570
stops beating again,

889
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,570
it may never come back.

890
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:22,010
This procedure,

891
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:22,010
is it an operation?

892
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,750
No, an infusion.

893
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,450
It can be done right here

894
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,450
in the treatment room.

895
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,350
I'll be with you

896
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,350
the whole time.

897
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,660
Okay.

898
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,060
Okay.

899
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,200
Gram-negative bacteria?

900
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,200
What is that?

901
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,900
It's a common germ found

902
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,900
in water, soil, plants,

903
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,010
the digestive tract,

904
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,010
sometimes the skin.

905
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,540
They don't always

906
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,540
lead to illness,

907
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,900
but when they invade somewhere

908
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,900
they are not endemic to,

909
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,040
you can get pretty sick.

910
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,080
So, what did

911
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,080
these germs get into?

912
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,780
The muscles

913
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,780
surrounding your spine.

914
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,720
There's an abscess

915
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,720
at the T4 vertebrae.

916
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,680
Is it treatable?

917
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,680
Yes.

918
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,490
A surgeon will make

919
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,490
an incision in your

920
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,490
back and drain it.

921
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,990
The hardware may need

922
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,990
to come out as well.

923
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,390
We'll do it today.

924
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,390
You'll likely feel

925
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,390
better immediately.

926
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,030
We're good, babe.

927
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,030
We're all good.

928
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,930
There is something

929
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,930
else, though.

930
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,360
In addition to the bacteria,

931
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,230
the biopsy showed

932
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,230
a cluster of cells

933
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,930
that are not native to

934
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,930
the paraspinal muscles.

935
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,900
The lab is still

936
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,900
trying to figure out

937
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,900
exactly what these cells are,

938
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,610
but they shouldn't

939
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,610
be there, nor do they...

940
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,980
They come from my body.

941
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,880
So, what are you

942
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,880
guys not telling us?

943
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,640
They're stem cells.

944
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,220
We've been going to Mexico

945
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,220
to get injections to

946
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,220
reverse the paralysis.

947
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,090
I'm gonna walk again.

948
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,600
I know that look.

949
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,600
You think we're crazy.

950
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,770
Abandon

951
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,770
a state-of-the-art hospital

952
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,770
for a clinic in Veracruz,

953
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,200
but what Nick needs,

954
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,200
we can't find here.

955
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,170
And between the FDA

956
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,170
and constantly

957
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,170
changing politics

958
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,600
and social taboos,

959
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,600
we just...

960
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,770
But leaving the country?

961
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,770
There is no oversight.

962
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,410
The bacteria that

963
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,410
caused your abscess

964
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,410
likely came from a treatment.

965
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,980
To ditch the wheelchair,

966
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,980
it's worth it.

967
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,180
You touched Nick's abdomen,

968
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,180
and he felt it.

969
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,450
He felt it.

970
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,650
I'm gonna walk again.

971
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,590
And Julia and I

972
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,590
are gonna get back

973
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,060
to the life

974
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,060
that we dreamed of.

975
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,560
The one that she deserves.

976
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,920
Okay.

977
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,370
We'll set up the surgery

978
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,370
to have the abscess drained,

979
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,060
then go from there.

980
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,670
Okay.

981
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,420
Sir, is everything okay?

982
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,720
Nurse? Somebody?

983
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,120
Oh, my God.

984
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,230
Uh, breathe, sir. Breathe.

985
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,820
Breathe.

986
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,820
Look at me, look at me.

987
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,130
Two seconds in,

988
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,130
four seconds out. Slowly.

989
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,400
I need some help!

990
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,700
Here, here, here.

991
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,700
What happened?

992
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,040
Uh, he suddenly

993
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,040
grabbed his chest.

994
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,040
He was short of breath.

995
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,080
All right, possible MI.

996
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,140
We gotta move.

997
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,280
Thank you.

998
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,050
Edward, are you okay?

999
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,440
Yeah, I think.

1000
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,440
Uh, he needed help.

1001
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,490
Okay, well, I saw.

1002
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,490
You saved him.

1003
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,390
And look,

1004
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,390
in a hospital gown, no less.

1005
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,530
Let me help you

1006
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,530
back to bed.

1007
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,470
What's happening?

1008
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,510
Asystole. Crash cart

1009
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,510
and a chest tray.

1010
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,510
Got it.

1011
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,120
Take over compressions.

1012
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,750
Scalpels?

1013
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,750
You're operating here?

1014
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,180
There's no electrical

1015
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,180
activity in the heart,

1016
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,180
so I can't shock it back.

1017
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,660
Internal CPR is

1018
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,660
my only option.

1019
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,960
Oh, my God.

1020
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,400
All right.

1021
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,540
Come on, beat.

1022
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,840
Amp of epi.

1023
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,840
One amp.

1024
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,060
Come on.

1025
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,940
All right, we've got a rhythm.

1026
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,130
He's back. He's back.

1027
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,800
Quite a turnaround.

1028
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,800
I know, right?

1029
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,400
I was worried I wouldn't

1030
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,400
be able to pull it off

1031
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,740
as smoothly as you,

1032
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,740
but it worked out.

1033
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,870
It's a new

1034
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,870
world for Edward.

1035
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,870
Is it?

1036
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,010
Deception breaks

1037
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,010
doctor-patient trust.

1038
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,480
We don't manipulate.

1039
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,480
We guide.

1040
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,390
Your ruse provided Edward

1041
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,390
with a moment of revelation,

1042
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,920
not the framework

1043
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,920
to build his future on.

1044
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,400
I mean, trust me,

1045
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,400
the costume is not

1046
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,400
yet a thing of his past.

1047
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,440
Okay, discharge

1048
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,440
papers for Edward.

1049
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,540
I'm gonna need

1050
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,540
a little more time.

1051
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,610
Oh. Okay.

1052
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,950
He feels cold.

1053
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,520
His blood pressure

1054
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,520
is very low.

1055
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,120
We're pushing meds,

1056
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,130
but his heart is

1057
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,130
really struggling

1058
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,820
to circulate blood

1059
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,820
through his body.

1060
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,100
Justin is a climber.

1061
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,900
He always has been.

1062
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,390
Wow.

1063
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,310
A few years ago,

1064
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,310
he realized that rock

1065
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,310
faces weren't enough.

1066
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,870
Oh, he loved his life.

1067
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,750
It's not over.

1068
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,450
But his heart will

1069
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,450
fail again, won't it?

1070
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,260
If it does, I'll restart it.

1071
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,260
I'll keep restarting it.

1072
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,720
That last resuscitation

1073
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,720
was so violent.

1074
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,130
Your son still has a chance.

1075
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,130
Does he?

1076
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,860
Please, no more heroics.

1077
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,520
Dr. Rhodes, I admit,

1078
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,520
I wanted you to

1079
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,520
be the hero today.

1080
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,620
And I know you did, too.

1081
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,550
But maybe it's time

1082
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,550
to stop.

1083
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,940
Hey.

1084
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,470
Got an update from

1085
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,470
the neurosurgical floor.

1086
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,470
They just got started on Nick.

1087
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,380
These foreign clinics,

1088
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,380
$30,000 a treatment,

1089
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,380
sometimes more.

1090
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,940
The stem cells are shipped in

1091
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,940
from all over the world.

1092
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,540
There's no way to prove

1093
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,540
they're even authentic,

1094
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,990
and the success

1095
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,990
rates on their websites,

1096
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,990
totally unverifiable.

1097
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,490
Scary, I know. But still,

1098
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,490
stem cell research

1099
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,490
is making huge leaps.

1100
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,020
Yeah, maybe for

1101
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,020
neurodegenerative diseases.

1102
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,920
But spinal cord

1103
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,920
injuries like Nick's?

1104
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,920
That tech is years away.

1105
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,830
Yeah.

1106
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,570
Just give me a second.

1107
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,100
Will, Will,

1108
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,100
I need you in here.

1109
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,340
All right, I gotta go.

1110
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,950
Melody's A-line

1111
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,950
pulsatility is fluctuating.

1112
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,750
This just start?

1113
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,350
A couple minutes ago.

1114
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,450
Is my heart getting worse?

1115
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,300
Uh. No, better.

1116
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,200
101. Your temp's gone down.

1117
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,200
It means your body's

1118
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,200
starting to fight back.

1119
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,970
I'm gonna be okay?

1120
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,640
Well, we'll get

1121
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,640
another blood test,

1122
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,670
and if your white cell count

1123
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,670
has improved as well,

1124
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,640
and your heart

1125
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,640
continues to strengthen,

1126
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,940
then I'll dial

1127
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,940
down the support.

1128
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,950
Oh, my God.

1129
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,510
Oh, God,

1130
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,510
I thought for sure...

1131
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,950
Thank you, April.

1132
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,820
You saved my life.

1133
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,250
Phew!

1134
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,320
Oh, God, I was so scared.

1135
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,660
You're good.

1136
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,900
I should call my parents.

1137
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,600
Of course.

1138
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,710
Yeah, I gotta say,

1139
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,710
I did not expect IVIG

1140
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,610
and plasmapheresis

1141
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,610
to be so effective,

1142
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,280
let alone that quickly.

1143
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,980
You know, maybe

1144
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,980
coupling it with the CPS...

1145
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,710
Or perhaps, you know,

1146
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,090
maybe the meds just finally

1147
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,090
worked on their own.

1148
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,180
You know what?

1149
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,180
Who cares. It worked.

1150
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,450
Yeah.

1151
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,450
Yeah?

1152
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,220
We got the win.

1153
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,660
Yeah.

1154
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,650
You don't seem excited.

1155
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,470
No, I am.

1156
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,390
It's just a long day.

1157
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,190
Yeah, but a good one.

1158
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,190
Nice job.

1159
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,700
Neurosurgeon said

1160
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,700
everything went well.

1161
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,770
I feel much better.

1162
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,770
It's like night and day.

1163
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,970
Mind if I take a look?

1164
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,350
All good back there?

1165
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,920
Yeah. No surprises.

1166
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,550
Great. Ready to

1167
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,550
put today behind me.

1168
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,290
No pun intended.

1169
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,130
Nick, when I was

1170
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,130
examining your abdomen,

1171
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,200
you thought you

1172
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,200
felt something.

1173
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,070
You didn't, did you?

1174
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,220
Just my wife's eyes

1175
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,220
desperately wishing I could.

1176
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,280
These treatments

1177
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,280
you're getting in Mexico,

1178
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,280
they're not working.

1179
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,480
And given your injury,

1180
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,480
the chances

1181
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,650
of paralysis being

1182
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,650
reversed is almost zero.

1183
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,050
I can't give up.

1184
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,390
Stem cells can turn

1185
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,390
into any part of the body.

1186
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,030
Instead of curing you,

1187
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,030
they could form

1188
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,030
a mass or a tumor.

1189
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,820
Please, don't get

1190
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,820
any more injections.

1191
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,260
I have to.

1192
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,800
I love Julia

1193
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,800
more than anything,

1194
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,440
but there are intimacies

1195
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,440
that I can't provide.

1196
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,010
Our bond is built on hope.

1197
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,010
It's what holds us together.

1198
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,150
So, it doesn't

1199
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,150
matter if you believe

1200
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,150
the treatments won't work.

1201
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,240
Julia does.

1202
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,240
That's enough for me.

1203
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,720
But you're risking

1204
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,720
your life.

1205
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,390
She is my life.

1206
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,180
I don't want you to share

1207
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,180
your concerns with her.

1208
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,330
Okay.

1209
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,000
Good luck.

1210
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,170
Good luck?

1211
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,170
Ethan, are you kidding?

1212
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,070
Nat, I've met combat vets

1213
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,070
who have been paralyzed.

1214
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,870
The feelings of inferiority

1215
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,870
can be overwhelming.

1216
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,750
If you told them

1217
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,750
a bottle of snake oil

1218
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,750
might help them walk again,

1219
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,310
they'd drink it every time.

1220
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,150
So, you agree with

1221
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,150
what Nick's doing?

1222
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,790
I understand it, Nat.

1223
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,490
It wasn't real.

1224
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:24,100
The situation was staged,

1225
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:24,100
but your response

1226
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:24,100
was absolutely real.

1227
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,270
But I shouldn't

1228
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,270
have tricked you.

1229
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,540
I thought building

1230
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,540
you up from the inside

1231
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,540
would help you

1232
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,540
connect to your true self,

1233
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,640
but I realize now

1234
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,640
you've always known

1235
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,640
exactly who you are.

1236
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,180
The real goal is making sure

1237
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,180
others can see that.

1238
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,350
What's that?

1239
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,350
A hospital volunteer vest.

1240
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,290
I know it's not as flashy

1241
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,290
as your other outfit,

1242
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,330
but around here,

1243
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,330
there are a lot

1244
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,330
of people in need.

1245
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,330
Seeing you in this,

1246
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,170
they'll know you're someone

1247
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,170
they can depend on.

1248
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,300
Someone who can help them.

1249
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,040
Think about it.

1250
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,070
Hey.

1251
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,840
Surgery?

1252
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,770
I have Procedure

1253
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,770
Room Three open.

1254
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,740
I'll schedule you in.

1255
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,740
Come on up.

1256
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,040
April?

1257
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,640
April.

1258
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,650
I saw your name on

1259
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,650
the list for a D&C.

1260
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,700
It was my ultrasound.

1261
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,920
There wasn't...

1262
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,600
I don't know when.

1263
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,640
I don't know why.

1264
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,520
My baby's heart...

1265
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,420
It stopped...

1266
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,420
It's okay.

1267
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,220
It stopped beating.
