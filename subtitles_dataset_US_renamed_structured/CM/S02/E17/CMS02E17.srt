1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,020
Well, lunch, 1:00?

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,020
12:30.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,800
Oh, yeah, right. Hey.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,910
Morning.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,910
Hey.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,540
Morning, Dr. Halstead.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,540
Good morning.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,250
Wait, wait, wait.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,780
Dr. Wheeler,

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,780
you got one in Three.

12
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,820
Be there in a minute.

13
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,820
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

14
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,750
Morning, Jeff.

15
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,750
Hey, man.

16
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,820
This is obviously

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,820
a tremendous shock.

18
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,560
Dr. Wheeler was one of us.

19
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,750
And the burden of processing

20
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,750
all that has happened

21
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,930
will be a long

22
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,930
and difficult one.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,400
So, there would be

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,400
no judgment on anyone

25
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,000
who would prefer

26
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,000
not to be here today.

27
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,910
At times like this,

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,910
talking about anything,

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,070
even the weather,

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,070
never hurt anyone.

31
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,880
So my colleague,

32
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,880
Dr. Richardson,

33
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,380
has made herself

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,380
available all day.

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,880
She'll be up in her office,

36
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,880
if anybody wants to stop by.

37
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,980
Okay?

38
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,680
All right, thank you.

39
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,160
Ms. Goodwin.

40
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,160
In my experience, the key

41
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,990
to maintaining

42
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,990
morale in times like this,

43
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,890
is to keep things

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,890
running smoothly.

45
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,890
Of course.

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,230
Okay if I take Dr. Reese

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,230
to fill in for the day?

48
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,390
Dr. Charles?

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,630
Sure.

50
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,500
Thank you.

51
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,740
Maggie, waiting room's full.

52
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,740
Let's keep them moving.

53
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,470
Trying, Dr. Choi.

54
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,840
What do we got?

55
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,810
Kid who fell in the river

56
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,810
about five minutes out.

57
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,010
Good Samaritan right behind.

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,610
Bunch of runny

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,610
noses and earaches

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,610
and abdominal pain in Six.

61
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,850
Dr. Manning,

62
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,850
you're on the kid.

63
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,350
Clarke and Sexton,

64
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,350
stand by to assist.

65
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,520
Reese, you're on deck.

66
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,520
Everyone else, take a room.

67
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,880
Let's go. Don't worry.

68
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,880
We'll get through this.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,020
Hi, I'm Dr. Choi.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,020
Heard you're

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,020
having some belly pain.

72
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,520
Yeah. It's not

73
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,520
a big deal.

74
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,630
He fell down the stairs.

75
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,800
Really? How'd that happen?

76
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,830
It was nothing.

77
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,070
He was carrying

78
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,070
a pretty heavy box of books.

79
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,940
We're packing up

80
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,940
to move next week.

81
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,610
And everyone thinks

82
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,610
reading's good for you.

83
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,880
Might have a broken rib.

84
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,410
I'd like to get some scans

85
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,410
and make sure

86
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,750
there's nothing else going on,

87
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,010
but it doesn't

88
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,010
look too serious.

89
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,720
I'll be back to check

90
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,720
on you in a little bit.

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,450
Uh... Uh...

92
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,580
Is there anything else?

93
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,220
No. It's...

94
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,220
It's just he's been

95
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,220
a little clumsy lately.

96
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,460
But

97
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,460
that's normal, right?

98
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,160
Tripping over his feet?

99
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,160
He's just

100
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,160
growing into his body?

101
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,300
It's probably nothing,

102
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,300
but since we got some time,

103
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,360
I'll run some

104
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,360
blood to rule out

105
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,410
any infections or toxicities,

106
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,410
just to be sure.

107
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,770
Thank you.

108
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,200
Need any help?

109
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,740
We got it.

110
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,050
Mags, put him in Baghdad?

111
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,050
Already on it, Dr. Choi.

112
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,450
Dustin Banks,

113
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,450
eight years old.

114
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,150
Fell through

115
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,150
the ice into the river.

116
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,710
Fifteen minutes

117
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,710
before he was pulled out.

118
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,690
Heart's in brady-arrest.

119
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,690
Core temp, 27 degrees Celsius.

120
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,080
Cold and dead, Sexton?

121
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,080
What do you think?

122
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,930
Uh... That he's not dead

123
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,930
until he's warm and dead?

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,660
You just won the first shift

125
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,660
of compressions.

126
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,230
All right. On my count.

127
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,560
One, two, three.

128
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,660
April, I need to intubate.

129
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,660
Fifty of sux, 10 of etomidate.

130
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,230
On it.

131
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,230
Can he hear me?

132
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,800
Dustin!

133
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,800
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

134
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,640
The doctor will be with you

135
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,640
as soon as she can, okay?

136
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,670
Jim Kessler, 58.

137
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,780
Had a STEMI after

138
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,780
jumping in the river

139
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,780
to save the kid.

140
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,090
Aspirin and

141
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,090
nitro in the field.

142
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,090
Sinus rhythm now 120 over 80.

143
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,790
Mr. Kessler, I'm Dr. Reese.

144
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,790
Can you hear me?

145
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,980
Sure can.

146
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,980
Great.

147
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,990
On the count of three,

148
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,990
let's move him.

149
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,330
One, two, three.

150
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,700
Meds are in.

151
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,830
Maggie, get an ECMO unit.

152
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,060
Pneumonia season.

153
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,060
Every single

154
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,060
one's in use upstairs.

155
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,800
He's not gonna wake up

156
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,800
till he's 95 degrees.

157
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,800
What about bypass?

158
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,370
Both in surgery.

159
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,940
We can get one down here

160
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,940
in about 90 minutes.

161
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,020
Then we're going have to

162
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,020
keep his heart beating

163
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,020
until we get it.

164
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,570
Compressions for 90 minutes?

165
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,950
In five-minute shifts.

166
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,680
And we'll warm

167
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,680
him the best we can

168
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,680
with a left lung lavage.

169
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,090
Jeff, we need two 32

170
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,090
French chest tubes.

171
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,420
April, get a warmer

172
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,420
and all the saline

173
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,420
in the hospital. Let's go.

174
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,420
Left lung lavage?

175
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,420
Sure it'll work?

176
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,420
We're going to try.

177
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,260
Dr. Manning,

178
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,260
this is David Banks,

179
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,260
Dustin's father.

180
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,260
Is he going to be okay?

181
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
It's too soon to tell.

182
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,500
The benefit of hypothermia is

183
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,500
it preserves brain function.

184
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,000
But if we don't

185
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,000
warm him fast enough,

186
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,300
the cold will

187
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,300
eventually overwhelm his body.

188
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,610
So we're going to

189
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,610
circulate warm saline

190
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,610
through his chest cavity

191
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,500
until we can put him

192
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,500
on bypass, okay?

193
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,410
Okay, the warmer's

194
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,410
on its way,

195
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,680
but for this amount of saline,

196
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,680
Central Supply

197
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,680
needs a doctor's order.

198
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,880
Okay.

199
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,410
I promise you, we are gonna do

200
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,410
everything that we can.

201
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,930
Your EKG shows ST elevations.

202
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,930
Definitely a heart attack.

203
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,630
Ever had any

204
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,630
heart problems before?

205
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,570
Little chest pain

206
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,570
here and there.

207
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,570
My doc's got me on some pills.

208
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,070
Well, he should've told you

209
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,070
not to jump in a frozen river.

210
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,610
The shock is

211
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,610
probably what tipped you

212
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,610
over the edge.

213
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,870
Everybody's a Monday

214
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,870
morning quarterback.

215
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,640
I don't know what that means,

216
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,270
but I do know that

217
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,270
we need to assess

218
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,110
the extent of your

219
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,110
coronary artery disease,

220
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,740
so I want to send

221
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,740
you up to the cath lab.

222
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,680
Long as there's some

223
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,680
hot cocoa in it for me,

224
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,680
you got a deal.

225
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,650
All right. I'll check

226
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,650
back in with you soon.

227
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,760
Activate

228
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,760
the STEMI protocol.

229
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,090
And call Dr. Rhodes

230
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,090
for a consult.

231
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,090
You got it.

232
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,220
He got off lucky.

233
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,640
He could've gone into

234
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,640
cold shock,

235
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,640
v-fib, coagulopathy.

236
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,400
What a great but

237
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,400
crazy thing to do.

238
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,340
He probably didn't

239
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,340
even think about it.

240
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,410
Just saw a kid

241
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,410
in trouble and reacted.

242
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,820
Thank you.

243
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,630
Hey, Nat.

244
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,800
Hey, Jay.

245
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,910
It's a tough day, huh?

246
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,910
Yeah.

247
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,270
Just hang in there.

248
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,700
Thank you.

249
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,990
All right.

250
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,990
All Kevin's scans show

251
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,150
are a broken rib

252
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,150
and a pretty good bruise

253
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,150
on his kidney.

254
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,990
So I agree with Dr. Choi,

255
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,990
there's no

256
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,990
neurologic reason he fell.

257
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,090
He simply slipped.

258
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,030
I'd like

259
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,030
Nephrology to get a look

260
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,030
just to be safe,

261
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,360
but then he should

262
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,360
be okay to leave.

263
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,830
So, he'll be all right

264
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,830
to drive across country

265
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,830
next week?

266
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,700
Mom.

267
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,700
Shh.

268
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,700
Let the doctor talk.

269
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,440
Might be

270
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,440
a little uncomfortable,

271
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,440
but he'll be fine.

272
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,530
Thank you for all your help.

273
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,530
You got it.

274
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,780
My advice, bring some pillows.

275
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,740
Lead levels

276
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,740
and Lyme Titers?

277
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,550
Pretty aggressive workup

278
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,550
for a kid who just

279
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,550
slipped and fell.

280
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,050
Nothing wrong with

281
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,050
covering our bases.

282
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,660
Hey, Maggie?

283
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,660
How's the resuscitation going?

284
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,720
Getting 20 people from

285
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,720
five different departments

286
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,720
to work seamlessly together.

287
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,170
What could go wrong?

288
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,170
Hmm.

289
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,270
Well, you keep me updated.

290
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,270
Yeah.

291
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,700
Let me ask you,

292
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,700
did Dr. Wheeler have

293
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,470
any interpersonal issues

294
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,470
with anyone on staff?

295
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,770
I mean, I don't know.

296
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,770
I don't think so.

297
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,810
But he was making

298
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,810
some pretty big

299
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,810
mistakes lately.

300
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,170
Yeah, and it was getting worse

301
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,170
after the drinking incident.

302
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,480
Was there anything

303
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,480
that might have

304
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,480
been weighing on him?

305
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,290
I mean, you can tell

306
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,290
that he was

307
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,290
losing his confidence.

308
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,680
Hmm.

309
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,750
Uh...

310
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,660
Okay, then. I'll let

311
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,660
you get back to work.

312
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,660
All right.

313
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,360
I'm sorry, can I help you?

314
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,130
I was told

315
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,130
to ask for you.

316
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,130
Okay.

317
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,690
I'm Dr. Wheeler's father.

318
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,810
I need help!

319
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,810
Can somebody help me?

320
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,570
What happened?

321
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,570
I don't know.

322
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,840
He can't move.

323
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,680
Kevin, squeeze my fingers.

324
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,920
Just... Wait, wait.

325
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,590
Can you feel my hand?

326
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,160
All right,

327
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,160
let's get him to CT now.

328
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,590
What? What's happening?

329
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,360
I think your

330
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,360
son's having a stroke.

331
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,060
Oh, my God, Kevin, no.

332
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,440
So, the episodes

333
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,440
he's been having recently

334
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,440
could have been TIAs.

335
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,870
They may have been

336
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,870
coming for some time.

337
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,820
Well, it's possible,

338
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,820
but the CT looks negative.

339
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,950
It is. However,

340
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,950
there can be a delay

341
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,880
before an embolic stroke

342
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,880
shows up on the scan.

343
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,190
Exactly. Which is

344
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,190
why we need an MRI.

345
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,190
Right.

346
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,150
An MRI? That'll take an hour.

347
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,020
His stroke could be evolving

348
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,020
right before our eyes.

349
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,450
If it is a stroke.

350
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,500
His left side's

351
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,500
completely paralyzed.

352
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,500
What else could it be?

353
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,730
I don't know.

354
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,730
That's why I want an MRI.

355
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Every minute

356
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,600
we wait to break up

357
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,600
the clot in his brain

358
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,100
increases the odds

359
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,100
of his paralysis

360
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,940
becoming permanent.

361
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,940
He needs tPA.

362
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,840
He's also got

363
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,840
a bruised kidney,

364
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,610
tPA could cause

365
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,610
a massive hemorrhage.

366
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,170
We cannot risk that

367
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,170
until we know for sure

368
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,170
what we're treating.

369
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,010
You've still got more

370
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,010
than a two-hour window

371
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,010
for tPA.

372
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,850
I can get him

373
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,850
in and out of the MRI

374
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,850
in 40 minutes.

375
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,750
Good. Do it.

376
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,560
I'm sorry about your resident.

377
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,530
He wasn't my resident.

378
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,040
Yeah. Thanks.

379
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,900
Yeah, it's awful.

380
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,000
I mean, residency,

381
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,000
who doesn't consider

382
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,000
doing it?

383
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,880
Still, you never think

384
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,880
anybody actually will.

385
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,140
Wait,

386
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,140
you thought about suicide?

387
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,150
Of course. Didn't you?

388
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,540
No.

389
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,110
Huh.

390
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,910
That's unusual.

391
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,300
You have moderate

392
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,300
three-vessel disease.

393
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,840
But given the fact

394
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,840
that you've already

395
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,840
had a cardiac event,

396
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,400
it is my recommendation

397
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,400
that we do a coronary

398
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,400
artery bypass graft.

399
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,170
This is pretty

400
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,170
major surgery, right?

401
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
It is, but you are

402
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
an excellent candidate.

403
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,170
So I'd like to give

404
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,170
your heart a day to rest,

405
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,150
and then we can get you

406
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,150
on the schedule for tomorrow.

407
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,820
If you say so, let's do it.

408
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,820
Great.

409
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,390
By the way,

410
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,390
it's a pleasure to meet you.

411
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,490
I hear that you

412
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,490
are quite the hero.

413
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,430
No.

414
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,400
Just lucky I happened

415
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,400
to be there.

416
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,890
Well, either way,

417
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,890
we thank you.

418
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,770
How did you know

419
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,770
he needed help?

420
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,540
What do you mean?

421
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,540
He was drowning.

422
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,810
No. I understand, but...

423
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,070
What went through your head

424
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,070
the moment

425
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,070
before you jumped in?

426
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,750
Was it an actual decision,

427
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,750
or was it more like

428
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,750
an instinct kicking in?

429
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,250
I don't know.

430
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,830
We should let

431
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,830
you get your rest.

432
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,560
Dr. Reese will be back

433
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,560
when we have a room

434
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,560
ready for you upstairs.

435
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,720
Dr. Reese?

436
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,500
Dr. Reese, are you okay?

437
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,340
What? Yeah, I'm fine.

438
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,500
Everything's fine.

439
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,500
I'm going to go

440
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,500
check on the room.

441
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,110
Where is he? My son, Dustin.

442
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,980
Mrs. Banks?

443
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,980
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

444
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,980
Your son is right here.

445
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,340
But let me just explain to you

446
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,340
what's going on first, okay?

447
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,720
Cheryl, I don't know

448
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,720
what happened.

449
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,720
I was right...

450
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,780
This is your fault.

451
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,860
You are a terrible father.

452
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,700
Mrs. Banks, please,

453
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,700
let me just explain to you

454
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,700
what's going on, okay?

455
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Hey. How come

456
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,900
you're getting a snack?

457
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,900
It's time for lunch.

458
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,530
I'm sorry.

459
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,530
We've been slammed.

460
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,530
I gotta get back.

461
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,600
Okay. But you could've

462
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,600
texted and saved me

463
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,600
the drive across town.

464
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,180
I told you

465
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,180
I haven't had a second.

466
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,580
You had time to

467
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,580
get a snack, though.

468
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,210
Fine. You win.

469
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,840
That's a great answer.

470
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,910
Well, I'm sorry

471
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,910
my dying patient

472
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,910
inconvenienced you.

473
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,980
Come on, April.

474
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,080
What do you want me to say?

475
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,060
That's just how you

476
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,060
justify everything,

477
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,060
your work.

478
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,420
Now you're going to

479
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,420
start in on my work?

480
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,390
Nah. I'm going.

481
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,390
Rather eat by myself anyway.

482
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,680
You ever seen this before?

483
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,680
A resident

484
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,680
ending it like this?

485
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,720
Unfortunately, I have.

486
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,720
Yeah. Several times.

487
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,180
You know, about 400 doctors

488
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,180
take their own lives

489
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,180
every year, right?

490
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,250
Most of any profession.

491
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,890
I don't have a lot of

492
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,890
evidence to back this up,

493
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,460
but I got a strong hunch

494
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,460
it's got something to do with

495
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,900
taking people who have

496
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,900
a powerful desire to help

497
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,660
and throwing them

498
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,660
into a game

499
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,470
where the odds

500
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,470
are just stacked

501
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,470
against them.

502
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,400
I mean, this I do know,

503
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,380
situations like this,

504
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,380
it's never just one thing.

505
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,540
It's always a complex

506
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,540
set of circumstances,

507
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,640
and, you know,

508
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,640
trying to figure it out,

509
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,640
trying to assign blame,

510
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,910
it's pretty pointless.

511
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,860
Hey, thanks for

512
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,860
getting him a bed so fast.

513
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,240
Tough day, huh?

514
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,990
You and Dr. Wheeler

515
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,990
were friends?

516
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,090
No. I hardly knew him.

517
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,060
He came to me.

518
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,820
Twice.

519
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,670
Asking about pills,

520
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,670
about therapy.

521
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,710
That wasn't really

522
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,710
what he was asking for.

523
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,710
He was asking for help.

524
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,250
I don't know

525
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,250
why he came to me,

526
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,250
but he did, and now he's dead.

527
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,150
What kind of

528
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,150
terrible psychiatrist

529
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,150
am I gonna be?

530
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,630
You can't jump in

531
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,630
and save everyone, Reese.

532
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,630
It's just not possible.

533
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,500
It's not that I didn't

534
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,500
jump in to save him.

535
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,270
I didn't even see

536
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,270
that he was drowning.

537
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,070
Dr. Rhodes, better come here.

538
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,110
BP's dropping,

539
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,110
ST segments are elevated.

540
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,570
He's barely got a pulse.

541
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,920
He's in cardiogenic shock.

542
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,920
It must be another MI.

543
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,290
We're going to

544
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,290
balloon-pump him.

545
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,360
Bolus heparin,

546
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,360
start dopamine, dobutamine.

547
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,020
Get him on high-flow O2.

548
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,020
Got it.

549
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,080
I'll tell the cath lab

550
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,080
we're coming.

551
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,390
There's no time.

552
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,390
We're going to do it here.

553
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,420
We're...

554
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,970
How will we know if

555
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,970
we're in the right place?

556
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,770
If he bleeds out,

557
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
we'll know

558
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
we punctured the iliac.

559
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,670
If he stops breathing,

560
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,670
then we perforated

561
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,670
into the mediastinum.

562
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,160
But if we don't get

563
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,570
his blood pressure up

564
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,570
right now,

565
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,170
none of that's

566
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,170
gonna matter anyways.

567
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,850
Hang in there, Jim.

568
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,030
Let me know when you see it.

569
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,030
Almost there. Got it.

570
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,730
Almost there, Jim.

571
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,430
I got you.

572
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,500
All right, turn it on.

573
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,280
Come on,

574
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,280
come on, come on, come on.

575
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,790
Pressure's coming up,

576
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,790
70 over 35,

577
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,950
80 over 40.

578
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,620
Okay. Get him ready

579
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,620
to go upstairs.

580
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,700
Still no improvement.

581
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,670
He's always been so healthy.

582
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,070
What could cause

583
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,070
a stroke in a 15-year-old?

584
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,940
Not much,

585
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,940
and he's negative

586
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,940
for the usual suspects,

587
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,570
so if his MRI is positive,

588
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,550
we'll have to start looking

589
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,550
for less common causes.

590
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,350
I'm not going to have

591
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,350
to stay overnight, am I?

592
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,710
Kevin, not now.

593
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,120
Dr. Halstead, Dr. Choi.

594
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,450
Excuse us.

595
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,250
MRI?

596
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,250
Yeah.

597
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,060
Still no evidence

598
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,060
of a stroke.

599
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,060
This can't be right.

600
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,020
Well, it may not be.

601
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,020
It says it's a poor study

602
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,020
due to patient movement.

603
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,630
So it's inconclusive.

604
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,760
Tell MRI we're

605
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,760
sending him back up

606
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,760
for a repeat scan.

607
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,960
Are you kidding?

608
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,960
If this is a stroke,

609
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,960
we're running out of time.

610
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,100
Doesn't his affect

611
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,100
strike you as weird?

612
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,100
So little concern?

613
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,330
He's a confused teenager

614
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,330
who's probably also in shock.

615
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,940
Well, I don't like it.

616
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,940
It doesn't add up.

617
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,570
And we should figure

618
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,570
it out after we treat

619
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,240
what may soon become

620
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,240
permanent paralysis.

621
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,180
I'm not going to risk

622
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,180
a massive hemorrhage

623
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,740
and a transfusion

624
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,740
for no reason.

625
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,150
He's going back to MRI.

626
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,850
Hey.

627
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,690
I just spoke with CCU.

628
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,690
Mr. Kessler's pressure

629
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,690
still isn't coming up.

630
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,250
Okay. We'll give it

631
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,250
a few more minutes,

632
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,260
and if it doesn't improve,

633
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,260
I'll have to operate.

634
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,390
Okay.

635
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,170
Wheeler came to me,

636
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,170
too, Reese.

637
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,430
When we had that

638
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,430
pile-up in the blizzard

639
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,440
and the pregnant woman

640
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,440
almost bled out,

641
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,170
he took it hard.

642
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,680
I had the chance to

643
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,680
reassure him, but I didn't.

644
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,540
All right. I appreciate

645
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,540
that you're trying

646
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,820
to make me feel better,

647
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,820
but it doesn't.

648
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,120
I'm going to go check

649
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,120
on Mr. Kessler.

650
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,760
Whoa!

651
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,170
Noah.

652
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,170
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

653
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,260
Let me help you.

654
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,940
Hey, I saw you and Tate

655
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,940
getting a little edgy.

656
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,940
Are you okay?

657
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,580
I'm fine.

658
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,580
Yeah?

659
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,340
Okay, good.

660
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,340
I just don't want

661
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,340
you to, you know...

662
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,890
What? Screw things up?

663
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,890
What? No, no.

664
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,720
I just want you to be happy

665
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,050
with a guy

666
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,120
who was an all-pro

667
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,120
wide receiver three times.

668
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,820
Three times, right?

669
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,630
Okay, everybody,

670
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,630
the bypass machine

671
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,630
just opened up.

672
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,000
We need to get

673
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,000
him upstairs now.

674
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,470
So, you'll be

675
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,470
able to warm him up?

676
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,840
Much faster, yes.

677
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,200
And it hasn't

678
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,200
been too long, right?

679
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,200
He might still be okay?

680
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,510
We won't know about

681
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,510
his neurological function

682
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,510
until he wakes up.

683
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,900
But this is definitely

684
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,900
a step in the right direction.

685
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,710
Thank you, Dr. Manning.

686
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,710
Of course.

687
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,710
I can't tell you how much

688
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,710
we both appreciate this.

689
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,090
He's ready to go.

690
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,090
Okay. Let's do it.

691
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,390
Hold on.

692
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,390
Ms. Goodwin?

693
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,770
They need

694
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,770
the bypass machine upstairs

695
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,770
for an emergency case.

696
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,330
What do you mean

697
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,330
an emergency?

698
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,970
It's for Mr. Kessler,

699
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,970
the man who saved your son.

700
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,400
They need to operate

701
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,400
on him immediately.

702
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,270
But it was promised to us!

703
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,270
We've been waiting for it.

704
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,140
Plus that man would

705
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,140
want Dustin to have it.

706
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,710
There can't be

707
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,710
a bigger emergency

708
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,710
than this.

709
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,840
My son is dying.

710
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,880
Are you just

711
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,880
going to stand there

712
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,880
and do nothing?

713
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,580
Mrs. Banks,

714
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,580
Dustin still has options,

715
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,180
other ways of

716
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,180
continuing to warm.

717
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,660
Mr. Kessler does not.

718
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,660
Without surgery, he will die.

719
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,520
My son is going to die.

720
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,520
Tell her.

721
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,460
Put him back on the monitors.

722
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,190
Wait. Wait!

723
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,560
Are you giving up?

724
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,870
No. But Ms. Goodwin is right.

725
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,640
We can try peritoneal lavage

726
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,640
to speed things up.

727
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,930
You are his doctor.

728
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,970
You're supposed to

729
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,970
fight for your patients!

730
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,010
My son is only

731
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,010
eight years old.

732
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,150
What kind of

733
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,150
a monster are you?

734
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,640
Mrs. Banks.

735
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,220
Mrs. Banks,

736
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,220
I am truly, truly sorry.

737
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,420
April, set up for the lavage.

738
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,420
Yeah. On it.

739
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,690
The waiting room's

740
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,690
backed up again, Maggie.

741
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,630
I'm doing my best, Dr. Choi.

742
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,660
We need to do better.

743
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,780
Too many people

744
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,780
losing focus today.

745
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,780
It's dangerous.

746
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,010
Is that right?

747
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,660
That patient in there,

748
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,660
Kevin, 15-year-old

749
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,660
with hemiparesis,

750
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,650
but his attending is

751
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,650
fixated on his mood

752
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,650
rather than his symptoms.

753
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,320
What do you mean?

754
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,830
He seems a little detached.

755
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,900
But he's just a kid

756
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,900
trying to play it cool.

757
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,870
So now we're

758
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,870
wasting valuable time

759
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,870
ordering scan after scan

760
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,100
when we should

761
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,100
be treating him.

762
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,580
Well, I mean, surely,

763
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,580
this attending gave

764
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,580
you his reasons, right?

765
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,300
He did.

766
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,640
But I think

767
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,640
the incident this morning

768
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,640
is clouding his judgment.

769
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,950
I'm not sure he

770
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,950
should be working today.

771
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,950
Really?

772
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,060
Dr. Charles,

773
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,060
we're in the business

774
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,060
of saving lives,

775
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,890
and the moment

776
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,890
people lose confidence

777
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,290
in their leader,

778
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,290
the fight is lost.

779
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,590
We've already had

780
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,590
one casualty today.

781
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,690
I won't have another.

782
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,880
Kevin, how are you?

783
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,880
I'm Dr. Charles.

784
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,490
Hey.

785
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,260
I understand you're

786
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,260
having a little trouble

787
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,260
with your left side.

788
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,700
Oh, yeah.

789
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,700
Yeah.

790
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,530
How you doing with that?

791
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,530
I know it can be

792
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,530
a little scary.

793
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,960
It's not that big a deal.

794
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,880
Excuse me, Dr. Charles,

795
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,880
this patient's

796
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,880
scheduled for an MRI.

797
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes.

798
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,140
Okay.

799
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,650
Well, nice to meet you.

800
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,650
Yeah.

801
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,590
Metz and DeBakeys.

802
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,840
Let's get him cannulated

803
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,840
for bypass, and get me

804
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,840
a sheet of woven patch.

805
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,540
Woven patch?

806
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,540
I thought we were doing

807
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,540
a three-vessel CABG.

808
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,240
Change of plans.

809
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,240
This isn't an MI.

810
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,340
Page Dr. Reese.

811
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,340
Tell her I need her now.

812
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,280
3.0?

813
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,000
How's he doing?

814
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,000
Still only 89 degrees.

815
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,570
Look, I know

816
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,570
Dr. Wheeler had

817
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,570
a difficult time here.

818
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,140
Did he ever talk

819
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,140
to you about it?

820
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,140
No.

821
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,920
Was there anyone he

822
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,920
might have talked to?

823
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,920
A confidant?

824
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,720
Honestly, I have no idea.

825
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,550
Okay then.

826
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,890
Ms. Goodwin?

827
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,890
Yes?

828
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,720
I spent eight months

829
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,720
working alongside someone

830
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,230
who was in so much pain

831
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,230
that he took his own life,

832
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,930
and I never even noticed.

833
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,700
Am I a monster?

834
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,870
No, Dr. Manning.

835
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,310
No, you're not.

836
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,190
Excuse me,

837
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,190
I'm looking for my friend.

838
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,520
Is this

839
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,520
the visitors' entrance?

840
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,060
For the ED, yeah.

841
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,060
Has he been admitted yet?

842
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,150
I don't know.

843
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,150
He said he can't

844
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,150
move his arm or leg.

845
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,460
It sounds really bad.

846
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,960
His name wouldn't be Kevin,

847
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,960
by any chance, would it?

848
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,230
Yeah, it is.

849
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,230
Huh.

850
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,170
Tell me, is your buddy,

851
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,170
like, a real cool customer?

852
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,470
You know,

853
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,470
like a James Dean type?

854
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,470
Who's James Dean?

855
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,140
What I mean is,

856
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,070
is he the kind of guy

857
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,070
that doesn't really get

858
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,070
too worked up about stuff?

859
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,620
Kevin? You're kidding.

860
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,620
They're making him

861
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,620
move to California.

862
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,950
Of course he's worked up.

863
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,510
He's gotta move?

864
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,150
Yeah. They're just

865
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,150
dragging him away.

866
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,810
Hmm.

867
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,260
You're gonna

868
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,260
miss him, huh?

869
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,260
Yeah.

870
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,530
Sorry, tell me your name.

871
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,530
I'm Dr. Charles.

872
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,530
Emmett.

873
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,460
Emmett, nice to meet you.

874
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,160
I think that there

875
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,160
might be a chance

876
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,260
that we could

877
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,260
help your friend.

878
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,200
Could we go

879
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,200
see him together?

880
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,200
Yeah, okay.

881
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,780
Dr. Rhodes,

882
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,780
why did you bring me here?

883
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,340
I can't assist

884
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,340
on a bypass graft.

885
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,050
We're not doing

886
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,050
a bypass graft.

887
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,890
What? But I...

888
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,890
Look.

889
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,560
A ventricular septal defect?

890
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,560
Necrosis.

891
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,500
Lack of blood flow

892
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,500
from his heart attack

893
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,500
at the river

894
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,470
caused a small

895
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,470
patch of muscle to die.

896
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,240
That's impossible to find.

897
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,240
How did you even know

898
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,240
to look?

899
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,970
You see

900
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,970
this discoloration?

901
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,970
Uh-huh.

902
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,910
I missed this once.

903
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,210
Guy died before

904
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,210
we even got him off the table.

905
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,210
I know that you feel like

906
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,210
you let Wheeler down,

907
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,910
like you missed the signs

908
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,910
of him needing help.

909
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,990
As doctors, all we can

910
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,990
do is learn from that

911
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,490
and try not to

912
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,490
miss them again.

913
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,860
Maggie, when's Kevin Roth

914
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,860
getting back from MRI?

915
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,540
Didn't you get

916
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,540
Dr. Choi's message?

917
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,700
He took your patient

918
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,700
to interventional radiology.

919
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,800
What?

920
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,210
Do not administer that tPA!

921
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,750
Dr. Choi, now.

922
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,160
The hell are you doing?

923
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,160
His window's nearly closed.

924
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,160
I had no choice.

925
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,130
No, you don't have a choice.

926
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,130
I'm your attending.

927
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,960
And you're not willing to do

928
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,960
what the patient needs.

929
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,790
So, you're 100% sure

930
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,790
of the correct

931
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,790
clinical course?

932
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,160
Because to me,

933
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,160
this is not a clear-cut case.

934
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,530
Doesn't mean we can avoid

935
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,530
making the hard decisions.

936
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,500
Even if those

937
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,500
decisions might kill him?

938
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,740
Gentlemen,

939
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,740
if we could take a beat,

940
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,730
this young man might

941
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,730
help us shed some light

942
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,730
on the situation.

943
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,390
Hey, man.

944
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,390
Emmett,

945
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,390
what are you doing here?

946
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,250
I was worried.

947
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,050
You were worried about me?

948
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,020
Yeah, man.

949
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,020
Your text said

950
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,020
you couldn't move.

951
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,000
I didn't know if you

952
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,000
were dying or paralyzed.

953
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,170
I just came as

954
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,170
fast as I could.

955
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,890
Oh, Mr. Wheeler,

956
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,890
I'm sorry.

957
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,720
I'll give you some time.

958
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,460
Why did he do it?

959
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,240
Even if he was

960
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,240
having trouble, why?

961
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,910
I don't know.

962
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,090
Did you ever see

963
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,090
Jason do that trick

964
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,220
where you'd pull

965
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,220
a card out of the deck,

966
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,090
and it turns out

967
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,090
it's in his pocket?

968
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,490
Yeah. When he was a kid.

969
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,290
Yeah, I saw him

970
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,290
do it once up on

971
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,290
the pediatric oncology ward.

972
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,330
I guess he used to go up there

973
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,330
a couple times a week

974
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,700
to do magic for the kids.

975
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,830
And, oh, man,

976
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,830
did they love it.

977
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,970
He did this thing

978
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,970
where he would pull

979
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,970
a lemon out of his ear,

980
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,810
and then out of one

981
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,810
of the kids' ears,

982
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,810
and then out of another...

983
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,640
And they'd be

984
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,640
rolling on the ground.

985
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,010
Just 10 minutes

986
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,010
in their day

987
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,780
where they

988
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,780
didn't have to think

989
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,520
about whatever

990
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,520
terrible illness they had.

991
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,020
I didn't know

992
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,020
your son very well.

993
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,890
And I've seen

994
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,890
a lot of doctors

995
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,890
come through here.

996
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,460
He would've been a good one.

997
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,240
Thank you.

998
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,670
Yeah.

999
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,980
We had no idea.

1000
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,120
It seems like

1001
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,120
he's been harboring

1002
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,120
thoughts and feelings

1003
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,660
that he wasn't

1004
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,660
comfortable expressing,

1005
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,090
and his body found a way

1006
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,090
to express them for him.

1007
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,430
So he wasn't

1008
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,430
actually paralyzed?

1009
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,460
No, but he was

1010
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,460
experiencing real symptoms.

1011
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,440
It's why we call it

1012
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,440
a conversion disorder.

1013
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,200
It's the

1014
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,200
physical manifestation

1015
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,200
of a psychological desire.

1016
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,110
"Desire"?

1017
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,110
Sounds like you're saying

1018
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,110
he wanted to be paralyzed.

1019
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,610
I'm saying

1020
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,610
he didn't wanna move.

1021
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,440
And his subconscious

1022
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,440
decided that having

1023
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,440
a serious medical condition

1024
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,920
might be a good way

1025
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,920
to accomplish that.

1026
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,350
That sounds crazy.

1027
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,350
Crazy, no.

1028
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,350
Complicated, sure.

1029
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,450
But if you think

1030
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,450
about it as a whole,

1031
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,220
an understandable response

1032
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,220
to what must have seemed

1033
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,220
like an impossible situation.

1034
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,130
I mean, having to leave

1035
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,130
somebody that he

1036
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,130
couldn't tell you about,

1037
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,590
somebody for whom

1038
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,590
he had very strong feelings.

1039
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,170
But if he was so upset,

1040
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,030
why didn't he seem to care

1041
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,030
about being paralyzed?

1042
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,770
Compartmentalization is

1043
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,770
just part of the condition.

1044
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,440
But trust me, your son cares.

1045
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,440
I mean, he cares a great deal.

1046
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,240
Just to be safe,

1047
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,240
we'd like to observe him

1048
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,240
in the hospital overnight.

1049
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,070
Then probably a good idea

1050
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,070
for the three of you

1051
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,070
to sit down and have a talk.

1052
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,710
They're getting

1053
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,710
a room for him upstairs.

1054
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,950
I'll let you know

1055
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,950
when it's ready.

1056
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,850
Thank you.

1057
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,050
Damn.

1058
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,730
The funny thing

1059
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,730
about feelings,

1060
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,830
you know, we think

1061
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,830
that if we push

1062
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,830
them down hard enough,

1063
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,030
they'll disappear.

1064
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,200
Never quite

1065
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,200
works out that way.

1066
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,140
I could've killed him.

1067
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,910
Well, you didn't.

1068
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,720
Cheryl?

1069
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,330
Cheryl, I was

1070
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,330
watching him every second,

1071
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,600
and then Ben

1072
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,600
called about this thing,

1073
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,000
and I had to look

1074
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,000
it up on my phone.

1075
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,530
And I know you

1076
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,530
never take your eyes

1077
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,530
off the kids for a minute,

1078
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,670
and I'm always working,

1079
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,670
and you're a far

1080
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,670
better parent than I am.

1081
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,950
I'm sorry.

1082
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,280
I don't know

1083
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,280
what else to tell you.

1084
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,660
I'm just so sorry.

1085
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,330
Hey. I'm tagging you out.

1086
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,390
There's a couch in

1087
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,390
the lounge that's free.

1088
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,370
I'll grab you in 20.

1089
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,370
Thanks.

1090
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,700
There's something

1091
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,700
else I have to do.

1092
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,520
Hey.

1093
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,730
Listen,

1094
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,730
I'm sorry about earlier,

1095
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,730
going off on you like that.

1096
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,570
Okay.

1097
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,570
But...

1098
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,140
But what?

1099
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,040
I know that you blame me

1100
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,040
for the miscarriage.

1101
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,580
April...

1102
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,580
No, admit it.

1103
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,110
No matter how many

1104
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,110
times you're told

1105
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,240
that my working had

1106
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,240
nothing to do with it,

1107
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,950
you just...

1108
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,950
You won't let it go.

1109
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,560
But it's bigger than that.

1110
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,330
You would've had me

1111
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,330
quit my job a year ago,

1112
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,330
before I was even pregnant.

1113
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,530
You want

1114
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,530
a different kind of woman.

1115
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,790
I want you.

1116
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,770
I love you.

1117
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,670
I just imagined

1118
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,670
a different kind of life.

1119
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,350
I know.

1120
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,780
I hope you find

1121
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,780
everything you want.

1122
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,980
You, too. You, too.

1123
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,780
Amazing what

1124
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,780
the mind can do, isn't it?

1125
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,450
Keeps me employed,

1126
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,450
that's for sure.

1127
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,150
You know, Wheeler...

1128
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,930
Maybe what

1129
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,930
happened wasn't my fault,

1130
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,930
but I didn't help.

1131
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,730
Hey, join the club.

1132
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,860
Look, not for nothing,

1133
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,860
helping people is just about

1134
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,860
the hardest job there is.

1135
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,070
You've been doing it,

1136
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,070
what, 25, 30...

1137
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,840
Several years?

1138
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,140
What... What's the secret?

1139
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,210
I'm still looking for that,

1140
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,210
but if I had to guess,

1141
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,410
I'd say it had

1142
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,410
something to do with,

1143
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,790
you know,

1144
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,790
just keep showing up,

1145
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,350
keep doing your job,

1146
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,350
put one foot

1147
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,350
in front of the other.

1148
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,590
'Cause when you start to get

1149
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,590
all tangled up in here,

1150
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,290
you know, that's when...

1151
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,290
I mean,

1152
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,290
it can just paralyze you.

1153
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,800
Yeah.

1154
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,400
Still, it's gonna be a while

1155
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,400
before I can sleep again.

1156
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,770
Dr. Halstead.

1157
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,450
I think we're lucky

1158
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,450
to have you here.

1159
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,450
Keep up the good work.

1160
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,580
Hey, I think he's waking up.

1161
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,180
Dustin.

1162
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,650
He's trying to breath.

1163
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,490
Hang on, Dustin.

1164
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,490
We're gonna take

1165
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,490
this tube out, okay?

1166
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,720
Hang in there, buddy.

1167
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,290
We're right here, buddy, okay?

1168
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,290
We'll take this out.

1169
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,830
Dustin?

1170
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,830
Can you hear us, buddy?

1171
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,830
Hey, hey.

1172
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,770
It's all right,

1173
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,770
sweetheart.

1174
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,770
Dustin.

1175
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,930
Bilateral breath sounds

1176
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,930
are present.

1177
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,880
Pupils are equal

1178
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,880
and reactive to light.

1179
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,800
Hey, Dustin,

1180
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,800
if you can hear me,

1181
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,800
can you tell me who this is?

1182
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,810
Mom?

1183
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,410
Oh, my God.

1184
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,880
Let's DC the lung lavage,

1185
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,420
but keep the peritoneal going

1186
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,420
until he's 98 degrees, okay?

1187
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,480
Got it.

1188
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,220
We're gonna

1189
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,220
need to observe him

1190
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,220
for a few days,

1191
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,760
but this is a very good sign.

1192
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,560
Dr. Manning?

1193
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,560
Yes?

1194
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,560
I'm sorry about

1195
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,560
what I said earlier.

1196
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,790
Thank you.

1197
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,930
Thank you for everything

1198
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,930
that you've done.

1199
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,540
I'm just happy we were

1200
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,540
able to save your boy.

1201
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,830
How about that?

1202
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,660
I guess every now

1203
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,660
and then we get lucky.

1204
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,160
Yeah.

1205
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,570
How'd it go

1206
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,570
with Dr. Richardson?

1207
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,570
She stay busy?

1208
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,470
Uh... Nobody showed.

1209
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,340
Nobody?

1210
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,340
Yeah, but that's...

1211
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,340
You know, it takes time.

1212
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,340
Trust me. People are dealing

1213
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,340
in their own way, you know.

1214
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,270
When I took this job, Daniel,

1215
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,480
I wanted to

1216
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,480
create an environment

1217
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,210
where we would

1218
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,210
never lose someone.

1219
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,750
Everyone would look

1220
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,750
out for each other.

1221
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,950
I thought I did.

1222
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,730
But then today, I found out

1223
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,360
there was a very

1224
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,360
troubled young man

1225
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,360
in our midst,

1226
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,000
and not a single person

1227
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,000
knew him.

1228
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,760
I failed.

1229
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,540
Sharon, come on.

1230
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,540
No, no.

1231
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,580
You gotta wonder

1232
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,580
about all the ones

1233
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,580
who don't jump off the ledge,

1234
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,880
what's going

1235
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,880
through their heads,

1236
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,340
how this job is

1237
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,340
affecting them.

1238
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,990
I worry about

1239
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,990
these people, Daniel.

1240
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,860
I worry about them.

1241
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,860
I know you do. I know you do.

1242
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,290
I wish I could protect them.

1243
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,470
He's right here, Ethan.

1244
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,190
I'm so sorry.

1245
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,990
They won't need me

1246
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,990
in the ED tomorrow,

1247
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,430
so I'll be back

1248
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,430
on your service.

1249
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,870
Thank you. Thanks.

1250
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,870
I'll see you tomorrow.

1251
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,280
Everybody comes

1252
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,280
to you, don't they,

1253
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,280
with all their pain?

1254
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,850
And you just

1255
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,850
have to absorb it.

1256
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,630
How are you doing today?

1257
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,980
It was awful.

1258
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,980
It's just awful.
