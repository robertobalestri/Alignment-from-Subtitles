1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,790
So, I get

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,790
this specimen labeled

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,790
"Synovial fluid, left hip."

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,500
And I'm looking at it,

5
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,500
and it's not very viscous.

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,930
Obviously, I'm thinking

7
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,930
maybe it's gout,

8
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,030
but there aren't any crystals

9
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,030
under the microscope,

10
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,030
just cells.

11
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,700
So I call the intern

12
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,700
who drew it,

13
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,110
and he tells me he's trying

14
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,110
to rule out cirrhosis,

15
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,480
which doesn't make any sense,

16
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,610
until I suddenly realize

17
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,610
that those weren't

18
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,610
monocytes I was seeing,

19
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,980
they were PMLs.

20
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,250
The guy had drawn it

21
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,250
from the left hip,

22
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,050
but it was

23
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,050
peritoneal fluid.

24
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,950
What is the matter

25
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,950
with you?

26
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,990
Did you see

27
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,990
someone following us

28
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,990
when we got off the bus?

29
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,420
No.

30
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,920
I'm pretty sure I did.

31
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,560
Who?

32
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,560
I don't know.

33
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,660
I just can't

34
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,660
shake this feeling

35
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm being followed.

36
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,930
Followed?

37
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,930
Mmm-hmm.

38
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,630
Oh, I get it.

39
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,740
But don't worry,

40
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,740
it's not real.

41
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,940
What?

42
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,940
You're a first-year

43
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,940
psych resident.

44
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,280
What does that mean?

45
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,810
You spend all day treating

46
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,810
very disturbed people.

47
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,720
It's only natural that

48
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,720
you'd start mirroring

49
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,720
some of their disorders.

50
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,310
For example, paranoia.

51
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,850
I don't know.

52
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,150
That sounds kind of

53
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,150
condescending.

54
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,750
Stacking up here,

55
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,750
Maggie.

56
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,130
We need to get these patients

57
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,130
to the medical force.

58
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,130
Oh, really? Sorry,

59
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,130
Dr. Choi, I didn't notice.

60
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,570
Dr. Manning,

61
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,570
Hayley Kline, incoming.

62
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,340
Adolescent female, on chemo

63
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,340
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma...

64
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,770
No, no, no, Baghdad.

65
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,770
Okay.

66
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,170
Dr. Manning,

67
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,170
thank God you're here.

68
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,640
Stop the shoes. No shoes.

69
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,640
Honey,

70
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,640
I don't understand.

71
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,770
She's been

72
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,770
talking nonsense.

73
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,280
GCS 10,

74
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,280
altered mental status,

75
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,280
mostly incoherent.

76
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,840
New onset of jaundice.

77
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,910
April?

78
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,910
Got it.

79
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,350
Her eyes, they're yellow.

80
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,290
Hayley, honey,

81
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,290
it's Dr. Manning.

82
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,290
Do you remember me?

83
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,020
I can't find my...

84
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,580
What is wrong with her?

85
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,580
We're gonna find out.

86
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,090
No rain. No. No.

87
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,430
Let's hang a liter

88
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,430
of NS and draw a CBC,

89
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,430
BMP, LFT, and lytes.

90
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,590
On it.

91
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,590
When was her

92
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,590
last dose of chemo?

93
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,800
A few days ago.

94
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,800
A week, actually.

95
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,930
Sweetie, honey.

96
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
She could be

97
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
in liver failure,

98
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,340
which could be causing

99
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,340
her brain to swell.

100
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,400
No.

101
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,540
GCS is worsening.

102
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,540
We need to intubate,

103
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,540
protect her airway.

104
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,710
I got it.

105
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,110
Do what you gotta do.

106
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,580
Ten of etomidate

107
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,580
and 75 of sux.

108
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,580
Yup.

109
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,650
One fluid line.

110
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,650
Keep an eye on her sats.

111
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,920
I'm in.

112
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,620
Let's get a head CT

113
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,620
and belly, hyperventilate,

114
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,360
and get labs now

115
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,360
with an acetaminophen level.

116
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,330
Got it.

117
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,330
Call 'em and tell 'em

118
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,330
we're on our way up,

119
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,890
we don't have time.

120
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,890
You can come with us.

121
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,440
Let's go.

122
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,670
Hang in there, Hayley.

123
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,740
Can't you rush

124
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,740
those discharges?

125
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,740
I need those beds.

126
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,650
You paged?

127
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,650
Yeah.

128
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

129
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,490
We're jammed,

130
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,490
and there's no

131
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,490
beds upstairs.

132
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,080
I hate to say it, but maybe

133
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,080
we should consider...

134
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,150
We're not diverting patients

135
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,150
to other hospitals.

136
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm just saying...

137
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,320
Maggie, we're not going

138
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,320
on bypass.

139
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,030
If the medical floors

140
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,030
are filled, call the ICUs.

141
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,160
Put patients there

142
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,160
until beds are available.

143
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,230
I'll try.

144
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,140
Sorry for

145
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,140
the lack of privacy.

146
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,330
No problem. I just

147
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,330
want to get out of here.

148
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,040
When did

149
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,040
the pain start?

150
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,440
About a half hour ago.

151
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,610
I was just gonna

152
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,610
ignore it, but my neighbor,

153
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,610
he's a nurse.

154
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,540
And so he said I should

155
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,540
get it checked out.

156
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,010
I don't like hospitals.

157
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,850
I hear you.

158
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,850
Where exactly is the pain?

159
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,320
Here. The belly button.

160
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,450
Dr. Halstead.

161
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,960
Mr. Logan, do you have

162
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,960
a history of A-fib?

163
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,860
What's that?

164
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,860
An irregular heartbeat.

165
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,760
No. Is it serious?

166
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,530
Oh, very common,

167
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,530
but something

168
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,530
we should look into.

169
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,100
How about this? This hurt?

170
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,870
No.

171
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,070
This?

172
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,070
Yeah, there.

173
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,910
Well, good news,

174
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,910
your belly's soft,

175
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,910
and you're not guarding,

176
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,780
meaning you're not tensing

177
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,780
when I touch you.

178
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,320
Oh, so it's probably

179
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,320
nothing, right?

180
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,050
I mean, it's probably

181
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,050
something I ate.

182
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,990
I hope so,

183
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,990
but let's just be safe.

184
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,990
Excuse me.

185
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,790
Uh, let's order

186
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,790
a chest X-ray,

187
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,560
KUB and lactate, CBC,

188
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,560
amylase lipase.

189
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,560
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,720
Just the basic chemistry.

191
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,720
Right.

192
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,930
How long is that

193
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,930
all gonna take?

194
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,890
Uh, do you know what?

195
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,890
Not long.

196
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,370
We'll get you out of here

197
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,370
as soon as possible.

198
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,710
Tolerated the surgery

199
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,710
well, Mr. Collins.

200
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,640
Your chest sounds good.

201
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,640
That's great.

202
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,610
Let me.

203
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,630
Mr. Collins, we're gonna

204
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,630
have to redo your aortic

205
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,630
root valve replacement.

206
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,170
What?

207
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,170
Dr. Latham?

208
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,830
Apical systolic murmur.

209
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,570
I didn't hear it.

210
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,570
It's subtle.

211
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,260
I'm sorry,

212
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,260
I still don't hear it.

213
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,820
Call the OR,

214
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,820
have them set up for

215
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,360
an emergent

216
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,360
aortic valve take back.

217
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,420
Right away.

218
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,730
You're gonna have to

219
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,730
operate again? Really?

220
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,290
Dr. Latham, if I may.

221
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,200
Excuse us.

222
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,200
We're gonna put him

223
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,200
through it again?

224
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,730
Shouldn't we at least

225
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,730
get an echo to confirm?

226
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,230
The valve will fail.

227
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,830
If you need to

228
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,830
assuage your doubts,

229
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,350
we can do an echo

230
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,350
on the table.

231
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,970
Meanwhile, I'm changing

232
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,970
into my scrubs.

233
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,320
Here is the reason for your

234
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,320
tummy ache, Shannon.

235
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,690
You have an obstruction

236
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,690
in your stomach.

237
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,920
Oh, dear.

238
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,920
It's not a growth.

239
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,890
It's clearly

240
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,890
a foreign object.

241
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,760
What did you eat?

242
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,760
Nothing.

243
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,570
You must have

244
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,570
swallowed something.

245
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,300
It's the only way

246
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,300
it could've gotten there.

247
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know.

248
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,570
Honey, think.

249
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,570
What could it be?

250
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,800
I had some of

251
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,800
those little carrots.

252
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,600
No, a carrot

253
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,600
wouldn't reflect X-rays.

254
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,580
This is dense.

255
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,580
It's metal or ceramic,

256
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,580
maybe some kind of toy.

257
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,140
Honey?

258
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,140
I don't know.

259
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,720
Won't it just

260
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,720
come out eventually?

261
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,250
You know, peristalsis.

262
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,750
Well, whatever this is,

263
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,750
I don't want it

264
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,750
moving through you.

265
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,920
It could cut the bowel,

266
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,920
and that would be serious.

267
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,490
With your permission,

268
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,490
I'd like Shannon

269
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,490
to have an endoscopy.

270
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,290
We'll sedate her,

271
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,290
put a scope down

272
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,630
her esophagus,

273
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,630
and get the thing out.

274
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,360
Shouldn't be a problem.

275
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,700
Oh, God.

276
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,700
Don't worry.

277
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,240
It'll be over

278
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,240
before you know it.

279
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,080
All right.

280
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,070
Well, you were right.

281
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,070
Diffuse cerebral edema

282
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,410
with effacement of

283
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,410
the sulci and ventricles.

284
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,740
Yeah.

285
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,720
Get her up to PICU.

286
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,590
I'm sorry,

287
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,430
but the CT shows that

288
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,430
there is significant

289
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,430
swelling in Hayley's brain.

290
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,370
The cause is

291
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,370
acute liver failure.

292
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,400
"Acute"?

293
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,540
There are things

294
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,540
we can do for her.

295
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,210
We have her

296
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,210
on medication that will

297
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,210
help reduce the swelling.

298
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,250
This is Dr. Abrams,

299
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,250
he's a neurosurgeon.

300
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,250
I've called him to consult.

301
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,750
I'm gonna put in

302
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,750
a drain to relieve

303
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,020
the pressure

304
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,020
on your daughter's brain.

305
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,720
With your permission,

306
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,720
of course.

307
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,560
Are you talking

308
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,560
about brain surgery?

309
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,150
I do it bedside.

310
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,150
It's not

311
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,150
a difficult procedure.

312
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,890
My baby.

313
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,770
My poor baby.

314
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,030
It's okay, honey.

315
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,200
We are gonna do everything

316
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,200
that we can for her.

317
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,800
I...

318
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,350
Chicken salad,

319
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,350
chicken wings,

320
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,350
chicken tenders.

321
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,910
Don't you have

322
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,910
anything without chicken?

323
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,980
Dude, can you read

324
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,980
the sign?

325
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
We only do chicken,

326
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
and we do it "clucking" well.

327
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,820
Next!

328
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,700
You don't eat

329
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,700
chicken anymore?

330
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,900
Since I got my parrot,

331
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,900
you know,

332
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,530
eating birds

333
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,530
doesn't feel right.

334
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
I'd like to order

335
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
chicken tenders.

336
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,680
Dr. Reese?

337
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,710
Danny.

338
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,580
You've been

339
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,580
following me.

340
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,890
I had to talk to you.

341
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,260
Alone. Uh...

342
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,260
Mmm-hmm.

343
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,630
You were nice to me.

344
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,630
We know

345
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,630
what's going on.

346
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
That woman with you

347
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
was not your mother,

348
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,560
and you're being

349
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,560
sex-trafficked.

350
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,270
They make me do things

351
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,270
that I don't wanna do.

352
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,840
We can help you, Danny.

353
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,930
No.

354
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,780
No, nobody can.

355
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,610
But you came to me. Why?

356
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,710
I can't take it anymore.

357
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,820
I want to kill myself.

358
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,530
I twisted arms,

359
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,530
got a few beds,

360
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,530
but we're still shy,

361
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,030
but I'm sure

362
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,030
there's more up there.

363
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,530
You know how

364
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,530
those ICU nurses are,

365
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,860
they always keep

366
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,860
spares for emergency.

367
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,730
Yeah, right.

368
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,730
We both played that game.

369
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,200
Go up there,

370
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,200
light a fire.

371
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,740
If you get

372
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,740
any push-back,

373
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,740
call me.

374
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,110
Will do.

375
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,170
Danny said he'd

376
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,170
get back in touch.

377
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,810
When he does,

378
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,810
you should refer him

379
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,810
to the psych clinic.

380
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,540
Well, he won't go.

381
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,540
He's afraid to come

382
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,140
into the hospital

383
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,140
or any clinic.

384
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,150
He's afraid the traffickers

385
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,150
will find out,

386
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,740
and he only wants

387
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,740
to see me outside.

388
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,150
Bad idea.

389
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,950
Dr. Charles, he's suicidal.

390
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,030
So, let me get

391
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,030
this straight.

392
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,890
You are gonna

393
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,890
give him psychotherapy

394
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,090
in the parking lot

395
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,090
once a week?

396
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,130
Dr. Reese,

397
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,130
this patient, any patient

398
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,530
has gotta be treated

399
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,530
in the proper

400
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,530
clinical setting.

401
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,370
He feels a connection

402
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,370
to me.

403
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,070
Let me ask you something.

404
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,170
You feel like

405
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,170
you're the only one

406
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,170
who can help him?

407
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,310
Only one

408
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,310
who understands him?

409
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,510
No. No, it's just...

410
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,510
Just what?

411
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,380
I care about him.

412
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,850
Cut it off.

413
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,850
You're too involved.

414
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,850
But I...

415
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,220
I...

416
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,220
I don't understand.

417
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,420
What happens if you don't

418
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,420
get the rosy outcome

419
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,420
you're looking for?

420
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,090
I think I can deal

421
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,090
with that.

422
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,090
No.

423
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,930
Crucial part of my job

424
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,930
is protecting my staff.

425
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,000
You are headed down

426
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,000
a dangerous path. Step away.

427
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,700
We clear?

428
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,570
Good.

429
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,940
Mr. Logan's

430
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,940
lab work.

431
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,520
Albumin's a little low,

432
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,520
creatinine's a little high.

433
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,950
Yeah, so is his lactate.

434
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,610
Yeah. Thanks, April.

435
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,610
Yeah.

436
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,590
Mr. Logan.

437
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,590
How are you feeling?

438
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm pretty good.

439
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,890
And the pain

440
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,890
in your belly?

441
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,130
Uh, it's about the same.

442
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,130
No worse.

443
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,590
I'd sure like to

444
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,590
get out of here.

445
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,490
This is the last X-ray

446
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,490
of your abdomen.

447
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,270
It shows

448
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,270
some vague dilation,

449
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,770
not enough to be

450
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,770
a real concern,

451
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,300
but your labs, too,

452
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,300
they're just

453
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,300
slightly off the norm.

454
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,440
So?

455
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,870
So I'm not comfortable

456
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,870
discharging you just yet,

457
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,820
till I know for sure

458
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,820
what's going on.

459
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,180
I'd like to do a CT scan

460
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,180
of your abdomen.

461
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,780
Really?

462
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,010
Humor me.

463
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,990
Fine. Whatever you say.

464
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,620
All right.

465
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,960
Sternum closing

466
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,960
looks good.

467
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,470
Dr. Bardovi, any help

468
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,470
with closing skin?

469
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,470
No, sir.

470
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,570
Amazing how effortlessly

471
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,570
you throw oh-eight stitches.

472
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,610
You too, Dr. Rhodes.

473
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,090
Hey.

474
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,360
Oh, hey.

475
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,710
Your friend, Izzy Latham,

476
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,540
that guy hears

477
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,540
heart sounds that are

478
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,540
practically undetectable.

479
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,580
It's the same

480
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,580
when we play music.

481
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,990
He has

482
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,990
an unbelievable ear.

483
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,650
I mean, my hearing is good,

484
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,650
but this patient today,

485
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,630
Latham caught a murmur.

486
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,630
I didn't.

487
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,630
It just sounded fine to me.

488
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,630
Yeah,

489
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,630
he's not Superman,

490
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,630
you know?

491
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,500
I mean, knowing Izzy,

492
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,500
he's worked

493
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,500
very hard at it,

494
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,100
probably listened

495
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,100
to a lot of hearts.

496
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,870
But you're

497
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,870
a first-year fellow.

498
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,870
You'll get it.

499
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,270
Hey, Nat.

500
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,270
Yeah?

501
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,250
I pulled this out of the gut

502
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,250
of a 14-year-old girl.

503
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,250
Any idea what it is?

504
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,370
I have never seen

505
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,370
anything like it.

506
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,580
Me neither.

507
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,710
Care to find out?

508
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,710
Yeah.

509
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,150
You're gonna be

510
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,150
all right.

511
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,280
Shannon, Mrs. Fisher,

512
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,280
this is Dr. Manning.

513
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,450
Hi.

514
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,520
We removed

515
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,520
this foreign body

516
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,520
from your stomach.

517
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,020
That was inside her?

518
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,160
What is it?

519
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,460
Shannon.

520
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,130
It's mine. I need it back.

521
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,730
Is that something you made

522
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,730
in the basement?

523
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,930
You made that?

524
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,500
Tell them

525
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,500
what it is.

526
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,570
It's a prototype.

527
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,810
For what?

528
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,810
A robot.

529
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,900
A robot?

530
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,140
The idea is

531
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,140
you swallow it.

532
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,580
You swallowed that?

533
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,250
And it can clear blockages

534
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,250
or repair intestinal wall

535
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,250
without surgery.

536
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,790
Excuse me, "clear blockages"?

537
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,790
It caused a blockage.

538
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,720
Okay, so it needs work.

539
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,660
What exactly goes on

540
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,660
in your basement?

541
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,290
Shannon and her friends,

542
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,290
they call themselves

543
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,290
"bio-hackers."

544
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,170
I'm a body-hacker.

545
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,890
Kyle and Jen

546
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,890
are bio-hackers.

547
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,710
Bio-hackers,

548
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,710
genetic engineering,

549
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,710
a bunch of kids?

550
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,810
They make things,

551
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,810
the DIY generation,

552
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,280
turned our basement

553
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,280
into a lab.

554
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,070
I can hardly get to

555
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,070
the washing machine.

556
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,980
I do not want you

557
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,980
experimenting on yourself.

558
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,040
I'll second that.

559
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,210
Yeah, seriously.

560
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,210
This was very dangerous.

561
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
You could have cost

562
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
yourself an operation.

563
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,320
You listen to the doctors.

564
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,310
Can I have it back?

565
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,950
Please?

566
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,430
That's up to your mom.

567
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,070
Body-hacking?

568
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,070
They could really

569
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,070
hurt themselves.

570
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,410
Shouldn't we report this

571
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,410
to someone?

572
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,340
Who? It's not illegal,

573
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,340
just crazy.

574
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,040
Excuse me.

575
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,040
Kids, where do

576
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,040
they get these ideas?

577
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,310
Listen to me,

578
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,310
I sound like my dad.

579
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,310
Your dad would be right.

580
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,750
Still, makes you wonder

581
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,750
what goes on there.

582
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,350
Mmm. See you.

583
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,350
Thanks.

584
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
I just came

585
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
from 3 West.

586
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,250
They said they have

587
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,250
a Mr. Isaac Johnson

588
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,160
who was just transferred

589
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,160
from your ICU.

590
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,700
How can he still be

591
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,700
listed there?

592
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,820
You should have a free bed.

593
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,560
We just didn't get

594
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,560
around to clearing

595
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,560
the computer,

596
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,470
but we already gave

597
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,470
that bed to

598
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,470
an ortho patient.

599
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,170
What about that room?

600
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,210
Oh, that's the Red Room.

601
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,210
"The Red Room"?

602
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,740
That's what

603
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,740
the docs call it.

604
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,970
They won't let us put

605
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,970
their patients there.

606
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,880
Why?

607
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,880
They think

608
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,880
it's bad luck.

609
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,810
Say what?

610
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,720
Three patients

611
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,720
have died in there

612
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,720
in the last two weeks.

613
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,780
They think

614
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,780
it's bad luck.

615
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,950
Doctors.

616
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,860
Nguyen won't operate

617
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,860
without orange socks,

618
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,090
and Bernstein's

619
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,090
gotta play Mandy

620
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,090
in every single surgery,

621
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,320
drives the OR nurses nuts,

622
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,320
and now this.

623
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,000
Dr. Rhodes.

624
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,870
I see you got

625
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,870
a patient in the SICU.

626
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,300
Emergent redo aortic valve.

627
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,640
How do you feel

628
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,640
about transferring him

629
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,640
into that room?

630
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,800
Given the choice,

631
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,800
I'd rather not.

632
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,280
Really, Dr. Rhodes, you?

633
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,280
Why take a chance?

634
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,420
All right,

635
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,420
let's fight fire with fire.

636
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,290
You know that Hawaiian guy

637
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,290
that you talked to me about?

638
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,220
Yeah, Keoni?

639
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,220
Yeah, the one

640
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,220
who owns the bar.

641
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,290
Yeah.

642
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,290
Can you put me

643
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,290
in touch with him?

644
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,230
Yeah, sure.

645
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,230
Thank you.

646
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,110
Okay, so since you

647
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,110
couldn't tolerate

648
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,110
the oral contrast,

649
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,480
the images are nonspecific.

650
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,480
We can't tell much.

651
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,810
Luckily, there's no evidence

652
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,810
of perforation or free fluid.

653
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,780
And you know what?

654
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,780
That pain I was feeling,

655
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,780
it's gone.

656
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,950
Really?

657
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,950
Yeah.

658
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,760
That doesn't hurt at all.

659
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,460
So, uh, I can go home, right?

660
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,540
I'm sorry, no.

661
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,910
I think you need

662
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,910
an operation.

663
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,970
Surgery?

664
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,970
Immediately.

665
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,000
No, no, I told you,

666
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,000
it doesn't hurt anymore.

667
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,170
Well, in this case,

668
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,170
that's not a good sign.

669
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,380
When a section

670
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,380
of the bowel dies,

671
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,380
at first, you can't feel it.

672
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,220
We need to remove

673
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,220
that section

674
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,220
while there's still time,

675
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,590
otherwise it could be fatal.

676
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,150
Page Dr. Rhodes

677
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,150
right now.

678
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,150
Mmm-hmm.

679
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,730
How long has

680
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,730
she been on chemo?

681
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,070
Multiple courses

682
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,070
over the last year.

683
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,760
To get to this.

684
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,670
We're still

685
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,670
in the Dark Ages.

686
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,670
Done.

687
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,540
Peds cases.

688
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,780
You can go in now.

689
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,140
How is she?

690
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,450
Um...

691
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,360
It's too soon to tell.

692
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,990
We have her on dialysis,

693
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,990
that'll take over

694
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,990
the function of her liver.

695
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,800
Is our daughter dying?

696
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,530
Uh... No.

697
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,830
No, she's not.

698
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,410
With dialysis,

699
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,410
she will stabilize

700
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,410
and her labs should improve.

701
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,410
Unfortunately...

702
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,920
The damage to her liver

703
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,920
could be permanent.

704
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,320
She may need

705
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,320
a transplant.

706
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,790
Oh, my God,

707
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,790
a liver transplant?

708
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,790
Another operation?

709
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,050
She's been through

710
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,050
so much.

711
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,050
I know.

712
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,060
I know, but...

713
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,790
Hayley's a fighter.

714
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,850
I've seen these things

715
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,850
turn around.

716
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,390
We're not giving up.

717
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,630
She could pull out

718
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,630
of this.

719
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,630
Thank you.

720
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,110
Little more.

721
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,110
Toward me.

722
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,080
We're on

723
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,080
borrowed time right now.

724
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,210
We need to get him

725
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,210
up there now.

726
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,380
No, look,

727
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,380
I am looking at the scan

728
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,380
myself and I am telling you

729
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,550
I am not taking

730
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,550
him up for surgery.

731
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,460
Connor, he's got

732
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,460
an ischemic bowel.

733
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,860
So show me on the scan.

734
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,860
It's inconclusive.

735
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,860
Exactly.

736
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,990
So you are asking me

737
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,990
to take him up

738
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,990
for a laparoscopy,

739
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,500
possibly an open laparotomy,

740
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,500
on what, your hunch?

741
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,470
Okay, look, he was

742
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,470
in A-fib when he came in.

743
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,470
Uh-huh.

744
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,500
Made me think right off,

745
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,500
a clot had immobilized

746
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,500
to the gut.

747
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,040
Now, his bowel sounds

748
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,040
are gone

749
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,040
and he's distended.

750
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,410
The differential for

751
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,410
what you're describing

752
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,410
is a mile-long,

753
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,750
gastroenteritis

754
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,750
to inflammatory

755
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,750
bowel disease.

756
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,680
This man's bowel

757
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,680
is dying.

758
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,950
I felt it

759
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,950
with my hands.

760
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,050
Your hands?

761
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,710
Yes.

762
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,930
If it wasn't for

763
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,930
what I just went through

764
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,670
with Latham today,

765
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,670
I would say no.

766
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,380
Fine, but for both our sakes,

767
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,380
I hope you're right.

768
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,420
Hey, Dr. Charles.

769
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,160
Do you have a second?

770
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,590
Of course.

771
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,750
I did something today

772
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,750
that I shouldn't have.

773
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,030
I have a patient,

774
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,030
an 11-year-old girl,

775
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,030
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

776
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,870
I've been treating her

777
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,870
for some time now.

778
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,870
Her name's Hayley.

779
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,080
She came back in today

780
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,080
in acute liver failure

781
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,080
with acute cerebral edema.

782
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,250
Sorry to hear that.

783
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,250
Yeah. Um...

784
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,440
Dr. Abrams put in

785
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,440
a ventricular drain.

786
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,710
We've got her on

787
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,710
liver dialysis,

788
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,710
waiting for a transplant.

789
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,780
Sounds about right.

790
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,790
This, on top of

791
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,790
her lymphoma,

792
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,090
I mean, she is

793
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,090
in very bad shape,

794
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,090
Dr. Charles.

795
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,660
Like...

796
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,330
And I told her parents

797
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,330
that she could

798
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,330
pull out of it,

799
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,120
that I've seen it

800
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,120
happen before.

801
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,460
Haven't you?

802
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,410
I gave them hope,

803
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,410
and I don't think

804
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,410
there is any.

805
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,110
Do you really

806
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,110
know that, though?

807
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,300
I didn't give them

808
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,300
an honest assessment, though.

809
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,970
I let my feelings

810
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,970
get in the way

811
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,240
because I so much want

812
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,240
Hayley to pull through.

813
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,120
I didn't

814
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,120
act professionally.

815
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,880
I didn't

816
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,880
prepare them for...

817
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,880
Nat.

818
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,750
You can't

819
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,750
torture yourself.

820
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,990
It's really hard

821
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,990
drawing these lines,

822
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,990
you know?

823
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,000
When do we know

824
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,000
we've become

825
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,000
too involved?

826
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,760
At the very least,

827
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,760
you can't fault yourself

828
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,760
for caring.

829
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,070
Hmm? I don't think

830
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,070
Hayley's parents would

831
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,070
want anything less.

832
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,230
Right?

833
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,800
Yeah.

834
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,840
Yeah.

835
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,610
Thank you.

836
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,960
Dr. Reese,

837
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,960
got a second?

838
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,560
Years ago,

839
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,560
I had a private practice.

840
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,660
I saw patients

841
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,660
on a regular basis.

842
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,470
One of them

843
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,470
was a musician.

844
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,280
Young lady in her 20s.

845
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,270
Talented, funny.

846
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,680
Suffered from bouts of

847
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,680
depression and anxiety,

848
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,880
but we were

849
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,880
working through it.

850
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,780
You know,

851
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,780
she was a brave lady.

852
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,310
Really liked her.

853
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,790
Looked forward to

854
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,790
our sessions together.

855
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,520
One night,

856
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,520
I got a phone call.

857
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,520
3:00 a.m.

858
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,070
She had, uh,

859
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,330
jumped off the roof

860
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,330
of her building.

861
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,300
Left a note.

862
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,700
"Sorry, I'm done."

863
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,910
I couldn't understand

864
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,910
why she killed herself.

865
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,350
Went over my notes,

866
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,350
looking for cues...

867
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,650
You know, things I could've

868
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,650
done differently.

869
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,710
Replayed our conversations

870
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,710
over and over in my head,

871
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,320
wondering what I could've

872
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,320
said or done.

873
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,320
Never got over it.

874
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,500
Sold my practice,

875
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,500
you know, went into

876
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,500
emergency psychiatry.

877
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,240
Swore I would

878
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,240
never get that involved

879
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,240
in anyone's life again.

880
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,610
Look, Sarah,

881
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,940
it was wrong of me to dismiss

882
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,940
your feelings for Danny.

883
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,220
You know,

884
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,220
my issues are my issues,

885
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,220
not yours.

886
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,460
Look, I really

887
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,460
need you to trust me.

888
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,860
Seeing him outside

889
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,860
a clinical setting

890
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,860
is a terrible idea,

891
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,100
especially given the people

892
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,100
he's involved with.

893
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,330
But...

894
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,270
But if you insist on...

895
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,270
I do.

896
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,250
Well, then grab your coat,

897
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,410
'cause I want to

898
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,410
introduce you

899
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,410
to someone who can help,

900
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,510
the right way.

901
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,390
Inject

902
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,390
the Indocyanine Green,

903
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,390
please.

904
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,690
Going in.

905
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,690
Let's get the lights.

906
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,000
That area that's not lit up

907
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,000
is about a foot and a half

908
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,000
of dead bowel.

909
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,370
Lights, please.

910
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,910
You were right.

911
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,910
Gotta open him up.

912
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,370
So, this

913
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,370
hypothetical patient,

914
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,370
female?

915
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,400
Male, hypothetically.

916
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,530
Okay.

917
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,780
And you say he was implanted

918
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,780
with a tracking device?

919
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,180
Yes.

920
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,610
Innovative.

921
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,360
We... We usually see

922
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,360
human trafficking victims

923
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,790
who've been branded

924
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,790
or tattooed, but not this.

925
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,420
How old is he?

926
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,860
We don't have consent

927
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,860
to get any more specific.

928
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,770
Sure.

929
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,370
You want to help this boy

930
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,370
get out of the life.

931
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,580
It's complicated.

932
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,480
Traffickers control

933
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,480
their victims in a number

934
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,480
of ways.

935
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,620
Psychologically, through fear

936
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,620
and emotional abuse,

937
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,210
and physically.

938
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,390
Drugs, torture.

939
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,730
He's up against a lot.

940
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,000
I think it'll help him

941
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,000
open up if he feels like

942
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,000
he can trust you.

943
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,960
Pretty sure

944
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,960
he already does.

945
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,530
Great.

946
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,370
Once he tells you

947
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,370
that he's ready

948
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,370
to involve us,

949
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,340
just call me,

950
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
and we'll start looking

951
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
at ways to extricate him,

952
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,410
but, in the meantime,

953
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,410
you have to be

954
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,410
really careful.

955
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,380
His fears are legitimate.

956
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,120
If these traffickers

957
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,120
find out that he's trying

958
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,120
to get out,

959
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,120
that he could

960
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,120
potentially become

961
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,120
a witness against them,

962
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,720
They'll kill him.

963
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Dr. Abrams?

964
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Tell me if you concur.

965
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,640
Her pupils are large,

966
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,640
sluggish.

967
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,680
What does that mean?

968
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,280
No. Wait.

969
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,590
Wait.

970
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,820
What aren't you

971
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,820
telling us?

972
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,770
Unfortunately, the swelling

973
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,770
in your daughter's brain

974
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,770
is so severe

975
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,130
that it's affecting

976
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,130
the brain stem.

977
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,500
BP's spiking, 200 over 100,

978
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,500
heart rate's falling.

979
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,810
She's crashing.

980
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,810
Call a code.

981
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,940
She's in v-fib,

982
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,940
1 milligram of epi,

983
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,940
charge to 200!

984
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,410
Now!

985
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,820
Hold compressions. Clear.

986
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,180
Still in v-fib.

987
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,450
Charge to 200,

988
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,450
another milligram of epi.

989
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,520
Hold compressions.

990
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,360
Clear.

991
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,760
V-fib's...

992
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,760
Fine v-fib.

993
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,760
Please, please, please.

994
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,330
Asystole.

995
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,810
I'm so sorry. She's gone.

996
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,670
Gone?

997
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,670
Are you...

998
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,670
Are you sure?

999
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,620
Yes. Yes. May we stop?

1000
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,050
Stop?

1001
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,190
I need

1002
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,190
your permission.

1003
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,720
Yes, please,

1004
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,720
for God's sake,

1005
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,720
let her be.

1006
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,920
No, no, no.

1007
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,920
No, no, no, come on.

1008
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,560
Come on, baby, come on.

1009
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,530
Baby, come on.

1010
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,330
No! No! No!

1011
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,160
I hope this

1012
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,160
isn't inconvenient.

1013
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,060
I'm just concerned

1014
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,060
about what Shannon

1015
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,060
and her friends are up to.

1016
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,470
Believe me,

1017
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,470
they won't mind.

1018
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,170
They love to

1019
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,170
show off their lab.

1020
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,170
Little mad scientists.

1021
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,700
But you're very supportive.

1022
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,140
They get so excited.

1023
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,140
They think they can

1024
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,140
do anything.

1025
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,310
Listen, I had to give

1026
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,310
Shannon back that gizmo.

1027
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,380
She said she'd never

1028
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,380
speak to me if I didn't.

1029
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,960
Shannon, look who's here.

1030
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,000
What you're describing,

1031
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,000
the suicidal thoughts,

1032
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,690
the sense of hopelessness,

1033
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,690
lack of energy,

1034
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,490
these are all

1035
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,490
signs of depression.

1036
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,940
And I can prescribe you

1037
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,940
medications that could help,

1038
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,030
but I think we need

1039
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,030
to address something

1040
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,030
more fundamental.

1041
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,440
What do you mean?

1042
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,440
Um...

1043
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,670
Hey, Danny, when we...

1044
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,980
When we examine

1045
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,980
a patient who's in prison,

1046
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,980
we have to ask ourselves,

1047
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,710
"Is this person

1048
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,710
really depressed,

1049
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,950
"or are they just living

1050
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,950
in a situation

1051
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,950
that is so awful,

1052
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,120
"so inherently depressing,

1053
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,460
"that any person would

1054
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,460
have these feelings?"

1055
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,650
So what I'm saying...

1056
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,060
Sorry, um...

1057
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,890
If you were living

1058
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,890
in a better situation,

1059
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,890
you might not be depressed.

1060
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,840
You mean leave them?

1061
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,210
Yes.

1062
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,210
No.

1063
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
No, no, I can't.

1064
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,110
These people,

1065
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,110
they'll hurt me.

1066
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,070
We can protect you.

1067
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,280
What about the heroin?

1068
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,590
I need it, you know that.

1069
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,590
They give it to me.

1070
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,650
We can get you off of heroin.

1071
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,650
You won't need it anymore.

1072
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,260
They'll find me.

1073
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,260
They will, they always do.

1074
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,060
Well, of course they do.

1075
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,060
They put a tracking device,

1076
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,060
a chip, in you,

1077
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,060
but we can take it out,

1078
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,060
and then they won't

1079
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,060
be able to find you.

1080
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,390
You don't know these people.

1081
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,390
They're too smart.

1082
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,560
Okay, Danny,

1083
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,300
you don't have to make

1084
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,300
any decisions right now.

1085
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,040
I just want you to know

1086
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,040
things can be different.

1087
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,710
This was a bad idea.

1088
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,710
I shouldn't have come.

1089
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,840
This was a bad idea.

1090
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,840
No! No!

1091
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,840
No, Danny. Danny!

1092
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,670
I heard. I'm sorry.

1093
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,840
Yeah.

1094
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,250
We ran the code, all the time

1095
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,250
knowing it was hopeless.

1096
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,110
Yeah.

1097
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,110
I failed her.

1098
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,990
You did everything

1099
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,990
you could.

1100
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,990
No, I did everything I could,

1101
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,530
and it wasn't enough.

1102
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,650
I felt helpless, Ethan,

1103
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,650
watching that

1104
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,650
little girl slip away.

1105
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,830
How many more kids

1106
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,830
like Hayley are we gonna

1107
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,830
have to lose?

1108
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,990
Nat,

1109
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,800
you know

1110
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,800
that patient of mine

1111
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,800
you saw today, Shannon?

1112
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,340
Yeah.

1113
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,440
I was worried about her,

1114
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,440
so I went to see her lab.

1115
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,010
Nat, you can't believe it,

1116
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,010
they're doing

1117
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,010
gene sequencing.

1118
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,020
One kid's trying to make

1119
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,020
an affordable Hep C drug,

1120
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,750
another's trying

1121
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,750
to bio-engineer

1122
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,750
chicken meat

1123
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,920
so we never have to

1124
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,920
kill another chicken.

1125
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,190
Okay.

1126
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,190
These kids

1127
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,730
are doing stuff

1128
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,730
in a basement

1129
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,000
that 10 years ago

1130
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,000
you could only do

1131
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,170
at a major university

1132
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,170
or hospital lab.

1133
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,370
You should go.

1134
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,870
Make you feel better.

1135
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,910
Make me feel better?

1136
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,850
Nat, when we find

1137
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,850
the cure for cancer,

1138
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,790
it might just come out

1139
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,790
of a lab like that one.

1140
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,340
Keoni.

1141
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,280
How's it, brah?

1142
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,280
Good, good.

1143
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,440
That's the room?

1144
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,440
That's it.

1145
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,430
Not a healing atmosphere.

1146
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,580
Can you do anything?

1147
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,580
Oh, yeah.

1148
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,350
What?

1149
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,760
You said he told you

1150
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,760
that certain abilities

1151
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,760
ran in his family.

1152
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,990
The shaman thing?

1153
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,990
Seriously?

1154
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,090
Show some respect,

1155
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,090
Dr. Rhodes,

1156
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,090
the term is "kahuna."

1157
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,330
And for a man who thinks

1158
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,330
a room can be unlucky,

1159
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,130
you're one to judge.

1160
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,200
Just calm down.

1161
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,200
It's okay, just calm down.

1162
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,440
Dr. Choi, incoming.

1163
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,440
Trauma Two's open.

1164
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,480
Nineteen-year-old male,

1165
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,480
found on the street

1166
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,020
with a self-inflicted

1167
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,020
wound to the right flank.

1168
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,710
Sarah!

1169
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,710
April, page Dr. Reese.

1170
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,450
Yeah.

1171
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,450
GCS 15 but lethargic.

1172
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,820
BP 110 over 60.

1173
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,720
About 200 of blood loss

1174
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,720
at the scene.

1175
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,490
I need Dr. Reese!

1176
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,420
Looks superficial,

1177
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,420
but there's still

1178
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,420
a lot of bleeding.

1179
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,990
Type and cross

1180
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,990
and hang a unit.

1181
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,990
Right.

1182
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,900
And a liter of

1183
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,900
normal saline.

1184
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,900
Yup.

1185
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,040
Danny.

1186
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,040
He cut himself.

1187
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,470
Were you trying

1188
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,470
to kill yourself?

1189
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,240
No,

1190
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,240
I tried to cut it out,

1191
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,240
the chip.

1192
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,270
The chip?

1193
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,900
I want... I want to live.

1194
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,780
I want to get away

1195
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,780
from them. Help me.

1196
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,740
Okay.

1197
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,920
We're culturing

1198
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,920
gut bacteria over here.

1199
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,320
Maybe we can reprogram

1200
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,320
some E. coli Nissle

1201
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,320
to boost the immune system.

1202
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,730
But Nissle's

1203
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,730
not dangerous.

1204
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,400
Still, what level of safety

1205
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,400
are you operating at?

1206
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,760
BSL-1.

1207
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,760
Maybe one and a half.

1208
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,330
What we're doing here

1209
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,330
doesn't need more than that.

1210
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,640
And who's supervising

1211
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,640
all of this?

1212
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,970
Ms. Herbert,

1213
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,970
our biology teacher.

1214
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,910
But I don't think

1215
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,910
she really gets

1216
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,910
what we're doing.

1217
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,810
She just tries to make sure

1218
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,810
we don't kill ourselves.

1219
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,820
Oh! This is cool.

1220
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,820
Kyle, show her the ear.

1221
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,250
He took a slice of apple

1222
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,250
and implanted it

1223
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,250
with HeLa cells.

1224
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,520
The cellulose in the apple

1225
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,520
is kind of like scaffolding

1226
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,760
for the cells to grow on.

1227
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,220
Wow.

1228
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,760
That really looks

1229
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,760
like an ear.

1230
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,900
Well, it's not.

1231
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,900
I carved it to

1232
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,900
make it look like one.

1233
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,160
But it's not

1234
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,160
apple anymore, either.

1235
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,350
Well, when I was your age,

1236
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,350
I was working with

1237
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,350
hippocampal cultures,

1238
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:50,040
studying the transduction

1239
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:50,040
pathways with

1240
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:50,040
short interfering DNA.

1241
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,620
I know, big deal, so 1995.

1242
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,720
You were

1243
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,720
a science geek, too?

1244
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,720
Mmm-hmm.

1245
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,790
And I would've killed

1246
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,790
to have a place like this.

1247
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,450
Let me ask you a question.

1248
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,730
What do you know about

1249
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,730
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?

1250
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,800
Blood cancer.

1251
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,800
Body produces a lot of

1252
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,800
abnormal lymphocytes.

1253
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,900
How'd you like

1254
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,900
to give it a shot?

1255
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,880
The room is clear.

1256
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,120
"Clear"?

1257
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,120
For lack of a better word.

1258
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,100
All right, now. Everybody,

1259
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,100
you heard the man.

1260
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,660
The room is good now.

1261
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm sending patients up.

1262
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,200
No argument.

1263
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,200
Okay.

1264
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,160
Mahalo.

1265
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,770
Mahalo nui.

1266
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,800
Come on,

1267
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,800
you don't actually think

1268
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,370
that there was

1269
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,370
anything wrong

1270
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,370
with the room, right?

1271
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,770
Oh, yeah.

1272
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,770
It's just physics.

1273
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,580
Physics?

1274
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,280
Vibrations from sound waves.

1275
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,610
They create

1276
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,610
micro-movements in things.

1277
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,180
They imprint themselves.

1278
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,420
So, stuff in a room,

1279
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,420
tables, chairs, walls,

1280
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,820
they get changed

1281
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,820
very slightly,

1282
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,120
but they get changed.

1283
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,390
A lot of grief

1284
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,390
and anger in there,

1285
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,230
left its mark.

1286
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,830
Not helpful to the ill.

1287
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,560
So, how do you fix that?

1288
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,530
You can't erase things,

1289
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,710
but you can write over them.

1290
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,390
Big first step.

1291
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,460
Remember, it's just

1292
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,460
the beginning.

1293
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,300
What do you want

1294
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,300
to do with this?

1295
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,770
I'll take it.

1296
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,980
Hey, I just checked in

1297
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,980
on Mr. Logan.

1298
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,980
He's doing fine.

1299
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,510
He said to say thank you,

1300
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,680
and he would like to know

1301
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,680
when he's going home.

1302
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,620
That was a tough

1303
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,620
diagnosis you made.

1304
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,030
How could you be so sure?

1305
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,140
When I was a fourth-year,

1306
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,140
I did a rotation with

1307
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,140
this amazing surgeon,

1308
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,900
real old-school.

1309
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,640
Unbelievable diagnostician.

1310
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,440
Didn't need a scan.

1311
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,180
She had such great hands.

1312
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,810
Just by touch,

1313
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,810
she could tell

1314
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,810
if a patient had

1315
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,790
cystic fibrosis,

1316
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,790
renal cysts.

1317
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,220
They don't make 'em

1318
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,220
like that anymore.

1319
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,950
I think I know one.

1320
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,330
You know, it's a good thing

1321
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,330
I didn't know

1322
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,330
what I didn't know

1323
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,630
before I became a doctor.

1324
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,630
I don't think

1325
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,630
that I would've.

1326
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,230
Oh, who would?

1327
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,400
Good night.

1328
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,400
Good night, Will.

1329
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,340
Hey, looking good.

1330
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,820
Hello, Dr. Rowan.

1331
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,450
Hello.

1332
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,460
Here you go.

1333
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,460
Oh.

1334
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,600
How are you today?

1335
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,400
Oh, fit as a fiddle.

1336
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,710
Mom said we're

1337
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,710
going to take a train.

1338
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,980
Perfect.

1339
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,170
I love trains.

1340
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,180
You know, Dr. Rowan,

1341
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,690
you were my teacher.

1342
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,660
Was I?

1343
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,250
That's right.

1344
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,790
You were a surgeon.

1345
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,420
The best.

1346
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,030
How about that?

1347
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,430
Yeah.

1348
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,170
And I wanted to tell you,

1349
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,680
today, what you taught

1350
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,680
me saved a man's life.

1351
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,310
Oh.

1352
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,140
Thank you.

1353
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,140
Oh, you're welcome.
