1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,000
Chicago Med, we're inbound

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,000
with a 24-year-old female,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,000
Cheryl Martin.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,840
High-speed

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,840
collision on Route 30.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,770
T-boned on the

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,770
passenger side.

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,040
Thirty-four weeks pregnant.

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,040
Chest and belly pain.

10
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,210
Heart rate 124,

11
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,210
BP 102 over 80.

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,810
Got it. We'll be waiting.

13
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,850
Dr. Halstead.

14
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,850
Maggie.

15
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,510
Incoming helo,

16
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,510
10 minutes out.

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,850
Double cappuccino.

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,450
What are you

19
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,450
doing with my phone?

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm posting.

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,580
Oh.

22
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,110
My little girl...

23
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,110
Please...

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,460
Baghdad.

25
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,760
Page OB.

26
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,760
Got it!

27
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,820
Maggie.

28
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,820
Yup!

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,990
Dad?

30
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,990
I'm here, honey.

31
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,060
Need an assist?

32
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,060
Sure.

33
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,440
Coming through!

34
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,440
Need X-rays.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,440
Chest and pelvis.

36
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,500
Got it. Sir, what

37
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,500
is your name?

38
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,500
Ray.

39
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,580
Why don't you come with me

40
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,580
and let the doctors

41
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,580
do their work? Okay?

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,870
No, Dad. Dad, please.

43
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,410
This way.

44
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,410
Stay right here.

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,650
He'll be right here, sweetie.

46
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,210
On my count.

47
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,210
One, two, three.

48
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,880
I need the ultrasound.

49
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,880
Should I start

50
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,880
a femoral line?

51
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,880
I'll do that.

52
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,490
Okay, get

53
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,490
a triple lumen and blood.

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,490
Excuse me.

55
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,620
Lungs are wet.

56
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,890
Belly's soft but tender.

57
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,930
Get a CBC, type and screen,

58
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,930
KB and coags.

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,070
If she's Rh-negative,

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,070
give RhoGAM.

61
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,200
Got good heart tones

62
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,200
and fetal movement.

63
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,200
Baby and placenta look okay.

64
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,910
I'm in. Clear.

65
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,480
Natalie.

66
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,250
Left hemothorax.

67
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,250
She's bleeding.

68
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,590
Put in a chest tube

69
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,590
and give her back all

70
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,590
the blood you get out.

71
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,060
We're gonna put

72
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,060
a tube in your chest, okay?

73
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,100
My baby...

74
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,100
Won't hurt the baby.

75
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,690
Betadyne and lidocaine.

76
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,690
I got it.

77
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,170
I'm in.

78
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,920
Secure the tube and

79
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,920
let's get her over to CT.

80
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,560
We're taking your daughter up

81
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,560
for a CAT scan. You can come.

82
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,650
Okay.

83
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
Dr. Rhodes.

84
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,610
Welcome to CT Surgery.

85
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,010
Dr. Latham. Thank you.

86
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,110
I'll be supervising

87
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,110
your fellowship.

88
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,770
I look forward to it.

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,240
Dr. Downey thought

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,240
very highly of you.

91
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,610
I'm curious.

92
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,610
There are rumors.

93
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,180
Did you kill him?

94
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm sorry?

95
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,430
Did you?

96
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,690
Well, yes. I killed him

97
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,690
and several other

98
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,690
patients as well.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,990
You're being sarcastic.

100
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,570
Yes, Dr. Latham.

101
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,570
I am being sarcastic.

102
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,130
I can see why

103
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,130
you might have found

104
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,130
that inappropriate.

105
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,740
Oh, I should tell you.

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,150
You weren't my first choice

107
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,150
for this fellowship.

108
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,650
I preferred a young woman

109
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,650
from Groote Schuur,

110
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,650
but I was out-voted.

111
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,280
Such is life.

112
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,860
That being said,

113
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,860
I hope we will

114
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,860
work well together.

115
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,400
Sputum test

116
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,400
was negative.

117
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,930
Chest is clear.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,700
Night sweats?

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,700
No.

120
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,570
Good. TB's still latent.

121
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,170
For now.

122
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,770
No reason it

123
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,770
shouldn't stay

124
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,770
that way.

125
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,240
Anything I need to know?

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,690
I worry about

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,690
Tate and his son.

128
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,090
They've been tested, April.

129
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,090
They're negative.

130
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,190
And you're not contagious.

131
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,520
I know. I know. But...

132
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,420
What?

133
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,560
I just don't feel

134
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,830
clean.

135
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,640
New residents settling in?

136
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,140
Yeah. I just gotta keep 'em

137
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,140
from killing people.

138
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,240
July first is not a good day

139
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,240
to need a hospital.

140
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,410
And how are you doing?

141
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,990
Cleaned out Bert's

142
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,990
desk this morning.

143
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,720
Thought it would

144
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,720
make me feel better.

145
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,360
It didn't.

146
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,360
Mmm.

147
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,290
Good morning.

148
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,290
Dr. Choi.

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,330
Our new Chief Resident

150
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,330
will need this.

151
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,690
ED staff contact list.

152
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,690
Thank you.

153
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,460
Oh, and one more thing.

154
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,030
I know I got

155
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,030
the Chief Resident's

156
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,030
gavel here somewhere.

157
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,930
Funny.

158
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,240
By the way, Maggie,

159
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,240
I've got some ideas

160
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,240
to improve patient flow.

161
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,740
Oh! Can't wait

162
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,740
to hear about them.

163
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,110
I hate killing their dreams.

164
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,880
No, you like to let

165
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,880
them hang themselves.

166
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,460
Morning.

167
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,020
Hey.

168
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,500
Here are

169
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,500
my scheduling sheets.

170
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,270
Last Chief Res

171
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,270
gave them to me.

172
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,030
Thanks, but I've got

173
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,030
my own system.

174
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,160
How we ran sick bay

175
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,160
on the carrier.

176
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,670
Hey, Dr. Choi,

177
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,670
I'm taking off.

178
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,170
I texted you

179
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,170
I'm switching shifts

180
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,170
with Elise Baker.

181
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,000
Right, yeah.

182
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,100
And she also,

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,100
she called,

184
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,270
she said she's going

185
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,270
to be a little late.

186
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,580
She has to take

187
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,580
her kid in for shots.

188
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,880
No problem, thanks.

189
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,950
Sure you don't

190
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,950
want these sheets?

191
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,410
No, I got it.

192
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,090
Dr. Choi, we need you.

193
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,120
Chout, talk to me.

194
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,430
Emmie Miles,

195
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,430
15-year-old girl.

196
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,800
Found unconscious,

197
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,800
suspected opioid overdose.

198
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,800
She appeared to have

199
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,800
smoked a fentanyl patch.

200
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,860
Okay, we're going

201
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,860
to Treatment...

202
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,860
Six.

203
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,300
I got it, Maggie.

204
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,300
All right.

205
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,170
You give her Narcan?

206
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,170
Five times.

207
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,410
She responded in the ambo,

208
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,410
just slid back into overdose.

209
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,010
All right,

210
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,010
let's move her.

211
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,870
On my count. Ready?

212
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,350
One, two, three.

213
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,690
April, let's give her

214
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,690
another two milligrams

215
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,690
Narcan and hang a drip.

216
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,080
Got it.

217
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,080
Bring her down slowly.

218
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,320
Don't want to

219
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,320
precipitate withdrawal.

220
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,260
Chout. Fentanyl patch.

221
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,260
This girl try to kill herself?

222
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,550
No idea, Doc.

223
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,170
Grande, quad, half-caf,

224
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,170
nonfat, no whip mocha?

225
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,900
Not half-caf.

226
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,900
Three shots regular,

227
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,900
one shot decaf.

228
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,070
Okay.

229
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,400
So, what happened

230
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,400
to your knee?

231
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,970
I'm embarrassed to say

232
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,970
I tripped over a suitcase.

233
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,100
Missed my conference

234
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,100
in Lyon.

235
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,250
At least I got

236
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,250
to practice French

237
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,680
with an orthopedic

238
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,680
nurse from Montreal.

239
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,920
So, Dr. Reese,

240
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,920
reason I'm here...

241
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,750
Uh, aside from the coffee,

242
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,750
of course,

243
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,530
is that Med

244
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,530
has a residency opening

245
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,530
for you.

246
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,060
I'll take it.

247
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,060
On my service.

248
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,730
Psychiatry? Okay.

249
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,730
Enough foam, enough foam.

250
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,500
Um...

251
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,310
Dr. Charles, thank you,

252
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,310
but I've never

253
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,310
considered psychiatry.

254
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,440
I don't think

255
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,440
I'm equipped.

256
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,110
I think you have

257
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,110
all the tools.

258
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,210
You're a problem solver.

259
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,780
You pay attention.

260
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,250
And look at how beautiful

261
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,250
you're making my coffee

262
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,340
despite

263
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,340
all my meddling.

264
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,610
But... I don't know

265
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,610
how to talk to people.

266
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,690
It's actually

267
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,690
more about listening

268
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,690
than talking.

269
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,620
Grande, quad,

270
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,620
three-quarters caf,

271
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,620
nonfat, no whip mocha.

272
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,560
I'll tell you what.

273
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,570
How about you come

274
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,570
and spend the day with me,

275
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,060
and then see what you think.

276
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,210
She has a contained

277
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,210
rupture of the aorta.

278
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,210
Pseudoaneurysm.

279
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,700
That's how we read it.

280
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,140
It's leaking.

281
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,970
Let's get her up to

282
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,970
the cath lab, fix it.

283
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,280
Cheryl's 34 weeks pregnant.

284
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,280
Wouldn't that

285
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,280
irradiate the baby?

286
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,040
Well, it's not ideal,

287
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,040
but it's very

288
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,040
little radiation.

289
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,410
What about surgery?

290
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,610
That's the other option.

291
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,950
We'd have to

292
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,950
put her on bypass.

293
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,390
We can't protect

294
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,390
the baby's heart rate.

295
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,620
So, let's give her

296
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,620
a C-section.

297
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,750
Take the baby out

298
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,750
of the equation.

299
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,690
No. She could still

300
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,690
carry this baby to term.

301
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,730
Natalie, you are very

302
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,730
concerned about the baby,

303
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,860
but what about the mother?

304
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,130
She is lying there

305
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,130
with an aortic injury.

306
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,000
Honey.

307
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,000
Dad.

308
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,670
Your daughter

309
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,670
has some damage

310
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,670
to her aorta.

311
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,370
It's what we call

312
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,370
a pseudoaneurysm.

313
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,840
And it caused a leak

314
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,840
in the vessel wall.

315
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,550
Sometimes a leak like this

316
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,550
will stop on its own.

317
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,260
If that's the case,

318
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,260
then Cheryl will be able

319
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,260
to carry the baby to term.

320
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,520
So at this point,

321
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,520
we're just going

322
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,520
to wait and watch.

323
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,160
We're gonna take

324
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,160
her up to the ICU

325
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,690
where we can keep

326
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,690
a close eye on her.

327
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,420
Whatever you think

328
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,420
is best.

329
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,590
Oh, my chest.

330
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,300
Mr. Buckner?

331
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,300
Daddy?

332
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,170
He's having an MI.

333
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,170
Dad?

334
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,240
Daddy,

335
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,240
what's happening?

336
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,240
No pulse. Code Blue.

337
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,280
Radiology hallway.

338
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,280
We need a crash cart.

339
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,280
Yes.

340
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,310
Daddy!

341
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,310
We're gonna take care

342
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,310
of him. Just lie still.

343
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,280
Bringing

344
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,280
the cart and monitor.

345
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,280
Just stay here.

346
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,280
Nat, get a quick look.

347
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,020
He's in v-fib.

348
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,020
Charge to 200.

349
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,120
Hold compressions. Clear.

350
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,730
Clear.

351
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,270
Still in v-fib. Clear!

352
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,720
Clear.

353
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,770
Daddy.

354
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,770
Sinus rhythm.

355
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,070
We got a pulse.

356
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,070
He's back.

357
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,640
Let's get him up

358
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,640
to the cath lab now.

359
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,870
On my count.

360
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,870
One, two three.

361
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,870
Daddy. Daddy!

362
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,570
Daddy!

363
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,540
All right, let's go.

364
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,540
Huge ST changes.

365
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,520
Yeah,

366
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,520
it's a bad one.

367
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,300
Morning, Dr. Choi.

368
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,300
Morning.

369
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,770
This your

370
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,770
fentanyl OD?

371
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,830
Yes.

372
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,110
Sarah. Are you back?

373
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,370
I've invited Dr. Reese

374
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,370
to become a psych resident.

375
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,570
That's great.

376
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,570
You think so?

377
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,970
Absolutely.

378
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,950
I'm a great believer

379
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,950
in psychiatry.

380
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,350
Hmm. Interesting.

381
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,820
Dr. Charles, this is the

382
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,820
patient's mother, Mrs. Miles.

383
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,550
Hey.

384
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,550
Nice to meet you,

385
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,550
Mrs. Miles.

386
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,260
This is my colleague,

387
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,260
Dr. Reese.

388
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,790
I don't understand this.

389
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,790
Emmie doesn't use drugs.

390
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,590
A fentanyl patch

391
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,590
is a very high dose

392
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,590
of a very strong opioid.

393
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,400
This is a difficult question,

394
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,400
but I have to ask it.

395
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,410
Do you think

396
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,410
there's any chance

397
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,410
that your daughter

398
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,870
could have been trying

399
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,870
to take her own life?

400
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,410
No, absolutely not.

401
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,640
She's very popular.

402
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,640
She has hundreds of friends.

403
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,240
She has no reason

404
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,240
to kill herself.

405
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,780
Do you have any idea

406
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,780
how she might have gotten

407
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,780
hold of the patch?

408
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,480
My mother has cancer.

409
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,220
She's prescribed

410
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,220
fentanyl patches

411
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,220
for pain.

412
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,520
I suppose she could...

413
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,590
Would you mind if we

414
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,590
talk with her for a bit?

415
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,790
Please. Go ahead.

416
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,330
Thank you.

417
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,270
Honey, I'll be back

418
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,270
in a couple minutes, hmm?

419
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,980
Hi, Emmie,

420
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,980
how are you feeling?

421
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm Dr. Charles.

422
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,650
And I'm Dr. Reese.

423
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,920
Can you tell us

424
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,920
what happened today?

425
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,850
Leave me alone.

426
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,660
We're concerned

427
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,660
about you, Emmie,

428
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,230
and we need to

429
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,230
understand what happened

430
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,730
so that we can

431
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,730
take care of you.

432
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,660
We just want to help.

433
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,470
You know what?

434
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,470
Why don't we

435
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,470
come back later?

436
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,180
And maybe you'll

437
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,180
feel like talking then.

438
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,150
You know who the most unhappy

439
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,150
people in the world are?

440
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,920
Hmm?

441
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,920
Fifteen-year-old girls.

442
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,090
I remember.

443
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,490
Mom said Emmie had

444
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,490
hundreds of friends.

445
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,830
Hyperbole?

446
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,830
Maybe not.

447
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,960
She could have

448
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,960
hundreds of friends.

449
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,330
Oh, like that.

450
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,900
Girls her age

451
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,900
share everything.

452
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,900
They judge everything.

453
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,740
Maybe Emmie was shamed,

454
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,740
and that led to

455
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,740
a suicide attempt.

456
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,910
Let me know

457
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,910
what you find.

458
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,910
Mmm-hmm.

459
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,710
Nice bunch of newbies.

460
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,090
Maybe even the Ice Princess

461
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,090
will finally find somebody.

462
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,850
The Ice Princess?

463
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,020
Yeah, Dr. Manning,

464
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,020
who else?

465
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,190
Just a princess?

466
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,190
Why not the Ice Queen?

467
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,830
It was a joke.

468
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,040
It was a joke.

469
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,370
Dr. Halstead.

470
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,290
HR informed me

471
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,290
that you still

472
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,290
haven't supplied them

473
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,420
with current

474
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,420
malpractice insurance.

475
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,090
Oh, I'm trying to find

476
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,090
a carrier that'll

477
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,090
write me a policy.

478
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm guessing that's

479
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
because of the lawsuit.

480
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,130
Doesn't make sense.

481
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,130
The suit was dropped.

482
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,370
But to an insurance company,

483
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,370
you still look

484
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,370
like a bad risk.

485
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,000
Attending physicians

486
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,000
must provide

487
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,010
their own

488
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,010
malpractice insurance.

489
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,610
Now, the hospital can give you

490
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,610
a grace period of two weeks,

491
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,440
but after that...

492
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,440
I understand.

493
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,090
Look, I know you and I

494
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,090
have had our ups and downs,

495
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,850
but I don't want to lose you.

496
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,520
So I'll make a few calls.

497
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,790
Thank you.

498
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,230
You may not want to thank me.

499
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,260
I guarantee, your insurance

500
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,260
will not come cheap.

501
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,660
Courtney?

502
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,660
Thirty-three-year-old male,

503
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,610
peds vs. auto. GCS 15.

504
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,910
Bruising to the right orbit,

505
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,910
no loss of consciousness.

506
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,380
All right.

507
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,380
Wait a second. Dr. Choi.

508
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,080
Got a GSW in Baghdad.

509
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,080
Where's Baker?

510
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,540
Took her kid in

511
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,540
for shots, remember?

512
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,050
I'll take it.

513
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,050
What room,

514
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,050
Dr. Choi?

515
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,350
Trauma Three.

516
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,350
You heard your Chief Resident.

517
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,350
Let's go.

518
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,680
It's... It's occupied.

519
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,980
Dr. Choi.

520
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,860
Go to Trauma Two. Rotate.

521
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,860
Patient told me

522
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,860
he's HIV-positive.

523
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,960
That's right, be careful.

524
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,120
No problem.

525
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,690
On my count.

526
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,690
One, two, three.

527
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,970
Get it out.

528
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,800
Can you tell me

529
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,800
your name, sir?

530
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,440
Greg Allen.

531
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,840
Can you tell me

532
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,840
how this happened?

533
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,770
Crossing the street.

534
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,770
Wasn't looking.

535
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,220
Will somebody

536
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,220
please call my wife?

537
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,220
The number's in my wallet.

538
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,380
I will.

539
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,080
Lungs are clear.

540
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,550
I'll take it from here.

541
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,550
I got it.

542
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,290
I'll take it.

543
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,690
Thank you.

544
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,690
I'm HIV-positive.

545
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,060
Okay. Follow my finger.

546
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,800
All right,

547
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,800
retractor's in.

548
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,230
Looks good.

549
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,210
Let's harvest.

550
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,210
Check the LIMA pulse.

551
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,050
The LIMA looks small.

552
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,050
How about the saphenous vein?

553
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,380
No. The left

554
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,380
internal mammary artery

555
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,720
is always the first

556
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,720
and best option.

557
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,490
I understand.

558
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,490
It's just...

559
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,360
Dr. Downey preferred

560
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,360
the saphenous vein

561
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,360
to a small LIMA.

562
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,590
LIMA pulse is good,

563
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,590
let's start freeing it up.

564
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,030
If you're sure.

565
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,970
I know what I'm doing,

566
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,970
and I don't like

567
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,970
to be contradicted

568
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,840
by a fellow

569
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,840
while I am operating!

570
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,810
Give me the Bovie.

571
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,170
And Emmie does have

572
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,170
hundreds of friends,

573
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,170
623 to be exact.

574
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,940
She's on a lot of

575
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,940
social media platforms.

576
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,280
Six hundred and

577
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,280
twenty-three friends?

578
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,280
Yikes.

579
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,150
Who do you invite to

580
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,150
the birthday party?

581
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,580
Mmm-hmm. And she isn't

582
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,580
always very nice

583
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,580
to the other girls.

584
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,510
Not very nice?

585
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,890
She wasn't shamed.

586
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,890
She's the shamer.

587
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,890
Interesting.

588
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,050
Well, so what do you think?

589
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,090
Maybe Emmie realized

590
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,090
she really hurt someone

591
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,090
and she felt guilty.

592
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,830
Guilty enough

593
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,830
to kill herself?

594
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,820
Mmm, I don't know.

595
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,590
You know what?

596
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,030
We got to get

597
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,030
Emmie to open up.

598
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Next time Mom takes a break,

599
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,200
jump in there,

600
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,200
give it another shot.

601
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,100
Uh, Dr. Charles, wait.

602
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,100
Where are you going?

603
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,680
Well, I just thought

604
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,680
Emmie might be

605
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,680
more comfortable

606
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,210
talking to a woman.

607
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,840
And somebody her own age.

608
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,350
But I don't know what

609
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,350
to say or what to ask.

610
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,890
I think that once

611
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,890
you get in there,

612
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,890
you'll discover that you do.

613
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,820
Thank you.

614
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,820
It's just...

615
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,460
I hate standing around.

616
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,890
I mean, I've had

617
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,890
a lot of experience,

618
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,260
and this guy won't

619
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,260
let me do anything.

620
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,200
I know he's your friend

621
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,200
and I'm sure he's a

622
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,200
really good doctor, but...

623
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,110
Mmm-hmm.

624
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,370
I don't know.

625
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,380
Jeff, can I...

626
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,380
Can I ask you something?

627
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,910
Yeah.

628
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,980
Do I seem like a...

629
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,980
An Ice Princess?

630
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,710
A what?

631
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,050
A nurse called me

632
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,050
that today.

633
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,580
Uh, do I come across

634
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,580
as rigid or uptight?

635
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,520
Really? Come on.

636
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,060
Do you remember back

637
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,060
when the four of us

638
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,060
were hanging out?

639
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,330
You were the one who always

640
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,330
kept the party going.

641
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,640
Do you remember that one time

642
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,640
we were at a Greek restaurant?

643
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,070
There was

644
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,070
a wedding party next to us,

645
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,070
and they were breaking plates.

646
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,070
So you got us to

647
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,070
start breaking plates...

648
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,300
And the next thing you know,

649
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,300
you're standing on the table,

650
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,510
and you're waving your arms

651
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,510
and you were yelling,

652
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,510
like, "Opa! Opa!"

653
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,380
You were crazy.

654
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,380
Oh, my God, yes.

655
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,680
The bouzouki player

656
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,680
wanted me to join the band.

657
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,240
That's right.

658
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,240
That was great.

659
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,240
Mmm-hmm.

660
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,650
Yeah. Yeah,

661
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,650
it really was.

662
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,390
See, I told you.

663
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,390
Everything's gonna be okay.

664
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,060
I still have to

665
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,060
be on antibiotics

666
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,060
for another five months.

667
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,660
Hey, we... We'll be

668
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,660
all clear by New Year's.

669
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,510
So, tonight,

670
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,510
you're gonna come over.

671
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,510
I'll cook dinner.

672
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,480
I'll see how

673
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,480
I feel after work.

674
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,620
Okay.

675
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,750
You're not contagious, honey.

676
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,730
Doesn't hurt to be careful.

677
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,160
Okay.

678
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,950
Hey.

679
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,950
How are you feeling?

680
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,160
Your, uh...

681
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,160
Your blood pressure

682
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,160
looks good.

683
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,230
And your heart rate...

684
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,230
Are you a shrink?

685
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,300
Uh, no.

686
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,870
I'm barely a doctor.

687
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,870
I just graduated

688
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,870
medical school.

689
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,020
I was, uh, checking out

690
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,020
your Instagram photos.

691
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,150
And you look

692
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,150
really beautiful.

693
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,360
I always hate

694
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,360
the way I look

695
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,360
in photos.

696
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,880
Mmm...

697
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,090
You need to take a lot.

698
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,490
You do?

699
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,820
I took about 100

700
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,820
to get that one.

701
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,030
Oh...

702
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,900
I have to look perfect

703
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,900
or I won't send it.

704
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,500
You've been

705
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,500
reading my tweets too?

706
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,370
Mmm-hmm.

707
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,310
You must think

708
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,310
I'm a horrible person.

709
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,780
Why would I think that?

710
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,350
'Cause of what

711
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,350
I say about other girls.

712
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,680
No.

713
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,880
No, I, um...

714
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,330
I just think you're

715
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,330
under a lot of pressure

716
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,330
to be perfect.

717
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,270
Oh, God.

718
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,530
Emmie?

719
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,530
I'm not...

720
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,170
I'm not perfect.

721
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,050
Emmie, nobody is.

722
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,150
You don't understand.

723
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,720
Look.

724
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,390
It's vitiligo.

725
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,490
I googled it.

726
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,490
You can't cure it.

727
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,540
It's gonna spread

728
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,540
all over my body.

729
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,700
Every... Everybody's

730
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,700
gonna make fun of me.

731
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,700
My life is ruined.

732
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,500
Emmie, did you try

733
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,500
to kill yourself?

734
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,270
I don't know.

735
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,310
You don't know?

736
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,150
I just...

737
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,150
I just wanted it all

738
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,150
to go away.

739
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,660
I'm gonna take a skin

740
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,660
scraping. Is that okay?

741
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,310
He extubated easily,

742
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,310
and the graft is in.

743
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,940
You were right

744
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,940
about using the LIMA.

745
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,050
True, but he's hemolyzing.

746
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,810
His urine output is

747
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,810
marginal and pink.

748
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,580
Neither's uncommon

749
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,580
after being on pump.

750
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,780
Nothing to suggest

751
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,780
he won't make a full recovery.

752
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,850
There's also nothing

753
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,850
to suggest he will.

754
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,890
Dr. Latham.

755
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,090
Um...

756
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,260
I realize, like every

757
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,260
doctor who teaches here,

758
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,860
you have your own methods.

759
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,300
But, I assume,

760
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,300
if I have an opinion,

761
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,300
you'd like to hear it.

762
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,940
Well, of course. Why?

763
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,750
Well, it's just that

764
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,750
you seemed very upset

765
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,750
in the OR.

766
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,480
Did I?

767
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,140
Yes.

768
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,180
I'm not upset.

769
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,760
I can't see! Help me!

770
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,420
Mr. Allen?

771
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,560
I can't see out

772
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,560
of my right eye.

773
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,630
Dr. Wheeler!

774
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,240
I can't see out

775
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,240
of my right eye!

776
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,570
The CT showed a hematoma.

777
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,330
Check the

778
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,330
intraocular pressure.

779
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Where's my wife?

780
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
She's on her way.

781
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,910
Pressure's high.

782
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,240
He's got

783
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,240
a retrobulbar hemorrhage.

784
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,780
He needs a lateral canthotomy.

785
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,610
Patient is HIV-positive.

786
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,880
Now, or he'll lose the eye.

787
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,280
Help me.

788
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,650
Clamp.

789
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,590
Here.

790
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,530
Surgical scissors.

791
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,530
Here.

792
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,290
Your vision will

793
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,290
return in a little while.

794
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,620
Thank you. Thank you.

795
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,030
Did Dr. Wheeler tell you

796
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,030
to perform that procedure?

797
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,330
It was an emergency.

798
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,330
The patient could have

799
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,330
gone blind in that eye.

800
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,880
Then why didn't

801
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,880
Dr. Wheeler perform it?

802
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,740
You'll have to ask

803
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,740
Dr. Wheeler.

804
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,830
You're a medical student.

805
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,840
You're not allowed to do

806
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,840
an invasive procedure

807
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,880
unless ordered to

808
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,880
do so by a doctor.

809
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,290
I've done

810
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,290
a lateral canthotomy.

811
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,290
Third-year on optho.

812
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,340
You're not on optho.

813
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,420
You're in the ED,

814
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,420
and there are rules.

815
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,480
And unless you

816
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,480
figure that out,

817
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,720
you're gonna get yourself

818
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,720
kicked out of here

819
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,720
and med school.

820
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,950
You understand?

821
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,420
I hear you.

822
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,900
Do you want me

823
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,900
to write him up?

824
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,240
No.

825
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,720
It's for his own good.

826
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,950
I know what happens

827
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,950
when you don't

828
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,950
follow protocol.

829
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,150
It's not personal.

830
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,460
Why didn't you tell me

831
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,460
that you were

832
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,460
coming back to Med?

833
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,470
I didn't know

834
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,470
until this morning.

835
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,760
So you'll be back

836
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,760
in the ED?

837
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,000
Uh, not exactly.

838
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,630
Dr. Charles wants me

839
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,630
to be a psych resident.

840
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,130
You?

841
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,740
Is that such a shock?

842
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,610
I just didn't realize

843
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,610
that you had

844
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,610
an interest in that.

845
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,670
I didn't.

846
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,610
I don't. I...

847
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,120
I don't know.

848
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,120
What do you see?

849
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,590
I wish people

850
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,590
wouldn't diagnose

851
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,590
themselves.

852
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,320
They always screw it up.

853
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,320
Hmm.

854
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,950
Your patient

855
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,950
doesn't have vitiligo.

856
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,950
She has tinea versicolor.

857
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,730
A yeast infection?

858
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,730
Yeah.

859
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,260
That's wonderful.

860
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,860
You know, I'm going to miss

861
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,860
the smell of coffee on you.

862
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,700
It's a little

863
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,700
early to tell,

864
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,440
but my initial assessment

865
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,440
is that your father

866
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,440
is doing well post-op.

867
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,210
Thank you.

868
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,210
Mmm-hmm.

869
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,110
Dr. Rhodes.

870
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,080
Excuse us.

871
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,190
You can see.

872
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,460
The leak from

873
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,460
her pseudoaneurysm

874
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,460
is increasing.

875
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,770
I still think we

876
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,770
should watch it.

877
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,330
Natalie,

878
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,330
if she goes into labor,

879
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,240
it could rupture

880
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,240
and kill her.

881
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,070
We gotta take

882
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,070
care of this now.

883
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,540
We'll take Cheryl

884
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,540
to the hybrid room.

885
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,340
I'll shield the baby

886
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,340
with a lead blanket

887
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,340
and stent her.

888
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,940
We'll have OB standing by.

889
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,150
If anything goes wrong,

890
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,150
they can perform

891
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,150
an emergency C-section.

892
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,190
Nat, we've got to

893
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,190
deal with this.

894
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,020
I'll page OB.

895
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,870
Doctor?

896
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,930
I was with his daughter

897
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,930
when he crashed.

898
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,930
How is he?

899
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,940
Mr. Buckner is in and out

900
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,940
of non-sustained v-tach.

901
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,380
Heart rate spikes to 180.

902
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,210
How long has it

903
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,210
been going on?

904
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,480
Fifteen minutes.

905
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,580
We've started

906
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,580
an amiodarone infusion.

907
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,090
That should suppress

908
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,090
his arrhythmia.

909
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,730
Your lips to God's ear.

910
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,640
Ready to cannulate.

911
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,220
Seeing decels on the fetal

912
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,220
heart rate down to 110.

913
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,960
In position

914
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,960
to place the stent.

915
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,250
Dr. Manning's right.

916
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,250
I don't like that tracing.

917
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,320
Just

918
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,320
a little bit longer.

919
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,360
Heart rate's

920
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,360
down to 100.

921
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,630
Ninety-six.

922
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,430
No time.

923
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,430
The baby's in distress.

924
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,430
We have to get her out now.

925
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,970
Okay.

926
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,810
OB DOCTOR 1:

927
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,810
Sponges on the field.

928
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,810
Yes.

929
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,720
OB DOCTOR 1:

930
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,720
All right. Get ready for flushes of suction.

931
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,250
Last heart rate was 85.

932
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,760
Cut the cord.

933
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,860
Dr. Manning.

934
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,650
She's all yours,

935
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,650
Dr. Rhodes.

936
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,890
Okay, fluoro on.

937
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,890
Let's go.

938
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,160
I'm not hearing

939
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,160
anything. How's the baby?

940
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,120
First APGAR,

941
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,120
six, but already improving.

942
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,120
How's Mom?

943
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,490
Hanging in there.

944
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,420
Placing the stent now.

945
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,100
And deploy.

946
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,870
It's in. Well-seated.

947
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,920
His creatinine levels

948
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,920
hit 2.5.

949
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,790
Is he responding

950
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,790
to diuretics?

951
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,880
No.

952
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,720
I'm not sure why his

953
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,720
kidneys aren't working.

954
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,990
Possibly post CPR

955
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,990
and pump.

956
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,490
Call renal, see what

957
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,490
the nephrologists suggest.

958
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,760
Yes, Dr. Latham.

959
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,110
Your little girl

960
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,110
is doing just fine.

961
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,380
Oh, thank you.

962
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,440
Oh, thank you.

963
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,850
Cheryl.

964
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,790
I'm afraid your father

965
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,790
is not doing very well.

966
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,560
What do you mean?

967
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm gonna go check on him.

968
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,000
I'll let you know.

969
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,230
Please take me to him.

970
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,640
Cheryl, you just had

971
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,640
an emergency C-section.

972
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,740
Take me and my baby.

973
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,410
I can't do that.

974
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,410
Please.

975
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,910
My dad.

976
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,290
Pressure's dropping.

977
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,620
No pulse.

978
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,620
Call a code.

979
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,190
Will, start compressions.

980
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,190
Yep.

981
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,390
Epi,

982
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,390
one milligram.

983
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,090
One milligram IV push.

984
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,090
Here you go.

985
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,300
Code Blue.

986
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,630
Charge to 200.

987
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,770
Code Blue.

988
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,340
All right, hold compressions.

989
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,340
Clear.

990
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,580
Clear.

991
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,520
Fine v-fib.

992
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,820
Two hundred again.

993
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,820
Charging 200.

994
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,990
Hold. Clear.

995
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,150
Clear.

996
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,030
Let me do it.

997
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,870
He's asystole.

998
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,970
He's gone, Connor.

999
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,700
Vasopressin 40. Now.

1000
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,510
Dr. Rhodes,

1001
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,510
the patient is dead.

1002
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,540
Time of death, 15:20.

1003
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,010
Connor.

1004
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,770
Daddy.

1005
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,770
Look.

1006
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,110
It's your granddaughter.

1007
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,800
Daddy?

1008
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,440
No.

1009
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,920
I've never seen

1010
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,920
anything like that.

1011
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,250
No.

1012
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,500
Dr. Reese,

1013
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,500
how's our patient?

1014
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,320
I gave her

1015
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,320
ketoconazole cream.

1016
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,130
Her fungal infection

1017
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,130
should be gone in a week.

1018
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,830
Excellent.

1019
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,830
Mmm-hmm.

1020
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,600
Dr. Charles, I've decided

1021
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,600
I will take that residency

1022
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,600
in psychiatry.

1023
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,750
I see now that by combining

1024
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,750
my clinical knowledge

1025
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,750
with psychology,

1026
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,940
maybe I really

1027
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,940
can help people.

1028
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,920
I am so glad

1029
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,920
to hear that.

1030
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,430
You're not talking about

1031
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,430
Emmie though, are you?

1032
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,150
Um...

1033
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,860
Listen, you very

1034
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,860
skillfully treated

1035
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,230
a superficial

1036
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,230
skin infection.

1037
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,600
Unfortunately,

1038
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,600
neither of us

1039
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,790
have done anything

1040
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,790
to address

1041
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,100
the profound underlying

1042
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,100
psychological issues

1043
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,640
that she suffers from.

1044
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,070
I'm just saying, you know,

1045
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,070
our patient has

1046
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,070
a long way to go.

1047
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,570
Oh.

1048
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,410
Yes.

1049
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,210
Anybody ever tell

1050
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,210
you the etymology

1051
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,210
of the word "psychiatry"?

1052
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,150
The medical treatment

1053
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,150
of the soul.

1054
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,580
Isn't that marvelous?

1055
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,630
So, worry not,

1056
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,630
Dr. Reese.

1057
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,630
We all... All of us

1058
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,630
have a long way to go

1059
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,630
in healing our souls.

1060
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,900
Dr. Choi.

1061
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,900
Yes?

1062
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,050
My patient waited

1063
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,050
two and a half hours

1064
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,050
for a treatment room,

1065
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,880
but I understand Treatment One

1066
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,880
has been free all day.

1067
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,020
Yeah.

1068
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,020
Wonderful.

1069
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,290
I'd sure like to know

1070
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,290
where Noah Sexton

1071
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,290
disappeared to.

1072
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,240
Thirty-five grand

1073
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,240
a year.

1074
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,140
What my malpractice

1075
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,140
is going to cost.

1076
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,950
And that's on top

1077
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,950
of my student loans,

1078
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,520
which now,

1079
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,520
because I'm an attending,

1080
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,520
I have to start paying off.

1081
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,220
How's your "sick bay"

1082
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,220
system working?

1083
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,960
I will take those

1084
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,960
scheduling sheets after all.

1085
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,330
You can have them.

1086
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,300
Well, you know,

1087
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,300
the thing I learned early on,

1088
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,400
the nurses,

1089
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,400
they run everything anyway.

1090
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,670
Yeah.

1091
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,580
You know,

1092
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,250
I saw a dead man

1093
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,250
come back to life today.

1094
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,320
Makes all this other stuff

1095
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,320
seem kind of small.

1096
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,010
Do you think she's on

1097
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,010
Pre-exposure Prophylaxis?

1098
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,740
Pretty standard

1099
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,740
with HIV. Why?

1100
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,380
Doesn't look like he's

1101
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,380
afraid he'll infect her.

1102
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,680
Well, there's very

1103
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,680
little risk, April.

1104
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,620
Learn to deal

1105
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,620
with things, April.

1106
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,620
Life's not perfect.

1107
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,260
But it is pretty great.

1108
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,910
Hey, Dad.

1109
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,910
Hi, sweetie.

1110
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,170
Let me check your phone.

1111
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,180
I want to see how

1112
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,180
many likes we got.

1113
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,180
"Likes"?

1114
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,610
The selfie we took.

1115
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,580
Twenty-two.

1116
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,350
Hey, you know

1117
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,350
what we should do?

1118
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,480
What?

1119
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,550
We should take one

1120
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,550
in front of Dylan's Candy Bar.

1121
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,190
That'll make

1122
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,190
everybody jealous.

1123
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,850
Yeah, you know

1124
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,850
what we should do?

1125
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,950
We should go live in a cave

1126
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,950
with no electricity

1127
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,900
until you're

1128
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,900
about 35 years old.

1129
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,900
That's what we should do.

1130
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,460
Daddy!

1131
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,460
What?

1132
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,700
April!

1133
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,540
Hey.

1134
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,020
So... So how are we

1135
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,020
feeling after work?

1136
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,110
Good.

1137
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,790
Then dinner tonight?

1138
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,290
You like my raviolis, right?

1139
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,750
I tolerate your ravioli.

1140
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,340
Are you sure

1141
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,340
you're okay

1142
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,340
with everything?

1143
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,870
Me, the whole package?

1144
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,340
Baby, I'm sure.

1145
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,850
I'll make the garlic bread.

1146
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,350
Come on.

1147
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,930
Oh...

1148
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,930
Mmm.

1149
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,160
I got these.

1150
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,200
Thanks.

1151
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,870
I'll get them next time.

1152
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,870
Okay.

1153
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,710
You know, I didn't

1154
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,710
expect to see you here.

1155
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,480
My mother-in-law

1156
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,480
insisted on taking Owen

1157
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,480
for the night.

1158
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,250
She says I need a life.

1159
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,250
Ah...

1160
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,830
My car is, um,

1161
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,830
is over there.

1162
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,260
Okay, I'll walk

1163
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,260
you to it.

1164
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,260
No, no.

1165
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,640
You don't have to do that.

1166
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,700
Okay.

1167
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,370
My apartment

1168
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,370
is just around

1169
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,370
