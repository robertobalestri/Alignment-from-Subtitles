1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,200
You think

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,200
this is a good spot?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,770
All right,

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,770
I'll see you inside.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,800
Remember, if you get

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,800
any central lines today,

7
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm your man.

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,270
And if I don't?

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,640
Hey, you're still bleeding.

10
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,340
Hmm.

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,790
Yeah, I think I'll be doing

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,790
those central lines myself.

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,880
Give me a break. See you.

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,820
The coast is clear.

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,160
Save some lives today,

16
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,160
Dr. Halstead.

17
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,370
I'll try, Dr. Shore.

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,370
And you down in path,

19
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,370
enjoy your day with the dead.

20
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,890
Always do.

21
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,550
Hey, you look cheerful today.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,020
Well, you know,

23
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,020
I like to see

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,020
the ED as half-full.

25
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,290
Dr. Halstead, Dr. Manning.

26
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,180
Clarke.

27
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,690
So, how you two doing?

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,750
What?

29
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,420
You and Jeff.

30
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,520
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,860
Natalie, everyone knows.

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,390
It's good. It's...

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,390
You know, you seem

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,530
a lot happier lately.

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,530
It's nice.

36
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,670
Okay, but when

37
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,670
you say everybody...

38
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,370
ED staff,

39
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,370
ambulance drivers, EMTs.

40
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,700
You know,

41
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,700
the crazy guy out front

42
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,700
who thinks he's Jesus.

43
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,990
Okay, so about the same people

44
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,990
who know about you and Nina.

45
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,750
Wait, seriously?

46
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,520
Incoming.

47
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,920
Dr. Choi.

48
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,460
We're going to room two.

49
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,490
Edward Hall, 82.

50
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,030
He passed out

51
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,030
in his apartment,

52
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,600
was awake when we got there,

53
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,600
vitals stable.

54
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,300
Mr. Hall, how are you feeling?

55
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,360
Head hurts.

56
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,360
You got an aspirin?

57
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,940
He's never done this before.

58
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,270
He was just

59
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,270
walking to the bedroom,

60
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,270
and he fell down.

61
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,870
We're gonna take care

62
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,870
of you, Mr. Hall, okay?

63
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,880
On my count. One, two, three.

64
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,240
Okay, let's get an H and H...

65
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,110
Okay.

66
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,250
Get Dr. Rhodes.

67
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,250
Okay.

68
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,050
Have you experienced

69
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,050
any recent neck pain,

70
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,050
trouble swallowing?

71
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,680
Swallowing?

72
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,350
Your neck is swollen.

73
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,350
How long has it

74
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,350
been like that?

75
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,430
I don't... Swallowing?

76
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,730
He's in and out mentally,

77
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,730
mostly out,

78
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,730
but I take care of him.

79
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,120
Are you his daughter?

80
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,260
No, I'm his girlfriend.

81
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,470
It's okay, Eddie.

82
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,470
You're gonna be all right.

83
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,730
What do we got?

84
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,930
Neck swelling with a bruit.

85
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm thinking

86
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,200
there's a compressive mass

87
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,570
in his chest,

88
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,570
possibly a tumor.

89
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,040
Oh, my God,

90
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,040
do you think he has cancer?

91
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,270
Could be.

92
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,680
If it's pressing on

93
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,680
his heart or carotids,

94
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,800
that would

95
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,800
explain his passing out.

96
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,210
And if that's the case,

97
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,210
we're gonna have to

98
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,210
operate to remove it.

99
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,850
Well, just do whatever

100
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,850
it takes, please.

101
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,780
Just take care of him.

102
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,450
Tell radiology we're

103
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,450
on our way up

104
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,750
for a neck and chest CT

105
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,750
with contrast,

106
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,750
then up to the OR.

107
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,820
Okay.

108
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,900
Whoa! Please, stop.

109
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,900
Don't take him anywhere.

110
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,950
Excuse me, sir,

111
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,950
can I help you?

112
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,220
This is my father.

113
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,630
He doesn't want any of this.

114
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,230
And that bitch has no right

115
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,230
to make any decisions

116
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,230
about his health.

117
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,820
Fact is, my father

118
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,820
doesn't want

119
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,490
any extraordinary

120
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,490
measures taken.

121
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,540
He never said that.

122
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,110
When his mind

123
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,110
first started to go,

124
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,720
he made his

125
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,720
wishes clear to me.

126
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,090
Dr. Choi, what are

127
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,090
Mr. Hall's options?

128
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,060
The scan suggests

129
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,060
he has a thymoma.

130
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,890
If we treat supportively,

131
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,890
he'll probably have

132
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,890
four to six months.

133
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,300
But if we excise

134
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,300
the tumor,

135
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,330
we can prolong his

136
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,330
life significantly,

137
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,030
as I'm sure our surgeons

138
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,030
can attest.

139
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,540
Surgery's definitely

140
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,540
an option.

141
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,270
Yes, though surgery

142
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,270
does come with risk,

143
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,520
a successful operation could

144
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,520
result in a total cure.

145
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,420
He's 82 and demented.

146
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,320
You want to put him

147
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,320
through an operation?

148
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,320
For what?

149
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,380
They just said

150
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,380
he could live.

151
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,790
Yeah, and he could

152
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,790
be left hooked up

153
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,260
to wires and tubes

154
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,260
for who knows how long.

155
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,310
No.

156
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,310
You can't do this.

157
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,160
You can't just

158
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,160
let him kill Eddie.

159
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,490
I am trying to honor

160
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,490
my father's wishes.

161
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,720
All right, enough.

162
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Look, we all understand

163
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,800
this is a very

164
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,800
sensitive issue,

165
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,270
but what matters here

166
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,270
is who has the legal authority

167
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,370
to make Mr. Hall's decisions.

168
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,640
Well, as far as

169
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,640
the hospital's concerned,

170
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,940
with no advance

171
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,940
directive in place,

172
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,240
the surrogate

173
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,240
decision-making power

174
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,240
goes to the next of kin,

175
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,620
which, in this case,

176
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,620
is Mr. Hall's son.

177
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,250
No.

178
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,250
Thank you.

179
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
Ms. Goodwin, all due respect,

180
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,850
but my job is to do whatever

181
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,850
it takes to keep

182
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,850
my patient alive.

183
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,120
Dr. Choi, you heard him.

184
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,120
Our hands are tied.

185
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,080
So that's it?

186
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,990
You're just gonna

187
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,990
let Eddie die?

188
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,330
I'm sorry.

189
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,330
Hey, you got

190
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,330
a bounce-back in three.

191
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,410
Hey, Hayley. Back so soon?

192
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,450
I was afraid you'd miss me.

193
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,040
Always. You still throwing up?

194
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,810
No, that's all better.

195
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,250
Right after we saw you,

196
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,250
what, three days ago?

197
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,020
She started getting

198
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,020
a fever and chills.

199
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,660
We tried ibuprofen,

200
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,660
but it didn't come down.

201
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,390
You did the right thing.

202
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,990
When did you finish

203
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,990
your last round of chemo?

204
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,050
Yesterday.

205
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,930
Usually the chemo

206
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,930
fevers don't last this long.

207
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,670
Or get this high, 103.

208
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,570
Do you think

209
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,570
something's wrong?

210
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,540
Hard to say. The cancer meds

211
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,540
do knock down

212
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,540
her immune system,

213
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,910
so I wouldn't be surprised

214
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,910
if she got some

215
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,910
sort of infection.

216
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,180
But probably nothing

217
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,180
to worry about?

218
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,940
Probably not, but I would like

219
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,940
to start her on

220
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,940
some antibiotics

221
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,990
and get labs and

222
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,990
cultures just to be safe.

223
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,620
Looks like we'll be spending

224
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,620
a little more time together.

225
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,490
I'll be back shortly.

226
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,260
Ready to head to the Farm?

227
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,020
Nurse, can you please

228
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,020
come here?

229
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,790
Sorry, I'm slammed.

230
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,090
The Farm?

231
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,090
Uh-huh.

232
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,660
You want to come?

233
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,230
Sure. What's the Farm?

234
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,400
You'll see.

235
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,800
Please, I need to leave.

236
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,930
Okay.

237
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,140
No, I gotta go.

238
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,140
Can you just take

239
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,140
this tube out of my nose?

240
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,410
Mr. Jones...

241
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,410
Everything okay?

242
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,740
He wants to leave.

243
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,410
Bowel obstructions,

244
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,410
even partial ones,

245
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,080
can become

246
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,080
life-threatening situations.

247
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,750
We can't discharge

248
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,750
you until it's cleared.

249
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,850
It doesn't hurt anymore.

250
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,550
Look, I understand,

251
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,550
but your output

252
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,550
is still too high.

253
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,980
Let's see if I can feel any...

254
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,980
No!

255
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,560
I just...

256
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,560
I don't like to be touched.

257
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,320
How're we doing in here?

258
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,400
Give the tube

259
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,400
a little more time.

260
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,540
I promise,

261
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,540
we'll get you home

262
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,540
as soon as possible.

263
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,310
He was found passed

264
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,310
out on the street.

265
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,420
KUB showed a massive

266
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,420
stool in his bowel.

267
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,380
Wow.

268
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,460
Passed out?

269
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,460
Yeah.

270
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,990
It must have been pretty bad.

271
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,930
It's starting to clear,

272
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
but he's been combative,

273
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
fearful ever since

274
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
he got here.

275
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,320
You want a consult?

276
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,000
Sure. He won't talk to me.

277
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,900
Oh, look, here's somebody

278
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,900
he might have an easier

279
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,900
time relating to.

280
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,610
They call this

281
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,610
a Vent Farm?

282
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,010
Dark humor.

283
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,010
Keeps you sane if you're gonna

284
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,010
spend some time here.

285
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,880
Hey, good to see you.

286
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,420
So this is where

287
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,420
all our comatose patients go?

288
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,420
Mmm-hmm.

289
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,050
A lot of these

290
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,050
people didn't have anyone.

291
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,160
They just got

292
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,160
appointed a case worker

293
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,230
who decided to keep

294
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,230
them on life support.

295
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,620
Others have families

296
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,620
that are still

297
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,620
holding out hope.

298
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,100
Either way, they're just...

299
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,600
Nothing that can

300
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,600
be done, right?

301
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,740
Nothing medically.

302
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,070
So, what? We're here to check

303
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,070
some culture results?

304
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,500
Nope.

305
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,910
Pronounce someone dead?

306
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,910
Uh-uh.

307
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,450
So what are we doing?

308
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,170
We're here to paint

309
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,170
some nails.

310
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,950
What's going on?

311
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,450
You remember

312
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,450
my cancer patient,

313
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,450
Hayley Kline?

314
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,990
Sweet young girl?

315
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,990
Yeah.

316
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,590
This just showed

317
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,590
up in her cultures.

318
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,990
Oh, God.

319
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,290
Colistin-resistant

320
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,290
Enterobacter.

321
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,600
She can barely fight

322
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,600
off infection as it is.

323
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,930
Now she has an

324
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,930
antibiotic-resistant superbug?

325
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,760
This is really bad news.

326
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,630
Natalie,

327
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,630
it's worse than you think.

328
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,140
What do you mean?

329
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,180
This is Erik Tillman,

330
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,180
just came in.

331
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,880
He has CRE too.

332
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,180
The same bug? Are you serious?

333
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,520
Labs just confirmed it.

334
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,130
So we could be looking

335
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,130
at an outbreak that might

336
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,130
not have a cure.

337
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,440
Dr. Halstead, Dr. Manning,

338
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,440
this is Robin Charles,

339
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,350
the newest member of our

340
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,350
epidemiology department.

341
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,380
It's a pleasure.

342
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,380
Top of her class,

343
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,220
DuPont Scholar,

344
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,220
and she just happens

345
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,220
to be Dr. Charles' daughter.

346
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,780
What can I say?

347
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,780
Nepotism is alive and well.

348
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,160
So I hear we've got

349
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,160
colistin-resistant

350
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,160
Enterobacter?

351
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,290
In two patients.

352
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,390
Did they catch it

353
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,390
in this hospital?

354
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,590
I don't think so.

355
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,130
There's no record

356
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,130
my patient's ever been here.

357
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,220
Well, he's here now,

358
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,460
which means every

359
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,460
immunocompromised

360
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
patient in this place

361
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
is at risk.

362
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,430
Do we have final

363
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,430
culture sensitivities yet?

364
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,770
We're still waiting.

365
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,040
I'll need to talk to

366
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,040
every one of your

367
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,040
patients' contacts,

368
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,210
get detailed histories,

369
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,210
find out what

370
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,210
the connections

371
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,470
between these people are.

372
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,940
I'll be in touch soon.

373
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,950
Actually, um, wait.

374
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,640
I think it's my fault.

375
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,020
Hayley was here

376
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,020
three days ago.

377
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,020
I missed the diagnosis.

378
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,650
You don't know that.

379
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,420
She could have just as easily

380
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,420
contracted it after she left.

381
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,360
I saw her records.

382
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,360
You treated her exactly

383
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,360
how you should have.

384
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,960
What if I sent her back

385
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,960
into the city

386
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,960
with an infection

387
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,900
and she gave it to Erik

388
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,900
and who knows how many others?

389
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,500
Natalie, it's a city of

390
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,500
almost 3,000,000 people.

391
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,070
This could all just

392
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,070
be a coincidence.

393
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,770
Actually, I don't

394
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,770
believe in coincidences.

395
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,630
Sorry.

396
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,040
I'll be in touch.

397
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,830
Hi, honey.

398
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,470
This is Jeff Clarke,

399
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,470
fourth-year med student,

400
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,530
little rough around the edges,

401
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,670
but it's so hard to find

402
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,670
good help these days.

403
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,780
Hi.

404
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,980
How do you know her?

405
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,150
She came into the ED

406
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,150
late one night, alone,

407
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,090
burst an aneurysm,

408
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,090
massive hemorrhage.

409
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,700
By the time we got her,

410
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,700
we knew it was too late.

411
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,630
She kept on asking me

412
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,630
to talk to her, so I did.

413
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,540
Thing is,

414
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,240
my mother had just passed.

415
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,780
And when she used

416
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,780
to put me to sleep as a kid,

417
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,580
she used to call

418
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,580
me "Maggie-Pie"

419
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,480
from a nursery

420
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,480
rhyme about a bird.

421
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,520
And I don't know,

422
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,520
maybe Cindy had heard

423
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,520
that rhyme before.

424
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
She must have seen

425
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
my nametag, and...

426
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,860
'Cause in her last moment,

427
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,560
she squeezed my hand,

428
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,290
and she called me

429
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,290
Maggie-Pie, too.

430
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,070
Anyway, CPD looked,

431
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,070
but there was no family,

432
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,580
no friends,

433
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,580
no one to speak for her,

434
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,580
so they brought her here.

435
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,450
Now I check in on her.

436
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,450
Every week.

437
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,450
Tell her what's

438
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,450
going on with my life.

439
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,090
I don't know.

440
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,130
I figure she's got

441
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,130
one foot in this world,

442
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,460
and another in the next

443
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,460
where Mom is.

444
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,600
Yeah.

445
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,410
So why would a 19-year-old

446
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,410
have a bowel obstruction?

447
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,580
Good question.

448
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,580
All his other

449
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,580
tests are normal.

450
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,520
It could be stress, right?

451
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,520
Could be.

452
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,420
Stress can present

453
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,420
a hundred different ways.

454
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,290
But you think

455
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,290
it's something else?

456
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,130
Don't know.

457
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,130
That's what you're gonna

458
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,130
find out.

459
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,330
Hi. I'm Dr. Reese, Sarah.

460
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,330
Can I come in?

461
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,330
I really want to leave.

462
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,870
I don't blame you,

463
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,870
but it sounds like

464
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,580
you're gonna be here

465
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,580
a little bit longer,

466
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,040
so maybe we could talk?

467
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,870
Or I could just sit here.

468
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,870
Is that okay?

469
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,940
Why?

470
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,720
I don't know. I just thought

471
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,720
you might want some company.

472
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,060
Are you from Chicago?

473
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,070
I've been here five years.

474
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,900
I'm from Connecticut,

475
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,870
and I still totally dread

476
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,870
the winter.

477
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,210
I mean, I thought I knew

478
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,210
what cold was,

479
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,210
but this is like

480
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,080
National Geographic,

481
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,080
Frozen Planet cold.

482
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,050
I carry around

483
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,050
those hand warmer pads

484
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,780
just in case my

485
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,780
eyelids freeze shut.

486
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,920
I hate the cold.

487
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,920
Yeah?

488
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,080
Where are you from?

489
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,660
Phoenix.

490
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,660
Okay.

491
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,060
I have a sister named Sarah.

492
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,290
No kidding.

493
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,030
Uh-huh. Yes, and have Monica

494
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,030
call every patient

495
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,730
that's been to the infusion

496
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,730
center since Monday.

497
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,480
Mmm-hmm. Yes, anyone

498
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,480
with fever, chills, headaches

499
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,480
or nausea gets a blood draw.

500
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,310
Yeah, okay.

501
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,870
How you doing? How's it going?

502
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,840
You know. Busy but good.

503
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,480
Nice people in that

504
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,480
department, right?

505
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,880
Yeah, they seem great.

506
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,420
So, you get my text?

507
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,960
When are we having coffee?

508
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,390
We will, Dad. I promise.

509
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,630
Just got a lot on my plate,

510
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,630
first couple of weeks

511
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,630
of work and all.

512
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,400
Of course you do.

513
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,130
You're sleeping,

514
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,130
though, right?

515
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,130
Are you sleeping?

516
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,790
Dad, come on.

517
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,340
Hey, new job, new city.

518
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,340
I'm sorry.

519
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,940
You know,

520
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,940
could be a little stressful.

521
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,470
I'm fine, Dad.

522
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,810
And really,

523
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,810
you're not my therapist.

524
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,570
Oh...

525
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,180
I'm just...

526
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,180
I'm glad you're here.

527
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,380
Proud of you.

528
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,220
Mr. Hall?

529
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,090
Mr. Hall?

530
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,190
We found a tumor

531
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,190
that's compressing

532
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,330
the large vessels

533
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,330
in your chest.

534
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,560
We could remove it

535
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,560
with an operation.

536
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,600
Are you a doctor?

537
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,430
Yes, I'm Dr. Choi.

538
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,430
I'm your doctor.

539
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,850
You're Chinese.

540
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,950
I saw the Great Wall.

541
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,580
Mr. Hall...

542
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,180
I really believe

543
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,180
that surgery is

544
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,180
your best option.

545
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,890
Do you give us permission

546
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,890
to perform the surgery?

547
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,090
Permission?

548
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,290
Yes.

549
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Are you a doctor?

550
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,070
What's going on?

551
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,640
I'm just explaining

552
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,640
to your father what's

553
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,640
happening in his chest.

554
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,940
Explaining? Looks to me like

555
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,940
you're trying to coerce him

556
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,340
into a procedure

557
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,340
he doesn't want.

558
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,710
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna

559
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,710
have to ask

560
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,510
that you not speak

561
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,510
to him alone again.

562
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,750
I'll check back with you soon.

563
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,110
Check back?

564
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,060
Echo to get a better idea

565
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,060
of her cardiac output,

566
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,260
and then we'll

567
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,260
take it from there.

568
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,130
Dr. Latham, about Mr. Hall,

569
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,960
the three of us need

570
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,960
to approach his son

571
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,960
as a united front.

572
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,100
Why?

573
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,100
Perhaps together

574
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,200
we can convince him

575
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,200
to let us save

576
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,200
his father's life.

577
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,800
I don't understand.

578
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,400
Well, I think what Dr. Choi

579
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,400
is suggesting is that

580
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,140
if we explain the surgery

581
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,140
again in more detail,

582
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,140
then maybe...

583
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,040
Our job isn't to solve

584
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,040
family problems.

585
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,410
Our job is to fix ailments,

586
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,410
and until the Halls

587
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,410
ask us to do that,

588
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,980
there will be no surgery.

589
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,990
This is distracting.

590
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,960
Cute shoes.

591
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,260
I could see my boyfriend

592
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,260
in those.

593
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,600
They're okay,

594
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,600
too tight in the toes.

595
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,930
These are pretty comfortable,

596
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,930
not the cutest.

597
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,470
I had to order, like,

598
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,470
50 pairs to find

599
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,470
the right one.

600
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,900
Are you okay?

601
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,540
I... I gotta go. I gotta go.

602
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,940
Hey, it shouldn't

603
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,940
be too much longer,

604
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,240
but let me check

605
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,240
with Dr. Choi.

606
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,880
Call Dr. Choi.

607
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,650
All right, this might

608
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,650
just be from the obstruction.

609
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,950
Is anything hurting?

610
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,260
He's tachycardic.

611
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,660
Abdomen's far less distended.

612
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,700
I'm gonna throw up again.

613
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,010
No sign of infection,

614
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,010
no fever.

615
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,240
Hey, has anything like

616
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,240
this happened before?

617
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,710
I am just here to help,

618
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,710
but I need you to tell me

619
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,010
if there's something

620
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,010
I should know.

621
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,480
Danny.

622
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,390
I am on your side.

623
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,750
Heroin.

624
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,950
Heroin.

625
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,950
What?

626
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,060
Are you... Are you on heroin?

627
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,620
He is in withdrawal.

628
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,730
Give me 10 milligrams IM

629
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,730
of methadone

630
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,730
and one of Ativan.

631
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,860
Got it.

632
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,100
Hey, I am right here.

633
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,100
It is going to be okay.

634
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,510
You know,

635
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,510
I couldn't stop

636
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,510
thinking about Cindy.

637
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,750
No family,

638
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,750
alone in that room,

639
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,750
month after month.

640
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,110
Yeah.

641
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,550
So I called a friend of mine

642
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,020
in the State Bureau

643
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,020
of Identification

644
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,020
to look into it.

645
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,760
It turns out that Cindy

646
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,760
has a sister in Spokane.

647
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,550
Really?

648
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,550
Yeah.

649
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,170
Gave her the number

650
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,170
of the hospital.

651
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,170
I don't know.

652
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,000
Maybe this means

653
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,000
Cindy will have

654
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,000
another person in her life.

655
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,240
That'd be great.

656
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,240
It would, right?

657
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,400
Yes, of course.

658
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,140
O2 sats are dropping.

659
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,310
Arms are swelling.

660
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,750
He must be hemorrhaging

661
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,750
into the tumor.

662
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,910
It's compressing his SVC.

663
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,660
Save me.

664
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,460
He said, "Save me."

665
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,730
What's going on?

666
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,730
He said, "Save me."

667
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,330
Where's his son?

668
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,600
I don't know, but I heard him.

669
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,430
Let's bag him.

670
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,300
Let's go.

671
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,340
Sats still dropping.

672
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,740
Okay, let's get him to the OR.

673
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,940
What are you doing?

674
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,010
The patient expressed

675
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,010
his wishes.

676
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,010
We're taking him to surgery.

677
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,110
Are you kidding?

678
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,110
He's demented. He can't

679
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,110
express his wishes.

680
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,880
I heard him.

681
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,880
Doctor,

682
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,880
we're ready to go.

683
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,180
Okay, let's move.

684
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,920
You can't do this.

685
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,930
How is it having

686
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,930
her back in town?

687
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,790
Oh.

688
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,430
It's great. It's great.

689
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,430
Yeah.

690
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,070
Yeah, haven't shared

691
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,070
a zip code since she was

692
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,070
in high school.

693
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,610
You been spending

694
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,610
some time together?

695
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah. I mean,

696
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,480
haven't really hung out yet.

697
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,640
You know,

698
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,640
she's got a lot on her plate,

699
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,640
like new job, new apartment.

700
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,190
I mean,

701
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,190
just getting cable installed.

702
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,190
Like, come on, that's a bitch.

703
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,020
So, after she's got cable?

704
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,150
Yeah.

705
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,050
Daniel.

706
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,050
Sharon, look, she's never

707
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,050
gonna forgive me.

708
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,260
For divorcing her mother?

709
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,420
Yeah, that and I don't know...

710
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,800
All the time I was there,

711
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,800
wasn't really there, you know?

712
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,470
You remember.

713
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,470
Yeah, I remember,

714
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,470
but I'm sure she...

715
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,160
Dr. Charles?

716
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,160
Yes?

717
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,430
I am sorry. Are you available?

718
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,270
Will you excuse me? I'm sorry.

719
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,870
You were right.

720
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,870
There is something

721
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,870
going on with Danny.

722
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,310
Tell me.

723
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,210
He told me he's addicted

724
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,210
to heroin.

725
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
He started going

726
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
through withdrawal,

727
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
he's stable now,

728
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,350
on methadone and Ativan,

729
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,820
and I know detox

730
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,820
is a long road,

731
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,820
but maybe we can help.

732
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,520
Could work.

733
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,520
Let's see what we got.

734
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,520
Okay.

735
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,790
Oh. Hi.

736
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,090
Hi, I'm Dr. Reese.

737
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,720
And I'm Dr. Charles.

738
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,720
It's nice to meet you.

739
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,130
I'm Tina, Danny's mother.

740
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,600
He just told me

741
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,600
what's going on.

742
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,600
I had no idea.

743
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,070
Well, it's a lot to take in.

744
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,930
How you feeling, Danny?

745
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,340
He's embarrassed,

746
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,340
and he should be.

747
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
It's just so confusing

748
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
why he would do this.

749
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,780
We've tried so hard

750
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,780
to be good parents.

751
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,520
Well, fortunately, Dr. Reese

752
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,520
has a good plan about how

753
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,520
to move forward.

754
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,320
Please, tell me what to do.

755
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,220
So, as long as you continue

756
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,220
to tolerate the methadone,

757
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,790
I want to switch you to orals.

758
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,560
Then we can talk about rehab.

759
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,490
But first,

760
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,490
how are you feeling?

761
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,300
I appreciate all this,

762
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,300
but I know he wants

763
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,300
to go home.

764
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,240
That's totally understandable,

765
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,240
but Danny is gonna have

766
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,240
to finish his IV first,

767
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,500
and that's gonna

768
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,500
take a couple of hours,

769
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,370
so you might want

770
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,370
to go get a cup

771
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,370
of coffee or...

772
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,470
He is still gonna

773
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,470
be here for a while.

774
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,440
Right now, I don't think

775
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,440
Danny wants me to leave

776
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,440
his side.

777
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,310
Do you, honey?

778
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,990
Okay, makes perfect sense.

779
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,220
Why don't we check

780
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,220
back with you in a bit?

781
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,630
I don't know what happened.

782
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,630
He's totally different.

783
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,330
Well, it's gonna

784
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,330
be a little tense with Mom

785
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,330
in there, right?

786
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,770
But it's like

787
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,770
a switch was flipped.

788
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,360
He wouldn't even

789
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,360
look me in the eye.

790
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,370
Something is a little off.

791
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,540
What... How long

792
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,540
till he's discharged?

793
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,700
Well,

794
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,700
his obstruction's cleared,

795
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,210
and now that we know

796
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,210
it was caused by the heroin,

797
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,340
there's no reason to keep him

798
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,340
once his IV's done.

799
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,180
Let's ask Dr. Choi to order

800
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,180
a lactate level

801
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,180
and an iron panel.

802
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,020
Why would we want those?

803
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,110
Buy us a little time.

804
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,030
We got to separate them,

805
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,030
see if we can find

806
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,030
out what's what.

807
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,690
Hmm.

808
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,660
This was the right

809
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,660
thing to do.

810
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,890
Hmm?

811
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,560
The surgery.

812
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,730
Absolutely. Why?

813
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,040
Well, you seemed against it.

814
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,000
The son said, "No,"

815
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,000
so it was a no.

816
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,100
The patient said, "Yes,"

817
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,100
so now it's a yes.

818
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,570
Is there more to it than that?

819
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,180
Guess not.

820
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,150
I'm not good with ambiguity,

821
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,150
Dr. Rhodes.

822
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,490
I want you to watch

823
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,490
how I elevate

824
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,550
the caudal portion

825
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,550
of the right inferior horn

826
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,790
while still attached to

827
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,790
the pericardial fat pad.

828
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,560
It's an easier method

829
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,560
to divide and ligate

830
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,560
it like that.

831
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,510
Mr. and Mrs. Kline?

832
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,610
I have some news.

833
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,080
The lab tested Hayley's

834
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,080
CRE culture against

835
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,080
every antibiotic,

836
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,020
and it turns out it's

837
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,020
sensitive to just one.

838
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,110
A drug called

839
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,110
ceftazidime-avibactam.

840
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,580
So there's a cure?

841
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,580
That's fantastic.

842
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,990
Yes, but the thing is...

843
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,060
The bug is sensitive

844
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,060
at a very low rate,

845
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,730
which means it works best

846
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,730
for patients that

847
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,730
we catch early.

848
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,530
So... So Hayley?

849
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,670
We won't know anything

850
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,670
until we try the medication.

851
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,440
I waited too long, didn't I?

852
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,440
No.

853
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,810
No, I should have

854
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,810
brought her in sooner.

855
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,810
No...

856
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,570
Mrs. Kline...

857
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,570
I am usually so on top

858
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,570
of this, but I just...

859
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,780
I can't tell what's

860
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,780
an emergency anymore.

861
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,150
She's always so sick.

862
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,150
You cannot blame yourself.

863
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,090
Please,

864
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,090
this is not your fault.

865
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,350
I promise you, we are gonna

866
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,350
do everything we can

867
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,350
to help her.

868
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,560
Okay. Thank you.

869
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,010
How is he?

870
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,750
They're just getting

871
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,750
in the chest.

872
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,050
When he was crashing,

873
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,050
did you hear what he said?

874
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,250
No.

875
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,400
We're here to save lives.

876
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
You're doing what

877
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
you're supposed to do.

878
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,640
Yeah.

879
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,200
Someone help!

880
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,550
She can't get a breath.

881
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,550
I need to intubate.

882
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,050
Ma'am, please move.

883
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,050
Five of Versed.

884
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,240
What's going on?

885
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,510
She could be in septic shock.

886
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,150
I don't know. Pressure's fine.

887
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,150
Pulse is strong.

888
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,350
You're good.

889
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,820
What's going on?

890
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,880
Please, come with me.

891
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,880
Hayley... What...

892
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,990
It's okay. It's okay.

893
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,560
I can't get the tube in.

894
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,560
It's like

895
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,560
something's blocking it.

896
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,600
Did she eat anything?

897
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,600
No.

898
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,330
Damn it.

899
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,330
Sats down to 50.

900
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,630
Doris, give me the ultrasound.

901
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,860
Got it.

902
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,860
I need a cric kit.

903
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,000
What?

904
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,980
We need to make

905
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,980
a hole in her trachea

906
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,980
so she can breathe.

907
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,340
Oh, my God.

908
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,050
Wait, you're right.

909
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,050
Her airway is blocked.

910
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,020
It's an abscess.

911
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,020
The infection's

912
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,020
spread to her pharynx.

913
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,090
I'll page ENT.

914
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,090
No, no time.

915
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,590
Give me a minor

916
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,590
tray and a knife.

917
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,650
I got it.

918
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,250
It's okay, I can do it.

919
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,250
No, I got this.

920
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,780
Sats down to 50.

921
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,360
Hold her arm, please.

922
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,640
Nat, I have to cric her.

923
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,640
Hang on.

924
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,520
Nat.

925
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,520
I got it.

926
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,720
Oh, my God.

927
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,770
Dr. Manning,

928
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,770
thank you so much.

929
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,100
Lung's clear.

930
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,300
Baby.

931
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,730
How's she doing?

932
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,330
She's stable for now,

933
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,590
but the abscess was

934
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,590
caused by her infection.

935
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,530
It's only a matter of time

936
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,530
before she gets more.

937
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,030
What's going on from your end?

938
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,230
Bad news, I'm afraid.

939
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,770
East Mercy just got

940
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,770
a new CRE patient.

941
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,480
Intubated,

942
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,480
can't get any info yet,

943
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,480
but we're working on it.

944
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,210
And they're sure it's CRE?

945
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,310
That's three.

946
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,750
It's a pattern,

947
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,750
not a coincidence.

948
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,910
Okay, but just because

949
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,910
another person has it

950
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,910
doesn't mean it's your fault.

951
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,590
Well, there's only

952
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,590
one way to find out.

953
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,650
We need to extubate Erik.

954
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,390
No. It's too dangerous.

955
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,550
We've tried everything else.

956
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,550
His social media,

957
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,550
his contacts.

958
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,150
In order to find the source

959
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,150
of the infection,

960
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,930
we have to figure

961
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,930
out how he is connected

962
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,730
to Hayley and this patient

963
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,730
at East Mercy.

964
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,530
We need to talk to him.

965
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,070
Well, that's if you can

966
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,070
extubate him.

967
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,400
He may not even tolerate it.

968
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,440
We will go as slowly

969
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,440
and safely as possible.

970
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,600
That's not a decision

971
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,600
you can make.

972
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,270
No, it's not, but he can.

973
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,940
Okay.

974
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,320
I'll turn down his propofol,

975
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,320
and he should be awake

976
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,320
in a few minutes.

977
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,790
Make sure you separate out

978
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,790
the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

979
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,460
Copy that. Do you see it?

980
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,000
Should be right... Here.

981
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,430
Pull harder.

982
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,700
Did you see The Force Awakens?

983
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,110
Got it...

984
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,780
I'm sorry, did I see what?

985
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,480
The Force Awakens.

986
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,310
Uh. No.

987
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,880
When Rey defeats Kylo Ren,

988
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,880
the glove falls off

989
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,880
of his left hand,

990
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,820
but when he sits up,

991
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,820
it's on again.

992
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,790
These are professional

993
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,790
filmmakers.

994
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,790
It's unbelievable to me.

995
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,640
O2's in the high 80s.

996
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,640
That's the best we can get.

997
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,970
Okay.

998
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,010
Erik, I'm Dr. Manning.

999
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,440
You are in the hospital

1000
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,440
right now with a very

1001
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,440
bad infection,

1002
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,210
and we're concerned

1003
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,210
that other people

1004
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,810
might be getting

1005
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,810
this infection as well.

1006
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,580
A lot of people.

1007
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,190
If we don't find them soon,

1008
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,190
it may be too late.

1009
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,520
But in order to do that,

1010
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,520
we're gonna need

1011
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,520
to ask you some questions.

1012
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,680
Now the problem is,

1013
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,680
if we take your tube out,

1014
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,060
we cannot guarantee you'll

1015
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,060
be able to breathe

1016
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,060
on your own.

1017
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,430
And once it's out,

1018
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,430
we may not be able

1019
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,430
to put it back in.

1020
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,170
What we are asking you to do

1021
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,170
won't help you directly,

1022
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,840
but it could save

1023
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,840
a lot of lives.

1024
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,710
You don't have to do this.

1025
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,580
Do you give us permission

1026
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,580
to take out your

1027
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,580
breathing tube?

1028
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,220
Thank you.

1029
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,200
Okay.

1030
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,570
He's still in the high 80s.

1031
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,480
How are you feeling?

1032
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,480
Are you okay?

1033
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,980
Yeah?

1034
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,980
Okay, okay, good.

1035
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,520
Okay, now, Erik,

1036
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,520
we're gonna ask

1037
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,520
you some questions.

1038
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,920
Danny, I thought we could

1039
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,920
spend some time

1040
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,590
looking over

1041
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,590
a few rehab centers.

1042
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,030
Thank you,

1043
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,030
but I made some calls.

1044
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,470
We're already booked

1045
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,470
in a private facility

1046
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,970
for as soon as

1047
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,970
he's discharged,

1048
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,030
which should be

1049
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,030
any minute, right?

1050
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,700
Are you sure you're

1051
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,700
feeling well enough

1052
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,700
to leave?

1053
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,550
Ah, well, if you ever

1054
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,550
want to talk.

1055
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,310
Thank you.

1056
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,820
Danny, are you okay?

1057
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,660
Yeah.

1058
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,660
We should get going.

1059
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,440
Because bowel obstructions

1060
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,440
can lead to irritation

1061
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,440
in the diaphragm

1062
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,980
if they aren't fully resolved,

1063
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,410
I feel like I should keep you

1064
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,410
for some more observation.

1065
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,350
You know, if it gets worse,

1066
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,350
we'll have it checked

1067
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,350
at rehab.

1068
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,610
There are doctors there.

1069
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,820
We should do a chest X-ray.

1070
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,220
Yes, yes, we need

1071
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,220
a stat chest X-ray.

1072
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,280
Could you take Danny

1073
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,280
over to radiology?

1074
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,420
I'll get a wheelchair.

1075
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,690
Really,

1076
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,690
I'm sure he'll be fine.

1077
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,690
We're on a schedule.

1078
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,000
Mrs. Jones, I see

1079
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,000
how concerned you are

1080
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,000
for your son,

1081
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,700
and I want to make sure

1082
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,700
he gets the best care.

1083
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,630
I promise we're gonna

1084
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,630
make this quick.

1085
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,330
So it turns out Erik's

1086
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,330
roommate was seen

1087
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,680
here up in GI three

1088
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,680
days ago for a bleed.

1089
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,180
But Erik wasn't here with him?

1090
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,980
No, but he's immunocompromised

1091
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,980
from rheumatoid

1092
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,980
arthritis meds,

1093
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,210
which means even

1094
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,210
if his roommate

1095
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,210
was just a carrier for CRE,

1096
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,020
Erik could easily

1097
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,020
catch it from him.

1098
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,810
And the patient in

1099
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,810
the ED at East Mercy?

1100
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,950
Was upstairs Monday

1101
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,950
to see his hematologist

1102
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,950
for chronic anemia.

1103
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,260
So with Hayley,

1104
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,260
that's three patients.

1105
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,260
All within the last few days.

1106
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,160
We are checking

1107
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,160
the hospital records

1108
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,160
line by line

1109
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,600
to see if they have

1110
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,600
anything in common.

1111
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,500
Staff, location,

1112
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,500
food, supplies.

1113
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,230
I think we're almost there.

1114
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,080
Maggie?

1115
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,680
Hey, what's going on?

1116
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,020
The hospital just received

1117
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,020
a set of legal papers.

1118
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,750
They're from Cindy's sister.

1119
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,320
She got in touch?

1120
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,660
I'm afraid so.

1121
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,160
She's ordering us

1122
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,160
to withdraw support.

1123
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,890
What? No!

1124
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,730
I've already spoken to Legal.

1125
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,900
There's nothing we can do.

1126
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,900
I am truly, truly sorry.

1127
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,270
Maggie, I had no idea...

1128
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,890
You feeling

1129
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,890
a little better, sweetheart?

1130
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,530
Well, it's still early,

1131
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,530
but it looks like

1132
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,530
her fever's breaking.

1133
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,660
I think the antibiotics

1134
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,660
may be starting to work.

1135
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,630
I'll be back in

1136
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,630
a bit to check in again.

1137
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,870
Thank you, Doctor.

1138
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,110
I think Hayley's

1139
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,110
turning the corner.

1140
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,510
Yeah, Erik's perking

1141
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,510
up a little bit too.

1142
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,810
Extubating him was risky.

1143
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,680
But it was a good call.

1144
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,120
I found our link.

1145
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,390
An endoscope?

1146
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,730
Hayley, Erik's roommate,

1147
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,730
the patient at East Mercy...

1148
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,600
All had endoscopies

1149
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,600
here in the last week.

1150
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,730
Okay, but we're

1151
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,730
always gowned and gloved,

1152
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,930
and everything

1153
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,930
gets sterilized.

1154
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,740
So, this crevice along the tip

1155
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,740
is just wide enough

1156
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,740
to harbor bacteria

1157
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,280
and small enough

1158
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,280
that even following

1159
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,280
the manufacturer's guidelines,

1160
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,340
it doesn't always

1161
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,340
clean that groove.

1162
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,350
Well, we have to tell the FDA.

1163
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,520
They know. They're

1164
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,520
the ones that told us.

1165
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,780
Wait.

1166
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,780
What?

1167
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,380
The FDA knows?

1168
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,380
Yes.

1169
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,860
Our hospital has

1170
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,860
dozens of these.

1171
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,860
There must be thousands in use

1172
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,860
across the country.

1173
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,090
That's why the FDA

1174
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,090
hasn't pulled them.

1175
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,630
They don't want to cause

1176
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,630
an endoscope shortage.

1177
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,500
So the agency created

1178
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,500
to protect patients is...

1179
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,430
Made a cost-benefit analysis.

1180
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,470
I have to tell

1181
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,470
Hayley's parents.

1182
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,700
No, no, no, that's my job.

1183
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,440
Thank you all.

1184
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,600
Thank you.

1185
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,050
They knew about it.

1186
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,050
Unbelievable.

1187
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,850
It really is.

1188
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,220
But I was right about

1189
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,220
one thing. Told you it

1190
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,220
wasn't your fault.

1191
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,850
It's great,

1192
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,850
what you two have.

1193
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm sorry?

1194
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,990
You and Dr. Halstead,

1195
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,990
you're really good together.

1196
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,470
Straight edges, opaque.

1197
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,670
It looks man-made,

1198
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,670
like there was something

1199
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,670
under Danny on the table.

1200
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,730
No, this is definitely

1201
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,730
inside of him.

1202
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,870
I could be wrong, but I think

1203
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,870
this might be

1204
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,870
a tracking device.

1205
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,240
A what?

1206
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,080
A transponder.

1207
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,080
Emits a homing signal.

1208
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,080
Would explain how

1209
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,080
that woman found him.

1210
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,680
You mean his mom?

1211
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,120
Yeah. Is she, though?

1212
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,890
I mean, think about it...

1213
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,230
The guarded behavior,

1214
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,230
heroin abuse.

1215
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,320
Wait, you think

1216
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,320
he's a drug mule?

1217
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,370
Resistance to examination

1218
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,370
by male doctors,

1219
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,430
suggesting a history

1220
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,430
of abuse by other men.

1221
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,830
I've seen this before.

1222
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,330
I think that Danny

1223
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,330
might be a victim

1224
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,330
of sex trafficking.

1225
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,240
Sex trafficking?

1226
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,910
So that woman...

1227
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,580
Is his pimp.

1228
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,380
Wait, Sarah.

1229
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,340
Dr. Reese. Stop.

1230
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,620
We can't just

1231
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,620
let her take him.

1232
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,890
He is not a minor,

1233
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,890
so we have no right

1234
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,890
to intercede

1235
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,390
unless he explicitly

1236
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,390
asks us to.

1237
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,260
But he wanted me

1238
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,260
to find the chip.

1239
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,390
He wanted me to know.

1240
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,520
Well, what did he say?

1241
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,520
What exactly did he say?

1242
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,470
He didn't say anything,

1243
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,470
but with his...

1244
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,500
See, Sarah, it's not enough.

1245
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,500
Crazy as it sounds,

1246
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,500
we need to know that

1247
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,540
he's psychologically

1248
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,540
ready to be extricated.

1249
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,670
We do this the wrong way,

1250
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,670
we call the police,

1251
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,840
could be very,

1252
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,840
very bad for him.

1253
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,440
It's why we need to hear

1254
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,440
it from his own lips.

1255
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,440
Trust me.

1256
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,980
Then I need to talk to him.

1257
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,350
Danny?

1258
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,790
Thanks for all your help.

1259
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,780
What's gonna happen to him?

1260
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,350
Hey.

1261
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,360
Hi.

1262
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,490
Fellowship programs?

1263
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah, I'm just wondering

1264
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,000
if staying here was a mistake.

1265
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,990
Why?

1266
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,200
Latham. The man is odd.

1267
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,340
He says that he is not good

1268
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,340
with ambiguity.

1269
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,340
That is an understatement.

1270
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,880
He is from Mars.

1271
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,550
I am constantly trying

1272
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,550
to figure out who the hell

1273
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,550
is this guy,

1274
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,020
and I don't know if I can

1275
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,020
handle working

1276
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,350
with him every day

1277
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,350
for the next two years.

1278
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,010
Is he?

1279
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,720
I get why you'd feel that way.

1280
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,720
I just think he takes

1281
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,720
some getting used to.

1282
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,490
Did you just say, "Is he?"

1283
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,530
Why don't you come meet us

1284
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,530
on the balcony tonight

1285
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,530
around 7:00?

1286
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,330
Why should I do that?

1287
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,830
Because I think

1288
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,830
there's more to him

1289
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,830
than meets the eye.

1290
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,770
Okay.

1291
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,440
Mr. Hall.

1292
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,480
You're awake.

1293
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,790
You a doctor?

1294
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,680
Yes.

1295
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,250
We were worried about you.

1296
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,560
That girl.

1297
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,160
Laurie.

1298
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,360
Laurie.

1299
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,530
You should know,

1300
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,530
through all of this,

1301
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,230
she was your

1302
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,230
strongest advocate.

1303
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,470
I'm sure.

1304
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,670
Sir?

1305
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,880
I'm her...

1306
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,440
What's that word?

1307
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,740
Gravy train.

1308
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,710
Is that the word?

1309
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,820
Okay.

1310
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,270
You can't take it with you.

1311
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,150
How's he doing?

1312
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,480
Surprisingly well.

1313
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,850
You made the right decision,

1314
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,850
Dr. Choi.

1315
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,920
Did I?

1316
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,420
I don't know.

1317
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,620
It could have gone either way.

1318
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,300
Combat medicine

1319
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,300
was always so simple.

1320
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,030
Just save whoever

1321
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,030
they put in front of you.

1322
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,100
Never any questions.

1323
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,100
"Should I?"

1324
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,100
"Shouldn't I?"

1325
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,910
Never really had to

1326
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,910
deal with that before.

1327
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,550
Tell Mom I said hi.
