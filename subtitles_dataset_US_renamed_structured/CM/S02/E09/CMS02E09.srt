1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,130
April.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,130
Cutting board?

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,130
Huh?

4
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,830
Uh, corner cabinet

5
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,830
by the Lazy Susan.

6
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,490
Yeah.

7
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,300
And you still haven't weighed

8
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,300
in on the paint choices

9
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,300
that I asked you about.

10
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,900
Uh, what room is that

11
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,900
for again?

12
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,510
The den. Come on, Tate.

13
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,200
I've been working on

14
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,200
this remodel for weeks.

15
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,800
I know. I know.

16
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,800
I'm sorry, babe.

17
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,140
I love that you're making

18
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,140
my house our house.

19
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,190
I love that we set

20
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,190
a date for the wedding.

21
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,220
But I'm driving you crazy.

22
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,220
Yep.

23
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,950
You know what?

24
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,960
Stuck in a house,

25
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,960
on TB leave, I get it.

26
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,690
I mean, I've been

27
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,690
trying to keep busy,

28
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,560
'cause when I'm not,

29
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,560
I can't help but worry.

30
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,730
First ultrasound today?

31
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,730
Yeah.

32
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,200
It's gonna

33
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,200
be perfect.

34
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,580
Are you crazy?

35
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,580
Where's your jacket?

36
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,090
Don't need it.

37
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,090
I love the crisp

38
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,090
winter air.

39
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,360
Yeah, right. I can see

40
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,360
your goose bumps.

41
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,590
Oh, you mean

42
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,590
my pilomotor reflex?

43
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,750
Oh, good God.

44
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,870
Uh, anyway,

45
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,870
this weather is balmy.

46
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,030
Do you remember that

47
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,030
February when you and

48
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,030
Jeff and me and Lisa,

49
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,600
we rented that cabin

50
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,600
at Lake Mendota?

51
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,600
Yes.

52
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,870
And then we got hammered

53
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,870
on that box of wine

54
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,870
we found in the pantry.

55
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,570
Mmm. Which led

56
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,570
to the hot tub.

57
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,010
Which led to you

58
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,010
sneaking a peek.

59
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,310
I did not!

60
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,310
Did you?

61
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,320
No. Of course not.

62
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,420
You're terrible.

63
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,160
Seems like

64
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,160
a lifetime ago.

65
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,420
How'd we lose touch

66
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,420
for so long?

67
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,720
I'm not sure.

68
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,100
Life of a med student.

69
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,100
Lunch will wait.

70
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,210
Ricky Wade, GCS 15,

71
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,210
vitals stable.

72
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
You're going

73
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
to Treatment Four,

74
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
Dr. Choi.

75
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,850
Trauma to

76
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,850
the left ear with hematoma,

77
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,850
multiple dislocated fingers,

78
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,810
expanding hematoma

79
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,810
of the anterior thigh.

80
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,040
Refused the board

81
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,040
and collar.

82
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,310
I'm not a cripple.

83
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,310
I could've walked.

84
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,680
I know. MMA.

85
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,680
Feel no pain, right?

86
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,590
Any loss of

87
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,590
consciousness?

88
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,590
Dizziness?

89
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,820
Hell no. That bitch

90
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,820
barely connected.

91
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,090
Cage doc called the fight.

92
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,090
Said it was

93
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,090
a freakin' bloodbath.

94
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,150
All right.

95
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,150
Let's get an IV in him,

96
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,150
then a gram of Ancef.

97
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,190
The opponent?

98
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,190
Yep.

99
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,130
You're going to

100
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,130
Treatment Three.

101
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,130
Thanks.

102
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Cyrus Hammad.

103
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,000
GCS 15.

104
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,330
Significant swelling

105
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,330
to his left eye

106
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,740
and bruising on

107
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,740
the right flank.

108
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,830
No loss of

109
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,830
consciousness,

110
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,430
but the fight doc

111
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,430
wanted to have him

112
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,430
looked at, anyway.

113
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,070
You're lucky that doc

114
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,070
stopped the fight.

115
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,740
I would've pounded you

116
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,740
into a living...

117
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,010
Hey!

118
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,010
Not in the cage anymore,

119
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,010
huh? Give it a rest.

120
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,910
History and physical

121
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,910
and a detailed neuro exam.

122
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,920
Got it. I'll shout

123
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,920
if I need you.

124
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,920
Yeah.

125
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,280
Excuse me.

126
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,280
Yes?

127
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,850
I'm looking

128
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,850
for my brother,

129
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,850
Cyrus Hammad.

130
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,620
Cheating-ass punks!

131
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,120
What did you do?

132
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,120
Grease some palms?

133
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,360
You know your bro was

134
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,360
getting his ass beat.

135
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,730
I'm gonna need

136
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,730
security in the ED.

137
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,430
Dr. Choi! Stop him!

138
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,630
Come on! Come on!

139
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,630
Come on!

140
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,760
I swear to God!

141
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,890
Chill out!

142
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,890
Walk away.

143
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,800
You okay?

144
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,800
Yeah.

145
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,410
It's swollen.

146
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,410
Let's get some ice on

147
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,410
his thigh and hands.

148
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,290
Had that Arab eating

149
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,290
mat in the first round.

150
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,620
Should've stomped

151
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,620
him into oblivion.

152
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,820
You've got a lot of blood

153
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,820
in your ear, Mr. Wade.

154
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,450
I need to release

155
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,450
the pressure around

156
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,450
the cartilage,

157
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,520
or it will cauliflower.

158
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,170
Skip the Lido.

159
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,170
Last thing I need is

160
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,170
a mile-long hospital bill.

161
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,200
You're gonna feel it.

162
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,200
You sure?

163
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,700
Suit yourself.

164
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,540
Damn it, that hurts

165
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,540
like a mother!

166
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,840
Bastard was all

167
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,840
about cheap shots.

168
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,550
Towelhead!

169
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,550
What do you expect?

170
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,220
Gonna put a dressing

171
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,220
on the ear and get

172
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,220
a CT head and face.

173
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,150
Also some X-rays

174
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,150
of the hands.

175
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,870
What do we got?

176
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,110
Moderate swelling

177
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,110
in his left orbit,

178
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,110
probable fracture.

179
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,610
Inbreds. Always go for

180
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,610
the low-hanging fruit.

181
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,940
Elbow strike?

182
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,050
Hammerfist.

183
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,050
Sounds bad, I know,

184
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,050
but it was a legal shot.

185
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,720
May have a couple

186
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,720
fractured ribs.

187
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,250
CT orbits and

188
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,250
facial bones to start,

189
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,250
chest X-ray for the ribs?

190
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,750
Thanks.

191
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,100
I should hit up Rasheed.

192
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,570
Meet these jackasses

193
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,570
in the parking lot,

194
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,970
show them how

195
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,970
the towelheads do it.

196
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,970
Aamir, let it go.

197
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,660
This is why

198
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,660
you fight, Cyrus.

199
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,970
Not anymore.

200
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,000
"You can't

201
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,000
control ignorance,

202
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,000
only how you react."

203
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,370
Surah Al shura

204
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,370
verse 40.

205
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,690
Scans may take a while.

206
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,690
Moving around's

207
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,690
gonna hurt like hell.

208
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,700
How's a bit of

209
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,700
morphine sound?

210
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,960
Like heaven.

211
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,810
Findings showed

212
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,810
that people with

213
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,810
higher confidence

214
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,870
tend to use open,

215
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,870
expansive postures.

216
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,980
Sure. Hmm,

217
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,980
runner crosses

218
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,980
the finish line,

219
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,450
throw their hands

220
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,450
up in victory.

221
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,960
Exactly. Conversely, those

222
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,960
who are timid or defensive

223
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,960
make themselves small.

224
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,890
They'll slouch in their seats,

225
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,890
cross their arms, their legs,

226
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,600
and actually what

227
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,600
is really cool is...

228
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,320
Oh. Hey.

229
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,320
How you guys doing?

230
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,730
Good, good.

231
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,730
Uh... So far, so good.

232
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,730
You know, just another day.

233
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,170
Um, so, dinner tonight?

234
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,170
Our usual spot?

235
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,210
You got it.

236
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,210
Good.

237
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,400
Bye.

238
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,570
I will catch you guys later.

239
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,420
Crossed arms.

240
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,280
What?

241
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,280
Crossed arms.

242
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,880
Sorry.

243
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,880
Hey, Daniel?

244
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,160
Oh, listen, I need you

245
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,160
to evaluate a potential

246
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,160
organ recipient

247
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,230
to see if

248
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,230
she's a candidate

249
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,230
for transplant.

250
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,730
Her name's Meghan Scott.

251
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,730
LVAD. Still in SICU.

252
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,080
I know it's delicate, but if

253
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,080
you could get it back to me

254
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,080
by the end of the day?

255
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,170
I will do my very best.

256
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,470
Thank you.

257
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,550
Yeah. For two at 8:00 p.m.

258
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,550
Great. Thank you.

259
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,020
Look at you, all smiles.

260
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,020
Hot date?

261
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,050
Surprise date.

262
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,050
Oh.

263
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm taking Nina to

264
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,560
this French restaurant

265
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,560
on Monroe,

266
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,220
Cochon Volant Brasserie.

267
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,220
Nice.

268
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,390
Actually, it's Cochon

269
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,390
Volant Brasserie.

270
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,030
Dr. Stohl.

271
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,660
Personally,

272
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,660
I prefer Alinea.

273
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,430
It's American

274
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,430
molecular gastronomy

275
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,430
at its finest.

276
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,810
Highly ranked on

277
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,810
the S.Pellegrino list.

278
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,440
Didn't realize you were back

279
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,440
from your sabbatical already.

280
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,950
Or that you spoke French.

281
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,950
Oh, enough to get by.

282
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,380
Something I can do

283
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,380
for you, Dr. Stohl?

284
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,190
My sabbatical

285
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,190
was a World Health

286
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,190
Organization assignment.

287
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,520
I advised nongovernmental

288
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,520
emergency medical teams

289
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,960
on how best to respond

290
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,960
and treat SODs.

291
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,790
"Sudden Onset Disasters."

292
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,730
We should sit down

293
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,730
and talk about it.

294
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,530
Sure. Sounds great.

295
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,840
Who is that?

296
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,810
The Troll.

297
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,050
Our beloved Chief of

298
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,050
Emergency Medicine.

299
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,640
Okay.

300
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,580
Talk about

301
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,580
sudden onset disasters.

302
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,380
I've been sober

303
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,380
almost three years.

304
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,380
It's not been easy.

305
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,420
Temptation never

306
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,420
really goes away.

307
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,250
But you've done it, Mom.

308
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,500
Um, you been going

309
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,500
to meetings?

310
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,590
Alcoholics Anonymous?

311
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,940
I tried, but the endless talk

312
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,940
about hitting rock bottom,

313
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,700
I know it's supposed

314
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,700
to be cathartic,

315
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,010
but it just put me in

316
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,010
a worse mental space.

317
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,610
So, no meetings,

318
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,610
no therapy. Um...

319
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,550
Any relapses?

320
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,320
Wow, well, it's remarkable

321
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,320
that you've been able

322
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,320
to stay sober.

323
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,290
Congratulations.

324
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,290
Thank you.

325
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,860
I started meditating,

326
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,860
and, uh, setting small,

327
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,860
achievable goals,

328
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,950
and of course, Bria.

329
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,330
The crew Mom used

330
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,330
to hang with,

331
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,200
I helped her see

332
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,200
they were bad influences.

333
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,770
She dropped them all.

334
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,770
No more bars, nightlife.

335
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,710
She's, uh, a homebody now.

336
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,270
It's senior year.

337
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,270
Must be nice to have

338
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,270
Mom home more.

339
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,610
Is college in the picture?

340
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,740
Yes. But not right away.

341
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,820
We've agreed

342
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,820
I'd take a year off

343
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,820
before applying.

344
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,420
I'm sorry.

345
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,420
A bit parched.

346
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,070
I just... I just want

347
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,070
this to be over.

348
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,240
It's just important that

349
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,240
you understand that

350
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,440
this would be

351
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,440
a life-changing event,

352
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,440
the surgery.

353
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,780
And could really shake up

354
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,780
your and Bria's routine,

355
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,250
so, it's very important that

356
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,250
you have a postsurgical plan

357
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,250
in place.

358
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,450
I plan to keep doing

359
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,450
what I've been doing.

360
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,450
Going solo has worked.

361
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,260
I need to make sure

362
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,260
it keeps working.

363
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,640
What's the status

364
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,640
with the room change, Maggie?

365
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,770
These guys next-door

366
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,770
to each other are like napalm.

367
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,700
I'm working on it,

368
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,700
Dr. Choi.

369
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,700
Thanks.

370
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,620
Hey, man.

371
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,620
Where you headed?

372
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,010
To grab a pop.

373
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,920
Vending machine's in

374
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,920
the waiting room that way.

375
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,680
So, that's how

376
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,680
it's gonna be?

377
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,750
Whatever.

378
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,210
Hey, don't let those

379
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,210
ass-wipes get to you.

380
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,210
Just trying to be tough guys.

381
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,040
No, Jeff.

382
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,040
It goes deeper.

383
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,880
Not many families

384
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,880
with the last name

385
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,880
Choi where I grew up.

386
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,510
Know the type

387
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,510
all too well.

388
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,320
Dr. Manning, you're

389
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,320
going to Trauma Three.

390
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,320
Got it.

391
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,760
Ted Baylor,

392
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,760
21-year-old male.

393
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,090
Friends found him in

394
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,090
his dorm room, hooked up to

395
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,090
the Xbox and unresponsive.

396
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,370
Gave him fluids

397
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,370
and oxygen in the field.

398
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,000
Glucose level?

399
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,000
Blood sugar's 800.

400
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,130
That's sky-high.

401
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
I see the train

402
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
kept rolling without me.

403
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,970
Yep. Welcome back.

404
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,970
We missed you.

405
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,610
All right. On my count.

406
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,610
One, two, three.

407
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,750
Mr. Baylor? Mr. Baylor?

408
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,620
He's out. Sternal?

409
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,620
Yep.

410
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,020
There he is.

411
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,720
Mr. Baylor,

412
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,720
do you know

413
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,720
where you are?

414
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,950
Hospital.

415
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,290
Okay. He's able to speak

416
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,290
and protect his airway.

417
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,960
Good breath sounds.

418
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,960
Lungs are clear.

419
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,690
Maintaining

420
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,690
oxygen saturation.

421
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,270
All right,

422
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,270
let's keep him on the O2,

423
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,270
bolus another liter of fluid,

424
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,390
and start an insulin drip.

425
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,340
Labs?

426
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,340
What do you think?

427
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,970
Likely diabetic

428
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,970
ketoacidosis,

429
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,000
so, CBC, CMP, VBG, uh,

430
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,000
hemoglobin, A1-C,

431
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,000
and another Accu-Chek.

432
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,870
Uh, for cardiac,

433
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,870
troponin and an EKG.

434
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,480
Nice job.

435
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,390
Help! Help!

436
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,390
Something's wrong!

437
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,190
I got it.

438
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,190
What happened?

439
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,420
What happened?

440
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,730
He was talking, and then

441
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,730
his eyes rolled back.

442
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,730
I don't know.

443
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,390
Got a pulse,

444
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,390
but he can't protect

445
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,390
his airway.

446
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,600
All right, we need to

447
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,600
intubate. Draw up meds.

448
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,140
Twenty of etomidate,

449
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,140
100 of sux.

450
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,200
Is he gonna be okay?

451
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,200
We'll see.

452
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,940
Hold the meds.

453
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,940
Don't need them.

454
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,940
No gag reflex.

455
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm in. Bag him.

456
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,820
Let's get an OG tube down

457
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,820
to decompress his stomach.

458
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,150
His pupil's blown.

459
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,150
He must have a head bleed.

460
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,160
Page neurosurgery.

461
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,160
We need a stat head CT.

462
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,080
Hi.

463
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,450
Dr. Manning, I presume?

464
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,120
I know. Corny.

465
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,090
A little.

466
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,090
But making jokes?

467
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,090
Feeling better?

468
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,450
Compared to before?

469
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,450
I mean, it still feels like

470
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,450
I got hit by a truck.

471
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,790
What happened?

472
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,860
Your body wasn't producing

473
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,860
enough insulin to control

474
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,860
your blood sugar,

475
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,930
so it spiked and

476
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,930
it knocked you out.

477
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,590
Is it diabetes?

478
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,590
Yes.

479
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,470
But the crisis period

480
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,470
is over.

481
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,640
Your blood sugar levels

482
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,640
are improving.

483
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,680
You okay?

484
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,680
It's just a little tender.

485
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,840
Do you mind

486
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,840
if I take a look?

487
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,760
Pain scale,

488
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,760
one to ten?

489
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,760
Twelve.

490
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,200
Okay. How long

491
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,200
has your stomach

492
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,200
been hurting?

493
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,460
A few days. I mean,

494
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,460
it's winter break.

495
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,230
Just more cheap beer

496
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,230
and pizza than usual.

497
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,370
I figured it was

498
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,370
just indigestion.

499
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,370
Is it the diabetes?

500
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,770
No.

501
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,200
Gallstones.

502
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,510
I would like to run some

503
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,510
additional blood tests

504
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,510
and get an MRCP,

505
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,690
a more detailed scan

506
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,690
of your stomach, okay?

507
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,320
Mmm-hmm.

508
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,690
Is there anyone

509
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,690
I can call for you?

510
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,890
No. My dad's on his way.

511
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,890
All right.

512
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,920
He had them.

513
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,920
Gallstones.

514
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,590
They're a fat person's

515
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,590
problem, aren't they?

516
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,300
They are often

517
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,300
tied to obesity.

518
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,170
The diabetes as well.

519
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,270
But, you know, with

520
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,270
lifestyle changes, these

521
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,270
things are manageable.

522
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,170
You mean like

523
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,170
diet and exercise?

524
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,140
You're only 21. It'd be

525
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,140
easier than you think.

526
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,140
I'll be back shortly.

527
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,670
Massive hemorrhaging

528
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,670
in his brain.

529
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,470
Trying to get

530
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,470
the swelling

531
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,470
under control.

532
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,940
Decompressive

533
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,940
craniectomy.

534
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,480
Opening up the skull

535
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,480
should relieve

536
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,480
the pressure.

537
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,670
Yeah, but right before

538
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,670
they put him under,

539
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,280
he had

540
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,280
a Cushing's reflex.

541
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,520
Dropped his heart rate,

542
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,520
and his BP went

543
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,520
through the roof.

544
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,980
Hang in, man.

545
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,430
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

546
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,840
All right, I'll check.

547
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,840
Sure. Uh-huh.

548
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,410
Everything okay?

549
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,550
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

550
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,280
So, uh, Meghan Scott.

551
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,490
I gotta say I have

552
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,490
some reservations.

553
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,920
But she's three years

554
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,920
sober and committed

555
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,920
to staying clean.

556
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,590
Yeah. Without

557
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,590
a plan or strategy

558
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,590
to avoid relapse.

559
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,700
Addiction is

560
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,700
never conquered.

561
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,700
Only managed.

562
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,890
But she's got a support

563
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,890
system in her daughter.

564
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,890
Bria's involved.

565
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,530
Mmm. Maybe too involved.

566
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,040
I mean,

567
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,040
by delaying college,

568
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,330
she is valuating

569
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,330
her mother's life

570
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,330
over her own,

571
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,310
and as admirable

572
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,310
as that may seem,

573
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,870
it just doesn't

574
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,870
tend to last.

575
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,400
Meghan's sick.

576
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,240
It makes sense

577
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,240
that she'd want

578
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,240
to take care of her.

579
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,710
There's

580
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,710
a very fine line between

581
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,710
a healthy support system

582
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,110
and an unhealthy

583
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,110
dependence.

584
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,590
I mean, did you see

585
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,590
during the evaluation,

586
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,590
Meghan needed

587
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,590
her daughter's help to

588
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,590
reach a glass of water

589
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,460
that was literally

590
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,460
right in front of her?

591
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,090
Look, it's a

592
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,090
gut-wrenching process,

593
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,300
and we just have to remember

594
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,300
that we give Meghan a heart,

595
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,230
we could be denying one

596
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,230
to somebody who is just

597
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,230
as deserving,

598
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,040
and might have

599
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,040
a better chance of success.

600
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,810
So, Meghan's a no?

601
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,310
No, I didn't say that.

602
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,310
I just...

603
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,310
I just want

604
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,310
to sit with it

605
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,310
a little longer.

606
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,010
Okay.

607
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,090
That gallbladder's

608
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,090
really inflamed.

609
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,090
It's full of stones.

610
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,030
But it doesn't look like

611
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,030
any have dropped into

612
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,030
the common bile duct.

613
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,060
No, but it's only a matter

614
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,060
of time before one does

615
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,500
and causes

616
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,500
a major obstruction.

617
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,560
Right.

618
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,800
Well, play it safe,

619
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,800
remove the gallbladder?

620
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,340
Yes, except

621
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,340
his latest labs.

622
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,140
Calcium's low.

623
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,140
Amylase, lipase, white cells,

624
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,140
are all through the roof.

625
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,340
Gallstone pancreatitis.

626
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,340
Man.

627
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,270
The swelling

628
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,270
is really bad.

629
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,450
Right now, I think we

630
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,450
should up his IV fluids

631
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,080
and start a course

632
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,080
of IV nutrition.

633
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,790
Should buy him a few days,

634
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,790
give his pancreas time

635
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,790
to cool off. Good idea.

636
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,150
Good.

637
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,860
What does this mean?

638
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,360
His pupils are

639
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,360
nonreactive?

640
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,700
The bleeding in

641
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,700
Cyrus' brain has caused

642
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,700
significant injury.

643
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,630
Despite the surgeon's

644
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,630
best efforts,

645
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,440
Cyrus has slipped

646
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,440
into a persistent

647
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,440
vegetative state.

648
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,540
A coma?

649
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,080
But he can wake up, no?

650
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,080
It's possible?

651
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,860
I'm sorry, but it's more

652
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,860
likely he stays like this

653
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,860
or devolves to brain death.

654
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,130
That referee,

655
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,130
he should've stopped

656
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,130
the fight earlier.

657
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,260
Cyrus was dominant.

658
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,770
The crowd,

659
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,770
they cheered for blood.

660
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,440
They wanted to see

661
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,440
the Muslim boy get killed.

662
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,160
Hey.

663
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,120
Oh!

664
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,760
All bundled up?

665
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,660
You realize your pilomotor

666
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,660
reflex is the first

667
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,660
step towards frostbite?

668
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,730
Yeah. Something

669
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,730
like that.

670
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,960
So, you know,

671
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,960
I've been sitting on

672
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,960
this for a while now,

673
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,400
and, uh,

674
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,400
it might sound silly,

675
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,710
but I believe

676
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,710
if couples are

677
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,710
good travel partners,

678
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,410
then they have what it

679
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,410
takes to have a future.

680
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,680
So, what do you think?

681
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,340
New Orleans?

682
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,340
Drinks, food, music?

683
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,890
I...

684
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,390
"I sometimes imagine, uh,

685
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,390
it was the other way around,

686
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,590
"that Lisa was your wife

687
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,590
and Natalie was mine."

688
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,660
What are you talking about?

689
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,660
I said that to Jeff.

690
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,530
That's why we all lost touch.

691
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,530
He didn't want us to hang out

692
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,530
anymore.

693
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,130
I don't understand.

694
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,070
Right when Lisa and

695
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,070
I started to go sideways,

696
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,550
you and Jeff met me out

697
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,550
at Twin Anchors

698
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,550
for moral support.

699
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,980
Yeah, I remember.

700
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,420
You were up at the bar

701
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,420
ordering a round,

702
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,320
and I was looking at you,

703
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,320
and I just said it.

704
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,680
Why?

705
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,650
'Cause my marriage

706
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,650
was falling apart and

707
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,650
I was a little bit drunk,

708
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,560
and right at that moment,

709
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,560
it was true.

710
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,800
Jeff, of course,

711
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,800
flipped out,

712
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,970
and, uh, I mean,

713
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,970
if you weren't there,

714
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,970
it might've gotten ugly.

715
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,730
And you're just

716
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,730
telling me this now?

717
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,700
I know. I should've

718
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,700
told you this morning

719
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,700
when you asked.

720
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,860
This morning?

721
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,770
How about

722
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,770
when you showed up

723
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,770
as a med student?

724
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,240
Or before we slept

725
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,240
together, or before

726
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,240
I let you into my life?

727
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,840
Unbelievable.

728
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,060
Hi.

729
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,060
Setting up

730
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,060
grocery delivery.

731
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,890
Farewell,

732
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,890
supermarket temptations.

733
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,720
Well, that's

734
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,720
a good first step.

735
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,720
Mmm-hmm.

736
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,990
You know there's

737
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,990
some great apps for

738
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,990
tracking calories, too.

739
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,330
That's way

740
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,330
down the line.

741
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,890
I mean, after I get

742
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,890
a handle on GMOs,

743
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,500
gluten, organic versus

744
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,500
farm-fresh. I...

745
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,770
That's why

746
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,770
I like fast food.

747
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,770
It's simple.

748
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,270
You know what?

749
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,270
Why don't I page

750
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,270
the hospital's nutritionist,

751
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,980
have her come in

752
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,980
for a consult?

753
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,510
You okay?

754
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,910
I've just been feeling

755
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,910
a little bit short

756
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,910
of breath, and...

757
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,680
Just come on now?

758
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,450
A couple minutes ago.

759
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,960
Is it a reaction to

760
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,960
all the meds, or...

761
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,050
No. They're just

762
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,050
sparking your

763
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,050
immune system.

764
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,150
It shouldn't affect

765
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,150
your breathing.

766
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,390
Sit up for me?

767
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,570
Lungs are clear.

768
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,570
Is the extra

769
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,570
oxygen helping?

770
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,200
No, not really.

771
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,430
Will? Will,

772
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,430
I need a hand.

773
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,240
Stat portable

774
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,240
chest X-ray.

775
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,280
What's going on?

776
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,280
Blood sugar's normal.

777
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,980
White cells, amylase,

778
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,980
lipase, they're all down.

779
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,750
Everything's good,

780
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,750
except now he can't breathe.

781
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,420
What's happening?

782
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,950
Your blood pressure

783
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,950
and oxygen levels

784
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,950
keep dropping,

785
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,820
so we're gonna take

786
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,820
a chest X-ray to try

787
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,820
to figure out why.

788
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,530
Mass in the lung.

789
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,140
I'm hearing a rub.

790
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,140
It wasn't there before.

791
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,000
All right.

792
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,000
Let's get an echo.

793
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,310
I can't breathe.

794
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,570
O2 keeps dropping.

795
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,570
Switching to

796
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,570
a full face mask.

797
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,450
Pericardial effusion.

798
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,820
What does that mean?

799
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,820
No, keep this on.

800
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,580
There's fluid built up

801
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,580
around your heart.

802
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,090
It's constricting it

803
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,090
from beating.

804
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,930
Bolus another liter of fluid.

805
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,930
Get 125mg Solu-Medrol IV

806
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,230
and a Levophed drip.

807
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,230
Yes, Doctor.

808
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,430
Page Dr. Rhodes.

809
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,430
We need to tap

810
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,430
the fluid off his heart.

811
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,400
Five minutes ago,

812
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,400
he was getting better,

813
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,100
and now, he's sicker

814
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,100
than when he came in.

815
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,290
Okay.

816
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,000
So, the fluid's from

817
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,000
acute pericarditis.

818
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,140
Stemming from the mass

819
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,140
in his lungs.

820
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,140
Mmm-hmm.

821
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,550
Drain's a temporary fix,

822
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,550
but his heart is

823
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,550
really struggling.

824
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,180
CT chest will show

825
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,180
exactly what

826
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,180
we're dealing with.

827
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,480
He presented

828
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,480
with hyperglycemia and

829
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,480
gallstone pancreatitis.

830
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,660
There was

831
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,660
absolutely no evidence

832
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,660
of a heart problem.

833
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,330
My time with Dr. Downey,

834
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,330
now Dr. Latham,

835
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,330
the one constant,

836
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,190
cardiac events can

837
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,190
strike without warning.

838
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,130
Thought he was

839
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,130
on the mend.

840
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,130
So did I.

841
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,770
Look. About earlier...

842
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,940
Dr. Manning?

843
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,940
Yeah?

844
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,410
Ted's father

845
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,410
has arrived.

846
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,810
I can fill him in.

847
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,810
No. I'll do it.

848
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,680
Hi. Dr. Manning.

849
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,800
Okay. Hard part's done.

850
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,800
Big muscle bleeder down deep.

851
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,070
Stick tying it now.

852
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,680
The Arab,

853
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,480
Cyrus...

854
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,220
You wheeled him out of here,

855
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,220
but he never came back.

856
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,520
What happened?

857
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,060
Turn for the worse.

858
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,630
He knew the risks

859
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,630
when he stepped

860
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,630
inside the cage.

861
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,700
It's the cost of

862
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,700
doing business.

863
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,670
Shower and change

864
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,670
the dressing every day.

865
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,040
It'll take at least two

866
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,040
to three weeks to heal.

867
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,840
Pack the wound.

868
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,620
Get him out of here.

869
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,950
Bulky, swollen lymph nodes

870
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,950
and a clear primary mass

871
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,620
in the right lower lobe

872
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,620
of the lung.

873
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,620
Non-small

874
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,620
cell lung cancer?

875
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,300
The biopsy

876
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,300
results are pending,

877
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,930
but I'm almost certain

878
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,930
they'll confirm it.

879
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,900
I'm gonna talk

880
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,900
to Dr. Latham about

881
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,900
surgical options.

882
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,000
All right.

883
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,000
I'll consult with oncology,

884
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,000
get their opinion as well.

885
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,410
Yeah.

886
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,110
Hey. Sorry, Nat.

887
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,610
Thank you.

888
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,610
Yeah.

889
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,420
Hey, Dr. Charles.

890
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,520
Um...

891
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,050
Speak with you

892
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,050
a second?

893
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,050
What's up?

894
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,650
Yeah, so, my heart

895
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,650
patient Meghan Scott,

896
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,650
I hadn't heard anything.

897
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,920
So, is there something

898
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,920
going on with

899
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,920
the transplant eval?

900
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
Well, I know you know

901
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
that we're not supposed

902
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,330
to be talking about this,

903
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,330
but unofficially,

904
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,230
her history of addiction

905
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,230
makes her very high risk.

906
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,460
I understand her history,

907
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,460
but we're talking

908
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,460
about her future here.

909
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,300
Well, her future's

910
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,300
precisely the issue.

911
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,740
I'm sorry, Dr. Rhodes,

912
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,740
but the clearance process,

913
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,740
it's unforgiving.

914
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,980
No, no, no, no.

915
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,980
Dr. Charles, you spent, what?

916
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,980
All of an hour with her?

917
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,380
I've known Meghan

918
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,380
and her daughter, Bria,

919
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,380
for months now.

920
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,340
You've known her

921
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,340
within a controlled

922
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,340
environment.

923
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,250
The invasive surgery,

924
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,450
the powerful opiates

925
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,450
for pain management,

926
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,220
the rigorous

927
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,220
medication schedule,

928
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,990
the constant check-ups

929
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,990
to make sure she's

930
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,990
not rejecting the organ.

931
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,000
So, you're gonna

932
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,000
seal her fate with

933
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,000
a checklist then?

934
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,200
She doesn't get a heart,

935
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,200
she dies.

936
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,790
She's looking

937
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,790
at six months,

938
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,790
maybe a year.

939
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,230
Do you honestly think

940
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,230
that I don't know that?

941
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,070
Someone's got to make

942
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,070
the tough decisions here,

943
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,070
Dr. Rhodes.

944
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,500
I'd thank you

945
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,500
to let me do my job.

946
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,290
Amniotic fluid level

947
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,290
looks okay.

948
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,420
Same with

949
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,420
nuchal translucency.

950
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,660
Fetal heart rate is 180,

951
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,660
nice and strong.

952
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,720
Oh, yeah,

953
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,720
that's a boy.

954
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,660
What's up, little man?

955
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,660
Already looking

956
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,660
like a linebacker.

957
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,870
Um, she looks like

958
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,870
a scientist to me.

959
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,200
Dr. Lee? Something wrong?

960
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,210
At 12 weeks,

961
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,210
the optimal crown chin

962
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,210
length is 26 millimeters.

963
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,770
Your fetal measurement is 23.

964
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,080
Is that still within

965
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,080
the normal range?

966
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,750
Yes, but on

967
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,750
the low end.

968
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,250
Something we need

969
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,250
to keep an eye on.

970
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,320
Low measurement,

971
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,320
what does it mean?

972
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,920
The main concern

973
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,920
is anencephaly,

974
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,950
a neural tube defect

975
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,950
that can cause the brain

976
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,950
to develop abnormally.

977
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,930
Is it because of

978
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,930
my TB meds?

979
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,730
Possibly. We can't

980
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,730
really know for sure.

981
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,260
All right.

982
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,050
She said the TB meds

983
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,050
could possibly be

984
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,050
affecting the baby.

985
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,810
That doesn't mean...

986
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,810
I know.

987
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,290
But what if they are?

988
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,290
You can't stop taking them.

989
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,250
So, where does

990
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,250
that leave us?

991
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,760
Look. You're 12 weeks.

992
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,860
If we're considering...

993
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,860
We're not.

994
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,530
April, it's not

995
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,530
what I want either,

996
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,800
but if your health

997
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,800
is in question,

998
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,500
the quality of

999
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,500
life of our baby

1000
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,500
is threatened, I...

1001
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,700
We need to understand

1002
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,740
this gets riskier,

1003
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,740
more complicated

1004
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,740
after 14 weeks.

1005
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,150
Tate, I am Catholic.

1006
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,550
April, it's my baby, too.

1007
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,550
Don't I at least get

1008
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,550
to discuss this?

1009
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,350
We are not

1010
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,350
terminating

1011
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,350
this pregnancy.

1012
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,330
So, how long would

1013
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,330
I have to do chemo for?

1014
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,140
That's up to

1015
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,140
the oncologist.

1016
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,560
Generally, it's given

1017
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,560
in cycles between one

1018
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,560
and four weeks long

1019
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,940
followed by

1020
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,940
a period of rest.

1021
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,670
How many cycles?

1022
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,600
On average, four to six.

1023
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,440
What about side effects?

1024
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,440
The Internet lists thousands.

1025
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,810
It all depends on

1026
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,810
how Ted's body reacts.

1027
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,680
But, yes,

1028
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,680
the side effects can add up.

1029
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,950
And because of

1030
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,950
the gallstone pancreatitis,

1031
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,950
they may even be exacerbated.

1032
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,120
Well, all of this

1033
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,120
sounds awful. Um...

1034
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,990
What am I looking

1035
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,990
at with surgery?

1036
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,690
Removal of the mass

1037
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,690
via thoracotomy.

1038
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,730
I'll open your chest

1039
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,600
and peel away the growth

1040
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,600
from whatever

1041
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,600
it's attached to.

1042
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,900
But my pancreatitis,

1043
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,900
a few hours ago,

1044
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,530
it was too dicey for

1045
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,530
gallbladder surgery.

1046
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,200
How is it okay

1047
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,200
with all of this?

1048
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,440
Your cardiac function

1049
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,440
is compromised.

1050
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,380
Preventing heart failure has

1051
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,380
to be our chief concern.

1052
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,120
Dad, I don't know

1053
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,120
what I'm gonna do.

1054
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,590
I feel like if I make

1055
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,590
the wrong decision

1056
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,590
right now, I'm gonna die.

1057
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,190
Do you need

1058
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,190
an answer right now?

1059
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,160
Ted, look,

1060
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,160
I understand this

1061
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,160
is all overwhelming,

1062
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,620
but you're very sick.

1063
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,130
The sooner we start

1064
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,130
fighting back...

1065
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,400
Emergency radiation.

1066
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,700
Yeah, a single dose

1067
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,700
intended only to stabilize

1068
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,700
the mass in your lung.

1069
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,000
It'll give the pancreatitis

1070
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,000
a few more days to heal,

1071
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,610
and it'll give you

1072
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,610
and your dad more time

1073
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,610
to decide on a treatment.

1074
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,280
And if I still choose

1075
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,280
surgery after,

1076
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,280
it'll be safer, right?

1077
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,210
Theoretically, yes.

1078
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,760
When can I do it?

1079
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,760
The radiation.

1080
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,890
Today. I will set

1081
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,890
it up with the

1082
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,890
radiation oncologist.

1083
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,130
You gonna just

1084
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,130
stand there staring,

1085
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,130
or are you gonna come in?

1086
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,030
I can't get this

1087
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,030
frickin' coffee ring

1088
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,030
off of...

1089
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,630
What's on your mind?

1090
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,500
I know

1091
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,500
you have reservations,

1092
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,540
but I've been reading about

1093
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,540
how others have managed

1094
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,540
addiction in unorthodox ways.

1095
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,540
There's meditation.

1096
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,540
Meghan already does that.

1097
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,450
Predicting your weak spots.

1098
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,690
She's cut off friends

1099
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,690
that were bad influences.

1100
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,580
The problem with

1101
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,580
these techniques is that

1102
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,580
they're all solo endeavors.

1103
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,460
What Meghan

1104
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,460
needs is the support

1105
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,460
of a sober community.

1106
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,800
But she's been

1107
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,800
successful without one.

1108
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,870
And she's got Bria,

1109
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,870
all the reason in

1110
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,870
the world to stay sober.

1111
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,930
Won't be enough.

1112
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,300
I've been treating

1113
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,300
addiction for

1114
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,300
over 20 years.

1115
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,740
And trust me.

1116
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,740
I know of what I speak.

1117
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,310
My brother lost

1118
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,310
his battle with addiction

1119
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,310
about 14 years ago.

1120
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,520
I am sorry.

1121
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,780
I want Meghan to succeed

1122
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,780
just as badly as you do.

1123
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,150
But I look at her, and I...

1124
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,150
I see my little brother.

1125
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,100
He tried to do it solo, too.

1126
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,100
It just doesn't work.

1127
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,060
And I can't in good

1128
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,060
conscience recommend her to

1129
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,060
the Transplant Committee

1130
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,370
without one good,

1131
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,370
solid, clinical reason

1132
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,930
that might give her

1133
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,930
a chance to succeed.

1134
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,940
I've been looking for it.

1135
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,940
I just can't find it.

1136
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,380
Okay.

1137
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,690
Hey. Okay to discharge

1138
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,690
the asthmatic

1139
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,690
in Treatment Two?

1140
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,230
Yeah. Prednisone

1141
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,230
and albuterol scripts

1142
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,230
are with the clerk.

1143
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,600
They've been going for

1144
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,600
the last several hours,

1145
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,600
trading places.

1146
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,640
They believe prayer

1147
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,640
can bring him out.

1148
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,450
What are you

1149
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,450
doing over here?

1150
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,080
I just, um...

1151
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,920
I'm not sure.

1152
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,550
You've been discharged.

1153
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,550
Go home.

1154
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,530
You're showing

1155
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,530
your face around here?

1156
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,360
You better suck

1157
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,360
in all that!

1158
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,990
Is he gonna wake up?

1159
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,930
Like you care. You did

1160
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,930
this to him. Murderer!

1161
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,770
It's not my fault.

1162
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,770
We both wanted to win.

1163
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,600
Go home, Ricky.

1164
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,600
God will punish you.

1165
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,900
You will burn in hell!

1166
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,900
Aamir!

1167
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,240
Enough.

1168
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,300
Come. Pray with us.

1169
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,260
I'm sorry.

1170
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,230
I'm sorry.

1171
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,690
Dr. Halstead,

1172
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,690
a moment.

1173
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,690
Yeah?

1174
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,530
Dr. Manning's patient,

1175
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,530
Ted Baylor...

1176
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,870
I understand

1177
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,870
surgery was proposed,

1178
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,700
but that radiation

1179
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,700
will be tried first.

1180
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,670
As a short-term measure.

1181
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,640
Yeah, well,

1182
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,640
it's the size of the mass

1183
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,640
that's killing him.

1184
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,300
Radiation only

1185
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,300
stalls its growth.

1186
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,300
It doesn't shrink it.

1187
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,340
Well, Dr. Manning's

1188
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,340
opinion and mine

1189
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,410
is that radiation

1190
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,410
is the much safer

1191
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,410
option right now.

1192
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,580
Well, you're the attending.

1193
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,580
Keep me posted.

1194
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,490
Hey, Daniel, I haven't gotten

1195
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,490
your report on Meghan Scott.

1196
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,490
How's it going?

1197
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,430
Um, still dotting the I's,

1198
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,430
crossing the T's.

1199
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,800
You know, I know

1200
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,800
these evaluations

1201
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,800
are difficult,

1202
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,340
but if you're looking

1203
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,340
for something

1204
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,570
and not finding it,

1205
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,570
maybe it's not there.

1206
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,000
I said I'd have it for you

1207
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,000
before the end of the day,

1208
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,000
and I will.

1209
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,600
Okay.

1210
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,520
From now on,

1211
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,520
clean nutrition, lots of

1212
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,520
cardio, diet and exercise.

1213
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,550
My dad, too.

1214
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,320
That's the enthusiasm

1215
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,320
I was hoping to hear.

1216
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,890
I'm getting a second chance.

1217
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,890
I'm not wasting a day of it.

1218
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,030
Good for you.

1219
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,430
Okay, let's do this.

1220
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,940
Natalie, hey.

1221
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,380
I am so sorry

1222
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,380
that I didn't say

1223
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,380
something sooner.

1224
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,950
I was afraid

1225
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,950
I'd lose you.

1226
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,060
Say something, please.

1227
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,970
I was terrified to

1228
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,970
move on from Jeff.

1229
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,060
Even more afraid

1230
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,060
to get involved with you,

1231
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,060
my husband's best friend.

1232
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,130
And yet I thought

1233
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,130
there is no one

1234
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,140
Jeff would approve of me

1235
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,140
being in a relationship

1236
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,140
with more than you.

1237
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,370
And you let me

1238
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,370
think that.

1239
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,970
He's coding!

1240
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,970
I need help!

1241
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,240
What happened?

1242
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,240
He just dropped.

1243
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,620
Take over compressions.

1244
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,620
Got it.

1245
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,180
I got it. I got it.

1246
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,180
No pulse. V-fib.

1247
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,720
Charge 200.

1248
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,720
Charging.

1249
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,720
Hold compressions. Clear.

1250
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,820
Resume compressions.

1251
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,390
Another milligram epi.

1252
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,390
Charge to 300.

1253
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,390
Charging.

1254
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,300
Hold compressions.

1255
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,560
Clear.

1256
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,980
Asystole.

1257
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,080
You gonna call it?

1258
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,080
Time of death, 17:32.

1259
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,550
He was dead before

1260
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,550
the first alarm

1261
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,550
even went off.

1262
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,990
COD, tumor

1263
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,990
lysis syndrome.

1264
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,990
No way.

1265
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,660
You know, the radiation

1266
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,660
was supposed to

1267
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,660
stabilize the mass.

1268
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,220
Instead,

1269
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,220
it caused it to burst.

1270
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,530
I might as well

1271
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,530
have just given Ted

1272
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,530
a lethal injection,

1273
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,340
because that is

1274
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,340
essentially

1275
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,340
what happened.

1276
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,430
Natalie,

1277
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,430
this is not on you.

1278
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,110
There are no predictors

1279
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,110
for tumor lysis syndrome.

1280
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,880
It is monumentally rare.

1281
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,580
Even more so

1282
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,580
in young people.

1283
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,410
And the few times

1284
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,410
that it does occur,

1285
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,720
overwhelmingly,

1286
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,720
it's a reaction to

1287
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,720
chemo, not radiation.

1288
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,190
It still feels like

1289
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,190
I missed something.

1290
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,560
Well, you didn't.

1291
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,790
No doctor sees

1292
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,790
gallstone pancreatitis

1293
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,790
with diabetes

1294
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,350
and thinks volatile

1295
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,350
cancerous chest mass.

1296
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,890
And yet here it is.

1297
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,400
Ted's death is

1298
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,400
not your fault.

1299
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,520
You just get good news,

1300
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,520
or bad news?

1301
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,500
My coma patient,

1302
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,360
this morning,

1303
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,360
he mentioned

1304
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,360
a Quran verse,

1305
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,700
Surah Al shura 40.

1306
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,930
"The recompense

1307
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,930
of an evil deed

1308
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,570
"can only be

1309
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,570
an evil equal to it,

1310
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,480
"but whoever pardons

1311
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,480
and makes reconciliation,

1312
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,310
"their reward

1313
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,310
is due from God."

1314
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,650
In the psych world,

1315
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,650
it's called

1316
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,650
complementarity.

1317
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,560
You know,

1318
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,560
kindness begets kindness.

1319
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,560
Hostility, hostility.

1320
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,960
Yeah.

1321
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,930
An hour ago,

1322
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,930
those two hated each other,

1323
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,000
but then his father

1324
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,000
extends a hand.

1325
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,370
Dr. Charles calls it

1326
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,370
"flipping the script."

1327
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,410
Don't know if

1328
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,410
I could've done it.

1329
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,740
Yeah.

1330
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,740
Not many people can.

1331
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,250
Okay, what is with you?

1332
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,140
No invitation to sit down?

1333
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,780
Usually I can't

1334
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,780
sneak past you.

1335
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,520
I'm just

1336
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,520
a little preoccupied.

1337
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,990
I gotta figure

1338
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,990
something out fast,

1339
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,990
and I'm at a roadblock,

1340
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,080
and I can't find

1341
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,080
my way around it.

1342
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,960
Okay, I will leave you to it.

1343
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,930
Hey, uh, if you're going

1344
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,930
through hell, keep going.

1345
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,760
Isn't that what

1346
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,760
you always taught me?

1347
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,240
Well, technically,

1348
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,240
it was Winston Churchill,

1349
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,240
but...

1350
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,540
Still, it's never

1351
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,540
let me down.

1352
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,540
Mmm.

1353
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,770
Good.

1354
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,890
Mom.

1355
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,890
You're recommending Meghan

1356
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,890
to the hospital's

1357
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,890
Transplant Committee.

1358
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,990
Uh-huh.

1359
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,230
Well, what happened?

1360
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,070
Well, um, if you must know,

1361
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,500
a member of my junior staff

1362
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,500
drew my attention

1363
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,500
to the fact that, um,

1364
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,300
I was so focused

1365
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,300
on her risk factors,

1366
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,910
that I was blind to

1367
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,910
the one personality trait that

1368
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,910
my late brother did not have.

1369
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,710
What?

1370
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,710
Grit.

1371
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:59,950
One's ability to persevere

1372
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:59,950
in the face of obstacles,

1373
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:59,950
a clean clinical reason.

1374
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,030
I mean, the stressors

1375
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,030
are still there,

1376
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,120
as are significant

1377
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,120
future challenges,

1378
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,690
but I like to think

1379
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,690
that the determination

1380
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,630
that's kept her clean

1381
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,630
the past three years

1382
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,360
is gonna help her

1383
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,360
go the distance.

1384
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,870
Mmm-hmm.

1385
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,630
Hey, what made you

1386
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,630
think of grit?

1387
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,470
Fatherhood.

1388
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,190
Rough one today, huh?

1389
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,790
To say the least.

1390
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,050
Well, not to pile on,

1391
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,070
but Dr. Stohl just

1392
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,070
informed me that he'd

1393
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,070
like to use your case

1394
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,930
for the next Morbidity

1395
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,930
and Mortality Review.

1396
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,700
Trace your steps.

1397
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,700
An M&M?

1398
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,700
Oh, my God.

1399
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,140
Well, it's not

1400
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,140
an inquisition.

1401
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,580
It's just a learning tool

1402
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,580
for the medical staff.

1403
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,840
You tell Dr. Stohl that?

1404
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,910
Okay, good night.

1405
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,480
All righty. Good night.

1406
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,700
What now?

1407
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,130
You can't kick me

1408
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,130
out of here, too.

1409
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm not here to do that.

1410
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,000
I was thinking we got off

1411
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,000
to a rough start.

1412
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,270
Let me make it up to you.

1413
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,670
Two beers. My tab.
