1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,040
No, I'm not saying

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,040
that you made it up.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,550
I believe

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,550
you heard something.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,550
Do you?

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,880
'Cause it really

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,880
doesn't sound like it.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,110
I'm going to

9
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,110
take the next one.

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,280
No. Dad, no. Come.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,390
We have rats.

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,390
Or we don't.

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,650
We've had two exterminators

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,650
go through everything.

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,780
"We?"

16
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,090
Yes, "we," Dad.

17
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,090
We are cohabitating,

18
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,090
and we do have rats.

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,750
Oh.

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,330
We'll talk about this later.

21
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,460
Yes, we will.

22
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,840
How about that snow, huh?

23
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,840
Springtime in Chicago.

24
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,280
I know what I heard,

25
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,280
okay?

26
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,110
We just have to

27
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,110
get an exterminator

28
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,110
who knows what he's doing.

29
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,610
Hey, Maggie?

30
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,610
Mmm-hmm.

31
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
I want to FaceTime

32
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
with Owen before his nap.

33
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,380
I set an alarm on my phone

34
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,380
for an hour from now,

35
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,720
but if I get swamped,

36
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,720
can you remind me?

37
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,090
Sure.

38
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,750
He was already asleep

39
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,750
when I got home last night

40
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,850
and still conked out

41
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,850
when I left this morning.

42
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,120
I've hardly

43
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,120
seen him lately.

44
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,490
Don't worry.

45
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,490
I'll remind you.

46
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,720
It hurts like hell, I know.

47
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,770
We're gonna get you upstairs

48
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,770
and the surgeon

49
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,770
will fix the holes

50
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,890
the bullet left

51
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,890
in your intestines.

52
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,990
They'll take good care of you.

53
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,100
Dr. Choi, incoming.

54
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,100
Trauma Two's open.

55
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,310
Elliot Gallagher, 17.

56
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,310
Got beat up at school.

57
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,470
Multiple facial trauma,

58
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,470
chest wall contusions,

59
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,680
GCS of 15

60
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,680
with a history of

61
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,680
loss of consciousness.

62
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,340
Elliot, I'm Dr. Choi.

63
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,340
Can you tell us what happened?

64
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,720
Those guys, they caught me.

65
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,460
Make sure his parents

66
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,460
are notified.

67
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,120
Let's transfer on my count.

68
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,120
Ready? One, two, three.

69
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,260
Elliot, can you take

70
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,260
a deep breath for me?

71
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,160
Again.

72
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,270
Does that hurt?

73
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,270
No.

74
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,800
Good breath sounds.

75
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,800
Let's get him off the board

76
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,170
and get a chest X-ray.

77
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,230
Right away.

78
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,380
Lungs are up and

79
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,380
no broken ribs.

80
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,580
Looks like

81
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,580
they're just bruised.

82
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,020
Let's give him 50

83
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,020
of fentanyl for pain.

84
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,520
On it.

85
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,850
Turn your head

86
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,850
side to side.

87
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,250
Chin to chest.

88
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,660
Good. C-spine's clear.

89
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,090
Elliot,

90
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,090
follow the light for me.

91
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,460
Your right eye doesn't look

92
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,460
the same as your left.

93
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,560
I think the orbit's fractured.

94
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,870
Your nose is also broken.

95
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,870
I'm going to

96
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,870
quickly realign it.

97
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,380
Pain meds should

98
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,380
be working by now.

99
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,180
Hope they caught

100
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,180
the boys who did this.

101
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,920
I deserved it.

102
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,880
You gotta castrate me.

103
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,480
What?

104
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,250
I want you to castrate me.

105
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,230
Please.

106
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,680
Are his ankles swollen?

107
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,680
Just look down and check.

108
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,350
Damn it. Yeah, all right.

109
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,350
I'm on my way.

110
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,350
Everything all right?

111
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,650
Not really.

112
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,450
That was my brother.

113
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,450
He's with my dad.

114
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,590
The man's stubborn

115
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,590
beyond all belief.

116
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,100
He's had mitral valve regurge

117
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,100
for, like, the last 10 years.

118
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,460
Man, faulty valves

119
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,460
are tricky.

120
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,060
Yeah, and I don't like

121
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,060
what Jay's describing.

122
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,900
I gotta get

123
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,900
to the L station.

124
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,700
Why doesn't your brother

125
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,700
bring him in?

126
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,630
Dad hates doctors.

127
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,630
Did I mention he's stubborn?

128
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,570
Well, don't you

129
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,570
have a car?

130
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,570
I sold it.

131
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,440
Hey, look, man,

132
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,440
waiting for the L train's

133
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,440
just gonna slow you down.

134
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,510
Why don't you take mine?

135
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,750
Actually,

136
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,750
I'd like to take you.

137
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,450
I'll get my coat.

138
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,450
All right.

139
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,990
I think about sex

140
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,990
all the time.

141
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
You're 17.

142
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
It's really not

143
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
that unusual.

144
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,960
Sex is for procreation.

145
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,960
That's all.

146
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,530
Huh. So, how did you

147
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,530
come to that understanding?

148
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,330
My parents.

149
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,910
The reason those

150
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,910
guys beat me up,

151
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,980
I, uh, was climbing

152
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,980
on a dumpster

153
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,980
by the girls' gym,

154
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,720
and was looking in

155
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,720
a window to the shower.

156
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,320
That sounds to me like

157
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,320
grounds for disciplinary

158
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,320
action, maybe,

159
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,950
but, I mean, not a beating.

160
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,620
I mean,

161
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,620
certainly not castration.

162
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,160
Blonde girls. It's, uh...

163
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,370
It's blonde girls.

164
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,370
I follow them.

165
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,300
There's this one girl,

166
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,300
Lacey.

167
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,680
She's blonde.

168
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,510
I sit behind her in trig.

169
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,950
One day, I...

170
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,090
I cut this off.

171
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,960
She didn't notice.

172
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,470
I'm afraid of

173
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,470
what I'm going to do.

174
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,780
I was looking up

175
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,780
castration online.

176
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,210
They can do it with drugs.

177
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,210
That's what I want.

178
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,210
Chemical castration.

179
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,480
I don't want to hurt her!

180
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,320
Or anyone.

181
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,930
Elliot is very troubled.

182
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,270
Poor kid is just consumed

183
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,270
with sexual thoughts.

184
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,430
Aren't most kids

185
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,430
his age?

186
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,910
Yeah, but he's been raised

187
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,910
to believe that sex is wrong

188
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,470
unless it's for procreation.

189
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,810
And repressing

190
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,810
his natural urges

191
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,710
is triggering

192
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,710
aggressive impulses,

193
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,840
which he's

194
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,840
struggling to control.

195
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,110
Aggressive?

196
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,020
He fetishizes blondes.

197
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,020
Stalks them.

198
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,750
We're talking about

199
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,750
a sexual predator?

200
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,790
Not a psychopath.

201
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,790
I mean, he has a conscience.

202
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,950
I mean, I think

203
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,950
he could definitely

204
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,950
benefit from therapy,

205
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,390
but I'm not

206
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,390
ruling out those meds.

207
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,390
Chemical castration,

208
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,390
really?

209
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,030
It's temporary, Ethan.

210
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,630
Raping somebody isn't.

211
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,230
We would need

212
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,230
the parents' consent.

213
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,240
Dr. Manning, a three-year-old

214
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,240
with a bilateral

215
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,240
lower extremity paresis

216
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,440
and gingival lesions

217
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,440
in Treatment Four.

218
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,840
Hey, you want to give

219
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,840
me a hand with this?

220
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,280
Sure.

221
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,780
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning,

222
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,780
and this is Mr. Clarke,

223
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,780
a medical student.

224
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,260
Hi.

225
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,260
He's gonna be assisting me.

226
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,830
I'm Amelia.

227
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,830
This is my son, Troy.

228
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,450
Hi, Troy. I hear

229
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,450
you're not feeling well.

230
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,260
Troy is speech-delayed.

231
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,260
He only says a few words.

232
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,760
Okay.

233
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm gonna check you out.

234
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,200
Okay, buddy?

235
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,660
When did this

236
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,660
start happening?

237
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,140
A couple weeks ago,

238
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,140
he woke up limping.

239
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,370
When it kept getting worse,

240
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,370
I took him in for X-rays,

241
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,670
but they didn't

242
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,670
show anything.

243
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,410
The doctor wanted

244
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,410
him to rest for a week,

245
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,350
but it isn't

246
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,350
getting any better.

247
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,450
They've been okay at work,

248
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,450
but I gotta get Troy well.

249
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,610
I understand.

250
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,830
This morning,

251
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,830
his gums started bleeding.

252
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,920
Hey, let me check

253
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,920
your chompers, bud.

254
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,660
Ulcerations.

255
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,860
Hmm.

256
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,770
He looks quite thin.

257
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,770
Um...

258
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,600
Has his appetite

259
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,600
been affected?

260
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,830
He's always been

261
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,830
a picky eater.

262
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,640
I've got one like that, too.

263
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,500
All right, we'll get

264
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,500
a copy of his X-rays.

265
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,780
The leg pain and weakness

266
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,780
could be coming

267
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,780
from a lot of things,

268
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,440
so we'll get a CAT scan

269
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,440
of his spine and

270
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,440
some blood work,

271
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,320
and, hopefully,

272
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,320
we'll get some answers.

273
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,410
All right.

274
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,710
Chocky.

275
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,750
Not now, sweetie, okay?

276
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,650
Chocky, now.

277
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,160
He wants some

278
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,160
chocolate milk.

279
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,560
I think we have some of

280
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,560
that in the cafeteria.

281
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,860
I'll have some sent in.

282
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,040
We'll check back

283
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,040
in a little while.

284
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,070
All right,

285
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,070
here are the rest of them.

286
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,140
Why all the dolls?

287
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,510
As part of

288
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,510
my psych residency,

289
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,140
I have to teach

290
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,140
high school kids

291
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,880
the responsibilities

292
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,880
of having a baby,

293
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,720
so hopefully, they'll

294
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,720
exercise a little caution.

295
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,820
The sound circuit

296
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,820
is adapted to

297
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,820
convert audio data

298
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:22,760
into analog audio

299
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:22,760
output at the speaker.

300
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,740
Oh, man, too bad you can't

301
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,740
do that with a real baby.

302
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,370
Okay, can I see it?

303
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,370
Mm-hmm.

304
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,310
Peripheral port is coupled

305
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,310
to the micro-controller

306
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,180
and connects to

307
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,180
the host computer?

308
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,170
Uh-huh. So I can monitor

309
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,170
how the kids are doing.

310
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,310
It's ridiculous.

311
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,310
What? Why?

312
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,180
These are cool.

313
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,450
No, I have no

314
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,450
maternal instincts.

315
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,750
I have no connection

316
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,750
to babies.

317
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,120
I have no intention

318
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,120
of having one.

319
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,560
I'm right there with you.

320
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,120
Good luck.

321
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,530
Robin?

322
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,180
Oh, hey.

323
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,370
What's looking good?

324
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,180
I can't decide.

325
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,930
This is where you grew up,

326
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,930
huh?

327
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,090
Yep. Played a lot of

328
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,090
ball on this street.

329
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,160
Everybody knew everybody.

330
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,240
All the grandmas

331
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,240
would sit on

332
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,240
the front porches.

333
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,400
They were like the original

334
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,400
neighborhood watch.

335
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,340
Up there,

336
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,340
Mrs. Riley hated noise.

337
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,850
She used to throw

338
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,850
a pot of boiling

339
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,850
water out at us.

340
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,310
Caught Jay on

341
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,310
the foot one time.

342
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,850
A little different

343
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,850
than the Gold Coast, huh?

344
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,180
It's nice.

345
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,760
Hey, Pop.

346
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,360
What are you doing here?

347
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,360
I called him.

348
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,300
Wasted trip.

349
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,300
I don't need you.

350
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,360
Are you kidding me?

351
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,130
You missed two days of work,

352
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,130
and you never miss work.

353
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,030
Pop, this is Connor Rhodes.

354
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,030
He's another doc at Med.

355
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,610
Told you

356
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,610
I don't need this.

357
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,210
Come on.

358
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,210
You can barely talk.

359
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,020
I'm gonna take

360
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,020
medical advice

361
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,210
from someone

362
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,210
who wet the bed

363
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,210
till he was nine?

364
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,450
Never changes.

365
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,450
I gotta get back

366
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,450
to the district.

367
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,680
Thanks, Jay.

368
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,350
Don't let the door

369
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,350
hit you on the way out.

370
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,530
Mr. Halstead,

371
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,530
I'm seeing some things

372
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,660
that tell me that your heart

373
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,660
isn't working very well.

374
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,570
Your fingertips are purple,

375
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,570
you're having

376
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,570
a hard time breathing,

377
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,600
and your energy

378
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,600
seems depleted.

379
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,110
Had this heart thing forever.

380
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,110
It's never been a problem.

381
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,210
Do you mind if

382
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,210
I have a listen?

383
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,910
If it'll get you two

384
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,910
off my ass.

385
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,130
Apical holosystolic murmur

386
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,130
and the lungs are wet.

387
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,420
In English?

388
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,260
It means that

389
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,260
your heart has been

390
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,700
compensating for

391
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,700
the faulty valve

392
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,700
for a very long time,

393
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,700
and now it can't keep up,

394
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,100
so fluid is backing up

395
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,100
into your lungs.

396
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,110
It literally means

397
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,110
you're drowning

398
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,110
in your own blood.

399
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,610
We need to get you

400
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,610
to the hospital.

401
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,340
I'll call an ambulance.

402
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,340
Like hell you will.

403
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,110
I'll be damned if

404
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,110
I'll have the neighbors

405
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,050
see me hauled out of here

406
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,050
in an ambulance.

407
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,510
Mr. Halstead...

408
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,510
No.

409
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,410
If we're going, I'm driving.

410
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,790
No, no, we'll drive.

411
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,750
I got it!

412
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,560
I'll call the ambulance.

413
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,560
No!

414
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,500
Just move your asses.

415
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,610
April, I got a patient walking

416
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,610
into the ambulance entrance.

417
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,700
Can you get

418
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,700
a wheelchair ready?

419
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,080
Walking in?

420
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,080
Uh-huh.

421
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,680
It's Dr. Halstead's dad.

422
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,110
Hey, you're going

423
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,110
to Treatment Six.

424
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,170
Yep.

425
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,580
Problems getting

426
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,580
an ambulance?

427
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,050
No, problem

428
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,050
with the patient.

429
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,210
I don't need that.

430
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,880
I got it, I got it.

431
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,880
Okay.

432
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,320
Easy on the bed.

433
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,030
Damn it, I got it.

434
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,000
All right,

435
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,000
let's get him hooked up.

436
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,300
Will, you wanna get

437
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,300
him on oxygen?

438
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,930
Yep. Pop...

439
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,930
Yeah?

440
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,600
On a scale of one to 10,

441
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,600
how bad is the pain?

442
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,840
I've had gas that hurt worse.

443
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,210
All right, T-wave inversions,

444
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,210
ST depressions.

445
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,610
It looks like he's

446
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,610
having an NSTEMI.

447
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,950
Let's give him 81

448
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,950
milligrams of aspirin

449
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,950
and a dose of nasal nitro.

450
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,640
Let's get cardiac labs,

451
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,640
CBC, CMP, coags,

452
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,640
and a chest X-ray.

453
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,420
He's gonna need a formal echo,

454
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,420
but in the meantime,

455
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,320
let's get a quick look

456
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,320
at the heart

457
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,320
with the ultrasound.

458
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,180
Clear.

459
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,160
Bilateral pleural

460
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,160
effusion and congestion.

461
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,960
Yeah. You see here?

462
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,270
Mitral valve is wide open

463
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,270
and the LV is dilated.

464
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Mr. Halstead,

465
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
it's just like we thought.

466
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,670
Your heart is

467
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,670
working way too hard

468
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,070
to compensate

469
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,070
for your bad valve.

470
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,340
First time I've ever heard

471
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,340
of hard work

472
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,340
being a bad thing.

473
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,910
You got a fix?

474
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,910
We will.

475
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,380
We're gonna get

476
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,380
you an angiogram,

477
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,970
and it'll give us

478
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,970
a full picture of your heart,

479
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,490
and then we're

480
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,490
gonna figure out a plan.

481
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,820
Let's get him up

482
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,820
to the cath lab.

483
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,420
Don't worry, Pop.

484
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,420
We can beat this.

485
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,090
Who the hell's worried?

486
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,760
All right, let's go.

487
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,700
Will?

488
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,070
My dad, his heart.

489
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,070
He needs a cath.

490
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,770
I'm so sorry.

491
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,610
Let me know how it goes.

492
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,940
Natalie?

493
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,580
Head lac in Treatment Two.

494
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,580
I'll shoot you the chart.

495
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,640
And don't forget

496
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,640
to FaceTime Owen

497
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,640
as soon as you're out, okay?

498
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,850
Oh, thank you.

499
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,180
The three-year-old.

500
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,050
Test results are back.

501
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,560
CT was clean, blood work

502
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,560
indicates mild anemia.

503
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,120
Nothing to explain

504
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,120
the limping or the lesions.

505
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,430
Maybe we're dealing

506
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,430
with lead poisoning

507
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,430
or some sort of tox?

508
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,730
Yeah, um, let's do

509
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,730
a tox workup and

510
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,730
look for heavy metals,

511
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,570
and get a babygram

512
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,570
while you're at it.

513
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,900
Okay. It could

514
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,900
also be abuse.

515
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,340
Let's not go there yet.

516
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,140
Can I help you?

517
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,140
It's our son, Elliot.

518
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,470
They said he was in a fight.

519
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,470
We got here as quick

520
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,470
as we could.

521
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,810
We got a call

522
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,810
from his school.

523
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,740
Okay, Dr. Choi.

524
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,740
He'll take you to him.

525
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,250
Dr. Choi, Stan Gallagher.

526
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,250
This is my wife, Debbie.

527
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,310
What happened?

528
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,580
Elliot got into

529
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,580
an altercation at school

530
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,420
and suffered

531
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,420
an orbital blowout fracture.

532
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,250
The eye surgeons want

533
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,250
to get him to surgery.

534
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,920
He's right here.

535
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,920
Oh, my God.

536
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,020
Oh, my poor baby.

537
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,130
Elliot,

538
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,130
who did this to you?

539
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,940
He's still a little

540
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,940
groggy from the pain meds.

541
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,100
Why don't we let him

542
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,100
rest while we talk?

543
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,440
The bracelets

544
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,440
you're wearing have a sensor

545
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,320
which registers when you feed,

546
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,320
bathe, or diaper the baby.

547
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,250
If you shake the baby

548
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,250
to stop its crying,

549
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,690
it will shut down

550
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,690
and register as being abused.

551
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,250
Are you a real doctor?

552
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,650
Sometimes I wonder.

553
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,160
Uh...

554
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,930
Anyways, recent

555
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,930
studies have shown

556
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,930
that talking, reading,

557
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,460
and singing to babies

558
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,460
is crucial for

559
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,460
early brain development,

560
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,840
80% of which occurs

561
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,840
during the first

562
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,840
three years of life.

563
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,580
These dolls record

564
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,580
the amount of time

565
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,110
you spend doing

566
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,110
these activities,

567
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,120
so, obviously,

568
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,120
the more, the better.

569
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,550
Need anything, Dr. Reese?

570
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,920
Uh, no, I'm fine,

571
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,920
Mr. Sexton.

572
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,020
Any questions?

573
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,690
I don't get it.

574
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,690
We're supposed to

575
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,690
be talking to a doll?

576
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,330
Or reading or singing.

577
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,420
Mm-hmm.

578
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,960
Any other questions?

579
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
What operating system

580
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
are the dolls on?

581
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,400
I don't know, and really,

582
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,400
why is that relevant?

583
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,300
I have PE today.

584
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,300
What should I do

585
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,300
with the doll then?

586
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,850
That is a problem you

587
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,850
will have to deal with.

588
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,880
The point of this is

589
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,880
to understand the impact

590
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,010
having a baby would

591
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,010
have on your life.

592
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,020
I will see you all

593
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,020
at the end of the day

594
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,020
to check on your dolls.

595
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,180
So, a kid got beat up.

596
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,700
What does he need

597
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,700
a psychiatrist for?

598
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,460
Well, Elliot was

599
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,460
caught peeping on girls

600
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,460
in the shower at school.

601
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,930
Oh, my God.

602
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,800
Wait till I get him home.

603
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,070
But much more troubling

604
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,070
are some violent impulses

605
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,700
that, so far,

606
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,700
he hasn't acted upon.

607
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,780
And there is

608
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,780
something we can do.

609
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,050
Elliot wants us to

610
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,050
give him a medication

611
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,080
that would turn

612
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,080
off his testosterone.

613
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,790
This would significantly

614
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,790
decrease his sex drive

615
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,150
and make it

616
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,150
much easier for him

617
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,150
to control these impulses.

618
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,920
But we do need your

619
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,920
permission to do it.

620
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,320
"Turn off his testosterone?"

621
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,320
What exactly are you

622
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,320
talking about?

623
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,630
The medical term is

624
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,630
"chemical castration."

625
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,860
What?

626
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,090
It's completely reversible.

627
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,940
The idea would be

628
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,940
to combine it with

629
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,940
traditional therapy

630
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,340
with the hope of ultimately

631
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,340
weaning him off

632
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,340
the medication.

633
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,840
No. No way.

634
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,670
Elliot could very well

635
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,670
be on the verge of acting out

636
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,940
on some very

637
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,940
disturbing impulses,

638
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,940
including rape.

639
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,740
He would never do

640
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,740
anything like that.

641
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,080
You people are sick.

642
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,680
Again, this was

643
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,680
your son's idea.

644
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,760
Elliot is torn up

645
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,760
about this.

646
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,020
He's scared

647
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,020
he may not be

648
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,020
able to stop himself.

649
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,820
This is ridiculous.

650
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,930
Fix his eye,

651
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,930
and we're taking him home.

652
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,300
Where's your dad?

653
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,600
The restroom.

654
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,580
He shouldn't be

655
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,580
up after his cath.

656
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,580
He couldn't use a bedpan?

657
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,120
Practically

658
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,120
threw it at my head.

659
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,750
I'm here if you need me.

660
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,090
I won't.

661
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,960
So, Mr. Halstead,

662
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,960
the results of

663
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,960
your cardiac cath

664
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,840
show that your heart

665
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,840
has been under

666
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,840
stress for so long

667
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,780
from the mitral

668
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,780
valve regurgitation

669
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,740
that it's basically giving up.

670
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,350
This is why I told you

671
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,350
to get it checked regularly.

672
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,010
We knew about the regurge,

673
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,010
we could've gotten

674
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,010
ahead of this.

675
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,020
Yeah, so what?

676
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,020
I'll fix it now.

677
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,010
Well, there's another

678
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,010
issue, unfortunately.

679
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,860
Your left anterior

680
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,860
descending artery

681
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,860
is 80% blocked.

682
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,960
Now that is

683
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,960
the largest artery.

684
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,070
It supplies half

685
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,070
the heart with blood.

686
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,600
The question is, am I done?

687
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,460
I can do a surgical

688
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,460
replacement of the valve,

689
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,770
and while I'm in there,

690
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,770
do a bypass for

691
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,770
the blocked artery.

692
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,140
Are you talking

693
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,140
open heart surgery?

694
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,010
It would involve

695
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,010
opening your chest, yes.

696
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,750
Now, if you wanted

697
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,750
to go non-surgical,

698
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,220
a cardiologist

699
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,220
could place a clip

700
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,220
on the mitral valve

701
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,780
to try and

702
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,780
control the regurge,

703
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,560
and do angioplasty

704
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,560
to open up the blocked artery.

705
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,920
Do you have

706
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,920
a good cardiologist?

707
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,090
We do.

708
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,700
But I strongly recommend

709
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,700
that you let me operate.

710
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,660
The long-term results

711
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,660
of surgery are much better.

712
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,730
Mmm-hmm. Exactly.

713
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,810
I'm going non-surgical.

714
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,200
Pop...

715
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,440
Hey, if you don't like it,

716
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,480
you don't have to be here.

717
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,710
Fine.

718
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,220
I'll set it up.

719
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,550
Yeah.

720
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,920
Hey.

721
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,200
Now, you know I should be

722
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,200
cracking his chest, right?

723
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,230
So, why did you give in?

724
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,000
Hey, you're the one who gave

725
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,000
him the non-surgical option.

726
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,440
No, I laid out

727
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,440
his choices, Will.

728
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,830
I pushed for the surgery.

729
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,900
Not hard enough.

730
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,370
You're his son.

731
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,540
You should be the one

732
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,540
trying to convince him.

733
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,980
He won't listen to me!

734
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,950
My dad considers me

735
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,950
something of a disappointment.

736
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,210
Oh, yeah, he didn't even

737
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,210
want me to go to college.

738
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,250
Says a real man

739
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,250
goes right to work.

740
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,750
He doesn't give a damn

741
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,750
what I have to say.

742
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,130
So why don't you get Jay

743
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,130
to try to talk to him?

744
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,390
It won't help.

745
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,090
No, Jay and him

746
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,090
have their own history.

747
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,700
Everything's

748
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,700
coming back normal.

749
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,700
Maybe we're dealing

750
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,700
with some sort of

751
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,700
weird vasculitis.

752
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,540
Henoch-Schonlein purpura

753
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,540
or Kawasaki disease?

754
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,950
Or possibly

755
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,950
infectious disease,

756
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,880
or rickettsia like

757
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,880
Rocky Mountain Fever.

758
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,080
Chocky, now!

759
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,750
It's okay, baby.

760
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,750
We'll get you some chocky.

761
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,090
Uh, the chocolate milk

762
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,090
never came?

763
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,090
No, the cafeteria was out,

764
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,090
and he won't drink the plain.

765
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,560
Well, you can't fault a kid

766
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,560
for knowing what he likes.

767
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,100
Is there

768
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,100
something else that he likes?

769
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,160
Graham crackers.

770
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,190
When I get home at night,

771
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,190
all he wants

772
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,730
is chocolate milk

773
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,730
and Graham crackers.

774
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,930
It's hard not to

775
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,930
give in when it's late

776
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,930
and I'm tired.

777
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,900
Let me go see

778
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,900
what I can find.

779
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,570
Uh,

780
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,570
you said he's picky at night.

781
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,570
Is he better during the day?

782
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,310
I'm pretty sure he

783
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,310
eats other things.

784
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,770
Pretty sure?

785
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,480
He has a couple sitters.

786
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,480
The neighbor's kid,

787
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,480
the woman upstairs.

788
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,820
It's possible

789
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,820
they're not as firm

790
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,820
as they ought to be.

791
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,420
I can't afford day care.

792
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,930
I understand. Um...

793
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,960
I'm going to send a nurse

794
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,960
in to draw blood

795
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,960
for one more test.

796
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,940
Mr. and Mrs. Gallagher,

797
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,940
I need to get Elliot

798
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,940
up to pre-op holding.

799
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,080
The eye surgeon will be

800
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,080
calling for him any minute.

801
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,950
We'll be in the

802
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,950
waiting room.

803
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,130
I'm guessing your

804
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,130
parents told you

805
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,330
they wouldn't approve

806
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,330
the chemical castration.

807
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,330
No.

808
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,830
But my mom read me

809
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,830
Thessalonians 4:3.

810
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,940
"God's will is

811
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,940
for you to be holy,

812
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,170
"so stay away from sexual sin

813
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,170
and immorality."

814
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,580
Both Dr. Charles and I tried,

815
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,580
but since you're

816
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,580
still a minor...

817
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,820
Yeah, I figured.

818
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,820
All right, whatever.

819
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,190
Look, I'll talk

820
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,190
to Dr. Charles

821
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,290
and see if we can come up

822
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,290
with some other options.

823
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,060
All right,

824
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,060
numbers look good.

825
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,130
Breathing great.

826
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
Feel like I could

827
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
pitch nine innings.

828
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,280
It's what every team wants.

829
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,280
A 60-something starter

830
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,280
with a bum ticker.

831
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,780
At least nobody had

832
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,780
to cut my chest

833
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,780
open to fix it.

834
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,240
Admit it, kid, I was right.

835
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,280
You got that fancy degree,

836
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,280
but I'm still the one

837
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,280
calling the shots.

838
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,410
I didn't say this course

839
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,410
of treatment wouldn't work.

840
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,550
I was more concerned

841
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,550
with the long term.

842
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,150
That right?

843
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,690
'Cause to me, it looks like

844
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,690
you're back-pedaling so much,

845
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,020
you're gonna start sweating.

846
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,760
Oh, believe me,

847
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,760
that is the last

848
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,760
you'll hear about it.

849
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,090
Yeah.

850
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,960
Well, since you made me

851
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,960
miss the end of the game,

852
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,810
let's see if I can

853
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,810
find some highlights.

854
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,040
I guess I should

855
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,040
start with an apology...

856
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,600
And for

857
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,600
the foreseeable future...

858
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,510
The cleanest, whitest white...

859
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,740
Yeah.

860
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,150
Hey, Dr. Charles,

861
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,150
you got a second?

862
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,750
Uh...

863
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,850
Yeah, kind of.

864
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,850
Okay.

865
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,160
I'm worried about Robin.

866
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,870
She's not acting like herself.

867
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,460
Hmm.

868
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,430
She is convinced

869
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,430
that there's rats in my condo,

870
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,530
but I haven't seen

871
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,530
them or heard them,

872
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,580
and no exterminator

873
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,580
can find them.

874
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,380
Rats can be pretty clever.

875
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,420
Not that clever.

876
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,750
And, aside from that,

877
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,750
lately, there are times

878
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,280
when I find Robin just

879
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,280
staring off into space.

880
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,760
Well, I mean,

881
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,760
that's not that odd.

882
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,930
I mean,

883
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,930
I do that all the time.

884
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,930
It must be a family trait.

885
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,690
I think it's more

886
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,690
than that.

887
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,400
How so?

888
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,970
Like I said, she's

889
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,970
not acting like herself.

890
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,840
I just feel like there's

891
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,840
something off with her.

892
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,780
Well, I mean,

893
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,780
there is that new

894
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,780
living situation.

895
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,680
Cohabitation can

896
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,680
be awful stressful.

897
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,450
Dr. Charles,

898
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,450
I hope you realize

899
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,450
I wouldn't have come here

900
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,990
if I didn't think

901
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,990
this was important.

902
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,190
And you know what?

903
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,190
I appreciate that,

904
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,920
but I was supposed to be

905
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,920
on a conference call,

906
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,920
like, two minutes ago,

907
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,900
so can we

908
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,900
pick this up later?

909
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,460
Yeah, you bet.

910
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,040
Well, thank you

911
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,040
for your time.

912
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,040
Thank you.

913
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,150
Did you find anything?

914
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,150
We did.

915
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,470
Based on Troy's limited diet,

916
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,470
we checked his

917
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,470
vitamin C levels.

918
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,590
The results show

919
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,590
a significant deficiency.

920
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,890
Well below normal.

921
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,670
Troy has scurvy. It's what's

922
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,670
causing his symptoms.

923
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,670
I don't understand. Scurvy?

924
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,670
Isn't that something

925
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,670
sailors used to get?

926
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,940
It was, historically,

927
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,470
but anybody with

928
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,470
prolonged dietary

929
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,470
deficiencies is susceptible.

930
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,950
Well, how is that possible?

931
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,320
We were surprised, too.

932
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,320
It's not something we see.

933
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,380
It's been all but eradicated

934
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,380
in developed countries,

935
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,320
because it's

936
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,320
easily preventable

937
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,320
with a balanced diet.

938
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,030
You mean he's sick

939
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,030
because of what he eats?

940
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,500
More like what

941
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,500
he doesn't eat.

942
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,660
It's a parent's job,

943
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,660
Ms. Bohlen,

944
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,030
to make sure their children

945
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,030
get nutritious foods.

946
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,200
Excuse me?

947
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,430
This never

948
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,430
should have happened.

949
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,370
You should have been

950
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,370
monitoring Troy's diet.

951
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,280
That's easy for you to say.

952
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,280
You know nothing

953
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,280
about my life.

954
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,010
I work two jobs

955
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,010
to support my son.

956
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,580
I am gone from 6:00 am

957
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,580
to eight at night.

958
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
You have no right to judge.

959
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,610
I would do anything

960
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,610
to protect him.

961
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,750
Excuse me.

962
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,750
Please explain

963
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,750
the course of treatment.

964
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,400
Mr. Halstead,

965
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,400
I'm Sharon Goodwin,

966
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,270
Executive Director

967
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,270
of Patient and

968
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,270
Medical Services.

969
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,670
I thought

970
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,670
I should say hello.

971
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,270
Well, how you doing?

972
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,970
Well, better question

973
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,970
is how are you doing?

974
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,480
Other than a lack of

975
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,480
sports channels in this place,

976
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,990
I'm feeling pretty all right.

977
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,150
You know,

978
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,150
we think quite highly

979
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,150
of your son around here.

980
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,530
Kid's got you snowed, huh?

981
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,700
You look a little pale.

982
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,700
Are you sure

983
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,700
you're feeling okay?

984
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,800
I'm fine.

985
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,560
Page Dr. Rhodes.

986
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,700
I'm concerned

987
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,700
about your breathing.

988
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,040
I'm going to

989
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,040
increase your oxygen.

990
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,680
What happened?

991
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,040
He's throwing runs of PVCs.

992
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,310
Give me the ultrasound.

993
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,020
How are you feeling,

994
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,020
Mr. Halstead?

995
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,350
Like I just told her,

996
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,350
I'm feeling fine.

997
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,050
I don't think

998
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,050
you're doing as well

999
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,050
as you say you are.

1000
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,820
Why don't we have

1001
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,820
a look, huh?

1002
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,600
Half the mitral

1003
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,600
valve clip came off.

1004
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,600
It's flopping around.

1005
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,200
We need to get you to surgery.

1006
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,970
Can you fix it?

1007
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,970
Like before?

1008
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,170
No, we can't.

1009
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,170
We need to operate,

1010
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,170
and quickly.

1011
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,400
If the other half comes loose,

1012
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,400
the clip could end up

1013
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,400
in your brain

1014
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,270
or somewhere else

1015
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,270
you definitely don't want it.

1016
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,650
Wait.

1017
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,180
This is not up for discussion,

1018
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,180
Mr. Halstead.

1019
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,580
No, just...

1020
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,580
Just don't tell Will.

1021
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,220
I don't want to have

1022
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,220
to hear him crowing.

1023
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,350
We won't, but I'm afraid

1024
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,350
he's going to find out anyway.

1025
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,180
Yeah, okay.

1026
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,430
Sorry, hold on.

1027
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,980
Hey, what's up?

1028
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,710
I can't find my wallet.

1029
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,770
Oh.

1030
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,440
Let me get it.

1031
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,910
Uh...

1032
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,720
My coffee, her yogurt.

1033
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,610
Come on, let's sit down.

1034
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,720
I think someone stole it.

1035
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,630
Oh, my God, now I'm going to

1036
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,630
have to cancel my credit cards

1037
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,530
and get a new

1038
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,530
driver's license.

1039
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,930
That it?

1040
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,930
Oh, thank God.

1041
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,500
The old side pocket.

1042
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,170
Is everything okay, honey?

1043
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,280
Damn it,

1044
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,280
Dad, I know that look.

1045
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,280
You're trying to shrink me.

1046
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,650
We're just talking.

1047
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,650
We're having some coffee...

1048
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,780
No, we're not just talking.

1049
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,780
You never just talk to me.

1050
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,050
It is always

1051
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,050
a psych evaluation.

1052
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,380
Robin, come on.

1053
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,150
Just because you

1054
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,150
are a head case, Dad,

1055
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,150
does not mean that I am.

1056
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,890
Stop looking for things

1057
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,890
that aren't there.

1058
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,500
Thank you for

1059
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,500
your participation.

1060
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,970
Thank you for

1061
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,970
your participation.

1062
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,590
Thank you for

1063
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,590
your participation.

1064
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,440
Thank you. Uh, Marla,

1065
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,440
would you hang back a sec?

1066
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,810
Uh, sure.

1067
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,940
Your score,

1068
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,940
very impressive.

1069
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,940
Thanks.

1070
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,120
You fed it regularly

1071
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,120
at two-hour intervals

1072
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,140
and verbally interacted

1073
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,140
a total of six hours.

1074
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,580
You said more is better.

1075
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,850
Uh...

1076
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,720
How did you have time

1077
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,720
to do anything else?

1078
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,720
Multi-tasking.

1079
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,290
You hacked your doll.

1080
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,030
What? No.

1081
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,430
Okay, just because I am 26,

1082
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,430
don't think I am some

1083
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,430
old fool.

1084
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,270
This score is impossible.

1085
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,170
Marla.

1086
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,040
Yeah, I hacked it.

1087
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,880
Don't worry, Mr. Halstead.

1088
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,420
We're going to get

1089
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,420
that mitral valve fixed.

1090
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,190
Damn.

1091
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,990
The kid was right.

1092
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,330
Not so much a kid anymore,

1093
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,330
is he?

1094
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,260
No.

1095
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,530
Did you know

1096
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,530
he put himself

1097
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,530
through college?

1098
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,670
I told him...

1099
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,480
Told him it was

1100
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,480
a waste of time,

1101
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,350
and damned if I was

1102
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,350
going to pay for it.

1103
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,890
Well, I'm sure

1104
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,890
you're very proud of him.

1105
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,960
That doesn't even

1106
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,960
begin to say it.

1107
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,270
He made something

1108
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,270
of his life.

1109
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,970
He's a better man

1110
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,970
than I am.

1111
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,640
I don't think he

1112
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,640
feels that way, sir.

1113
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,220
And I'm sure that he wouldn't

1114
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,220
want you to either.

1115
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,770
We need to get started,

1116
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,770
Mr. Halstead. Are you ready?

1117
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,900
Yeah.

1118
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,670
I spoke to the surgeon.

1119
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,670
Everything went great.

1120
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,110
Once the dressing is off,

1121
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,110
your vision should

1122
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,110
be back to normal.

1123
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,340
I'll be back in

1124
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,340
a bit to check on you.

1125
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,450
Hey.

1126
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,650
Hey.

1127
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,720
I went off

1128
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,720
on that boy's mom.

1129
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,290
Oh?

1130
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,400
But it was really about me.

1131
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,660
I wasn't mad at her.

1132
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,660
I was mad at myself.

1133
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,340
Am I a horrible mother?

1134
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,330
Yes, you are.

1135
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,680
Nat, you're just

1136
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,680
having working mom's guilt.

1137
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,780
Relax, man,

1138
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,780
Dad's too stubborn to die.

1139
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,690
Any word?

1140
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,290
Not yet.

1141
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,430
I heard you were there

1142
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,430
when he went back

1143
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,430
into failure.

1144
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,090
Thanks for jumping in.

1145
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,270
Well, it's good to

1146
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,270
flex the nursing muscles

1147
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,270
every now and then.

1148
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,930
He did great.

1149
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,010
Brand new mitral valve

1150
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,010
is fully functioning.

1151
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,910
Shouldn't give him

1152
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,910
anymore problems.

1153
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,380
Told you.

1154
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,980
Thanks, man.

1155
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,980
You got it.

1156
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,180
Nice work, Dr. Rhodes.

1157
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,180
Thank you.

1158
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,780
I'm gonna head

1159
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,780
back to the house,

1160
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,150
'cause he's probably

1161
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,150
gonna need some stuff.

1162
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,510
All right?

1163
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,610
See you, Jay.

1164
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,610
Yeah.

1165
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,990
Thanks, Connor.

1166
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,190
If my dad hadn't

1167
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,190
pulled through...

1168
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,220
Yeah.

1169
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,930
I gotta say, man,

1170
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,930
what you guys have,

1171
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,930
it's pretty great.

1172
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,430
Are you serious?

1173
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,270
All we do is fight.

1174
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,180
Yeah, well, me and my dad,

1175
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,180
we barely even talk.

1176
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,110
That doesn't

1177
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,110
sound too bad to me.

1178
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,880
Take my word for it, Will.

1179
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,750
You got a

1180
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,750
good thing going.

1181
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,190
Elliot?

1182
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,700
Elliot?

1183
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,700
Elliot, what are you doing?

1184
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,600
She looked cold.

1185
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,470
Step away from her.

1186
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,510
Now.

1187
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,520
Elliot!

1188
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,420
Elliot! Elliot,

1189
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,420
open the door.

1190
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,420
Page security!

1191
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,970
Elliot!

1192
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,360
Elliot!

1193
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,100
I need a gurney

1194
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,100
with soft restraints

1195
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,100
and some ABD pads.

1196
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:46,210
Get me some ice and 50 mics

1197
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:46,210
fentanyl IV now,

1198
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:46,210
and page Urology.

1199
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,940
Just relax.

1200
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,940
Elliot, Elliot.

1201
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,940
Just relax, buddy.

1202
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,450
The procedure to

1203
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,450
repair the testicles

1204
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,450
is complicated,

1205
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,260
but the urologist

1206
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,260
is optimistic.

1207
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,270
How did this happen?

1208
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,170
What did we do?

1209
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,490
You know, in my experience,

1210
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,700
there's actually

1211
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,700
very little to be gained

1212
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,700
from looking backwards.

1213
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,770
The important

1214
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,770
thing to focus on is,

1215
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,770
what do you do now?

1216
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,590
Hey.

1217
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,890
I just saw Natalie.

1218
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,890
She told me your dad's

1219
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,890
in the hospital.

1220
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,290
Yeah,

1221
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,290
mitral valve and blockage.

1222
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,290
He should be awake now.

1223
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,130
I'm headed up.

1224
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,710
Will, I'm glad

1225
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,710
he's doing well,

1226
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,240
but how come I had to hear it

1227
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,240
from Natalie and not you?

1228
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,110
Yeah, sorry.

1229
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,110
It's been a little crazy.

1230
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,720
You had time to tell her.

1231
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,020
Listen, why don't you

1232
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,020
come with me?

1233
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,220
If Dad's up for it,

1234
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,220
I'll introduce you.

1235
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,690
No, just let me

1236
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,690
know how he's doing.

1237
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,530
I will.

1238
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,110
Yeah.

1239
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,110
Am I interrupting?

1240
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,410
Actually,

1241
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,410
I'm glad you're here.

1242
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,410
I have something to show you.

1243
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,610
Proof that we have got rats.

1244
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,110
I picked up some

1245
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,110
of their droppings.

1246
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,970
I don't understand.

1247
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,970
They were here.

1248
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,840
They were here.

1249
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,540
Weren't they?

1250
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,550
Honey, I'm saying this

1251
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,550
as a dad, not a shrink.

1252
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,820
I would just feel

1253
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,820
a whole lot better

1254
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,820
if we could get somebody

1255
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,450
to, um, you know,

1256
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,450
take a look at you.

1257
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,430
What do you say?

1258
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,410
Okay.

1259
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,970
Okay.

1260
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,180
So, did you flunk her?

1261
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,690
No, I couldn't.

1262
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,980
She was overwhelmed.

1263
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,550
She's taking all

1264
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,550
these AP courses

1265
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,520
and doing all that

1266
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,520
extracurricular stuff

1267
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,550
that you gotta do to

1268
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,550
get into a good college.

1269
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,000
Man, I hear you.

1270
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,000
Math club?

1271
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,930
A lot of better ways

1272
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,930
to spend my time.

1273
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,930
Mmm-hmm.

1274
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,500
And the thing

1275
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,500
is I did it, too.

1276
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,410
I hacked my doll when

1277
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,410
I was in high school

1278
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,410
'cause I was overwhelmed.

1279
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,200
Nice.

1280
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,440
I mean, to tell you

1281
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,440
the truth, Noah,

1282
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:11,210
the real reason I

1283
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:11,210
don't wanna have kids

1284
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:11,210
is it's too hard.

1285
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,610
How is anybody

1286
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,610
supposed to do it all?

1287
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,980
No, you'd be good at it.

1288
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,620
Why do you say that?

1289
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,880
I watched you.

1290
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:23,160
You're like that girl,

1291
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:23,160
cagey, resourceful.

1292
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,870
You can't hack

1293
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,870
a real baby, Noah.

1294
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,630
Yeah, you're right,

1295
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,630
all right.

1296
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,860
And what do you mean,

1297
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,860
you watched me?

1298
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,340
You know.

1299
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,320
Hey.

1300
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,880
I heard your dad's

1301
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,880
doing well.

1302
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,950
Yeah, I'm sure he's making

1303
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,950
the nurses miserable.

1304
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,490
They can handle it.

1305
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,400
I better get up there.

1306
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,400
Okay.

1307
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,940
We're waiting for a bed,

1308
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,940
then we'll transfer

1309
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,940
Troy upstairs.

1310
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,840
We're gonna get you

1311
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,840
feeling better soon,

1312
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,840
okay, buddy?

1313
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,850
It takes a few weeks

1314
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,850
to get back to normal,

1315
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,850
but his prognosis is good.

1316
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,640
He should have

1317
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,640
a full recovery.

1318
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,690
You waiting

1319
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,690
for a thank you?

1320
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,530
One of our social workers

1321
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,530
is gonna come in

1322
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,070
and talk to you

1323
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,070
about nutrition,

1324
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,070
help you with Troy's diet.

1325
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,730
And I'm sorry.

1326
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,640
I know it isn't easy

1327
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,640
holding everything together.

1328
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,410
And, to tell you the truth,

1329
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,740
every day,

1330
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,740
I worry if I'm doing

1331
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,740
right by my kid, so...

1332
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,550
Okay.

1333
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,190
Thanks.

1334
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,500
All right.

1335
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,500
Hang in there, champ.

1336
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,340
Hey, Pop, how you feeling?

1337
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,440
Like I took one

1338
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,440
on the chin.

1339
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,640
You kind of did.

1340
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,950
Maybe now, if something's

1341
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,950
cooked in bacon grease,

1342
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,950
you'll think twice?

1343
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,320
You know, in fact,

1344
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,320
we need to have a talk

1345
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,090
about all the junk food

1346
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,090
you eat

1347
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,960
and the beer.

1348
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,120
What?

1349
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,700
I mean it. When we get home,

1350
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,700
there are gonna be

1351
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,700
some changes.

1352
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,920
Thanks, kid.

1353
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,990
Yeah.

1354
