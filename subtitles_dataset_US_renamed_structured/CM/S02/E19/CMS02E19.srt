1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,760
You did this skydiving?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,760
Not exactly.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,360
I fall 9,000 feet

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,360
and land, no problem.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,990
And then I trip

6
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,990
walking to my car.

7
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,700
Isn't that ridiculous?

8
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,430
Well, sounds like

9
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,430
you got off easy.

10
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,240
Mmm. What can I say?

11
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,240
It was on my bucket list.

12
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,240
Okay. Let's take

13
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,240
a look at your head.

14
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,500
Ow!

15
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,080
Yeah, you got

16
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,080
a decent-sized laceration

17
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,080
on your scalp, Lyla.

18
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,120
Ah! Figured. I used

19
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,120
half a box of Kleenex

20
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,680
trying to stop the bleeding

21
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,680
on my way over here.

22
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,550
You didn't drive yourself,

23
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,550
did you?

24
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,090
No, no,

25
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,090
no, my boyfriend actually.

26
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,090
He's out parking the car.

27
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,220
All right, let's get

28
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,220
a picture of that wrist.

29
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,220
Okay.

30
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,560
Thank you.

31
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,360
Hey, I got requests

32
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,360
for schedule changes

33
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,240
that could

34
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,240
use your signature.

35
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,240
All righty.

36
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,560
Right there.

37
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,370
This one's frozen.

38
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,110
Oh, really? I just used it.

39
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,170
Well, I'll pull it up

40
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,170
on the desktop.

41
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,640
Sharon?

42
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,520
It looks like this screen

43
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,520
is locked as well.

44
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,120
Sharon, it's Bert.

45
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,680
Maggie. Sharon.

46
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,590
I'll go check

47
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,590
on that monitor.

48
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,670
What are you doing here?

49
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,670
Is something wrong

50
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,670
with one of the kids?

51
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,600
No, no, no, everything's fine,

52
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,600
as far as I know.

53
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,040
That's not why I'm here.

54
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,380
Honey, Bert, over here.

55
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,140
"Honey"?

56
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,650
That's my lady friend.

57
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,650
She... I think she

58
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,650
might've broken her wrist.

59
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,980
Excuse me.

60
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,690
Balloon catheter

61
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,690
is at the lesion site.

62
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,520
Inflating now.

63
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,850
Stent deployed.

64
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,220
All right,

65
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,220
let's have one last look.

66
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,700
Compress the pedal.

67
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,100
Dr. Bardovi?

68
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,470
I don't know

69
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,470
what's wrong

70
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,470
with the fluoro pedal.

71
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,880
I'm stepping on it.

72
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,880
Guys.

73
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,610
Is that...

74
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,090
What's happening?

75
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,750
Sharon?

76
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't say anything, okay?

77
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,000
I need a moment to process.

78
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,690
No, no, no,

79
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,690
it's not that. Look.

80
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,600
What is all this

81
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,600
about malware and

82
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,600
decryption keys?

83
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,370
It's a ransom note.

84
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,240
Oh...

85
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,800
We've been hacked.

86
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,810
Our server has been

87
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,810
corrupted and shut down,

88
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,820
and until we can

89
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,820
restore the system,

90
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,620
we'll be operating

91
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,620
under downtime procedure.

92
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,220
That means paper charts.

93
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,690
And no tablets, people.

94
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,690
Hand them over.

95
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,670
So we have no access

96
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,670
to anyone's medical records?

97
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,360
How do we do stuff?

98
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,400
Well, there was

99
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,400
a time not so long ago

100
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,910
when we actually

101
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,910
treated patients without

102
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,910
the aid of computers.

103
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,710
Imagine that.

104
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,710
Tell them, Dr. Charles.

105
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,180
Can I keep it if I

106
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,180
promise not to use it?

107
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,310
Sorry, Dr. Charles,

108
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,310
IT needs to

109
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,310
check them all out.

110
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,520
Well, it's not just

111
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,520
the electronic medical records

112
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,520
that are disabled, right?

113
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,990
I hear imaging's

114
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,990
down as well.

115
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,780
Yeah, so that means, what?

116
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,780
No X-rays?

117
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,880
And no CT scans,

118
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,880
no MRIs...

119
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,060
We'll have to

120
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,060
cancel elective surgeries

121
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,060
for the time being,

122
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,360
but the IT

123
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,360
department is confident

124
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,130
they can disable the malware

125
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,130
and get us back online soon.

126
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,760
Isn't that right, Bruce?

127
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,760
We're doing our best.

128
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,770
And in the meantime,

129
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,770
we'll make do.

130
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,300
We'll use the transport

131
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,300
monitors to read the vitals...

132
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,370
Yeah, I'm sorry,

133
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,180
but the note says

134
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,180
that if we pay

135
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,180
them 30 Bitcoins,

136
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,080
they'll give us

137
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,080
a decryption key, so...

138
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,880
It's hospital policy

139
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,880
not to engage

140
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,880
with extortionists.

141
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,390
So we're going to fly blind

142
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,390
with one arm tied

143
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,390
behind our back?

144
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,580
It seems

145
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,580
a little shortsighted.

146
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,120
I mean, it's what

147
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,120
$30,000, $40,000?

148
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,120
It seems like nothing.

149
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,460
Says the guy

150
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,460
with the trust fund.

151
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,220
We're not paying

152
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,220
the ransom, Dr. Rhodes.

153
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,220
We don't need to.

154
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,030
We aren't so fragile

155
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,030
that we could be

156
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,730
knocked off our

157
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,730
game that easy.

158
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,870
Absolutely, Ms. Goodwin.

159
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,870
We're up for the challenge.

160
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,660
Thank you, Dr. Choi.

161
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,380
Okay, G.I. Joe.

162
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,380
G.I. Choi.

163
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,980
Back to your patients.

164
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,980
Increase communication,

165
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,980
people.

166
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,180
No blood is drawn,

167
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,180
no test is run,

168
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,790
and no medication is dispensed

169
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,790
without writing on this board.

170
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,820
Sharon?

171
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,830
Sharon, listen, I...

172
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,700
I didn't want you

173
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,700
to find out.

174
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,500
Then you could've

175
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,500
taken her to County.

176
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,970
But Med was

177
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,970
the closest

178
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,970
and the best,

179
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,570
not in small part

180
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,570
because of you.

181
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,630
Don't sweat it, Bert,

182
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,840
I've got bigger problems

183
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,840
to deal with right now.

184
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,810
I can't access

185
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,810
any of my files.

186
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,590
What are we

187
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,590
supposed to do?

188
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,950
Cross our fingers and hope

189
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,950
that some guy named Bruce

190
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,950
can save the day.

191
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,020
I can't say that

192
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,020
I'm optimistic.

193
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,620
Do you know how much

194
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,620
research that I just have

195
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,620
to put on hold now?

196
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,030
This is unacceptable.

197
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,090
Whoa! Easy there, babe.

198
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,090
It's not the end of the world.

199
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,560
Are you sure about that?

200
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,570
Because things are seeming

201
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,570
a little biblical around here.

202
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,970
I mean,

203
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,970
last night with the rats

204
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,970
and then today with the hacks.

205
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,410
Rats? What rats?

206
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,170
In the vents of my apartment.

207
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,510
It kept me up

208
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,510
all night last night.

209
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,140
Exterminator can't

210
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,140
come until tomorrow.

211
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,780
I'm gonna have to

212
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,780
check into a hotel.

213
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,410
No, you won't.

214
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,120
You stay with me

215
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,120
until this is resolved.

216
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,920
That is exactly what

217
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,920
I wanted you to say.

218
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,290
Give me that.

219
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,420
I need this

220
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,420
more than you do.

221
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,730
Bye.

222
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,370
He can't catch his breath.

223
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,130
I mean, I tried getting him

224
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,130
to lie back on the way over,

225
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,130
but he just...

226
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,440
He's tripoding.

227
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,440
Trying to clear

228
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,440
his secretions.

229
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,530
All right, it's okay,

230
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,530
Desmond.

231
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,380
Just try to take

232
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,380
a deep breath for me,

233
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,380
all right?

234
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,280
Does this hurt?

235
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,280
A little.

236
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,780
Okay.

237
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,910
His lymph nodes

238
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,910
are very swollen.

239
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,420
Do you know when he started

240
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,420
feeling like this?

241
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,780
Maybe three weeks ago.

242
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,650
Never as bad as this.

243
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,130
I mean, it would

244
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,130
come and go, so we just

245
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,130
thought he had the flu.

246
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,660
It's been going

247
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,660
around his school.

248
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,890
102.7.

249
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,730
He just started running

250
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,730
that fever this morning.

251
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,500
I mean, we got here

252
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,500
as fast as we could.

253
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,760
I had to find

254
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,760
someone to cover my shift.

255
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,170
I was out working, too.

256
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,170
I drive for a couple of

257
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,170
those ride-share apps.

258
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,070
We're just scrambling.

259
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,070
I understand.

260
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,040
Has he had all

261
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,040
his vaccinations?

262
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,040
Yes.

263
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,910
I think so.

264
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,350
Okay, let's get him

265
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,350
on an oxygen mask,

266
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,350
and give him racemic epi.

267
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,550
I'll be back to

268
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,550
check on him soon, okay?

269
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,250
April?

270
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,050
What do you think?

271
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,050
I don't know.

272
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,090
Maybe epiglottitis,

273
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,090
maybe mumps.

274
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,260
I mean,

275
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,260
who knows if he's really

276
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,260
had all his vaccinations.

277
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,760
Let's give him some steroids,

278
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,760
see if we can't

279
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,760
reduce the swelling,

280
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,460
and let's do a CBC, CMP,

281
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,460
blood cultures, and a DR-70.

282
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,160
Tumor marker?

283
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,370
Let's see if we can

284
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,370
get a rush on that.

285
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,310
Sorry.

286
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,410
This board's a mess.

287
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,150
Look around.

288
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,150
The whole ED's a mess.

289
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,620
We can't even send

290
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,620
patients upstairs

291
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,590
because we don't know

292
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,590
if there's beds available.

293
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,490
What a nightmare.

294
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,900
Okay, so before we

295
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,900
stitch up your head,

296
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,030
I wanna reduce

297
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,030
the fracture in your wrist.

298
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,460
Here, we'll give you a little

299
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,460
ketamine to sedate you.

300
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,870
I promise you

301
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,870
won't feel a thing.

302
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,140
Sure

303
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,140
I can trust you, Doc?

304
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,110
Seems I'm an enemy combatant.

305
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,300
Lover boy here

306
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,300
failed to mention

307
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,070
that his ex-wife is

308
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,070
running the place.

309
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,210
I told you Sharon

310
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,210
was a hospital administrator.

311
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,080
You didn't say it

312
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,080
was this hospital.

313
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,280
Before we get started,

314
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,280
you should know

315
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,280
our EMR system's down,

316
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,980
so I can't pull

317
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,980
up your records.

318
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,950
Really?

319
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,790
Yeah,

320
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,790
so I just need to confirm

321
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,790
the history you already gave.

322
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,390
Any medical problems?

323
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,390
Prior surgeries?

324
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,300
Anything I should

325
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,300
be aware of?

326
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,300
No.

327
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,960
Okay.

328
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,960
You taking any medications?

329
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,960
Any allergies to medications?

330
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,800
Nada.

331
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,800
Got a clean bill of health.

332
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,360
Lyla's the most active

333
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,360
person I've ever met.

334
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,180
Biking, tai chi.

335
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,110
We just got back

336
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,110
from whitewater

337
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,110
rafting in Chile.

338
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,440
It's all I can do

339
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,440
to keep up with her.

340
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,450
Look who's trying

341
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,450
to get in on my good side.

342
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,940
It's working.

343
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,720
Let's do it.

344
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,720
Okay.

345
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,450
New history and physicals

346
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,450
for everyone in

347
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,450
the psych ward?

348
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,550
Not everyone.

349
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,960
I mean, if they were

350
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,960
admitted before today,

351
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,960
we still have backups.

352
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,150
Still leaves about

353
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,150
six that we lost.

354
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,560
So, you know,

355
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,560
we just divvy them up.

356
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,560
Okay.

357
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,160
Here's the catch.

358
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,000
Even for us

359
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,000
so-called normal people...

360
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,000
Dr. Charles?

361
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,800
Thank you.

362
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,630
Getting hacked,

363
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,630
it really creates...

364
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,630
You know, it's a violation.

365
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,540
You know, heightens

366
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,540
your vulnerability,

367
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,270
and that's obviously

368
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,270
magnified for people

369
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,270
who are dealing with...

370
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,420
Anxiety and paranoia. Of course.

371
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,420
Yeah, yeah.

372
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,180
So I think it's just important

373
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,180
to not let them know

374
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,590
why their histories

375
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,590
are being retaken.

376
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,320
You know, we just

377
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,320
gotta finesse it a bit.

378
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,150
Understood.

379
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,680
Oh...

380
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,620
I heard that they

381
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,620
are having a hard time

382
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,500
filling the vacancy

383
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,500
left by Dr. Wheeler's death.

384
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,840
I'm sorry,

385
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,840
the ED residency?

386
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,840
Yeah.

387
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,900
I mean, you just

388
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,900
graduated from med school.

389
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,700
I thought maybe you might know

390
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,700
somebody who's interested.

391
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,030
Oh, darn it.

392
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,610
Hey, Daniel,

393
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,610
you got a minute?

394
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,610
Yeah.

395
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,680
Anyway, just give me a shout

396
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,680
if you're having any problems.

397
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,890
So I hear they went

398
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,890
zip-lining in Costa Rica.

399
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,550
I thought it was

400
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,550
South America somewhere.

401
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,230
You knew about this?

402
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,060
Daniel?

403
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,600
I went and had

404
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,600
drinks with Bert

405
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,600
about a month ago,

406
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,230
and, you know,

407
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,230
he let it slip.

408
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,300
A month ago?

409
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,300
And you've just

410
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,300
been sitting on this?

411
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,710
Well, I kind of thought

412
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,710
it was more up to

413
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,710
Bert to tell you,

414
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,400
and I advised him

415
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,400
to do exactly that.

416
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,140
Yeah, well, he didn't.

417
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,140
I'm sorry.

418
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,880
You know, it's not so

419
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,880
easy staying neutral

420
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,880
throughout all this, you know.

421
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,410
You want me to choose sides,

422
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,410
I'll pledge my

423
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,410
loyalty to you right now.

424
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,890
Not necessary.

425
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,890
I gotta get back to work.

426
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,400
Swelling's not coming down,

427
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,400
and his sats are dropping.

428
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,230
Are we gonna

429
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,230
need to intubate?

430
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,230
We can't.

431
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,230
If it spasms down,

432
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,230
we could lose his airway.

433
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,140
Let's get an analog X-ray up

434
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,140
here for a lateral neck, okay?

435
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,140
"Analog"?

436
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,140
What's going on here?

437
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,010
Mr. Rawls, please...

438
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,010
I hear you guys were hacked.

439
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,710
Do I need to take my

440
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,710
son to another hospital?

441
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,020
I seriously recommend

442
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,020
you not moving your son

443
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,020
in his current condition,

444
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,780
but I can assure you

445
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,150
that Desmond's care

446
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,150
will not be compromised

447
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,150
in the slightest.

448
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,690
Chad...

449
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,120
I hope you're right.

450
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,530
Workup back yet

451
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,530
on my 7-year-old?

452
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,400
The lab got them mixed up

453
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,400
with another patient.

454
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,300
They gotta run them again.

455
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,300
Are you kidding me?

456
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,160
It's the damn hack, okay?

457
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,140
Oh, Ms. Goodwin,

458
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,140
when are we

459
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,140
getting back online?

460
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,070
We're working on it.

461
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,070
You said that an hour ago.

462
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,440
I've got a dad

463
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,440
who wants to pull

464
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,440
his kid out of here.

465
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,270
You've got to stay

466
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,270
on top of the lab.

467
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,470
Don't worry.

468
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,470
We'll ride this whirlwind.

469
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,050
A little help here!

470
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,050
A little help!

471
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,050
Incoming!

472
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,280
My friend's been shot!

473
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,290
Dr. Choi?

474
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,290
Get out of the way, move.

475
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,660
I don't have

476
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,660
a room right now.

477
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,420
Out of the way.

478
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,420
Mags, where are

479
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,420
we taking him?

480
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,230
Wait, get that up.

481
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,230
I don't have a room right now.

482
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,320
Coming through!

483
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,320
Put him there.

484
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,420
Keep this area clear!

485
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,420
Lift him up.

486
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,030
Park him in

487
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,030
the hallway over there.

488
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,940
"We're gonna ride

489
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,940
this whirlwind"?

490
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,870
Keep telling me that.

491
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,450
Sats 100, BP 102

492
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,450
over 69, heart rate 110.

493
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,310
A little hypotensive

494
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,310
and tachycardic.

495
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,690
Let's get a 16 in each arm

496
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,390
and bolus a liter of LR

497
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,390
on the rapid transfuser,

498
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,680
and 50 of fentanyl for pain.

499
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,850
How's the leg looking?

500
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,900
A likely entrance hole

501
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,900
in the upper right thigh.

502
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,030
Big hematoma.

503
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,030
No apparent fracture.

504
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,090
All right, Noah, pop quiz.

505
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,090
Let's see how much you recall.

506
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,360
After we figure out

507
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,360
where the bullet went in,

508
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,360
what do we do?

509
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,760
Count the holes.

510
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,760
If there's an even number,

511
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,760
it came out.

512
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay. Jason,

513
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,000
I need you to grab the rail

514
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,000
and roll on your side for me.

515
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,910
Want to tell me

516
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,910
what happened?

517
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,910
I shot him, actually.

518
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,710
By accident.

519
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,710
I thought the safety was on.

520
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,510
I'm so sorry, man.

521
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,310
We cool?

522
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,310
Yeah, don't sweat it.

523
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,250
What kind of gun was it?

524
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,250
Uh, 9 mil.

525
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,590
And you carry it why?

526
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,590
You don't know

527
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,590
my neighborhood.

528
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,090
They got guns,

529
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,090
I got a gun.

530
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,930
Making the world

531
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,930
a safer place?

532
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,630
I think I might

533
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,630
see an exit hole.

534
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,360
It's tiny, but...

535
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,360
Yeah, too tiny.

536
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,360
Probably shrapnel.

537
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,300
Bullet's still

538
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,300
in there somewhere.

539
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,300
We've gotta find it.

540
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,570
Systems are still down.

541
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,270
Then we'll use

542
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,270
the tools we have.

543
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,560
Hey, Natalie,

544
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,560
can I ask you a favor?

545
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,320
One second.

546
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,550
Hey, April, can you try

547
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,550
and track down Connor for me?

548
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,650
All right.

549
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,650
Thank you.

550
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,820
Sorry, what's up?

551
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,100
I was gonna give this to Will,

552
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,100
but it looks like he's busy.

553
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,130
Can I leave it with you?

554
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,130
Sure.

555
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,060
He's going to

556
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,060
watch the game

557
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,060
with his brother tonight.

558
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,360
I slept in it last night,

559
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
and when he left this morning,

560
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
I was still in bed.

561
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,640
I'd leave it in his locker,

562
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,640
but I want to

563
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,640
make sure he gets it.

564
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,410
Okay.

565
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,410
Thanks.

566
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,310
You're the best.

567
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,530
She just said she had

568
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,530
an out-of-body experience.

569
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,390
Oh, that's ketamine.

570
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,900
Lyla, do me a favor

571
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,900
and follow my finger

572
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,900
with your eyes.

573
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,070
That whole time

574
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,070
you were pulling on my wrist,

575
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,010
I was floating

576
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,010
up to the ceiling,

577
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,010
looking down at myself.

578
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,010
It was wonderful,

579
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,680
though you may want

580
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,680
to tell the cleaning staff

581
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,440
there's a lot of dust

582
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,440
on the light

583
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,440
fixtures up there.

584
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,380
I'll have them look

585
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,380
into that immediately.

586
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,040
Are you sure there's nothing

587
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,040
you left out of your history?

588
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,680
Is something the matter?

589
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,520
Probably not.

590
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,420
You're having a little trouble

591
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,420
focusing with your eyes.

592
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,430
That could be just

593
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,430
a reaction to the ketamine,

594
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,560
but considering you suffered

595
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,560
the head injury, though,

596
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,690
I am thinking I want to bring

597
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,690
someone in from neurology,

598
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,030
just to rule

599
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,030
some things out.

600
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,020
You know what?

601
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,700
I'm sorry, there is one thing

602
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,700
that I left out of my history.

603
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,670
Elavil.

604
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,670
I take it for insomnia.

605
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,530
You never said

606
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,530
you had trouble sleeping.

607
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,870
It's not

608
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,870
an every night thing.

609
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,710
Is it possible that, um...

610
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,710
The drug had a bad interaction

611
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,710
with the ketamine?

612
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,810
Yes, that might explain it.

613
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,750
Oh, good. Then mystery solved.

614
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,850
Hmm...

615
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,720
I'll tell you this.

616
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,090
He could have come

617
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,090
in here with Beyoncé,

618
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,720
and it'd still be

619
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,720
a step down from you.

620
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,290
You don't have

621
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,290
to say that.

622
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,870
It's true.

623
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,870
He's lost weight.

624
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,430
Mmm-hmm.

625
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,300
Could've been worse.

626
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,670
Could've been a blonde.

627
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,710
Hmm...

628
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,810
Ms. Goodwin.

629
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,810
Dr. Halstead.

630
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,810
Any chance you got a hold

631
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,810
of Lyla's records yet?

632
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,790
Are you kidding me? How?

633
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,050
I've got no idea

634
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,050
when things are

635
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,050
gonna get here.

636
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,750
Well, in that case,

637
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,750
let's repeat her labs,

638
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,550
but this time add

639
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,550
coags and a D-dimer.

640
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,490
Whoa! I thought you were

641
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,490
wrapping things up with her.

642
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,150
Her head lac's not

643
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,150
repaired yet, Maggie.

644
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,420
She's not going

645
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,420
anywhere anyway.

646
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,860
I hope this is not

647
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,860
another one of your

648
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,860
wild goose chases.

649
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,030
What's that

650
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,030
supposed to mean?

651
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,970
It means

652
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,970
keeping Bert in the ED

653
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,770
is the opposite

654
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,770
of what Goodwin

655
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,770
needs right now.

656
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,570
Well, this is

657
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,570
a hospital, Maggie.

658
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,670
I know I don't

659
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,670
need to remind you

660
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,670
whose needs come first.

661
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,940
You want new labs? Fine.

662
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,540
We're doing paper today.

663
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,550
How about filling these out?

664
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,220
Hey, what do we got?

665
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,690
You've really got to

666
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,690
retrace all your steps?

667
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,690
Uh-huh.

668
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,960
I don't understand

669
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,960
why the network

670
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,800
isn't constantly

671
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,800
backing itself up.

672
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,130
Hard drives are

673
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,130
so cheap these days.

674
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,510
Hey, Dr. Charles

675
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,510
says they're looking

676
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,810
to fill the open

677
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,810
residency in the ED.

678
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,240
That's great news,

679
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,240
isn't it?

680
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,680
Why?

681
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,680
Because now

682
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,680
you can take it.

683
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,910
Isn't that the position

684
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,910
that you wanted

685
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,040
before Dr. Charles pulled

686
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,040
you into psychiatry?

687
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,590
You're missing

688
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,590
the point, Joey.

689
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,820
What point?

690
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,820
Why would Dr...

691
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,050
Why would Dr. Charles

692
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,050
bring this up in

693
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,050
the first place?

694
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,130
I mean, he sounded

695
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,130
innocent enough,

696
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,760
and since I just

697
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,760
graduated med school,

698
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,130
maybe I knew someone

699
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,130
who'd want the job,

700
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,570
but I can't help thinking

701
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,570
that he's got

702
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,570
some kind of agenda.

703
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,040
Is he dissatisfied

704
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,040
with my performance?

705
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,010
Is he trying

706
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,010
to get rid of me?

707
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,010
Look at it this way.

708
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,810
Everyone thought that

709
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,810
you were really good

710
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,810
in emergency medicine.

711
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,510
Is that supposed to

712
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,510
make me feel better?

713
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,480
Yeah.

714
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,820
You know, Joey,

715
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,820
you and I don't

716
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,820
communicate very well.

717
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,130
You see there?

718
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,130
Look how narrow

719
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,130
this boy's trachea is.

720
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,890
It's no wider than

721
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,890
a cocktail straw.

722
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,100
I assume you've

723
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,100
started a workup?

724
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,100
Still gummed up in the lab.

725
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,540
I started treating

726
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,540
him for epiglottitis,

727
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,070
but that's

728
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,070
clearly not the problem.

729
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,400
Lymphs?

730
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,100
It's hard to exclude cancer

731
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,100
from the differential.

732
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,270
We need to address

733
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,270
his airway issue.

734
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,510
Can we remove the lymph nodes?

735
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,510
Get a biopsy?

736
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,210
Surgically,

737
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,210
we're never gonna get

738
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,510
an ET tube down him

739
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,510
in this condition,

740
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,640
and Marty's gonna be hesitant

741
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,640
to put him under general.

742
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,020
So what can we do?

743
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,150
How still do you think

744
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,150
this kid can be?

745
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,750
What's that

746
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,750
you're spraying on him?

747
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,750
Ethyl chloride.

748
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,320
And you're positive

749
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,320
he won't feel anything?

750
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,060
Maybe a slight pinch,

751
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,060
but that's it.

752
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,060
Now the most important thing

753
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,060
is for you to stay

754
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,060
extremely still

755
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,440
while we're

756
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,440
doing this, Desmond.

757
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,060
You think you can do that?

758
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,060
Yeah.

759
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,730
You know what I

760
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,730
find works sometimes?

761
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,000
Is if you close your eyes

762
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,000
and you squeeze my hand

763
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,510
as hard as you

764
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,510
can until it's over.

765
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,510
How does that sound?

766
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,510
Good? Okay.

767
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,610
Let's go. Okay.

768
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,610
Okay.

769
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,120
Oh, God.

770
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,390
Mommy?

771
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,390
It's okay, D.

772
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,760
Mommy?

773
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,760
Just a little bit longer.

774
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,930
No!

775
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,930
Okay,

776
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,930
okay, okay.

777
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,030
Okay.

778
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,470
I'm sorry.

779
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,470
No, it's fine.

780
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,600
I think we got enough tissue

781
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,600
to send to pathology.

782
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,970
You should

783
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,970
see this, Jason.

784
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,450
It's cool. The bullet's,

785
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,450
like, in your heart.

786
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,750
Cool for you.

787
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,880
He shot me in the leg.

788
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,880
What the hell is

789
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,880
it doing up here?

790
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,750
Bullets travel in

791
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,750
unexpected ways.

792
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,950
Well, we need to

793
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,950
get that out, right?

794
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,950
One step at a time.

795
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,220
I can't tell yet

796
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,220
whether it's actually

797
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,690
in the heart or

798
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,690
just behind it.

799
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,350
Well, what about those

800
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,350
X-rays we took earlier?

801
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,260
Well, they're not

802
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,260
that precise.

803
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,060
Well, find something

804
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,060
that is.

805
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,000
What about

806
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,000
that MIR machine?

807
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,870
MRI? And it's not

808
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,870
usable right now.

809
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,870
What do you mean?

810
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,470
Look, if we can figure out

811
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,470
the path the bullet took

812
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,470
to get to your chest,

813
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,440
we should be able to determine

814
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,440
exactly where it is.

815
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,800
There are only

816
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,800
two options, right?

817
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,010
Right, well, either it caromed

818
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,010
through your midsection,

819
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,810
or it hitched a ride up

820
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,810
through your venous system.

821
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,380
Good. Grab a DPL.

822
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,150
DPL?

823
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,150
A diagnostic

824
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,150
peritoneal lavage.

825
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,880
We're gonna insert

826
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,880
a needle in your abdomen,

827
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,880
fill it with fluid,

828
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,050
then drain it to see

829
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,050
if there's any

830
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,050
internal bleeding.

831
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,820
Don't worry,

832
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,820
we'll drape off this area

833
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,820
before we insert the Foley.

834
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,100
What do you mean,

835
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,100
"Insert the Foley"?

836
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh, this goes up your urethra.

837
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,000
First you shoot me,

838
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,500
then you bring me to a place

839
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,500
from the Dark Ages.

840
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,440
You really suck, Marius.

841
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,440
My fault.

842
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,170
Um...

843
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,080
Excuse me.

844
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,350
Hey, Bert,

845
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,590
can I ask you...

846
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,590
Have you talked to

847
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,590
the children about this?

848
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,790
Not yet.

849
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,130
I was waiting to see

850
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,130
if it was serious or not.

851
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,660
And is it?

852
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,060
Sharon...

853
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,530
You know, maybe,

854
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,530
you should speak

855
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,530
to your children.

856
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,240
Oh, man, she's a trip wire.

857
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,910
How'd you

858
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,910
expect her to react?

859
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,450
This city is

860
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,450
filthy with hospitals,

861
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,450
but you decided to come here.

862
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,380
To do what?

863
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,250
To rub it in

864
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,250
Sharon's face?

865
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,250
Oh, come on.

866
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,720
How old is she anyway?

867
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,390
What does that have

868
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,390
to do with anything?

869
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,560
Okay.

870
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,560
When did you meet her?

871
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,900
I know what

872
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,900
you're implying.

873
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,260
Lyla wasn't

874
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,260
even in the picture

875
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,300
till way after

876
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,300
Sharon and I split up.

877
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,630
Split up?

878
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,730
Uh-uh.

879
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,800
You walked out on her.

880
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,950
Okay, so Bruce is no closer

881
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,950
to fixing this malware.

882
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,480
And the FBI?

883
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,180
Oh, come on, let's not

884
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,180
hold our breath there.

885
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,520
You know, I...

886
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,650
I think it's time

887
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,650
to consider putting

888
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,650
the hospital on bypass.

889
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,790
What is that?

890
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,790
Sending patients

891
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,790
to other hospitals?

892
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,360
Do you know how much revenue

893
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,360
that is gonna cost?

894
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,230
A few hundred thousand.

895
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,770
That's just today.

896
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,770
You can double it tomorrow.

897
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,130
I mean,

898
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,130
the board is gonna plotz.

899
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,800
What do you suggest then?

900
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,800
We're full up.

901
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,240
My doctors are treating

902
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,240
gunshot wounds in the hallway.

903
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,370
Listen,

904
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,340
we keep a little cash on hand

905
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,340
for a rainy day, okay?

906
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,080
So we could pay this ransom,

907
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,080
and no one would ever know.

908
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,210
No.

909
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,210
Why not?

910
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,590
And do not say,

911
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,590
"Because it's bad precedent."

912
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,150
It's a horrendous precedent.

913
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,990
These hackers are putting

914
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,990
people's lives at risk.

915
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,190
They're compromising

916
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,190
their care.

917
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,490
You can't reward

918
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,490
behavior like that.

919
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,090
Besides, you pay them now,

920
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,090
what stops them

921
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,090
from doing it again

922
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,400
or holding the hospital

923
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,400
next door hostage?

924
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,600
I don't care about

925
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,600
the hospital next door.

926
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,710
We cannot

927
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,710
let them win, Peter.

928
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,850
You want to stick to

929
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,850
your guns, that's fine,

930
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,440
but you are the one

931
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,440
who's going to tell the board.

932
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,450
Spread the word

933
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,450
and notify IDPH

934
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,860
the hospital's now

935
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,860
on full diversion.

936
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,930
Yes, ma'am.

937
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,230
Give me IDPH.

938
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,500
Yeah, I need

939
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,500
a home for a chest pain,

940
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,500
a dog bite, and a flu.

941
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,200
Thank you. You got any room?

942
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,770
Oh, thank you.

943
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,770
I owe you.

944
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Leah, tell any walk-ins

945
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,840
who can fend for themselves

946
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,080
that we'll be

947
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,080
arranging for transport

948
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,080
to Rush and Mercy.

949
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,240
Okay?

950
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,540
Hey, have you heard

951
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,540
from pathology yet?

952
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,450
Let me give them

953
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,450
another call.

954
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,450
Please.

955
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,390
It's busy.

956
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,390
I'll check back in a minute.

957
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,390
Okay.

958
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,190
You look worried.

959
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,530
I do? That's not good.

960
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,330
I just...

961
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,570
I lost so many kids

962
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,570
to cancer this year

963
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,330
that every time

964
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,330
one comes in now

965
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,810
with the same symptoms,

966
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,810
I just...

967
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,840
I can't help but feel

968
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,840
the fear rising in me,

969
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,810
and it's all I can

970
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,810
do to control it,

971
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,440
so that I don't

972
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,440
scare the family.

973
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,210
Dr. Manning,

974
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,210
I've got your biopsy results.

975
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,780
Pathology called me in.

976
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,520
Why is an epidemiologist

977
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,520
getting called in on this?

978
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,960
Coccidioidomycosis?

979
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,970
Otherwise known

980
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,970
as Valley Fever,

981
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,970
and it's highly infectious.

982
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,860
Oh! Thank God.

983
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,530
You realize this is

984
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,530
a serious illness?

985
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,530
Yes.

986
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,870
No, yes, absolutely.

987
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,840
But at least

988
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,840
it isn't cancer.

989
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,210
That's what was causing

990
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,210
the fever and the swelling?

991
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,540
A fungal infection?

992
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,540
Spores are

993
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,540
typically found in soil,

994
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,090
predominantly

995
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,090
in desert locales.

996
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,420
Valley Fever isn't endemic

997
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,420
of the Great Lakes region.

998
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,720
Have you spent any time

999
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,720
in the Southwest recently?

1000
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,580
California?

1001
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,580
Nevada? Arizona?

1002
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,960
No, Desmond's never been

1003
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,960
further away from home

1004
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,660
than Grand Rapids.

1005
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,660
None of us has.

1006
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,360
Okay, well,

1007
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,360
we'd like to start your son

1008
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,460
on a round of IV

1009
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,460
antifungals right away.

1010
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,660
But I do have to warn you,

1011
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,570
it's strong medicine with

1012
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,570
the potential of side effects,

1013
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,940
but it is what he needs.

1014
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,330
Thank you, doctors.

1015
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,880
I'll get started on Desmond.

1016
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,380
I'm sorry, uh, but your

1017
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,380
son is the second person

1018
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,380
I've seen with this disease.

1019
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,610
I'm gonna need

1020
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,610
a detailed history

1021
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,610
from the both of you.

1022
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,580
It could help me find

1023
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,580
the source of the infection.

1024
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,850
I mean, can we do this later?

1025
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,850
We just want to be

1026
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,850
with our child right now.

1027
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,450
It's important

1028
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,450
that we find this

1029
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,720
before someone else's

1030
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,720
child gets infected.

1031
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,580
I can sit with you

1032
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,580
one at a time

1033
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,580
if that's better.

1034
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,590
You go. Be with Desmond.

1035
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,160
Thank you.

1036
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,360
At first, I thought it

1037
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,360
was just the sedation.

1038
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,700
You know, but her eyes,

1039
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,700
she's just not able to focus.

1040
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,370
I had her fix on my finger

1041
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,370
from about this distance.

1042
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,870
They dart back and forth

1043
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,870
to a random space over here.

1044
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,240
Almost mechanical.

1045
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,240
A square wave jerk.

1046
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,540
Exactly.

1047
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,780
So any time I get

1048
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,780
an eye thing after

1049
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,780
a fall on the head,

1050
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,150
I'm thinking, you know,

1051
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,150
possible stroke, but...

1052
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,740
Did your workup

1053
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,740
come back negative?

1054
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,550
Yeah.

1055
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,510
Any idea what else

1056
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,510
this might be?

1057
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,620
It could be anything

1058
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,620
from a basal ganglia

1059
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,620
disorder to normal aging.

1060
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,030
It's impossible to tell

1061
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,030
without a head CT or an MRI.

1062
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,760
You know,

1063
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,760
maybe if you just

1064
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,760
examine her yourself...

1065
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,900
Do I need to explain

1066
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,900
the definition of

1067
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,900
"impossible" to you?

1068
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,460
I'm a neurosurgeon,

1069
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,460
not a magician.

1070
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,510
Just find someone

1071
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,510
who can get the scans

1072
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,510
back up and running,

1073
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,040
and then maybe

1074
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,040
we can all do our jobs.

1075
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,980
Any word on when

1076
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,980
we might be getting

1077
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,980
our network back?

1078
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,410
Sorry.

1079
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,010
You think they

1080
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,010
still need my tablet?

1081
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,980
I'm afraid so,

1082
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,980
Dr. Charles.

1083
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,490
Dr. Charles, hey,

1084
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,490
about those H and Ps,

1085
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,030
Mrs. Kornbluth in Room 17,

1086
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,790
she was admitted

1087
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,790
experiencing hallucinations.

1088
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,920
Okay, okay...

1089
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,660
At intake, it was determined

1090
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,660
that she was having

1091
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,660
a psychotic episode,

1092
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,900
but after speaking with her,

1093
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,370
I think she simply

1094
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,370
might have had an

1095
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,370
adverse reaction to Ambien.

1096
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,010
This is all proving to be

1097
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,010
an incredible inconvenience,

1098
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,010
I just wanna say.

1099
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,530
I cannot believe

1100
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,530
that our patients'

1101
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,530
psychiatric histories

1102
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,310
aren't hosted on

1103
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,310
a separate secure network,

1104
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,810
and that HIPAA

1105
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,810
hadn't mandated that.

1106
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,080
Moving forward,

1107
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,080
you know, maybe...

1108
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,170
But in the meantime,

1109
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,950
it might've been beneficial

1110
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,950
for us to retrace our steps.

1111
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,720
I am running some tests now,

1112
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,190
but I think we might

1113
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,190
be able to discharge

1114
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,190
Mrs. Kornbluth later today.

1115
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,460
Oh, there's the IT guy.

1116
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,990
Bruce.

1117
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,200
Old rule of thumb.

1118
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,670
If you can read

1119
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,670
through the bag,

1120
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,670
the test is negative.

1121
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,710
So there's no

1122
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,710
bleeding in the abdomen?

1123
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,710
No.

1124
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,180
Well, that's

1125
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,180
good news, right?

1126
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,960
So you want me to crack

1127
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,960
this guy's chest open

1128
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,490
and put him on

1129
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,490
bypass on a hunch?

1130
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,050
Not a hunch.

1131
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,050
The diagnosis of exclusion.

1132
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,220
And what if

1133
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,220
you're wrong?

1134
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,220
He's not wrong

1135
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,730
I mean, the DPL

1136
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,730
ruled out the bullet traveling

1137
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,730
through the peritoneum,

1138
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,630
and if it went through

1139
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,630
the retroperitoneum,

1140
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,460
then he would have

1141
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,460
reported back pain,

1142
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,340
so it had to have embolized.

1143
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,770
Dr. Choi,

1144
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,770
he knows his stuff.

1145
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,780
It's how he does it

1146
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,780
on the battlefield.

1147
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,110
So we can't just

1148
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,110
transfer this guy

1149
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,210
to another trauma center

1150
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,210
with a working CT?

1151
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,550
Too risky. He could

1152
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,550
decompensate at any moment,

1153
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,990
and every second

1154
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,990
we wait just ups the risk

1155
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,460
of a massive

1156
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,460
pulmonary embolism.

1157
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,920
All right,

1158
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,920
I'll call the OR.

1159
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,920
Thanks.

1160
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,420
I don't understand

1161
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,420
what is taking so long.

1162
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,120
Get him going.

1163
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,120
I'll meet you up there.

1164
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,120
Yeah.

1165
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,360
If I could just

1166
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,360
access my files,

1167
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,160
I'm sure I could find a link

1168
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,160
between these cases.

1169
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,200
I'm sorry,

1170
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,200
but I was told by IT

1171
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,200
that the malware is

1172
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,200
quite sophisticated.

1173
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,100
Then why don't you

1174
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,100
just pay the ransom?

1175
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,400
It's not that simple, Robin.

1176
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,300
But it is that simple.

1177
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,300
It's right there

1178
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,300
on every screen.

1179
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,610
Easy instructions

1180
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,610
to pay the ransom

1181
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,610
and obtain a decryption key.

1182
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,050
A 3-year-old

1183
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,050
could figure it out.

1184
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,780
Hey, Robin, what's going on?

1185
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,180
What's going on is

1186
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,180
there might be an epidemic

1187
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,310
of Valley Fever breaking out,

1188
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,310
and no one seems to care.

1189
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,310
Let me remind you,

1190
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,310
Ms. Charles,

1191
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,880
in case the air

1192
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,880
is too thin to breathe

1193
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,880
atop that soap box,

1194
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,460
that you are

1195
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,460
an epidemiologist,

1196
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,070
and I am the one responsible

1197
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,070
for running this hospital.

1198
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,040
Why don't we just take

1199
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,040
a second to cool down?

1200
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,130
Why don't we?

1201
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,130
Don't handle me.

1202
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,010
Hey.

1203
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,850
Barry Lindheim again.

1204
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,850
Thinks you're

1205
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,850
dodging his calls.

1206
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,630
Smart man.

1207
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,630
Tell him you can't find me.

1208
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,630
Okay.

1209
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,580
Back online?

1210
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,480
I guess this means

1211
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,480
that we are off of bypass?

1212
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,550
Yes, we are

1213
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,550
off of bypass.

1214
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,220
Hallelujah.

1215
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,220
Thank you, Sharon.

1216
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,520
No, no, thank him.

1217
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,520
He's the real hero.

1218
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,360
Bruce, great job.

1219
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,860
I'm sorry.

1220
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,860
I didn't do anything.

1221
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,300
What?

1222
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,330
The system came

1223
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,330
back up on its own.

1224
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,870
Someone must've

1225
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,870
paid the ransom.

1226
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,110
You didn't

1227
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,110
authorize this?

1228
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,650
Then who did?

1229
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,180
Peter.

1230
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,630
I thought we agreed

1231
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,630
we weren't gonna

1232
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,630
pay the ransom.

1233
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,330
We didn't pay the ransom.

1234
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,630
Then what happened?

1235
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,630
Who knows?

1236
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,830
Look, maybe the hackers

1237
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,830
felt the feds were getting

1238
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,830
close and they bailed.

1239
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,740
In any case,

1240
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,740
the problem's been resolved,

1241
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,470
and we can get

1242
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,470
back to business,

1243
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,470
saving lives, making money.

1244
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,140
Someone countermanded

1245
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,140
my orders, Peter.

1246
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,820
Sharon,

1247
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,820
whoever that person was,

1248
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,820
they did us a huge favor,

1249
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,370
so let's not look a gift horse

1250
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,370
in the mouth, okay?

1251
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,360
Preliminary visual

1252
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,360
inspection shows no

1253
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,360
pericardial effusion.

1254
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,830
Thank you, Dr. Bardovi.

1255
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,630
I was just informed

1256
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,630
that we're back online,

1257
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,630
in case that's pertinent.

1258
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,770
Well, we're not

1259
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,770
gonna close him back up

1260
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,770
and send him to radiology

1261
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,570
just to wind up

1262
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,570
where we are now.

1263
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,540
So let's ultrasound

1264
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,540
the heart directly

1265
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,670
and see if we

1266
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,670
can't find the bullet.

1267
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,620
There,

1268
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,620
in the right ventricle.

1269
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,580
Yeah,

1270
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,580
that could be our culprit.

1271
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,910
Scalpel?

1272
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,830
Forceps.

1273
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,600
Hey.

1274
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,670
Nice work.

1275
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,240
I guess that Navy training

1276
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,240
wasn't a waste after all.

1277
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,780
That's how we do it

1278
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,780
on the battlefield.

1279
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,620
Well, if it hadn't worked,

1280
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,620
I would've blamed you anyway.

1281
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,980
I know.

1282
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,490
Hey, Dr. Rhodes,

1283
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,490
I don't know if you heard,

1284
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,490
but somebody paid the ransom,

1285
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,960
an open violation

1286
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,960
of hospital policy.

1287
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,560
What, you think it was me?

1288
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,920
I'm sorry, Ms. Goodwin,

1289
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,940
but as much as I

1290
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,940
would like to take credit,

1291
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,940
I didn't do it.

1292
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,570
Well, somebody paid.

1293
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,700
Was it you, Sam?

1294
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,610
My kid starts

1295
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,610
Sarah Lawrence in the fall.

1296
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,440
Not a chance in hell

1297
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,440
I'm cutting a check that size

1298
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,770
to solve your problem.

1299
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,720
Okay, so you're telling me

1300
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,720
nobody here knows

1301
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,720
anything about this?

1302
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,450
You got a second?

1303
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,020
What? You think

1304
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,020
I need a timeout?

1305
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,020
No.

1306
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm not endorsing

1307
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,960
any kind of palace coup,

1308
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,960
but I just...

1309
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,020
I understand any

1310
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,020
number of motivations

1311
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,930
why somebody would

1312
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,930
wanna get that thing paid.

1313
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,130
I've completely

1314
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,130
freaked myself out

1315
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,960
how much I miss

1316
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,960
this thing, you know?

1317
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,090
Which has clearly

1318
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,090
become a powerful tool

1319
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,400
that I use to

1320
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,400
maintain distance

1321
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,670
between myself

1322
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,670
and the world, you know?

1323
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,300
Control my environment.

1324
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,940
And that's

1325
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,940
a slippery slope, man.

1326
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,200
Control, you know,

1327
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,200
for all of us.

1328
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,840
I mean, one second

1329
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,840
you're steady in command.

1330
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,180
Next second, it's like, ah,

1331
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,180
rogue wave, you know,

1332
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,050
hackers, relationships

1333
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,050
we can't control.

1334
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,380
Come on, Daniel.

1335
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,650
Are you trying to

1336
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,650
bait and switch me?

1337
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,580
I'm not in denial.

1338
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,580
I know my husband is gone.

1339
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,290
I may never get a good answer

1340
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,290
for why he left,

1341
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,160
but I sure as hell

1342
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,160
can find out

1343
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,160
who paid that ransom.

1344
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,560
Your son is taking

1345
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,560
well to the medication.

1346
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,000
Hopefully,

1347
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,000
in a couple days,

1348
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,240
he'll be able to

1349
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,240
take this orally

1350
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,240
and we can send him home.

1351
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,240
Thank you, Dr. Manning.

1352
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,080
I'm glad we brought him here.

1353
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,110
We did, however,

1354
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,110
get your test

1355
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,110
results back as well.

1356
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,820
Ivie,

1357
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,820
yours came back negative.

1358
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,220
Chad, however,

1359
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,220
you tested positive.

1360
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,280
Positive? But I feel fine.

1361
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,590
It just means

1362
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,590
you've come in contact

1363
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,590
with a spore.

1364
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,460
A lot of people

1365
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,460
never become symptomatic,

1366
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,550
but moving forward,

1367
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,550
it is something to monitor.

1368
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,030
Mr. Rawls,

1369
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,030
I think I found a connection

1370
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,130
between Desmond

1371
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,130
and my other patient.

1372
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,600
You told me earlier

1373
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,600
you use your car

1374
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,600
to ride-share.

1375
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,340
Yeah. Why?

1376
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,540
My patient last week,

1377
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,540
she rode in your

1378
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,540
car 18 days ago.

1379
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,670
I mean,

1380
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,670
if you say so. No way I can

1381
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,670
remember everyone I drove.

1382
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,240
Did you park it here?

1383
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,240
I'd like to take a look at it.

1384
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,110
I don't understand.

1385
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,110
Why would my car be

1386
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,110
making people sick?

1387
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
I apologize,

1388
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Lyla, for the delay.

1389
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,850
I know you must be

1390
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,850
eager to get out of here.

1391
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,430
Yeah, are you gonna

1392
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,430
stitch me up or what?

1393
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,520
I am, but now that

1394
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,520
our imaging system's

1395
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,520
come back online,

1396
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,360
I'd like to get you

1397
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,360
down for a CT scan

1398
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,360
of your head first.

1399
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
I just grazed my head.

1400
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,400
It's really

1401
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,400
not a big deal.

1402
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,400
I hear you.

1403
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,200
Still, standard of care

1404
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,200
requires me to get a head CT.

1405
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,780
So blame it on

1406
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,780
insurance companies,

1407
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,780
if you must.

1408
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,940
Hey, I couldn't

1409
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,940
decide what to get.

1410
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,050
So I bought the whole rack.

1411
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,120
Did I miss something?

1412
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,980
Uh...

1413
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,550
Dr. Halstead just said

1414
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,550
that it might be

1415
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,550
a couple more hours

1416
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,960
until he can stitch me up.

1417
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,130
You mind running to my place

1418
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,130
and walking the dog?

1419
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,720
No, of course.

1420
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,720
I'll hurry back.

1421
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,720
Okay, thanks, babe.

1422
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,840
Why do I get the impression

1423
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,670
there's something going on

1424
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,670
you don't want

1425
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,670
either of us to know?

1426
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,910
You don't have

1427
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,910
to send me down

1428
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,910
for the CT scan.

1429
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,720
I can tell you what

1430
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,720
it's going to show.

1431
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,800
Dr. Halstead,

1432
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,800
I got a message

1433
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,800
you wanted to see me.

1434
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,990
Yes and no.

1435
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,660
Actually, Ms. Dempsey

1436
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,660
would like to speak with you.

1437
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,370
Why?

1438
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,050
I was told

1439
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,050
you wanted

1440
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,050
to speak with me.

1441
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,820
Yes, thank you.

1442
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,980
Yeah, this is pretty much

1443
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,980
as awkward as I imagined.

1444
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,230
But now that I told

1445
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,230
Dr. Halstead,

1446
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,030
I assumed it was

1447
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,030
a matter of time

1448
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,120
before the head

1449
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,120
of the hospital

1450
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,120
found out as well.

1451
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,730
Last year, I was

1452
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,730
diagnosed with a disease

1453
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,570
called progressive

1454
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,570
supranuclear palsy, PSP,

1455
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,180
which is a poor

1456
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,180
relation to Parkinson's.

1457
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,370
I'm familiar with PSP.

1458
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,050
I'm sorry.

1459
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,120
What's your prognosis?

1460
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,390
Five more years,

1461
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,390
maybe ten.

1462
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,650
What are you going to do?

1463
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,650
Seize the day, right?

1464
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,890
I'm still able to

1465
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,890
hide the symptoms

1466
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,890
for the most part,

1467
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,760
at least from lay people,

1468
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,040
which is why

1469
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,040
I wanted to talk to you.

1470
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,840
You haven't told Bert,

1471
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,840
have you?

1472
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,910
Want to scare off

1473
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,910
a potential guy

1474
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,910
lickety-split?

1475
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,810
Tell him, in three years,

1476
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,810
you won't be able

1477
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,810
to swallow or chew

1478
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,490
or breathe

1479
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,490
without their help.

1480
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,160
I didn't get a lot of

1481
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,160
calls for a second date,

1482
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,560
so when I met Bert...

1483
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,660
Look...

1484
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,470
Bert and I may

1485
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,470
have run our course,

1486
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,400
but keeping this

1487
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,400
from him is a mistake.

1488
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,410
I'm selfish, I know.

1489
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:04,350
I'm scared to spend

1490
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:04,350
the last few years

1491
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:04,350
of my life alone, you know?

1492
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,530
Yes, I do.

1493
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,370
How long have

1494
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,370
you owned this car?

1495
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,370
About two months.

1496
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,070
Bought it used

1497
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,070
from some place

1498
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,070
out in Hillside.

1499
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,800
Only had

1500
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,800
40,000 miles on it.

1501
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,600
Do you know anything

1502
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,600
about the previous owner?

1503
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,700
No.

1504
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,270
So what exactly

1505
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,270
are we looking for here?

1506
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,750
That's the ride-share app.

1507
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,750
Yeah.

1508
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,810
What's this?

1509
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,920
Uh, I don't know.

1510
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,920
It was on there

1511
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,920
when we bought it.

1512
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,050
"FAT." It's not something

1513
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,050
you really wanna advertise,

1514
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,060
but we couldn't get

1515
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,060
the sticker off the car.

1516
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,690
That's actually

1517
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,690
an IATA code.

1518
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,130
It's an airport abbreviation.

1519
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,130
That's Fresno International.

1520
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,260
California, Central Valley?

1521
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,830
I suspect

1522
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,830
your car might have spores

1523
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,830
in the air filters.

1524
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,100
They could stay

1525
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,100
active that long?

1526
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,270
Yeah, I'm sorry,

1527
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,270
but the CDC's gonna

1528
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,270
have to impound your car.

1529
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,210
And we're gonna need

1530
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,210
to check and notify every

1531
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,210
passenger you have had.

1532
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,810
Okay, it's... I know...

1533
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,110
Hey, Mags,

1534
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,110
I need to leave early.

1535
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,810
I gotta let the plumber

1536
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,810
into my apartment.

1537
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,850
Why can't your girlfriend,

1538
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,850
Vicki, do that for you?

1539
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,310
She got deployed. Germany.

1540
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,250
Oh, that must be hard

1541
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,250
on the two of you.

1542
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,530
Well, it's not

1543
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,530
the two of us anymore.

1544
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,150
Oh.

1545
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,590
Hi.

1546
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,590
Hey.

1547
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,690
I hear we dodged a bullet

1548
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,690
with that GSW earlier.

1549
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,790
Ah... So to speak.

1550
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,790
So to speak.

1551
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,140
Noah thinks you're

1552
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,140
some sort of a miracle worker.

1553
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,400
No, just a guy who's seen

1554
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,400
way too many shootings.

1555
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,840
Oh, Dr. Charles,

1556
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,840
hey, I just finished

1557
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,840
the last history.

1558
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,210
It's fascinating, really.

1559
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,210
The patient thought

1560
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,210
I was an...

1561
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,110
An FBI agent. I saw.

1562
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,110
The system's back up.

1563
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,110
But thank you.

1564
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,510
Dr. Charles?

1565
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,120
If you want to fire me,

1566
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,120
why don't you

1567
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,120
just do it already?

1568
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,980
Fire you?

1569
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,360
Wait, why would I

1570
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,360
want to fire you?

1571
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,760
Okay, I might not be

1572
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,760
the greatest psych

1573
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,760
intern of all time,

1574
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,230
but I know

1575
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,230
a little bit about subtext

1576
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,230
and the cognitive unconscious.

1577
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,070
And so when you tell me

1578
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,070
that there's an opening

1579
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,070
in the ED, I'm left to wonder

1580
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,200
does that mean you

1581
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,200
want me to quit psych

1582
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,200
and take that job?

1583
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,970
No. No, it does not

1584
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,970
mean that at all.

1585
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,000
Because I am not quitting.

1586
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,210
I am sticking with this

1587
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,210
all the way, and so

1588
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,210
if you wanna get rid of me,

1589
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,650
you're going to have to

1590
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,650
do more than just

1591
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,650
try to get in my head.

1592
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,030
Leah, thank you.

1593
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,030
That was a good job today.

1594
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,990
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

1595
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,870
I forgot you were a pacer.

1596
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,130
Wore out the rug every time

1597
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,130
you were in the delivery room.

1598
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,870
I don't know

1599
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,870
why I'm doing it now.

1600
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,240
Lyla's just getting stitches.

1601
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,240
Nobody ever died

1602
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,240
of that, right?

1603
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,280
Well, I'm sure

1604
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,280
it'll all work out.

1605
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,410
Sharon, um...

1606
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,820
I know it was

1607
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,820
incredibly insensitive of me

1608
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,820
to bring Lyla into your ED.

1609
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,390
You don't deserve to

1610
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,390
be treated like this.

1611
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,920
Bert...

1612
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,920
I owe you

1613
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,920
an apology, Sharon.

1614
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,400
I've crafted

1615
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,400
a few in my head.

1616
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,330
I've even written some down.

1617
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,330
I'm just so...

1618
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,960
Bert, please, it's fine.

1619
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,100
Mr. Goodwin?

1620
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,640
You wanted to know

1621
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,640
when Lyla was all sewn up?

1622
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,170
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

1623
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,650
You know, maybe someday,

1624
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,650
I can introduce

1625
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,650
the two of you formally.

1626
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,890
Yeah, sure.

1627
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,640
Hey, Nina left

1628
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,640
this for you earlier.

1629
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,230
Oh.

1630
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,610
Thanks.

1631
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,610
Mmm-hmm.

1632
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,820
So I heard Goodwin's ex

1633
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,820
brought his new girlfriend in.

1634
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,680
Yeah, Lyla.

1635
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,410
Mmm.

1636
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,410
That's gotta be tough,

1637
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,190
seeing someone

1638
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,190
you care about so much

1639
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,190
with a new lover.

1640
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,220
Yeah, tell me about it.

1641
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,520
I mean,

1642
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,520
I was the one treating Lyla.

1643
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,990
Right.

1644
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,700
Good night.

1645
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,470
Good night.

1646
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,400
Good night, Ms. Goodwin.

1647
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,400
Night.

1648
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,090
I was going to

1649
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,090
get a little drink.

1650
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,090
Yes.

1651
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,010
You find out who

1652
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,010
paid the ransom yet?

1653
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,450
You know what?

1654
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,450
I don't care.

1655
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,430
Who do we have next?

1656
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,250
Two CABGs, back to back.

1657
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,990
At least the hybrid

1658
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,990
suite's back online.

1659
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,290
Everyone's wondering

1660
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,290
who paid the ransom.

1661
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,530
I did.

1662
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,800
Thirty Bitcoin versus

1663
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,800
the continued integrity

1664
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,800
of our services?

1665
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,640
Pretty simple math,

1666
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,640
don't you think?

1667
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,370
Honey, what's going on?

1668
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,330
Why are you up?

1669
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,540
Seriously,

1670
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,540
who can sleep through that?

1671
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,780
Through what?

1672
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,780
The rats.

1673
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,020
My God, it's like

1674
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,020
nails on a chalkboard.

1675
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,720
This whole city

1676
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,720
must be infested.

1677
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,490
Can't you hear them?
