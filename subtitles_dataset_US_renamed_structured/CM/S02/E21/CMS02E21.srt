1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,030
Sure you don't want me

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,030
to wait with you?

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,030
Connor, I'm fine.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,330
I'm not saying

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,330
that you're not.

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,900
I just know that waiting rooms

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,900
can be awfully boring.

8
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,530
All those old issues

9
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,530
of People Magazine.

10
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,110
Anyone else gets

11
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,110
a little anxiety,

12
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,110
they get a massage.

13
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,710
Daughter of a psychiatrist,

14
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,710
a full-blown psych eval.

15
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,050
Look, we both know

16
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,050
that you haven't exactly

17
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,050
been yourself lately.

18
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,650
So let's just do this right.

19
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,650
We'll get you back

20
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,650
on your feet, okay?

21
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,990
Fine.

22
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,250
Robin Charles?

23
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,610
Dr. Kwon just told me

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,010
Robin's coming in

25
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,010
to be evaluated.

26
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,350
I'm so sorry to hear that.

27
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,050
Yeah, thanks.

28
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,050
Just, um...

29
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,450
I'm hoping for the best.

30
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,450
He chose me as the resident

31
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,450
to do her initial evaluation.

32
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,520
Really?

33
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,590
Yeah, he said you spoke

34
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,590
very highly of me. Thank you.

35
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,330
Well, didn't tell him

36
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,330
anything that wasn't true.

37
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,390
I imagine

38
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,390
it must be hard

39
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,930
to have to stay

40
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,930
at arm's length

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
from your daughter's

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
treatment, but...

43
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,940
And this goes without saying,

44
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,940
but I just want

45
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,940
to say it anyway,

46
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,240
Dr. Kwon and I will

47
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,240
do everything we can

48
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,070
to make sure Robin gets

49
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,070
the best possible care.

50
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,080
Dr. Reese, I have

51
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,080
complete confidence in you.

52
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,520
And if there's anything

53
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,520
I can do to help,

54
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,520
you just let me know.

55
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,080
I will.

56
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,720
There you are.

57
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,720
What's up?

58
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,850
A buddy of mine had

59
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,850
to pawn off two Blackhawks

60
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,850
tickets for tonight.

61
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,950
You in?

62
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,590
Only if I can feel the chill

63
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,590
coming off the ice.

64
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,270
Mmm. Twenty-seven rows up,

65
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,670
you're gonna feel it

66
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,670
coming off your beer.

67
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,170
Pick you up at 7:00?

68
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,170
See you at 7:00.

69
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,170
All right.

70
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,970
Dr. Rhodes, possible

71
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,970
collapsed lung coming in.

72
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,670
We're going to

73
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,670
Treatment Three.

74
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,670
I'm on it.

75
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,900
Courtney? Talk to me.

76
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,350
Gayle Parks.

77
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,350
Twenty-one weeks pregnant.

78
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,350
Fell getting out of bed.

79
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,820
Baby's stable,

80
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,820
but mom's short of breath

81
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,510
and satting at 92,

82
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,510
bradycardic and hypotensive.

83
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,280
Doris!

84
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,280
Can you tell me

85
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,280
what happened?

86
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,220
Uh, she miscarried

87
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,220
her last pregnancy,

88
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,260
so we've kept her

89
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,260
on bed rest just to be safe,

90
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,190
but when she got up to go

91
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,190
to the bathroom, she fell.

92
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,560
All right,

93
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,560
thank you, sir.

94
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,100
All right.

95
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,100
Let's move her

96
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,100
on my count.

97
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,160
One, two, three.

98
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,500
Okay.

99
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,500
All right,

100
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,500
let's get it out.

101
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,400
Nice, easy breaths

102
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,400
for me.

103
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,600
I've got breaths

104
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,600
sounds bilaterally,

105
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
but they're faint

106
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
with crackles.

107
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,370
Let's get a stat

108
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,370
AP chest X-ray.

109
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,370
No.

110
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,050
Nothing that

111
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,050
could harm the baby.

112
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,250
Mrs. Parks,

113
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,250
I promise the radiation

114
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,250
will be minimal,

115
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,050
and the fetus

116
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,050
will be shielded

117
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,050
by a lead apron.

118
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,450
We understand,

119
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,450
but if there's

120
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,450
any other way...

121
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm sorry, sir,

122
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,680
but your wife is having

123
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,680
a lot of trouble breathing.

124
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,780
We need to figure out why.

125
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,660
I said don't do it.

126
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,170
This baby is a perfect match

127
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,170
for my daughter.

128
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,170
I'm not taking any risks.

129
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,630
I'm sorry, excuse me?

130
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,910
I have leukemia.

131
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,340
My mom's having

132
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,340
this baby to save me.

133
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,090
Imagine that baby

134
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,090
being responsible

135
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,090
for keeping its sister alive.

136
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,150
Serial bone marrow donation.

137
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,320
Maybe a kidney one day.

138
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,320
Part of its liver.

139
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
Not gonna be easy.

140
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
No.

141
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,100
But if your kid

142
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,100
had advanced leukemia,

143
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,100
what would you do?

144
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,630
Whatever it takes.

145
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,000
Mmm-hmm.

146
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,440
EKG confirmed

147
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,440
a right inferior STEMI.

148
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,770
He's feeling better

149
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,770
after aspirin.

150
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,210
Gave him a dose

151
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,210
of beta blockers.

152
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,910
I spoke with cardiology,

153
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,910
put him on the list

154
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,910
for a cath,

155
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,640
but he's currently stable

156
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,640
and I think we're

157
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,640
gonna be in good shape.

158
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,880
Sounds like it.

159
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,880
Mmm-hmm.

160
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,620
All right, Mr. Walker,

161
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,620
you're in good hands

162
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,620
with Dr. Manning.

163
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,720
And those hands

164
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,720
couldn't be prettier.

165
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,720
Thank you, sweetheart.

166
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,830
Why is it that older men

167
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,830
always think they can

168
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,830
call you sweetheart?

169
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,700
I can't say it happens

170
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,700
much to me anymore.

171
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,860
Oh, maybe you should

172
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,860
be sweeter then?

173
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,600
And blow this rugged,

174
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,600
tough guy thing I got?

175
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,870
It's my meal ticket.

176
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,440
Hi.

177
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,440
Hey.

178
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,920
Don't even know why

179
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,920
I'm bringing you this,

180
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,220
Mr. I-slept-in-an-hour-late-today.

181
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,380
Well, that's because

182
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,380
you're so thoughtful

183
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,380
and lovely.

184
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,930
That's true.

185
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,200
Thanks. I better

186
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,200
get back to work.

187
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,360
I'll see you.

188
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,360
Have a good day.

189
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,100
Is it

190
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,100
Match List day already?

191
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,270
Uh-huh. Stohl's

192
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,270
yearly power trip.

193
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,710
Marching those

194
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,710
poor med students around,

195
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,340
telling them that

196
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,340
he's turning in

197
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,340
his list tonight.

198
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,510
So if they want

199
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,510
a residency spot here,

200
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,350
"Your last chance

201
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,350
to impress me."

202
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,620
Reminds me of

203
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,620
a drill instructor

204
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,620
I had in boot camp.

205
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,950
Nice guy?

206
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,950
Sweetheart.

207
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,750
Follow me.

208
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,750
We'll start over here.

209
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,260
First, I would like

210
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,260
to hear about what's

211
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,260
been happening lately.

212
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,600
After that,

213
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm gonna send you

214
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,600
down to phlebotomy

215
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,330
so we can run

216
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,330
a few standard tests.

217
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,500
Then, later,

218
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,500
we can meet up again,

219
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,340
see if we can't

220
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,340
figure out

221
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,340
what's going on.

222
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,570
Sounds like a plan.

223
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,570
Good. Good.

224
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,180
Um, so can you tell me,

225
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,180
in your own words,

226
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,180
why you're here today?

227
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,970
To find out if I'm crazy.

228
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,790
Do you think

229
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,790
that's a possibility?

230
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,790
No.

231
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,580
Okay.

232
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,950
Though you did agree

233
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,950
to meet with me.

234
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,820
How come?

235
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,240
I don't know.

236
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,740
I mean, there is a history

237
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,740
of psychiatric issues

238
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,740
in my family.

239
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,600
I see.

240
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,440
Um, you want to tell me

241
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,440
about what's been happening

242
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,440
in the last few weeks?

243
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,550
I started hearing rats

244
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,550
in the walls of my apartment.

245
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,960
Mrs. Parks. Hi.

246
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,770
You breathing any better?

247
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,610
A little.

248
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,610
Good.

249
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,110
Are you okay?

250
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,080
Yeah.

251
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,580
Leah just finished

252
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,580
a round of chemo. She's, uh,

253
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,580
been a little nauseous.

254
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,710
Got it.

255
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,620
Why don't you and Sam

256
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,620
go get a little

257
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,620
fresh air, huh?

258
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,880
I'll go with you.

259
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,220
Thanks, Doris.

260
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,400
So, your tests show

261
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,400
that you do not have

262
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,400
a collapsed lung,

263
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,270
but I'm seeing something

264
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,270
more concerning.

265
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,610
You're in heart failure.

266
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,380
Um... Uh, she had

267
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,380
a peripartum cardiomyopathy

268
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,380
during her last pregnancy.

269
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,480
So you understand

270
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,480
the danger you're in?

271
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,920
I had no choice.

272
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,790
Our son Sam wasn't

273
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,790
a donor match for Leah.

274
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,460
This is the only way

275
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,460
that I can save her.

276
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,000
We're well aware of the risks,

277
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,000
but we discussed this

278
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,000
at length and we, uh...

279
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,340
We're willing

280
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,340
to take the risk.

281
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,900
I realize that this

282
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,900
is difficult to hear,

283
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,280
but the safest choice

284
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,280
in cases like this is to

285
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,410
take the load

286
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,410
off of your system

287
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,410
and terminate the pregnancy.

288
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,390
My daughter can't make it

289
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,090
without getting

290
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,090
a marrow transplant

291
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,090
in the next year.

292
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,070
If I lose this pregnancy,

293
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,070
it'll be too late.

294
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,100
Three weeks, Dr. Rhodes.

295
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,100
That's all we need.

296
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,870
Can you help us do that?

297
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,600
Yes. Okay.

298
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,310
I'm gonna put you

299
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,310
on some medicine

300
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,900
that will help to

301
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,900
strengthen your heart.

302
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,540
We will get your

303
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,540
pressure back up,

304
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,410
and hopefully

305
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,410
you'll be breathing

306
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,410
easier again soon.

307
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,950
Oh, thank you.

308
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,950
Thank you.

309
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,350
Of course.

310
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,680
Dr. Charles.

311
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,320
Thanks for the help

312
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,320
with Robin.

313
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,260
Of course.

314
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,760
Hey, Daniel?

315
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,100
I understand Dr. Reese

316
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,100
is the resident

317
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,100
evaluating Robin.

318
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,640
Yeah, well,

319
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,640
it makes sense.

320
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,510
She's very good

321
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,510
with patients

322
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,510
in her own peer group.

323
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,780
Yes, she is, but

324
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,780
she's also your student.

325
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,710
One of my very best,

326
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,710
and I, uh, have the utmost

327
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,710
confidence in her.

328
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,850
Well, I'm sure

329
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,850
you do, Daniel.

330
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,080
I know this is complicated,

331
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,960
but I sincerely hope

332
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,960
you're not using Dr. Reese

333
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,960
as your surrogate.

334
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,520
Sharon, look, of course

335
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm a big fan of Sarah's,

336
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,230
but Dr. Kwon's running

337
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,230
the show on this one.

338
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,000
My only job

339
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,000
is to be a good dad,

340
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,000
and stay out of the way.

341
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,080
He's in unstable v-tach.

342
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,080
Barely got a pulse.

343
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,040
A little help in here.

344
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,040
Right away.

345
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,390
He's peri-arrest.

346
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,390
Must be another

347
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,390
heart attack.

348
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,860
Will, start bagging.

349
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,830
April, charge

350
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,830
the paddles to 100.

351
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,830
On it.

352
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,060
What did his angio

353
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,060
look like?

354
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,920
Stented two small lesions

355
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,920
in the cath lab.

356
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,330
Charged to 100.

357
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,530
Clear.

358
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,400
No pulse.

359
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,400
I'm starting compressions.

360
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,400
Another milligram of epi.

361
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,300
Charge to 200.

362
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,610
How were his vitals?

363
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,240
He was fine.

364
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,240
He was totally stable.

365
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,980
Two hundred.

366
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,980
Clear!

367
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,110
Clear.

368
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,450
He's gone into v-fib.

369
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,010
Another milligram of epi,

370
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,010
300 amiodarone.

371
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,580
Keep up compressions

372
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,580
and charge to 200.

373
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,360
Then he must have had

374
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,360
a worse disease

375
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,360
than we thought.

376
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,730
Charge to 200.

377
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,730
Clear!

378
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,960
Clear.

379
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,890
Asystole.

380
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,470
Time of death, 10:32.

381
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,740
How did this happen?

382
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,560
And now,

383
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,560
for our final case...

384
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,060
Mr. Dayne passed out

385
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,060
this morning from

386
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,060
a cardiac arrhythmia.

387
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,590
He's stable now,

388
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,590
though still in a-fib.

389
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,300
Mr. Dayne, do you have

390
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,300
any idea how long ago your

391
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,300
irregular heartbeat began?

392
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,700
Nope.

393
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,700
Thank you.

394
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,700
We'll be back.

395
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,780
So, if the a-fib started

396
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,780
less than 48 hours ago, we...

397
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,540
Shock him back

398
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,540
into rhythm?

399
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,540
Correct.

400
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,210
But if it's been longer

401
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,210
than 48 hours,

402
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,310
that same shock

403
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,310
could throw a dangerous

404
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,310
embolus to his brain.

405
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,650
So my bright,

406
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,650
young minds,

407
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,890
one of you

408
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,890
needs to come up

409
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,890
with the answer.

410
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,460
Dr. Stohl?

411
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,390
How are we supposed

412
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,390
to do that?

413
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,300
Impress me.

414
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,950
Dr. Reese, what's up?

415
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,950
Hey.

416
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,950
Robin is down

417
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,950
in phlebotomy now.

418
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,550
Oh.

419
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,720
Great.

420
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,860
Well, sounds like

421
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,860
you're on top of it.

422
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,330
How's it, um...

423
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,660
How's it going?

424
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm starting

425
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,000
to put together

426
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,000
a clinical picture.

427
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,690
Good stuff.

428
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,030
Once again, you know,

429
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,230
if you need

430
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,230
any family history,

431
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,230
any background...

432
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,110
For instance,

433
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,110
she's been talking

434
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,110
about her apartment a lot.

435
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,200
Has that come up at all?

436
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,040
I really can't

437
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,040
discuss this.

438
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,710
Of course you can't.

439
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,710
I'm sorry.

440
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,780
I just meant purely

441
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,780
from a clinical standpoint,

442
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,780
you know,

443
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,150
the home is a reflection

444
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,150
of the mind and all that.

445
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,750
It couldn't hurt exploring,

446
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,750
but you're absolutely right.

447
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,250
Keep up the good work.

448
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,250
Doing a great job.

449
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,860
Dr. Manning?

450
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,530
I thought you might want

451
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,530
to have a look at this.

452
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,470
Oh. Thanks.

453
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,410
Oh, God.

454
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,410
What?

455
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,280
My patient's

456
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,280
autopsy report.

457
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,980
I made a mistake.

458
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,460
Mr. Walker didn't die

459
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,460
of an MI.

460
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,900
Massive pulmonary

461
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,900
embolism.

462
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,570
I can't believe it.

463
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,570
I totally missed it.

464
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,930
Oh, come on. Even if we knew,

465
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,930
there's nothing we could've

466
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,930
done differently.

467
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,200
It happened so fast.

468
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,940
We didn't have time

469
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,940
to get heparin on board,

470
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,940
let alone send him upstairs.

471
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,240
I know, but still...

472
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,240
Wait.

473
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,740
How did you get this

474
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,740
so fast?

475
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,020
These reports usually take

476
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,020
at least three to four hours.

477
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,380
Nina brought it up to me.

478
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,650
She came upstairs

479
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,650
and gave it to you?

480
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,650
Yeah.

481
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,060
You know, I'm gonna

482
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,060
go back over the chart,

483
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,060
see if there were some clues.

484
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,720
Nat, listen.

485
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,260
You did everything

486
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,260
you could for that man,

487
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,760
so don't get down

488
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,760
on yourself over it.

489
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,590
Hey, you're

490
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,590
too good a doctor.

491
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,900
Thanks, Will.

492
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,540
Stohl's a-fib case.

493
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,570
Guy's holding

494
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,570
a residency spot

495
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,570
over our heads with this.

496
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,640
What's the case?

497
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,520
Forty-year-old male.

498
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,310
No records, no history,

499
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,180
and Stohl expects us

500
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,180
to figure out

501
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,180
when it started.

502
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,520
Where are you at?

503
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,690
I mean,

504
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,690
there's no previous records.

505
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,360
No previous episodes.

506
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,050
No family history.

507
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,160
I'm getting killed on this.

508
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,670
You got any thoughts?

509
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,130
Any recent caffeine

510
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,130
or alcohol use?

511
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,940
New-onset irritability,

512
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,940
perspiration, hand tremors?

513
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,510
To assess for

514
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,510
acute thyrotoxicosis.

515
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,020
Hey, that is good.

516
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,020
Thyrotoxicosis.

517
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,220
You got anything else?

518
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,380
You applied here

519
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,380
for residency, right?

520
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,380
Yeah.

521
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,860
Well, you're not gonna get it

522
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,860
by half-assing it

523
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,860
through your cases.

524
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,690
Get back in there

525
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,690
and start asking

526
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,690
some questions.

527
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,890
And don't come out

528
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,890
till you've done

529
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,200
a thorough and complete

530
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,200
history and physical.

531
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,260
You understand?

532
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,260
Yeah.

533
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,530
Okay.

534
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,370
Good.

535
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,140
Help! My wife

536
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,140
can't breathe!

537
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,010
Please, please,

538
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,010
we need help!

539
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,010
Mom!

540
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,450
Just stay here.

541
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,450
It's okay.

542
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,260
She's profoundly bradycardic.

543
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,260
Let's get 5 liters of O2.

544
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,660
Let's get

545
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,660
the external pads

546
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,660
on to capture,

547
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,860
and then we'll set up

548
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,860
for a central line.

549
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,400
Let me help!

550
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,400
Yep.

551
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,090
Mom, what's happening?

552
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,360
It's okay, angel.

553
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,830
What are you gonna do?

554
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,270
This is gonna fire electricity

555
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,270
through your skin

556
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,270
60 times a minute

557
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,040
to keep your heart beating

558
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,040
until I can get

559
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,040
an internal pacer on.

560
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,140
It won't affect the baby?

561
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,750
No, but it is

562
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,750
gonna hurt.

563
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,750
Okay. Okay.

564
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,580
Set to 60 beats

565
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,580
a minute.

566
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,580
Got it.

567
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,850
Pacer's set.

568
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,490
Not capturing.

569
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,620
Mom!

570
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,890
Leah? Leah! Baby?

571
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,890
Leah! Leah!

572
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,930
I got her!

573
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,930
Leah, baby?

574
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,990
She's not getting

575
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,990
enough air!

576
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,990
I need oxygen now!

577
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,940
Nat, she's got

578
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,940
stage four leukemia.

579
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,940
Just had chemo.

580
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,770
Save my daughter.

581
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,840
Try to stay calm, okay?

582
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,940
How are you feeling?

583
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,280
I'm a lot better.

584
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,510
Good.

585
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,920
Twenty more minutes of oxygen,

586
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,920
and then she'll be free to go.

587
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,550
I'll let her mom know.

588
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,550
Great.

589
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,630
I love you.

590
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,100
Can I ask you something?

591
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,030
Of course.

592
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,240
What's happening

593
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,240
to my mom?

594
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,610
I think that's something

595
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,610
you should talk to

596
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,610
your parents about.

597
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,280
They just tell me

598
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,280
everything's fine.

599
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,190
When you're pregnant,

600
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,190
your heart is pumping

601
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,190
for two.

602
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,060
And right now,

603
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,060
your mom is having

604
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,060
trouble keeping up.

605
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,890
Is she gonna die?

606
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,340
Dr. Rhodes

607
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,340
is the best heart doctor

608
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,340
in the hospital.

609
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,000
He's gonna take

610
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,000
the very best care of her.

611
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,470
She's doing this

612
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,470
'cause of me.

613
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,680
She's your mother.

614
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,910
She wants

615
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,910
to do everything

616
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,910
she can for you.

617
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,190
What about Sam?

618
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,020
Your little brother?

619
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,430
Sometimes,

620
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,430
it's like Mom and Dad

621
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,430
hardly notice him.

622
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,660
Like he's not even there.

623
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,760
Why should I get

624
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,760
all the attention?

625
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,730
Your parents are

626
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,730
worried about you

627
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,730
because you're sick.

628
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,340
I'm sure they love

629
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,340
your brother just as much.

630
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,840
What about the baby?

631
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,840
What's it gonna

632
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,840
be like for him?

633
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,480
I don't want everyone sad

634
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,480
'cause of me.

635
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,610
I want us to be

636
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,610
a regular family.

637
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,780
Have you told your mom

638
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,780
how you feel?

639
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,030
I think she'd

640
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,030
want to know.

641
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,560
Nina?

642
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,560
Hey.

643
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,700
Why did you give

644
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,700
that report to Natalie?

645
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,440
I'm sorry?

646
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,240
Why did you come up to the ED

647
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,240
and give it to her?

648
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,010
She missed a diagnosis.

649
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,010
I thought she'd want

650
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,010
to know.

651
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,910
No. You file the report

652
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,910
in the chart

653
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,710
and put an alert

654
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,710
in the doctor's mailbox.

655
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,180
That's how

656
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,180
you usually do it.

657
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,210
Okay.

658
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,350
You have it in

659
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,350
for Natalie?

660
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,790
What?

661
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,890
Are you trying

662
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,890
to make her feel bad

663
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,190
because you think there was

664
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,190
or is something between us?

665
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,130
Really, Will?

666
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,530
That's what

667
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,530
you think of me?

668
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,530
Just explain this.

669
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,370
Why would you go

670
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,370
out of your way

671
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,030
to make sure Natalie

672
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,030
knew about a diagnosis

673
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,740
she couldn't possibly

674
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,740
have done anything about?

675
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,610
I told you.

676
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,610
She made a mistake.

677
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,580
And you know what?

678
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,010
Anyone who refuses

679
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,010
to learn from their mistakes

680
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,380
is gonna repeat them.

681
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,050
Dr. Reese, how's everything

682
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,050
going with Robin?

683
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,560
I kind of have a problem.

684
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,030
Dr. Charles logged

685
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,030
into her medical records.

686
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,960
I see.

687
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,470
I haven't posted

688
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,470
any notes yet,

689
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,380
so there's nothing

690
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,380
much to see, but still...

691
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,670
Hmm.

692
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,670
Well, I'll go talk

693
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,670
with Dr. Kwon.

694
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,740
In the meantime,

695
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,740
hold off on

696
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,740
posting those notes.

697
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,750
Ms. Goodwin?

698
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,750
Yes?

699
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,480
I can't help but wonder...

700
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,150
Did Dr. Charles

701
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,150
have me assigned

702
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,150
to Robin's case

703
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,490
just so he could get

704
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,490
access to her treatment?

705
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,030
'Cause I get the feeling

706
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,030
he's just using me

707
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,030
to be his...

708
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,030
I don't know, his patsy.

709
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,210
Listen, uh, Dr. Reese,

710
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,640
the only thing

711
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,640
I can say is that

712
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,110
this is a very difficult

713
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,110
situation for him.

714
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,010
Try not to take it

715
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,010
personally.

716
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,420
Hey, there you are.

717
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,820
Showing Dr. Stohl

718
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,820
what you're made of?

719
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,890
Yeah. I guess.

720
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,720
Actually, problem is

721
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,720
Dr. Choi's been

722
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,720
riding me really hard.

723
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,400
Well, that's his style.

724
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,560
It's just you're

725
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,560
his friend, right?

726
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,230
You think maybe you could

727
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,230
ask him just to dial it

728
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,230
back just a little bit?

729
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,170
What do...

730
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,170
You know, just get him

731
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,170
off my case.

732
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,180
He doesn't hassle

733
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,180
the other med school

734
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,180
students like this.

735
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,610
I'm not doing that.

736
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,370
Okay. Fine.

737
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,370
I guess I'll just

738
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,370
get back to work then.

739
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,810
How's Leah's mom doing?

740
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,150
Even with the pacer,

741
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,950
she's experiencing a dangerous

742
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,950
number of premature

743
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,950
ventricular contractions.

744
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,860
She could have a lethal

745
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,860
decompensation any minute.

746
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,630
And if she does,

747
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,630
I'm afraid we won't

748
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,630
be able to get her back.

749
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,300
How's the breathing?

750
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,300
Uh, okay.

751
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,550
Let me see the EKG.

752
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,890
What?

753
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,700
What's wrong?

754
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,830
Your heart function

755
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,830
is deteriorating rapidly.

756
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,040
We need to surgically place

757
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,040
a device called an LVAD

758
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,740
to pump your heart for you.

759
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,240
How risky is it

760
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,240
for the baby?

761
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,380
Surgery on bypass

762
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,380
does carry significant

763
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,380
risks for the baby,

764
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,710
but if we don't do surgery,

765
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,420
we'll be forced

766
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,420
to intubate you

767
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,420
and put you on ECMO...

768
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,700
You won't get off

769
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,700
the ventilator.

770
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,430
You'll remain

771
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,430
in a persistent

772
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,430
vegetative state.

773
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,610
I am very sorry.

774
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,510
We'll get you ready

775
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,510
to go upstairs soon.

776
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,750
Will my baby survive?

777
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,320
If I were like that...

778
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,920
In a coma?

779
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,220
It's possible,

780
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,220
but the chances

781
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,220
are not very good.

782
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,660
Honey...

783
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,660
But it is possible?

784
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,100
Mrs. Parks, maybe

785
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,100
we're not making

786
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,100
ourselves clear...

787
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,830
No, I understand.

788
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,650
But I have the cure

789
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,650
to my daughter's

790
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,650
cancer inside me.

791
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,850
Maybe the two of you

792
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,850
should take some time

793
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,850
and talk it over?

794
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,180
Yes, yes.

795
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,350
We already discussed

796
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,350
every possibility.

797
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,030
Not this.

798
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,030
Yeah.

799
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,860
We said we would

800
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,860
do anything.

801
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,990
If the time comes...

802
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,740
Intubate me.

803
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,610
Hopefully,

804
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,610
it won't come to that.

805
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,750
We obviously can't let her

806
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,750
go through with this.

807
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,560
What choice do we have?

808
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,560
We can't force her

809
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,560
to have surgery.

810
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,730
We're talking about

811
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,730
letting her kill herself.

812
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,200
No. It's not that simple.

813
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,200
She doesn't see it

814
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,200
as suicide.

815
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,760
She sees it

816
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,760
as saving her daughter.

817
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,730
At what cost?

818
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,530
She'd be leaving

819
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,530
a three-year-old

820
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,530
and an infant behind

821
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,200
with no mother

822
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,200
to care for them.

823
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,140
And Leah would

824
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,140
survive leukemia.

825
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,380
I offered the surgery.

826
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,380
She declined it.

827
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,140
Wait.

828
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,710
You said doing

829
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,710
the surgery on bypass

830
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,710
came with some risks.

831
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,510
What about doing it

832
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,510
off bypass?

833
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,250
A lot more dangerous.

834
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,690
I wouldn't be able

835
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,690
to see through the blood.

836
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,690
I'd lose them both.

837
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,790
But what if we could

838
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,790
save them both?

839
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,460
I mean, brain death

840
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,460
shouldn't be an option.

841
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,460
That family needs a mother.

842
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,040
Hey, there!

843
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,040
Oh, hey.

844
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,280
You, um,

845
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,280
mind if I join you?

846
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,280
Go right ahead.

847
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,780
How's it going?

848
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,780
Fine.

849
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,550
Are you back

850
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,550
in your place yet?

851
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,390
Everyone says

852
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,390
I don't have rats,

853
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,390
so I am back at my place.

854
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,220
Wow. Great.

855
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,220
So, no more rats?

856
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,220
Mmm-hmm.

857
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,630
Everything's good.

858
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,630
Got it all under control.

859
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,670
Fantastic.

860
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,470
Yeah. And Dr. Reese

861
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,470
seems comfortable

862
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,470
with where I'm at,

863
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,740
so I think one more session

864
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,740
later on today

865
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,740
and I'll be done.

866
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,370
That's a relief.

867
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,980
Hon, you must be exhausted.

868
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,710
You want me to bring

869
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,710
some sushi by tonight?

870
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,880
Maybe we watch a movie...

871
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,880
No.

872
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,450
No.

873
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,450
How about I just

874
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,450
drop off some sushi?

875
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,360
Dad, I just...

876
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,360
I really want

877
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,360
to get some rest.

878
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,730
Of course.

879
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,830
Hon, my knee

880
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,830
has been acting up.

881
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,160
Can you do

882
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,160
your old man a favor?

883
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,930
Just grab me

884
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,930
another creamer,

885
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,930
please? Or two?

886
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,330
Okay.

887
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,770
Hazelnut.

888
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,770
Mmm-hmm.

889
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,690
Thank you.

890
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,690
You're welcome.

891
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,820
Hey, um, I know

892
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,820
you're helping

893
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,820
my brother with his case,

894
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,450
and I really appreciate it,

895
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,220
but could you maybe

896
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,220
go a little easier on him?

897
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,230
What do you mean?

898
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,230
You know, just lay off

899
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,230
the gas a little?

900
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,490
Where's this coming from?

901
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,490
Did Noah ask you

902
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,490
to talk to me?

903
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,540
April, there's

904
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,540
a good doctor

905
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,540
inside Noah.

906
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,870
But he has a way

907
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,870
of getting people

908
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,870
to make things easier for him.

909
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,080
And as long as

910
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,080
they keep doing that,

911
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,010
he's never gonna reach

912
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,010
his full potential.

913
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,880
I won't coddle him.

914
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,480
Who said anything

915
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,480
about coddling?

916
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,580
You just asked me

917
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,580
to give him a pass

918
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,580
on a patient.

919
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,820
Not a pass. Just stop

920
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,820
being such a hard-ass.

921
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,650
Well, maybe if he had

922
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,650
more hard-asses

923
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,650
in his life,

924
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,920
he wouldn't

925
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,920
have to leave Med

926
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,920
to do his residency.

927
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,920
Wow. Okay.

928
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,920
You know what?

929
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,900
You don't know

930
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,900
anything about me

931
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,900
or my brother.

932
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,340
You know, truth is,

933
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,410
I can't say I'm surprised

934
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,410
that you and that guy

935
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,410
didn't work out.

936
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,920
What?

937
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,160
Well, yeah, I just mean

938
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,160
a doctor and a lab tech...

939
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,190
He just can't understand you.

940
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,190
You know? The pressures

941
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,190
we face.

942
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,530
Holding someone's life

943
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,530
in our hands. It's...

944
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,200
Noah? Noah?

945
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,200
Yeah?

946
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,960
Have you solved

947
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,960
Dr. Stohl's case yet?

948
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,770
No, but, uh...

949
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,710
You can't keep having

950
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,710
other people carry

951
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,710
your water for you.

952
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,400
You have to commit.

953
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,170
Let them see that you're

954
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,170
gonna kill it every day

955
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,170
and get the job done.

956
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,940
I know, but I...

957
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,940
But nothing!

958
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,210
Go back to Dr. Choi.

959
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,840
Listen to every word

960
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,840
he says until you get

961
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,840
the case solved.

962
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,820
You got that?

963
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,890
Yeah. Okay.

964
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,150
I got it.

965
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,760
I got your page.

966
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,760
BP's 80 over 40.

967
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,760
Stats are down to 60.

968
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,090
Gayle, your heart is no longer

969
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,090
able to function on its own.

970
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,600
Please, let me do

971
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,600
the surgery.

972
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,700
Otherwise, we're gonna

973
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,700
have to intubate you now.

974
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,610
Honey, I know

975
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,610
we've come so far,

976
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,610
and we're so close,

977
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,040
but I don't want you

978
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,040
to do this.

979
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,340
I do.

980
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,340
No!

981
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,750
It's okay. You're gonna

982
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,750
have a beautiful life.

983
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,110
No, not without you.

984
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,310
We don't want you to go.

985
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,180
Even if the baby saves me.

986
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,860
We love you. We need you.

987
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,560
Pressure's down to 70.

988
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,720
Gayle, if you don't tell

989
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,720
Dr. Rhodes to do the surgery,

990
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,530
we are going to need

991
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,530
to intubate you now.

992
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,070
No! Don't!

993
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,070
Please, Mommy!

994
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,370
We could try

995
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,370
the surgery off bypass.

996
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,370
What does that mean?

997
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,670
Instead of diverting

998
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,670
blood from her heart,

999
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,670
I'll let it keep pumping.

1000
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,270
It is an extremely

1001
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,270
difficult surgery,

1002
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,870
but I could avoid

1003
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,870
using the anti-coagulant

1004
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,870
that would harm the baby.

1005
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,310
You could save us both?

1006
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,920
The odds are very low,

1007
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,920
and if we get into trouble,

1008
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,320
I have to tell you,

1009
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,320
I will try to save you.

1010
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,820
I won't be able

1011
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,820
to save the baby.

1012
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,090
Mom, please!

1013
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,090
Gayle...

1014
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,260
Okay.

1015
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,260
All right, tell the OR

1016
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,260
we're on our way up.

1017
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,660
Let's get her

1018
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,660
ready to move now!

1019
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,660
Okay.

1020
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,530
Yep. Good?

1021
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,530
Let's go.

1022
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,170
Hey.

1023
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,810
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have

1024
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,810
brought Natalie into this.

1025
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,150
But you were right.

1026
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,110
I am jealous.

1027
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,020
I just miss you, Will.

1028
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,730
I don't want us

1029
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,730
to grow apart.

1030
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,090
Neither do I.

1031
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,960
I'll apologize

1032
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,960
to Natalie.

1033
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,030
No, no.

1034
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,030
I'll talk to her.

1035
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,670
Infections can

1036
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,670
cause heart problems.

1037
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,310
Have you had any

1038
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,310
recent illnesses?

1039
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,310
No.

1040
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,480
Hmm. Okay.

1041
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,710
Any past issues

1042
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,710
with blood pressure?

1043
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,930
No, I'm usually

1044
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,930
around 110 over 80.

1045
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,430
And your cholesterol

1046
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,430
is good, too.

1047
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,230
I watch what I eat.

1048
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,200
I exercise a lot.

1049
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,200
I'm a runner.

1050
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,510
Okay. Do you track

1051
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,510
your vitals with, like,

1052
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,510
a Fitbit or an app?

1053
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,330
Yeah. Yeah, that's how

1054
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,330
I know what my BP is.

1055
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,170
I've got it on my phone.

1056
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,680
Can I take a look?

1057
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,940
Yeah.

1058
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,790
There is going

1059
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,790
to be more blood

1060
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,790
in the next two minutes

1061
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,980
than you have ever seen.

1062
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,860
I'll get the LVAD

1063
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,860
into the ventricle

1064
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,360
while Dr. Harper

1065
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,360
cannulates the aorta.

1066
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,950
Keep the suction coming.

1067
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,760
Steady hands.

1068
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,030
Once we make the cut,

1069
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,030
the clock starts.

1070
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,590
Are you ready?

1071
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,590
Yes.

1072
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,810
Okay. Ready?

1073
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,700
Go!

1074
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,010
I can't see anything.

1075
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,850
Connor, baby's rate

1076
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,850
is at 120.

1077
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,850
More suction.

1078
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,310
Mom's pressure

1079
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,310
is dropping.

1080
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,460
I need 45 seconds.

1081
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,790
Baby's rate's at 98.

1082
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,090
You there?

1083
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,090
Not yet.

1084
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,790
Mom's not responding.

1085
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,790
We're gonna lose her.

1086
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,460
All right, I'm in.

1087
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,010
Baby's rate

1088
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,010
is at 65 and dropping.

1089
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,240
Mom can't

1090
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,240
handle this.

1091
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,440
We need to deliver

1092
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,440
the fetus and get

1093
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,440
the load off her heart.

1094
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,850
There's too much blood.

1095
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,320
You can still

1096
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,320
save the mom.

1097
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,080
We have

1098
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,080
to deliver now.

1099
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,080
No!

1100
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,520
Dr. Rhodes.

1101
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,320
I'm almost there.

1102
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,220
Baby's rate is at 40.

1103
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,950
Dr. Rhodes,

1104
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,950
what do you want to do?

1105
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,420
Hey, honey.

1106
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,420
Where are you off to?

1107
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,420
Uh, home.

1108
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,490
Do you mind,

1109
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,490
could we just

1110
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,490
have a little chat?

1111
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,970
I really have

1112
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,970
a lot of things to do.

1113
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,430
Sweetie, look, I'm, um...

1114
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,860
Honey, I'm sorry.

1115
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,060
I'm just really

1116
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,060
very worried about you,

1117
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,580
and I just want to make sure

1118
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,580
that we're getting you

1119
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,580
the proper treatment.

1120
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,310
Yeah, that's being

1121
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,310
taken care of.

1122
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,410
No, darling.

1123
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,410
Can we just talk

1124
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,410
about this for a second?

1125
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,350
Robin, stop.

1126
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,350
Can we please

1127
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,350
talk about this?

1128
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,970
Not now, Dad.

1129
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,970
Robin!

1130
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,580
Robin!

1131
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,680
Excuse me,

1132
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,680
I need to get through.

1133
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,020
I'm so sorry, honey.

1134
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,020
I can't let you do that.

1135
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,650
What?

1136
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,390
Get away from me!

1137
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,560
What are you doing?

1138
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,430
Just need you to stay here

1139
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,430
a little while longer.

1140
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,630
We need to keep you here

1141
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,630
a little while longer

1142
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,000
so we can get you

1143
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,000
the help that you need.

1144
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,190
No. No, I'm not staying.

1145
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,830
Honey, I'm just worried

1146
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,830
that you're gonna

1147
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,830
hurt yourself.

1148
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,030
I don't want you

1149
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,030
to hurt yourself.

1150
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,010
Who are you to decide

1151
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,010
who's gonna hurt themselves?

1152
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,510
Get off of me!

1153
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,210
What are you doing?

1154
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,210
I hate you!

1155
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,810
I swear I'm never

1156
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,810
gonna speak to you again!

1157
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,830
Mrs. Parks?

1158
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,530
Mrs. Parks?

1159
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,660
Gayle? Hey.

1160
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,400
You're okay.

1161
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,740
The baby?

1162
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,150
Even with the transfusions,

1163
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,150
the blood loss was too great.

1164
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,420
Your heart couldn't

1165
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,420
keep up with it.

1166
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,960
We tried.

1167
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,930
There was no way

1168
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,930
to save both of you.

1169
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,930
I'm so sorry.

1170
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,230
No, Mom.

1171
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

1172
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,860
I failed you.

1173
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,460
No, you didn't.

1174
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,070
No. I love you.

1175
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,560
That girl has

1176
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,560
an impossible battle

1177
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,560
ahead of her.

1178
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,460
At least she'll be able

1179
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,460
to face it with her mother.

1180
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,750
Based on our

1181
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,750
patient's fitness app,

1182
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,220
the resourceful Mr. Sexton

1183
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,220
believes he has determined

1184
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,160
when the arrhythmia began,

1185
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,160
and he proposes

1186
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,160
electrocardioversion.

1187
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,060
If he's right,

1188
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,060
shocking the patient

1189
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,860
will return him

1190
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,860
to a sinus rhythm.

1191
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,460
If he's wrong,

1192
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,360
we may soon see the effects

1193
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,360
of an embolic stroke.

1194
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,670
Mr. Sexton?

1195
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,600
Charge to 75.

1196
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,340
Clear.

1197
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,020
Sinus rhythm.

1198
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,430
Well done, Mr. Sexton.

1199
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,430
I'm impressed.

1200
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,300
I suppose you're looking

1201
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,300
for a thank you?

1202
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,970
Nah.

1203
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,770
Just as long as I get

1204
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,770
to say I told you so.

1205
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,310
How dare you admit

1206
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,310
Robin behind my back?

1207
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:05,220
She is my patient.

1208
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:05,220
You didn't examine her.

1209
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:05,220
You didn't treat her.

1210
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,650
You didn't see

1211
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,650
her apartment.

1212
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,160
I don't care what you saw.

1213
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,160
You should've come

1214
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,160
to me first.

1215
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,320
I didn't have time, Dr. Reese.

1216
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,320
She was leaving the hospital.

1217
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,220
Yes, because

1218
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,220
I gave her the night

1219
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,220
to think about it.

1220
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,530
I know she needs

1221
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,530
to be admitted!

1222
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,130
I thought...

1223
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,020
I thought that she was

1224
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,020
masking it from you.

1225
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,130
No! We were

1226
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,130
making progress.

1227
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,830
I was trying to get her

1228
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,830
to admit herself voluntarily.

1229
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,240
To take ownership

1230
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,240
of the idea,

1231
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,000
so she'd be in the best state

1232
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,000
of mind to accept treatment.

1233
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,710
I needed to earn

1234
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,710
her trust for that,

1235
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,710
and now that chance is gone.

1236
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,110
You had to run around

1237
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,110
sticking your nose

1238
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,110
in everything

1239
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,080
instead of letting me

1240
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,080
do my job.

1241
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,600
Natalie,

1242
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm sorry about Nina

1243
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,730
bringing that autopsy report

1244
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,730
to your attention.

1245
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,930
What do you mean?

1246
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,200
She feels jealous.

1247
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,000
We haven't spent a lot

1248
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,000
of time together lately,

1249
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,040
and you working here

1250
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,040
all day alongside me...

1251
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,840
Anyway, you shouldn't

1252
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,840
have gotten dragged

1253
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,840
into our issues.

1254
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,740
Okay.

1255
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,310
Okay.

1256
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,060
Listen.

1257
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,070
If I'm being honest,

1258
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,840
if I saw my boyfriend

1259
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,840
working with another woman

1260
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,400
the way we work together,

1261
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,710
I'd be concerned, too.

1262
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,170
Why?

1263
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,210
We work well together.

1264
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,210
There's nothing

1265
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,210
wrong with that.

1266
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,150
We don't just

1267
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,150
work well together.

1268
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,890
The way we laugh,

1269
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,890
the way we talk...

1270
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,260
It's special.

1271
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,990
Well, we're good friends.

1272
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,500
Are we, Will?

1273
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,930
Are we just good friends?

1274
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,180
Yes. That's exactly

1275
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,180
what we are.

1276
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,640
Okay.

1277
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,790
Natalie!

1278
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,790
No, you're right.

1279
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,780
We're good friends.

1280
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,780
Night, Will.

1281
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,660
Reese! Hey.

1282
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,560
Robin hasn't been

1283
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,560
answering my texts.

1284
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,760
Have you seen her?

1285
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,760
I was about to call you.

1286
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,730
I'm afraid I have

1287
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,730
some bad news.

1288
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,510
All right.

1289
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,510
Let's do this.

1290
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,180
Ah, man.

1291
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,050
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna

1292
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,050
spend a little quality time

1293
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,050
with Nina tonight.

1294
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,890
We need that.

1295
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,890
Dude.

1296
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,560
I know. It's on me.

1297
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,830
I promise I'll get us

1298
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,830
tickets for next week.

1299
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,830
All right?

1300
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,730
I gotta go. I will.

1301
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,530
Hey, Nat.

1302
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,530
Hey.

1303
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,700
Do you like hockey?

1304
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,240
Oh, uh, not tonight,

1305
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,240
but thank you.

1306
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,070
My brother just ditched me,

1307
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,070
and the ticket's

1308
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,070
gonna go to waste.

1309
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,840
Mmm.

1310
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,850
I guess Owen

1311
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,850
is already asleep

1312
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,850
at his grandma's,

1313
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,490
and I could use

1314
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,490
a hockey game?

1315
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,320
Right? Cold beer.

1316
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,160
Grown men on skates.

1317
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,160
What's not to love?

1318
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,160
Okay. Thank you.

1319
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,960
Tough day.

1320
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,360
Hope you're not here

1321
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,360
to lecture me.

1322
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,440
Well, it's a little late

1323
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,440
for that.

1324
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,020
I had her back,

1325
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,730
and I lost her.
