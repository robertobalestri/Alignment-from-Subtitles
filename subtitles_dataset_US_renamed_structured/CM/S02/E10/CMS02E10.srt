1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,130
Hey, Natalie.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,860
I was hoping

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,860
I could catch you

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,860
before my shift started.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,130
Well, you caught me.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,380
So, uh, you want to do

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,380
something later?

8
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,380
Maybe grab some dinner?

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,410
I was up all night

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,410
prepping for the M&M today.

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,110
By the time my shift's over,

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,110
I'm gonna be running on fumes.

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,050
We can keep it mellow.

14
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,380
Make some spaghetti,

15
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,380
watch a movie.

16
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,890
Uh, maybe.

17
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,890
We'll see.

18
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,560
Okay, everyone, heads up!

19
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,560
CPD! Dr. Choi?

20
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,360
Auto versus ped.

21
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,360
Officer Kate Windham found

22
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,360
unresponsive in her driveway.

23
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,400
Who?

24
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,400
Officer Kate Windham.

25
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,530
Down for

26
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,530
an unknown period.

27
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,530
Tubed in the field.

28
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,860
Mags?

29
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,460
Baghdad.

30
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,080
She was hit in

31
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,080
her own driveway?

32
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,050
Freak accident.

33
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,050
Parking brake gave out.

34
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,840
Her SUV rolled into her.

35
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,980
BP 111 over 77,

36
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,980
heart rate 136.

37
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,320
Dropped to 32,

38
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,320
and then shot back up.

39
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,150
Cushing's response.

40
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,150
Brainstem herniation?

41
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,380
Let's not go there yet.

42
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,930
Transfer on my count.

43
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,930
Ready? One, two, three.

44
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,390
Any sedation or

45
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,390
paralytics in the field?

46
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,390
No.

47
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,390
Pupils are fixed

48
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,390
and dilated.

49
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,270
Not initiating a breath.

50
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,270
Resume bagging.

51
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,710
No corneal reflex.

52
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,810
What's with Maggie?

53
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,780
Officer Windham

54
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,780
arrested Maggie last year.

55
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,990
Lieutenant Windham,

56
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,620
as I explained,

57
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,620
your wife's CT showed

58
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,620
massive bleeding.

59
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,400
The tests confirm

60
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,400
she's not responsive

61
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,400
to stimuli,

62
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,430
and her blood flow

63
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,430
study indicates that

64
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,430
the pressure in her brain

65
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,270
is greater than

66
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,270
her blood pressure.

67
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,500
She has no blood flow

68
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,500
to her brain.

69
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,480
Unfortunately,

70
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,480
all of these things tell us

71
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,480
that your wife is brain dead.

72
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,080
I'm very sorry.

73
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,120
You're telling me

74
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,120
she's dead?

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,960
My wife's dead.

76
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,560
We're right here

77
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,560
for you, Darryl.

78
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,390
She was just walking

79
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,390
to the mailbox.

80
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,390
Mmm-hmm.

81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't understand.

82
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't get it.

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,000
She was...

84
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,270
She was walking

85
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,270
to the mailbox.

86
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,770
I know this must be

87
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,770
a terrible shock for you.

88
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,850
Lieutenant,

89
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,290
I did see on her records,

90
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,290
your wife is

91
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,290
a registered organ donor.

92
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,360
Yeah.

93
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,170
Kate was all about

94
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,170
helping others.

95
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,920
Our charge nurse will

96
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,920
coordinate the donations.

97
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,920
Mmm.

98
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,850
Lieutenant Windham,

99
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,850
this is Maggie Lockwood.

100
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,020
You're the nurse,

101
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,020
that's the nurse...

102
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,020
That's, uh...

103
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,900
You're the nurse

104
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,900
from last year.

105
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,890
Okay. We'll give you

106
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,890
some time, Lieutenant.

107
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,930
Again, I'm very sorry.

108
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,580
I am gonna be right back.

109
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,880
Dr. Choi, can I talk

110
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,880
to you for a minute?

111
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,660
Given the history

112
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,660
between your nurse

113
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,200
and Officer Windham,

114
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,200
we have a problem.

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,190
It's hard enough

116
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,190
on the Lieutenant.

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,190
He doesn't need this.

118
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,430
Maggie's a pro.

119
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,430
She'll do her job.

120
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,270
Doctor, if you're

121
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,270
not gonna handle this,

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,270
I'm gonna go

123
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,270
over your head.

124
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,380
I understand

125
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,380
you're taking care

126
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,380
of your own,

127
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,700
but I need to do

128
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,700
the same.

129
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,980
I'll talk with

130
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,980
Ms. Goodwin.

131
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,250
Hey. So, why'd Maggie

132
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,250
get arrested? What happened?

133
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,790
The charge was

134
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,790
interfering with

135
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,790
a police investigation.

136
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,660
But Maggie was

137
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,660
protecting a patient.

138
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,130
In my opinion,

139
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,130
Officer Windham

140
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,130
overreacted.

141
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
Hmm.

142
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,390
Dr. Manning, you set

143
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,390
for the Morbidity and

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,390
Mortality Conference?

145
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,030
I am, Doc...

146
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,030
Good. See you there.

147
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,040
Remember, M&M is non-punitive.

148
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,040
It's a learning experience.

149
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,660
Okay.

150
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,660
Dr. Halstead?

151
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,170
Yes?

152
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,170
I expect to see you

153
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,170
there too.

154
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,500
As her attending physician,

155
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,310
you are ultimately responsible

156
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,310
for Dr. Manning's actions.

157
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,670
Right.

158
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,950
I am so sorry to put you

159
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,950
in this position.

160
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,990
Oh, I'm not concerned.

161
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,990
You did everything right.

162
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,910
Except my patient died.

163
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,260
Natalie, hey,

164
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,260
you're being too

165
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,260
hard on yourself.

166
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,020
You know, sometimes

167
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,020
things just don't break

168
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,020
the way we want them too.

169
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,360
If you need backup,

170
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,360
I'm available.

171
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,030
Thanks, um,

172
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,030
but I've got it covered.

173
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,760
Med students

174
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,760
don't present, Clarke.

175
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,760
Doctors only.

176
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,140
I knew it.

177
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,270
Sawfly larva.

178
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,400
Hmm?

179
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,310
I ate half of that apple

180
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,720
before I saw it

181
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,720
crawling out of the core.

182
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,880
That's nice.

183
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,380
Nice?

184
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,350
Sarah, what is

185
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,350
the matter with you?

186
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,690
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

187
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,690
I didn't get any sleep

188
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,690
last night.

189
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,420
This neurology rotation

190
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,420
I'm doing,

191
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,560
Dr. Abrams had me pull

192
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,560
a second shift.

193
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,970
Tell Abrams that residents

194
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,970
aren't supposed to work more

195
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,970
than a 12-hour shift.

196
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,470
Well, yeah,

197
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,470
you tell him. I gotta go.

198
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,530
Here.

199
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,400
I have something.

200
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,640
What is that?

201
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,640
Espresso beans.

202
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,580
Robusta from Brazil.

203
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,580
Highest concentration

204
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,580
of caffeine.

205
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,750
Take five every hour.

206
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,750
Chew thoroughly.

207
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,180
Really?

208
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,180
Yeah.

209
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,250
Thanks.

210
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,750
Hey.

211
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,300
Abnormal heart tones?

212
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,370
No. Heart rate is 150.

213
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,140
Strong and steady.

214
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,800
How do

215
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,800
the measurements look?

216
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,030
Give me a second.

217
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,480
Crown-to-chin

218
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,480
length measurement

219
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,480
is 30.9 millimeters.

220
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,380
Well within

221
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,380
the normal parameters.

222
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,620
So, the TB meds...

223
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,820
Don't seem to be

224
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,820
causing any problems.

225
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,820
That's great news.

226
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,020
You were right.

227
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,320
I'll see you

228
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,320
back downstairs.

229
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,530
No. The heart recipient

230
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,530
has already been notified.

231
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,540
I need an echo,

232
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,540
bronchoscopy, liver biopsy,

233
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,400
standard chest X-ray,

234
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,400
and chest CT.

235
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,000
Send the results to me,

236
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,000
and I'll forward it

237
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,000
to the transplant team.

238
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,400
Yep. Thank you.

239
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,010
Maggie, I heard about

240
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,010
Officer Windham's accident.

241
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,610
Yeah.

242
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,610
I think it's best

243
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,810
we let April be

244
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,810
the liaison on this one.

245
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,720
No worries. I'm already

246
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,720
into it with the labs.

247
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,510
Even so, I know what

248
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,510
a hard time you had

249
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,510
with the arrest.

250
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,220
Why stir up all

251
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,220
those feelings?

252
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,450
I don't need coddling.

253
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,450
I can do my job.

254
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,960
Maggie, we need to consider

255
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,960
the patient's family as well.

256
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,690
I think it's better

257
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,690
for all concerned that

258
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,690
we get in front of this.

259
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,030
It's too loaded.

260
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,330
You're taking me off?

261
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,330
Sharon, come on.

262
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,600
Let April handle it.

263
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,450
Mr. Koslow,

264
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,450
I'm Dr. Halstead.

265
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,420
You were brought

266
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,420
in unconscious.

267
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,420
What happened?

268
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,750
Uh, I'm laying here

269
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,750
practically naked, Doc.

270
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,280
You could call me Felix.

271
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,980
Uh...

272
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,150
Last thing I remember,

273
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,150
I was coming back from a run

274
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,690
feeling a little lightheaded.

275
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,360
Well, according to

276
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,360
the paramedics, you were

277
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,360
passed out in the bathroom.

278
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,960
Yeah. But I'm fine.

279
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,530
And I can't stay here.

280
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,130
I'm a jockey.

281
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,430
Just been busting my ass

282
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,430
getting ready for a race

283
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,430
at Santa Anita tomorrow,

284
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,870
so I must have

285
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,870
just overdone it.

286
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,700
Ever happen before?

287
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,700
Never.

288
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,810
I really don't

289
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,810
need to be here.

290
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,810
Tell me if this hurts.

291
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,210
Ow! Ow! Ah.

292
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,310
Just kidding.

293
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,450
When I was a kid, my dad

294
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,450
used to take me down to

295
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,450
the racetracks at Hawthorne.

296
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,420
The man never

297
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,420
picked a winner.

298
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,650
Most kids dream about playing

299
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,650
in the World Series.

300
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,530
For me, it's all about

301
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,530
the Kentucky Derby.

302
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,360
Took years of riding

303
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,360
at BS tracks to get over

304
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,360
to Churchill Downs.

305
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,060
Been working

306
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,060
my way up there,

307
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,330
but, you know, in the winter

308
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,330
the track closes down,

309
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,670
so I've been picking up

310
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,670
mounts on the West...

311
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,470
West Coast.

312
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,470
Uh-huh.

313
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,470
Open wide for me.

314
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,410
Very possible this is just

315
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,410
a bout of overtraining.

316
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,670
You say

317
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,670
you're feeling fine.

318
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,670
You sure?

319
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,620
Hmm. A little weak,

320
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,620
but nothing

321
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,620
that's gonna stop me.

322
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,490
I'm on

323
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,490
a great horse tomorrow.

324
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,380
Well, let's make sure

325
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,380
you're fit to mount up.

326
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,120
I'm ordering

327
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,120
an EKG and an echo

328
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,120
to check your heart.

329
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,090
I'm still waiting

330
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,090
on those lab results,

331
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,090
so for now, sit tight.

332
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,360
Dr. Manning!

333
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,830
Brett, talk to me.

334
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,460
Car crash.

335
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,460
44-year-old female.

336
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,460
GCS 14.

337
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,230
Large laceration

338
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,230
to the head.

339
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,230
Pale and sweaty.

340
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,300
LVAD keeps alarming.

341
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,770
Page Dr. Rhodes

342
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,770
and let him know we got

343
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,770
an LVAD down here.

344
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,870
Bria, honey?

345
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,870
Copy.

346
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,140
You go to Trauma 1,

347
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,140
Dr. Manning.

348
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,140
Got it.

349
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,440
Court.

350
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,440
17-year-old female.

351
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,440
GCS 15.

352
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,750
No LOC. Vitals are stable.

353
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,750
Hands and feet moving.

354
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,010
Complaining of

355
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,010
neck pain.

356
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,020
Bria!

357
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,020
Mom?

358
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,460
Dr. Choi,

359
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,460
you're going to Trauma Two.

360
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,460
Copy.

361
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,530
Bria! Baby!

362
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,030
Mom!

363
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,030
Here we go.

364
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,530
On my count.

365
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,530
One, two, three.

366
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,890
Okay, let's transfer

367
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,890
on my count. Ready?

368
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,890
One, two, three.

369
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,500
Where's my mom?

370
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,600
Easy, easy.

371
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,600
Eyes on me.

372
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,570
She is right next door.

373
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,570
You're gonna see

374
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,570
her real soon, okay?

375
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,970
She has a bad heart.

376
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,310
They called.

377
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,310
We were coming in

378
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,310
for a transplant.

379
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,870
Okay. Heart surgeon's

380
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,870
on his way down.

381
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,070
Can you tell us

382
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,070
what hurts?

383
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,810
My neck. It snapped back

384
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,810
after the airbag hit me.

385
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,680
I got a call saying

386
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,680
a heart's available,

387
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,680
said to get here.

388
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,650
Guy ran a red light.

389
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,890
Where's my daughter?

390
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,860
She is in good hands.

391
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,860
Right now we need

392
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,860
to worry about you, okay?

393
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,990
Let's get her

394
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,990
hooked up

395
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,990
to the monitor

396
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,090
and rapidly transfuse

397
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,090
two packed red blood

398
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,090
cells and two plasma.

399
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,860
Then get X-rays

400
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,860
of her chest

401
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,860
and pelvis, okay?

402
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,960
Okay.

403
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,060
All right, I'm gonna

404
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,060
take this off now, okay?

405
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,840
I tried to swerve,

406
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,840
but I was going too fast.

407
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,840
Ow! It really hurts!

408
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,380
We're gonna give you

409
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,380
something for the pain.

410
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,810
Then we need

411
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,810
to make sure you don't

412
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,810
have any fractures, okay?

413
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,540
Let's get a CT of her

414
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,540
neck and thoracic spine

415
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,640
and 0.2 milligrams

416
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,640
of hydromorphone.

417
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,640
Got it.

418
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,110
All right, let's give her

419
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,110
50 mics fentanyl IV push.

420
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,350
No. No.

421
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,350
I'm a recovering alcoholic.

422
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,020
Meghan?

423
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,020
Dr. Rhodes.

424
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,250
I made it.

425
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,250
I'm ready for the transplant.

426
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,130
Okay, you just try

427
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,130
to stay calm, okay?

428
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,260
We're gonna

429
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,260
figure this out.

430
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,630
She's having suction events.

431
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,630
She's still hypovolemic.

432
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,890
Let's up her volume.

433
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,890
Okay.

434
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,370
I need to close up

435
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,370
this head wound.

436
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,030
Can you check her LVAD?

437
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,030
Yeah. You got it.

438
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,460
Skin stapler?

439
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,460
Right away.

440
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,460
Here you go.

441
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,730
Argh!

442
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,780
Where's Bria?

443
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,870
Where's my baby?

444
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,870
We're gonna take care

445
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,870
of her, all right?

446
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,720
Let's get some

447
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,720
pressure on this.

448
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,720
Yes, Doctor.

449
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,090
I'm... I'm okay.

450
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,090
I got a hard head.

451
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,710
You just relax.

452
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,020
What happened?

453
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,020
Auto accident.

454
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,400
How bad is it?

455
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,400
We've got a donor

456
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,400
heart in Baghdad.

457
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,390
She needs to be able

458
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,390
to tolerate the surgery.

459
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,430
I'm hoping

460
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,430
the head wound is

461
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,430
just superficial.

462
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,270
We won't know anything

463
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,270
until she gets a CT.

464
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,270
We're headed up there now.

465
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,570
All right, well, keep

466
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,570
your fingers crossed.

467
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,440
She's got better odds

468
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,440
of hitting the lottery

469
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,940
than she does

470
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,940
of matching to another

471
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,940
heart before it's too late.

472
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,100
Yeah.

473
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,580
Lieutenant Windham?

474
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,790
Yeah.

475
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,790
Hi. I'm April.

476
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,380
I'm very sorry

477
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,380
for your loss.

478
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,520
Yep.

479
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,120
I'll be handling

480
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,120
your wife's care.

481
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,630
I thought it was the, uh...

482
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,630
It was the other nurse.

483
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,770
I'm coordinating with

484
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,770
the transplant teams today.

485
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,070
Your wife's organs

486
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,070
are in the process

487
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,540
of being matched

488
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,540
to people in need.

489
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,980
Once that's complete,

490
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,980
we'll go ahead

491
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,980
and schedule surgery.

492
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,670
You're free to stay with her

493
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,670
throughout the process.

494
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,520
And tell me, how many

495
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,520
people will she save?

496
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,490
That depends

497
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,490
on the organ

498
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,490
evaluation results,

499
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,430
but she could

500
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,430
potentially save

501
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,430
seven, eight lives.

502
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,430
We've already found

503
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,430
a match for her heart.

504
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,570
That's Kate.

505
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,960
Always going

506
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,960
above and beyond.

507
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,240
I'm here for you

508
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,240
every step of the way.

509
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,340
Please don't hesitate

510
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,340
to reach out

511
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,240
should you have

512
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,240
any questions

513
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,240
or need anything.

514
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,980
Thank you.

515
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,580
Thank you.

516
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,180
Hey. When you call the lab,

517
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,180
make sure you deal with Sue.

518
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,620
She gets the blood

519
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,620
and tissue samples

520
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,420
analyzed faster

521
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,420
than anybody else.

522
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,420
All right.

523
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,400
And once they match

524
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,400
the other organs,

525
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,400
make sure that you...

526
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,020
Maggie, I know

527
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,020
how to do this.

528
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm sorry if you feel

529
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,520
like I'm stepping

530
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,520
on your toes.

531
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,300
You're not stepping

532
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,300
on my toes. It's just...

533
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,010
It's my responsibility.

534
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,280
Meghan, we got

535
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,280
your test results.

536
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,910
Your CT scan looks fine.

537
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,650
Then I'm okay to have

538
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,650
the surgery, right?

539
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,190
Unfortunately,

540
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,190
there's another problem.

541
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,250
We do a tox screen

542
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,250
as part of your

543
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,250
pre-op workup.

544
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,330
Your blood alcohol

545
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,330
content came back 0.06.

546
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,170
No. It can't...

547
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,170
That's a mistake.

548
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,730
I... I told her not to,

549
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,570
but that doctor

550
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,570
must have given me

551
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,570
pain medication.

552
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,140
Pain medication

553
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,140
would have no effect on

554
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,140
the blood alcohol levels.

555
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,370
Check it again.

556
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,580
I'm sorry.

557
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,240
I screwed up.

558
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,390
Can you explain

559
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,390
your actions?

560
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,690
Margaret Brazetti.

561
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,920
She's my age. Three kids.

562
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,920
Been on the transplant list

563
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,920
two years.

564
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,960
Met in a support group.

565
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,000
Was always positive.

566
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,000
Always laughing.

567
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,130
And she got me through

568
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,130
some really hard days.

569
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,500
She died this morning.

570
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,010
I slipped.

571
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,070
Two shots.

572
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,610
First time

573
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,610
in three years.

574
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,510
Then I got the call

575
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,510
about the heart.

576
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,180
I asked Bria to take me.

577
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,620
If I hadn't asked her,

578
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,620
she wouldn't be hurt.

579
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,860
The asking wasn't

580
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,860
the problem.

581
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,860
The drinking was.

582
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,700
Does this mean

583
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,700
I don't get the heart?

584
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,470
That's the committee's

585
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,470
decision.

586
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,470
You should try

587
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,470
and get some rest.

588
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,720
Rest?

589
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,980
Is Bria, um,

590
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,980
back from her CT?

591
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,550
We'll have somebody check.

592
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,190
As I recall,

593
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,190
you vouched for her.

594
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,090
I did.

595
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,320
Quite an

596
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,320
unfortunate choice.

597
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,670
All the other

598
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,670
matches are in?

599
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,470
Yeah. Got teams

600
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,470
flying in from Wisconsin,

601
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,470
St. Louis, and Des Moines.

602
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,740
April, is it possible

603
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,740
for some of us

604
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,050
to be in the OR

605
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,050
with Darryl during

606
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,050
the procedure?

607
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,310
He could use

608
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,310
the support.

609
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,250
I will have to talk

610
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,250
to the surgical charge nurse,

611
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,910
but I'm sure we can

612
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,910
work something out.

613
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,980
Thanks.

614
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,280
Excuse me.

615
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,950
Excuse me.

616
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,380
Um...

617
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,360
I was the one who

618
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,360
asked for someone else

619
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,360
to take charge of this.

620
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,260
It really

621
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,260
wasn't personal.

622
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,230
I was just thinking

623
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,230
of the Lieutenant.

624
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,230
You understand?

625
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,740
No.

626
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,740
Everything's good.

627
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,070
Uh, flying out at 9:00.

628
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,110
Yeah. I'll see you

629
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,110
first thing for

630
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,110
the morning workout.

631
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,770
Yeah.

632
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,520
Got your labs back

633
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,520
and the results

634
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,520
of your echo.

635
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,160
Yeah. I'm sure nothing's

636
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,160
wrong with me that these

637
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,160
bags of fluid haven't fixed.

638
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,620
Well, you're dehydrated.

639
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,620
It will help with that.

640
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,500
Felix, your creatinine

641
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,500
and sodium are high,

642
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,500
and your potassium is low,

643
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,240
and I noticed enamel erosion

644
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,240
around some of your teeth.

645
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
Now, all these are

646
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
indicators of bulimia.

647
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,240
Bulimia is

648
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,240
something girls get.

649
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,940
Well, actually, a third

650
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,940
of those suffering from

651
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,940
bulimia are men.

652
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,540
Eating disorders are

653
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,540
not specific to women,

654
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,180
and you should know

655
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,180
they're treatable.

656
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,520
I don't have

657
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,520
an eating disorder.

658
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,910
I've got a job that

659
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,910
requires me to make weight

660
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,910
or I don't get to ride.

661
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,790
All jockeys flip.

662
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,490
Flip?

663
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,490
Yeah. Stick our fingers

664
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,490
down our throat.

665
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,930
If that ain't enough,

666
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,930
some guys sit in

667
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,930
the hot box and sweat it out.

668
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,300
Some down laxatives.

669
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,930
I take diuretics.

670
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,500
Because of the purging

671
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,500
and diuretics,

672
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,900
you're considerably

673
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,900
underweight,

674
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,140
which has caused

675
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,140
a mitral valve prolapse.

676
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,280
Meaning the valve

677
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,280
in your heart

678
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,280
has become floppy.

679
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,540
And it's treatable.

680
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,050
I'd like to put a tube

681
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,050
through your nose

682
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,050
into your stomach

683
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,310
to feed you calories.

684
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,950
Now, over time,

685
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,950
this may reverse the MVP

686
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,950
and fatten up your heart.

687
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,280
What happens if I don't?

688
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,280
Is it gonna kill me?

689
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
With your lifestyle,

690
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
you are putting yourself

691
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,690
at a much greater

692
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,690
risk of infection,

693
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,490
cardiac arrhythmia,

694
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,490
or even heart failure.

695
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,260
I've been riding

696
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,260
Executive Chef

697
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,260
for a year.

698
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,890
That's four wins

699
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,890
and a place.

700
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,290
I am one ride away

701
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,290
from that derby mount.

702
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,300
Felix...

703
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,300
No, I'm finishing

704
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,300
this fluid

705
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,360
and I'm getting

706
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,360
the hell out of here.

707
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
We have a pre-op consult

708
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
upstairs in six minutes.

709
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,840
Dr. Reese, Dr. Abrams.

710
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,840
How's it going?

711
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,710
I need to break her of

712
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,710
all your bad habits.

713
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,210
I've found my most

714
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,210
successful residents

715
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,040
happily volunteer

716
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,040
to work well past

717
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,040
the standard 80-hour week.

718
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,050
Dr. Charles.

719
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,830
Meghan Scott,

720
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,830
my transplant patient

721
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,830
you evaluated.

722
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,020
Yeah.

723
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,760
Turns out that

724
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,760
you were right about her.

725
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,830
She fell off the wagon.

726
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,690
Really?

727
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,730
I'm very sorry

728
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,730
to hear that.

729
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,770
The way I put you on the spot

730
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,770
about your decision,

731
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,770
I owe you an apology.

732
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,840
No, you don't.

733
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,080
I appreciate

734
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,080
the gesture,

735
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,080
but my evaluation...

736
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,150
I vetted her.

737
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,150
It was my call.

738
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,910
I should, um...

739
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,890
I should probably

740
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,890
check in with her.

741
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,020
The, uh, Transplant

742
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,020
Committee's gonna want

743
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,020
another assessment.

744
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,090
If you'll excuse me,

745
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,090
I've got to get to the M&M.

746
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,930
Yes. Thank you

747
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,930
for telling me.

748
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,930
Of course.

749
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,250
The patient became unstable

750
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,250
due to an unrecognized

751
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,250
pericardial effusion,

752
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,580
which was stabilized

753
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,580
by emergent

754
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,580
pericardiocentesis.

755
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,020
You presented the images

756
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,020
of the MRCP demonstrating

757
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,020
cholelithiasis

758
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,990
to support your diagnosis

759
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,990
of pancreatitis

760
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,990
due to choledocholithiasis,

761
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,730
but you aren't showing us

762
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,730
any images of the lung

763
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,730
bases or heart.

764
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,100
Those images

765
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,100
were not obtained.

766
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,860
Why not?

767
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,940
The patient's movement

768
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,940
resulted

769
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,940
in unreadable images.

770
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,440
Why didn't you

771
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,440
repeat the scan?

772
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,070
The study captured

773
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,070
adequate detail within

774
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,070
the area of interest.

775
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,140
So, had you been

776
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,140
more vigilant

777
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,140
at this juncture,

778
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,880
perhaps you would have

779
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,880
identified this patient's

780
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,880
pericardial effusion

781
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,250
and avoided his subsequent

782
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,250
cardiovascular collapse.

783
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,420
In hindsight, yes.

784
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,890
At the time, I believed

785
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,890
I had what I needed.

786
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,460
Let's move on.

787
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,470
You mentioned placing

788
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,470
the patient on BiPAP,

789
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,830
which exacerbated

790
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,830
cardiac tamponade.

791
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,800
How did you respond?

792
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,230
How are you feeling?

793
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,940
Like I screwed up

794
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,940
two lives.

795
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,080
Let's get you

796
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,080
two together.

797
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,120
I'll have

798
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,120
this dividing wall

799
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,120
opened up.

800
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,590
How is she?

801
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,590
Is her neck okay?

802
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,850
Good news is there

803
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,850
are no fractures.

804
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,990
Okay. What's the bad?

805
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,060
It's not necessarily bad.

806
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,060
It might be minor,

807
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,100
but Bria's CT showed

808
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,100
a mass in her upper

809
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,100
thoracic spine,

810
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,460
unrelated to

811
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,460
the accident.

812
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,200
Oh, God.

813
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,200
A mass means tumor, right?

814
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,700
It could be

815
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,700
a number of things.

816
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,070
My poor baby.

817
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,300
She's had some back pain

818
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,300
in the last few months.

819
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,410
She tried

820
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,410
to convince me

821
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,410
it was nothing.

822
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,380
I should've

823
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,380
brought her in.

824
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,380
This is my fault.

825
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,450
Meghan, until

826
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,450
we do an MRI

827
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,120
to get a better look

828
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,120
at what

829
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,120
we're dealing with,

830
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
the best thing

831
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
you could do is

832
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
try to stay calm.

833
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,000
Son of a bitch!

834
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,370
I need this

835
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,370
damn thing out!

836
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,610
Mr. Koslow, please,

837
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,610
you need to calm down.

838
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,810
And you need to take

839
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,810
this out of my arm.

840
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,810
I'm two pounds over.

841
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,510
Hey, hey, hey.

842
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,510
It's just water weight.

843
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,310
That IV is the only reason

844
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,310
you're feeling stronger.

845
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,380
You need to leave it in.

846
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,450
You know, screw this.

847
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,450
You're not gonna do it,

848
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,290
I'll pull it out myself.

849
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,290
No, no, no.

850
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,290
Please don't do that.

851
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,660
Okay. Fine. That's what

852
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,660
you want, let's get you

853
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,660
back to your room...

854
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,590
Hell, no!

855
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,590
You're gonna try to

856
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,590
give me something.

857
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,100
I'm done with this crap!

858
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,100
No! Mister...

859
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,500
Get off of...

860
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,500
Hey.

861
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,430
Now you're bleeding.

862
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,430
I'm fine.

863
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,560
Okay. This is why

864
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,560
you need to be treated.

865
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,140
I did that, and now

866
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,140
I'm too fat to ride.

867
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,370
You cannot take

868
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,370
diuretics again.

869
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,070
You are playing

870
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,070
Russian roulette.

871
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,050
There are only so many times

872
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,050
you can pull that trigger.

873
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,480
Let me go, now!

874
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,370
Mom, I'm fine!

875
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,030
Oh, it's just a blanket.

876
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,330
I don't need it.

877
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,330
Everything okay?

878
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,030
Oh, she just

879
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,030
seemed cold.

880
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,030
And you shouldn't be up.

881
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,540
Can I help you

882
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,540
back into bed?

883
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,380
Dr. Reese?

884
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm doing a rotation

885
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,700
in neurocritical care.

886
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,750
The mass we found

887
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,750
is not a tumor.

888
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,250
Oh, thank God.

889
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,010
It's a spinal AVM,

890
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,150
which is

891
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,150
an abnormal tangle

892
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,150
of blood vessels.

893
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,850
Is it serious?

894
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,820
Bria's probably had it

895
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,820
since she was born.

896
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,160
Quite often, we don't

897
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,160
find it until it starts

898
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,160
causing problems.

899
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,960
What kind of problems?

900
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,990
Down the line, uh,

901
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,990
numbness, hemorrhage,

902
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,990
even paralysis.

903
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,570
So, the back pain

904
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,570
was a sign.

905
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,800
We could've caught

906
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,800
this months ago.

907
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,940
Let's focus on the fact

908
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,940
that we caught it now.

909
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,170
It can be treated

910
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,170
surgically.

911
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,440
Dr. Reese will do

912
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,440
a neurosurgery consult

913
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,440
with you,

914
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,170
and then our head

915
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,170
of neurosurgery,

916
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,170
Dr. Abrams,

917
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,440
will come down

918
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,440
and go over the details.

919
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,650
I'm so sorry, Bria.

920
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,050
Stop it.

921
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,050
It's not your fault.

922
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,280
No. I wasn't thinking

923
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,280
about you.

924
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,950
I was only thinking

925
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,950
about myself.

926
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,460
Having an AVM

927
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,460
is unfortunate,

928
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:25,060
but finding it now,

929
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:25,060
as early as we have,

930
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:25,060
is the best we could ask for.

931
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,600
Dr. Manning then

932
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,600
paged me to perform

933
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,600
a pericardiocentesis.

934
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,610
Did you recommend sending

935
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,610
the fluid for analysis

936
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,650
and obtaining a CT chest,

937
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,650
abdomen, and pelvis?

938
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,940
I did.

939
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,960
The CT showed a large mass

940
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,960
in the right middle lobe

941
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,720
with bulky hilar

942
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,720
and mediastinal

943
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,720
lymphadenopathy.

944
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,500
And that's when

945
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,500
Dr. Manning called

946
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,500
for an oncology consult?

947
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,520
Yes. And their recommendation

948
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,520
was chemotherapy.

949
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,260
Dr. Rhodes?

950
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,130
I recommended

951
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,130
an alternative

952
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,130
course of therapy.

953
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,810
Since the primary

954
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,810
mass was resectable,

955
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,200
I thought it best

956
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,200
to move forward with

957
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,200
surgery without delay.

958
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,030
And Dr. Manning disagreed?

959
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,040
I felt the radiation

960
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,040
would give the pancreatitis

961
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,040
time to cool down.

962
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,850
What was his

963
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,850
Ranson's score?

964
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,810
It was...

965
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,810
What difference

966
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,810
does that make?

967
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,320
There's no reliable way

968
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,320
to predict

969
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,320
tumor lysis syndrome.

970
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,860
Dr. Manning,

971
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,860
if your white knight

972
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,990
plans on continuing

973
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,990
his medical education

974
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,990
at this hospital,

975
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,560
I recommend that you

976
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,560
advise him to remove

977
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,560
himself from my presence.

978
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,700
Let's take

979
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,700
a five-minute break.

980
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,880
How dare you?

981
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,320
I know.

982
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,320
I shouldn't have said...

983
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,080
I am not a damsel in

984
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,080
distress, and I do not

985
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,080
need you to defend me.

986
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,620
I was only trying to help.

987
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,620
You humiliated me in there.

988
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,290
Natalie, I'm sorry.

989
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,070
If he gets on that horse,

990
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,070
he's not only a danger

991
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,070
to himself,

992
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,060
but every other jockey

993
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,060
in the race.

994
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,540
I don't disagree.

995
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,570
Can we keep him

996
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,570
on a psych hold?

997
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,910
No, we can't. I mean,

998
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,910
from everything you told me,

999
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,210
his stated intention

1000
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,210
is to win the race.

1001
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,980
He didn't say anything

1002
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,980
about doing intentional harm.

1003
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,610
And if we do hold him,

1004
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,380
he'd probably

1005
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,380
sue the hospital

1006
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,380
and you personally.

1007
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,250
If you can't

1008
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,250
convince him

1009
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,250
to stay,

1010
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,920
get him to sign

1011
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,920
that he's leaving

1012
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,920
against medical advice.

1013
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,720
Oh, he's already asked

1014
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,720
for the paperwork.

1015
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,500
Then it's settled.

1016
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,000
Damn it!

1017
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,870
That ultrasound

1018
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,870
was a huge relief.

1019
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,870
Yeah.

1020
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,440
So, now that we know

1021
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,440
everything's okay,

1022
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,210
there's something

1023
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,210
I'm hoping

1024
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,210
you'll consider.

1025
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,410
For the baby's sake.

1026
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,810
Maybe it would be good

1027
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,810
if you stopped working

1028
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,810
for a while.

1029
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,160
Just until the kid is born.

1030
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,160
I know how you feel

1031
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,160
about your job.

1032
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,910
I'm not asking you

1033
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,910
to give that up.

1034
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,450
But a few months could help

1035
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,450
to take away some stress.

1036
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,200
If it was up to you,

1037
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,200
there wouldn't even

1038
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,200
be a baby.

1039
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,030
April, I told you

1040
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,030
I'm sorry.

1041
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,390
The only reason I wanted

1042
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,390
to consider terminating

1043
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,530
was I thought

1044
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,530
the baby would have

1045
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,530
no quality of life.

1046
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,600
I didn't want

1047
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,600
to put you...

1048
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,740
Us through that.

1049
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,270
My job's not endangering

1050
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,270
the pregnancy.

1051
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,100
The second I feel like work

1052
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,100
is negatively affecting me,

1053
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,310
I'll stop.

1054
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,020
For now, I'm fine.

1055
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,250
We are fine.

1056
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,080
So, Dr. Charles,

1057
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,080
you assessed

1058
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,080
Meghan Scott today.

1059
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,890
Yes, I did...

1060
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,890
I don't understand

1061
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,890
why we're debating this.

1062
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,830
An alcoholic must be

1063
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,830
sober for 18 months

1064
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,660
before being eligible

1065
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,660
for transplant.

1066
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,400
Those are the rules.

1067
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,400
This patient

1068
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,400
disqualified herself.

1069
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,870
Dr. Latham,

1070
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,870
right now in the hospital,

1071
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,440
we have an excellent match

1072
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,440
for a heart,

1073
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,470
an organ which you know

1074
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,470
has a limited window

1075
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,470
of viability.

1076
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,750
We may have to think

1077
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,750
beyond the rules.

1078
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,840
What stops her from drinking

1079
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,840
the next time she gets upset?

1080
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,150
Ironically,

1081
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,150
relapse can be a very

1082
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,150
important part of recovery.

1083
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,520
Happens to most addicts

1084
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,520
at some point

1085
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,720
and it's very often

1086
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,720
the utter misery

1087
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,720
of falling off the wagon

1088
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,350
that motivates

1089
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,350
those that suffer

1090
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,060
to finally get serious

1091
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,060
about staying sober.

1092
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,100
And you believe this is

1093
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,100
the case for Ms. Scott?

1094
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,900
I also think

1095
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,900
it's been a very real

1096
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,900
wake-up call for her.

1097
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,670
Until the accident,

1098
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,670
Bria was performing

1099
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,670
the caretaker role,

1100
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,300
but now Meghan realizes

1101
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,300
the importance of stepping up

1102
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,300
and taking responsibility,

1103
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,780
not just for herself

1104
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,780
but also for her daughter.

1105
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,510
So, bottom line,

1106
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,010
are you saying the committee

1107
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,010
should give Ms. Scott

1108
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,380
the currently

1109
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,380
available heart?

1110
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,420
As a human being,

1111
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,420
I would love

1112
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,420
to root for Meghan.

1113
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,260
As a doctor,

1114
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,260
I'm just more

1115
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,260
aware than ever

1116
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,170
of the power that

1117
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,170
this disease can have

1118
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,170
over somebody.

1119
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,030
Dr. Rhodes?

1120
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,440
Uh, I was confident

1121
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,440
when I pushed for Meghan

1122
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,440
to be put on the list.

1123
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,350
Regretfully,

1124
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,350
I am less confident now.

1125
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,320
If there are

1126
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,320
no more questions,

1127
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,220
I move the committee

1128
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,220
take a vote.

1129
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,650
All those in favor

1130
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,650
of Meghan Scott

1131
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,650
receiving the heart,

1132
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,660
signify with a "yea."

1133
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,490
Yea.

1134
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,130
All those against,

1135
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,130
signify with a "nay."

1136
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,730
Nay.

1137
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,730
Nay.

1138
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,440
The nays have it.

1139
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,040
We'll look for

1140
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,040
another recipient.

1141
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,460
You remain conflicted

1142
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,460
about Meghan Scott

1143
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,470
despite her breaking

1144
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,470
the clearly defined rules

1145
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,870
for being

1146
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,870
a transplant candidate.

1147
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,430
Yes.

1148
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,430
I... I remain conflicted.

1149
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,630
I've worked with

1150
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,630
a lot of alcoholics,

1151
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,510
and I know real regret

1152
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,510
when I see it.

1153
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,800
Real regret?

1154
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,420
Can you elaborate?

1155
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,420
What exactly did

1156
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,420
you see in Ms. Scott?

1157
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,550
Well, I saw real sadness.

1158
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,850
You know, there were tears

1159
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,850
rolling down her face,

1160
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,490
and, um, her jaw

1161
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,490
was clenched, you know,

1162
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,460
and her body sort of drooped

1163
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,460
with what looked like shame.

1164
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,810
That's interesting.

1165
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,940
Are you sure you're

1166
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,940
gonna be all right?

1167
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,280
Sweetie, you need to

1168
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,280
stop worrying about me.

1169
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,360
All I want you

1170
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,360
to think about is

1171
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,360
how much I love you.

1172
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,860
And when you wake up,

1173
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,860
I'll be right there, okay?

1174
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,390
I love you, baby.

1175
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,390
I love you, too.

1176
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,930
Please let her

1177
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,930
be all right.

1178
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,150
While debatable

1179
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,150
choices were made

1180
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,150
by all involved,

1181
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,840
no one physician

1182
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,840
is to blame.

1183
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,890
My recommendation is

1184
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,890
to revisit hospital policy

1185
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,850
on requiring doctors

1186
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,850
to be present when

1187
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,850
radiation is administered.

1188
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,020
Only with more

1189
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,020
skilled eyes on the ECG

1190
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,560
can future incidents of TLS

1191
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,560
be identified and treated.

1192
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,900
Hope you've all learned

1193
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,900
something here today

1194
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,700
that will make

1195
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,700
you better physicians.

1196
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,260
On a personal note,

1197
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,780
it's ill-advised

1198
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,780
for residents to date

1199
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,780
medical students.

1200
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,450
Uh-huh.

1201
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,560
Is there something that

1202
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,560
I can help you with?

1203
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,320
Yeah. I was looking

1204
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,320
for April.

1205
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,990
She's on a break

1206
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,990
right now.

1207
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,530
But I can answer

1208
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,530
any question

1209
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,530
you might have.

1210
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,560
Yeah. Uh, my wife, Kate,

1211
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,560
has this necklace,

1212
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,600
and, uh, I think it was

1213
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,600
a gift from her mother.

1214
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,200
And, you know, anyways,

1215
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,200
she always wears it,

1216
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,010
but the clasp broke,

1217
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,010
uh, during the accident.

1218
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,210
And I know she'd want

1219
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,210
to have it with her.

1220
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,210
I just...

1221
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,250
I understand.

1222
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,250
It can be in her hand

1223
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,250
through the surgery.

1224
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,160
I can make sure

1225
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,160
April gets it.

1226
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,920
We can put them back together,

1227
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,920
but we can't change

1228
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,920
their behavior, right?

1229
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,250
"I'm indeed a king because

1230
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,250
I know how to rule myself."

1231
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,750
Pietro Aretino. He was

1232
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,750
a 16th century poet.

1233
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,350
What are you

1234
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,350
getting at, Doc?

1235
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,900
Well, put it this way,

1236
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,900
in this case,

1237
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,490
the king might be in

1238
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,490
for a rude awakening

1239
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,960
when they drug test him

1240
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,960
before the race.

1241
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,230
Yeah, if he gets tested.

1242
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,230
Testing's random.

1243
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,600
I don't know.

1244
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,440
I mean, somebody could make

1245
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,440
an anonymous phone call,

1246
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,100
you know, tipping off

1247
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,100
the track that, uh,

1248
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,100
he took a diuretic.

1249
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,540
You never know.

1250
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,510
Somebody maybe already did.

1251
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,610
Dr. Charles.

1252
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,610
Those signs that you

1253
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,610
talked about earlier,

1254
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,480
the sadness in the eyes,

1255
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,480
the clenched jaw.

1256
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,410
I don't see them.

1257
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,490
I'd like to know

1258
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,490
why they elude me.

1259
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,750
You know, I might have

1260
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,750
some literature in my office

1261
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,850
that could illuminate

1262
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,850
some of this stuff for you.

1263
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,730
You got

1264
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,730
a couple minutes?

1265
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,160
Mmm-hmm.

1266
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,410
How's Bria?

1267
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,220
Dr. Abrams just started

1268
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,220
cauterizing the AVM.

1269
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,650
He's a really

1270
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,650
good surgeon.

1271
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,360
I just wish

1272
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,360
he wasn't such a dick.

1273
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,930
Keep me posted.

1274
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,930
Mmm-hmm.

1275
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,540
Rough day, huh?

1276
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,540
Yeah.

1277
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,900
Grab a bite?

1278
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,780
I'd like that.

1279
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,980
Dr. Rhodes, Daniel.

1280
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,950
We found another recipient

1281
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,950
for Officer Windham's heart,

1282
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,360
but the woman lives

1283
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,360
in San Diego,

1284
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,130
and that's at least

1285
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,130
a four-hour flight.

1286
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,090
If there were a delay,

1287
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,090
we couldn't guarantee

1288
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,090
the heart's viability,

1289
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,860
and we cannot

1290
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,860
postpone harvesting

1291
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,170
due to the needs

1292
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,170
of the recipients

1293
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,170
of her other organs.

1294
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,300
So, therefore?

1295
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,670
Meghan Scott will

1296
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,670
be receiving Officer

1297
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,670
Windham's heart.

1298
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:13,240
Due to the circumstances,

1299
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:13,240
it's the only option we have.

1300
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,410
I guess dinner

1301
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,410
will have to wait.

1302
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,410
Yeah.

1303
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,420
Sharon?

1304
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,420
Yeah?

1305
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,430
Can we talk?

1306
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,430
Of course.

1307
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,700
That's the form.

1308
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,700
Here, take this.

1309
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
What's up?

1310
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,640
Sharon, I want to take over

1311
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,640
Kate Windham's care.

1312
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,200
Come on, Maggie.

1313
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,540
We've been through this.

1314
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,540
You know my concerns.

1315
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,840
Yes, and I respect them.

1316
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,410
But it's closure for me.

1317
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,120
And in a way for

1318
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,120
Kate Windham, too.

1319
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,190
And what about her husband?

1320
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,190
What about his feelings?

1321
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,730
I promise you,

1322
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,730
I'll make sure

1323
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,730
he feels comfortable.

1324
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,090
I need to do this.

1325
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,360
All right.

1326
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,430
All right.

1327
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,430
I'll talk to April.

1328
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,430
Okay.

1329
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,170
Can I speak

1330
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,170
to you, Lieutenant Windham?

1331
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,150
You good? Okay.

1332
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,850
When I became a nurse,

1333
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,850
I took an oath.

1334
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,350
I swore to devote myself

1335
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,350
to the welfare of those

1336
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,350
committed to my care.

1337
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,450
That's my job.

1338
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,030
When your wife arrested me,

1339
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,030
she was doing her job.

1340
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,890
I bear her no ill will.

1341
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,530
I'm very sorry

1342
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,530
for your loss.

1343
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,880
But I want to

1344
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,880
honor your wife,

1345
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,450
if you'll allow me.

1346
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,440
Yeah.

1347
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,230
No. No.

1348
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,860
Ms. Scott, we need

1349
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,860
to get you upstairs.

1350
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,230
No, I don't care.

1351
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,230
I'm not going anywhere

1352
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,230
until I find out about Bria.

1353
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,000
She's still

1354
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,000
in surgery but doing well.

1355
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,380
Right now, the best thing

1356
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,380
you could do

1357
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,180
for your daughter is

1358
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,180
to take care of yourself.

1359
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,410
We'll be right back

1360
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,410
with someone to

1361
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,410
take her up to the OR.

1362
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,960
Hey.

1363
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,270
You know today wasn't

1364
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,270
a defeat, right?

1365
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,710
I guess.

1366
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,940
The whole experience has

1367
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,940
been a lesson in humility.

1368
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,480
Humility. Always been

1369
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,480
a tough one for me.

1370
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,180
Good night.

1371
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,420
You know, Clarke...

1372
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,350
He was out of line today.

1373
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,490
But he was really

1374
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,490
in your corner.

1375
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,560
Yeah.

1376
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,640
Hey, Jeff!

1377
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,640
You want to get a drink?

1378
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,680
I'll meet you over there.

1379
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,020
Okay.

1380
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,220
A nice move, Daniel.

1381
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,220
Anonymous phone call.

1382
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,960
We do what

1383
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,960
we can, sister.

1384
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,830
Yes, we do.

1385
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,670
So, the M&M.

1386
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,400
Stohl called you

1387
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,400
my white knight.

1388
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,140
I know, Nat,

1389
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,140
and I feel terrible.

1390
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,140
I...

1391
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,110
And I heard what

1392
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,110
he said about dating.

1393
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,010
No, Jeff.

1394
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,010
I can handle that.

1395
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,980
I'm just really sorry.

1396
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,490
It should be me

1397
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,490
apologizing to you.

1398
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,450
Why? I'm the one

1399
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,450
who made everything worse.

1400
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,220
I haven't been

1401
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,220
fair to you.

1402
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,100
Stohl also said that

1403
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,100
he hoped we all learned

1404
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,100
something today.

1405
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,860
And I did.

1406
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,740
When Jeff died,

1407
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,740
it created this void,

1408
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,680
this hole in my life

1409
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,680
and in my heart.

1410
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,560
I needed someone

1411
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,560
to fill that void.

1412
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,460
To take the pain away.

1413
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,660
And there you were.

1414
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,590
I feel like I used you.

1415
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,330
You gave me the illusion

1416
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,330
that my life was

1417
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,330
fixed and whole.

1418
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,440
But it doesn't

1419
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,440
work that way.

1420
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,740
It can, though, Natalie.

1421
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,740
It can work that way.

1422
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,740
And look, I want to be...

1423
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,580
Jeff... I think

1424
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,580
you're a great guy.

1425
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,840
You're just not

1426
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,840
the great guy for me.

1427
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,950
This is it?

1428
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,080
Yeah.

1429
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,700
Dispatch to 2436.

1430
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,290
Dispatch to Officer Windham.

1431
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,140
Dispatch to

1432
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,140
Officer Kate Windham.

1433
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,870
Officer Windham,

1434
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,870
your work here is done.

1435

Officer Kathryn Windham

1447
