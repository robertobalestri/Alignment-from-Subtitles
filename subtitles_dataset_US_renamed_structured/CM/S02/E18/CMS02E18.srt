1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,530
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,460
We're live. NaÃ¯ma?

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,970
Twenty-two-year-old male,

4
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,970
gunshot wound to the abdomen.

5
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,970
GCS 15.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,630
Dr. Choi, GSW!

7
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,630
On it!

8
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,460
BP 100 over 50.

9
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

10
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,460
wait a second. Wait a sec.

11
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,410
Get this one up to surgery.

12
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,410
All right, let's go.

13
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, here we go.

14
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,650
Dr. Choi, you're good?

15
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,650
Good.

16
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,740
All right, Monique,

17
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,250
seven treatment

18
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,250
rooms on the east side,

19
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,950
four trauma bays on the west.

20
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,760
Bays three and four combine

21
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,760
to treat gunshot wounds,

22
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,220
a place affectionately

23
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,220
known as Baghdad.

24
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,390
Four thousand

25
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,390
shootings in Chicago.

26
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,430
Some days, we get a dozen.

27
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,670
Drug dispensers

28
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,670
are in the north

29
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,670
and south end of the ED.

30
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,070
Extra gurneys,

31
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,070
isolations suites

32
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,070
in the ambulance bay.

33
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,980
Uh, band-aid, wound dressings,

34
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,980
gauze, and extra weaponry

35
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,170
are in the supply

36
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,170
closet next to the elevator,

37
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,240
which brings us right here

38
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,240
to the command center.

39
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,090
Deer in the headlights.

40
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,090
Nursling?

41
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,090
Mmm-hmm.

42
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,490
Monique Lawson.

43
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,150
She's got her

44
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,150
Pediatric Advanced

45
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,150
Life Support certification,

46
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,820
and is doing her ED

47
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,820
check-off skills training

48
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,330
with yours truly.

49
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,390
Be careful, she bites.

50
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,260
Monique, Doris, move.

51
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,500
I hardly slept last night.

52
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,300
I couldn't stop thinking.

53
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,930
I mean,

54
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,930
so many people coming in

55
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,930
with horrible injuries.

56
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,500
And this isn't

57
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,500
even a busy day.

58
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,680
I just hope I'm up to it.

59
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,310
Quick, nurses' credo?

60
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,550
"Cure sometimes,

61
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,550
treat often, comfort always."

62
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,750
Uh-uh.

63
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,750
Don't kill your patient.

64
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,680
Because that's

65
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,680
the doctor's job.

66
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,150
I heard that.

67
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,890
Maggie,

68
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,890
what you got for me?

69
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,620
Alzheimer's patient,

70
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,220
here from

71
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,220
long-term care facility.

72
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,320
Hypotensive and high fever,

73
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,320
in Treatment Two.

74
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,830
Any family?

75
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,830
Advance directives?

76
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,030
No, surrogate

77
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,030
just passed away,

78
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,440
and no one else

79
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,440
was designated, so it's

80
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,440
going to be our call.

81
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,870
Okay, and you need to be

82
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,870
initiating catheter duty.

83
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,370
Patient in Treatment Six.

84
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,370
Have a stab at her.

85
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,210
Wait, we need to page Will.

86
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,210
What is it?

87
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,760
This is Bella Rowan,

88
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,760
Dr. Rowan.

89
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,360
She was Will's teacher,

90
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,360
his mentor.

91
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,360
Okay.

92
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,450
Lungs are wet.

93
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,150
Does this hurt,

94
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,150
Dr. Rowan?

95
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay. All right,

96
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,000
all right.

97
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,700
Who are you?

98
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,330
I'm Dr. Halstead.

99
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,330
Oh...

100
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm gonna help

101
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,280
Dr. Manning here

102
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,280
take care of you.

103
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,580
Is that all right?

104
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,580
Oh, good.

105
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,640
Okay.

106
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,340
Gotta... Gotta go.

107
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,750
Why is that?

108
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,750
Miss my bus.

109
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,950
Oh...

110
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,080
Where are you going?

111
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,250
What?

112
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,590
Okay, okay, okay...

113
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,170
Tell you what,

114
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,170
Dr. Rowan...

115
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,370
We promise to do our best

116
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,940
to get you out of here

117
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,940
so you can catch that bus.

118
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,710
How's that sound?

119
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,710
Good.

120
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,040
Good.

121
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,980
All right.

122
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,680
I'll be back to check

123
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,680
on you in a few minutes.

124
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,920
I'm pretty sure she's got

125
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,920
aspiration pneumonia.

126
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,290
Yeah.

127
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,290
You start antibiotics?

128
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,800
Vanc and Zosyn, plus Levophed

129
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,800
to maintain her pressure.

130
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,500
Metabolic panel,

131
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,500
urine analysis,

132
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,160
and blood cultures

133
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,160
are all pending.

134
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,670
She's obviously

135
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,670
been sick for days.

136
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,680
Why did they wait so

137
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,680
long to bring her in?

138
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,680
I'm sorry, Will.

139
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,810
Dr. Halstead,

140
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,810
I came as soon as I heard.

141
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,010
I was an OR nurse

142
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,010
under Dr. Rowan

143
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,010
when I was starting out.

144
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,850
How is she?

145
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,890
Not good,

146
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,890
and we're playing catchup.

147
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,190
All right,

148
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,190
let's put in a central line

149
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,190
and get a chest X-ray,

150
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,250
and I want to keep close tabs

151
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,250
on her volume status.

152
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,630
Please keep me

153
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,630
updated every 20 minutes.

154
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,630
Of course.

155
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,400
Hey, we went to

156
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,400
Joe's last night.

157
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,200
My sister loves stone crab.

158
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,340
It was nice.

159
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,610
I mean, there were

160
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,610
a lot of years when Claire

161
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,610
wasn't speaking to me.

162
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,580
I'm sure she had

163
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,580
very good reason.

164
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,580
Well, she can tell you

165
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,580
all about it herself.

166
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,750
What do you mean?

167
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,750
She wants to meet you.

168
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,560
She wants to have

169
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,560
you over for dinner.

170
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,290
By "meet,"

171
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,290
you mean "grill"?

172
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,280
Make sure I'm

173
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,280
worthy of a Rhodes?

174
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,660
No, that's more my father.

175
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,660
Claire's not like that.

176
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,630
She's happy if I'm happy,

177
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,630
and I'm happy.

178
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,770
I'm not sure if I'm

179
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,770
ready to meet the family.

180
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,160
Good morning,

181
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,160
Dr. Rhodes.

182
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,040
Robin.

183
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,040
Leah.

184
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,840
Dr. Bardovi, are you

185
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,840
ready for your first

186
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,840
coarctation repair?

187
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,940
I've been

188
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,940
studying cases all week.

189
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,940
Good.

190
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,950
'Course, there's nothing

191
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,950
like watching the maestro.

192
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,820
I will catch you

193
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,820
at lunch, maestro.

194
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,760
We'll continue this

195
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,760
conversation later.

196
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,150
Let's go.

197
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,820
Patient's 13.

198
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,820
Pretty late to get

199
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,820
a coarctation diagnosis.

200
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,190
His dad's an oil worker.

201
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,190
He did a stint in Nigeria.

202
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,100
Nobody there caught it.

203
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,530
Knock, knock?

204
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,900
Dr. Rhodes.

205
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,900
Mitch, how are you doing?

206
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,800
This is Dr. Bardovi.

207
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,800
She's gonna be

208
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,800
assisting me in the surgery.

209
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,770
Brandon, how are

210
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,770
we doing this morning, bud?

211
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,250
We are both looking forward

212
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,250
to getting on

213
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,250
the other side of this thing.

214
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,710
Ain't that right, buddy?

215
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,390
Uh... Yeah, sure.

216
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,950
Hey, are you guys gonna

217
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,950
have to saw me

218
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,950
open to do this?

219
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,550
Yes. Yes, we are.

220
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm not scared.

221
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm just wondering if

222
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,500
Halloran's gonna have

223
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,120
a cool scar after

224
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,120
the battle of Madigan.

225
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,330
Halloran?

226
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,270
It's a character

227
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,270
in some dumb online

228
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,270
game that he plays.

229
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,000
Dad, it's not a game.

230
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,000
It's fan fiction.

231
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,870
I published a chapter today,

232
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,500
and my followers are

233
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,500
gonna wanna know

234
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,500
what happens to Halloran

235
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,440
after he slays

236
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,440
the High Locust.

237
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,610
That's you.

238
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,610
All right, then.

239
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,610
Well, I am honored.

240
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,920
And yes,

241
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,920
Halloran's gonna have

242
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,920
a pretty gnarly battle scar.

243
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,060
Sweet.

244
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,060
Well, at least one

245
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,060
of us isn't nervous.

246
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,760
So, coarctation repair.

247
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,160
It sounds complicated,

248
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,360
but it's actually

249
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,360
a relatively

250
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,360
simple procedure.

251
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,790
I'm gonna make an incision

252
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,790
in Brandon's left chest.

253
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,110
We'll place him

254
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,110
on partial bypass,

255
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,110
and then resect, or cut out,

256
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,170
the narrowed

257
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,170
portion of his aorta,

258
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,170
and place a graft.

259
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,310
Now I know all this is a lot,

260
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,310
but any questions, feel free.

261
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,910
Yeah, I was doing

262
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,910
some research online,

263
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,910
and it seems that

264
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,620
Brandon's chicken legs

265
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,620
and his puny size

266
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,620
are because of his condition.

267
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,590
I mean, any chance

268
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,590
that that'll change?

269
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,760
Obviously, Brandon's health

270
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,760
is our primary concern,

271
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,800
but yes, he may grow

272
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,800
at a more rapid rate

273
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,300
once the blood flow

274
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,300
issue is corrected.

275
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,330
Good. Okay.

276
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,840
All right, Brandon,

277
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,840
see you on the battlefield.

278
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,490
Dr. Reese?

279
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,860
You didn't answer your page.

280
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,860
Oh. Sorry.

281
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,690
I...

282
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,120
I was just...

283
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,430
Uh...

284
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,840
When Jason Wheeler jumped,

285
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,840
do you think he was scared?

286
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,680
Was...

287
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,340
I mean, was he at peace?

288
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,260
Right before he stepped off,

289
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,260
was there a moment of regret?

290
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,490
I just can't stop

291
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,490
thinking about him.

292
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,160
Yeah.

293
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,270
But, see, I don't want to,

294
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,270
and then I feel

295
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,270
guilty because I don't.

296
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,270
The thing about suicide,

297
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,810
it's never really

298
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,810
a lone act.

299
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,140
It tends to leave a lot

300
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,140
of victims in its wake.

301
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,090
I'd be lying

302
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,090
if I said I'd been

303
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,090
sleeping too well recently.

304
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,360
But, um, you and I,

305
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,160
we've got work to do.

306
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,640
Excuse me.

307
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,670
Sean Adams,

308
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,670
former naval aviator,

309
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,610
now flies for

310
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,610
a private charter company.

311
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,770
He was doing his

312
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,770
pre-flight check

313
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,770
and felt faint.

314
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,280
Co-pilot brought him in.

315
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,280
Says it's not the first time.

316
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,940
Now, I checked Mr. Adams out.

317
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,940
Can't find anything wrong.

318
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,780
Probably just

319
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,780
dehydrated and overworked.

320
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,220
Says he feels

321
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,220
fine and wants to go.

322
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,250
So, why are we here?

323
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,560
Charter company

324
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,560
wants a psych evaluation.

325
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,250
Uh-huh.

326
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,030
Co-pilot says he's also

327
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,030
been acting different.

328
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,920
Doesn't go out

329
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,920
with the boys anymore,

330
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,920
naps a lot,

331
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,530
seems to be

332
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,530
low energy. Huh.

333
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,930
Sounds like depression.

334
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,930
Possibly.

335
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,840
In any case,

336
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,840
the company won't let him fly

337
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,840
till you sign off.

338
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,310
Why don't we

339
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,310
have a little chat?

340
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,310
Thanks.

341
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,580
Code Blue!

342
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,750
Unresponsive two-year-old.

343
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,750
Quick, what do we do first?

344
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,910
Check pulse,

345
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,910
start compressions.

346
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,590
There is no pulse.

347
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,590
Compressions at what rate?

348
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,930
150 beats per minute.

349
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,930
Good.

350
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,720
You got a team behind you.

351
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,720
What's next?

352
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,230
I tell them

353
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,230
to start bagging.

354
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,230
Pulse check.

355
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,430
Okay, but there's still

356
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,430
no pulse.

357
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,700
Patient's dying.

358
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,700
What now?

359
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,540
Use the paddles

360
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,540
to do a quick look.

361
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,310
Shows v-fib.

362
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,310
She's coding, so?

363
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,680
Need to shock at

364
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,680
four joules per kilo?

365
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,840
Well, move then.

366
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,840
You're losing her.

367
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,580
Charge to 28 joules.

368
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,020
I'm shocking the patient.

369
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,020
Great.

370
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,190
You just killed me.

371
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,190
I did?

372
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,520
Mmm-hmm.

373
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,520
You forgot to yell

374
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,520
"clear" before shocking.

375
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Just one of

376
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
those minor details.

377
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,920
Reset. Let's take it

378
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,920
from the top.

379
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,330
Come on.

380
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,630
It just seems like

381
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,630
everyone's overreacting.

382
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,860
But you can see

383
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,860
their point of view.

384
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,700
I mean, people put

385
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,700
their lives in your hands.

386
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,700
And I'm fine.

387
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,270
I've answered your question.

388
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,270
I know what today is.

389
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,270
I know where I am.

390
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,470
Aside from lack of energy,

391
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,980
your co-pilot

392
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,980
says that at times

393
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,980
you seem mildly confused.

394
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,480
I have no idea what

395
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,480
he's talking about.

396
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,280
Maybe he's

397
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,280
the one that's confused.

398
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,480
Mr. Adams, I imagine

399
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,480
there's a lot of pressure

400
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,480
at your job.

401
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,920
I used to land F-14s

402
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,920
on an aircraft carrier.

403
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,920
That's pressure.

404
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,860
Have you ever had thoughts

405
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,860
of hurting yourself?

406
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,630
What? No.

407
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,760
Let's see here.

408
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,760
Are you on any medication?

409
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,240
You mean do I take

410
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,240
anything that might

411
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,240
affect my performance?

412
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,330
No.

413
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,440
I take a statin,

414
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,440
like 10 million

415
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,440
other Americans.

416
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,440
And no, I don't drink,

417
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,440
if that's your next question.

418
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,210
All right, Mr. Adams,

419
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,210
well, thank you

420
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,210
for your time.

421
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,290
Getting a little

422
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,290
ahead of yourself.

423
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,290
Don't you think?

424
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,850
Well, he is exhibiting

425
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,850
signs of depression,

426
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,230
and there is a high rate

427
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,230
of suicide among pilots.

428
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,500
Dr. Reese, trust me,

429
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,500
I understand

430
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,500
what's on your mind,

431
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,640
but suicidality should not

432
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,640
necessarily be

433
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,640
a default diagnosis.

434
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,510
So what do you think?

435
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,510
I think that Mr. Adams

436
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,510
is linear, lucid.

437
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,140
I mean,

438
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,140
he's certainly

439
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,140
not confused.

440
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,310
Are you gonna

441
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,310
sign off on him?

442
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,310
Well, I didn't say that.

443
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,710
I mean, I thought

444
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,710
he was a little defensive

445
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,710
around the medication issue.

446
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,180
Well, the man has to

447
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,180
prove himself to keep his job.

448
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,480
That would make me defensive.

449
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,350
And you know what,

450
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,350
that could be

451
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,350
all there is to it.

452
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,660
But, look, he's a pilot.

453
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,660
Let's just take

454
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,660
the extra step.

455
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,560
You know, run a tox screen,

456
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,560
make sure he's clean.

457
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,750
Okay.

458
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,600
To your point,

459
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,600
depressives

460
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,600
often self-medicate.

461
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,930
So, I'm not ruling out

462
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,930
the diagnosis.

463
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,040
Dr. Rowan's LFTs are high,

464
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,040
her creatinine's

465
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,040
through the roof.

466
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,240
Kidneys are struggling.

467
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,240
White cell count's high, too.

468
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,280
Multiple organ failure,

469
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,280
impending respiratory failure.

470
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,040
We need to intubate her.

471
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,040
What, at her age?

472
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,520
Nurse!

473
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,520
No, Will...

474
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,750
You know what this means.

475
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,750
She might never get off.

476
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,850
What if we

477
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,850
bridge her with BiPAP?

478
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,360
That'll take

479
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,360
the stress off the lungs,

480
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,360
until the infection cools.

481
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,330
We'd still wind up

482
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,330
intubating her,

483
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,330
and we'd have lost time.

484
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,490
Dr. Halstead,

485
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,490
there's a Mr. Sherwood here

486
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,490
from the nursing home.

487
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,800
He wants to know

488
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,800
how Dr. Rowan is doing.

489
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,570
I'll be happy to tell him.

490
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,170
Sherwood, is it?

491
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,570
You mind telling me

492
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,570
how you and your staff

493
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,710
let a textbook case

494
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,710
of aspiration pneumonia

495
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,710
go unattended?

496
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,750
I don't think that happened.

497
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,750
You don't?

498
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,080
Then how was she

499
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,080
allowed to aspirate

500
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,080
in the first place?

501
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,120
Dr. Halstead...

502
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,120
'Cause I...

503
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,090
I visited her every month.

504
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,090
I knew she had

505
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,090
trouble swallowing.

506
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,720
Your staff knew

507
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,720
she had trouble swallowing.

508
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,660
Okay. I promise you.

509
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,660
I'll look into this.

510
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,390
I'm sure you will.

511
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,390
Oh, you better.

512
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,130
I mean, that Dr. Rowan

513
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,130
should come to this,

514
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,100
all because you denied her

515
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,100
the most basic...

516
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,230
Hey!

517
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,230
Dr. Halstead.

518
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,040
Thank you, Mr. Sherwood.

519
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,110
Will...

520
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,110
They're criminals.

521
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,080
I mean, we should call IDPH,

522
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,080
have their license revoked.

523
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,100
You've all achieved

524
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,100
something very special today.

525
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,100
Now you're physicians,

526
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,100
doctors.

527
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,500
In a few months,

528
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,500
you'll begin your residencies,

529
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,000
caring for people in need.

530
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,810
If you take one thing

531
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,810
away from me today,

532
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,810
let it be this.

533
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,790
Treat the patient,

534
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,790
not the disease.

535
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,990
I brought you

536
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,990
some Vitner's.

537
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,990
Ah!

538
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,030
Triple cheese.

539
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,030
Thanks.

540
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,990
Dr. Rowan?

541
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,670
I'm really sorry, Will.

542
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,230
I know how hard it'll be...

543
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,230
No.

544
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,140
No, if we can get

545
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,140
her temp down

546
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,140
and her sats up,

547
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,770
I think we'll

548
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,770
be over the hump.

549
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,530
Hmm.

550
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,640
Okay.

551
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,680
I just remember

552
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,680
when my grandma got sick,

553
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,680
how tough it was for my mom.

554
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,850
The options, decisions.

555
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,190
Seeing my grandma so ill,

556
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,020
it was awful.

557
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,700
Yeah, I hear

558
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,700
what you're saying.

559
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,530
But, Nina,

560
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,530
she can beat this.

561
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,930
Dr. Rowan gave me so much.

562
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,700
Getting her through this,

563
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,700
it's the least I can do.

564
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,410
Enter the patient's

565
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,410
first and last name,

566
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,910
select an urgency level,

567
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,910
pick your labs,

568
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,910
and then hit submit.

569
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,080
Okay.

570
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,080
Excuse me.

571
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,080
Yep.

572
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,460
I'm looking for my husband,

573
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,460
Sean Adams.

574
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,750
He's in Treatment Four.

575
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,750
I'll page his doctor.

576
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,750
Thank you.

577
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,830
How's it look?

578
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,130
Systolic's still 50

579
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,130
higher in the arms,

580
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,040
but that's not uncommon

581
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,040
right after surgery.

582
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,340
It should come down

583
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,340
in the next 24 hours.

584
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,810
It looks like Halloran slayed

585
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,810
the High Locust after all.

586
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,180
Hey, so how much longer

587
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,180
before he's up

588
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,180
and running around?

589
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,990
Well, over

590
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,990
the next few months,

591
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,760
you should see

592
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,760
an increase in energy

593
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,920
and some improvement

594
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,920
in muscle development.

595
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,500
Oh, thanks.

596
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,500
I can't tell you,

597
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,500
I've been

598
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,500
dreaming about the day

599
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,500
I could get out in the yard

600
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,060
and toss

601
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,060
a football with my son,

602
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,060
like my dad did with me.

603
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,240
Well, hopefully,

604
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,240
that'll happen.

605
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,510
Right now, why don't you

606
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,510
just let him get some rest?

607
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,580
See, Mr. Adams,

608
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,580
as part of our evaluation,

609
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,580
we run a toxicology screen,

610
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,250
and I'm happy to say

611
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,250
that yours was normal.

612
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,330
I told you

613
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,330
I don't take drugs.

614
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,350
However,

615
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,350
we did find something else.

616
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,890
Profound anemia.

617
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,890
Anemia?

618
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,660
It could explain

619
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,660
your feeling faint.

620
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,960
Okay, I guess

621
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,960
I gotta eat more steak.

622
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,590
It's actually more

623
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,590
serious than that.

624
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,230
We need to transfuse you

625
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,230
with several units

626
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,230
of blood right away.

627
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,810
We also need to find out

628
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,810
what's causing it,

629
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,970
so I'd like to admit you

630
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,970
for a battery of

631
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,970
scans and tests.

632
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,470
I've got my own doctor.

633
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,470
I'll make

634
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,470
an appointment with him.

635
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,410
Mr. Adams, we don't want you

636
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,410
to leave in this condition.

637
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,850
You're not well.

638
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,850
I feel fine.

639
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,580
Sean, are you sure

640
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,580
about that?

641
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,480
Yes, and a car ride home

642
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,250
and sleeping in my own bed

643
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,250
isn't gonna hurt me.

644
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,880
That may not be true.

645
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,410
I emphatically recommend

646
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,410
that you take

647
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,410
Dr. Choi's advice.

648
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,020
As far as

649
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,020
the psych evaluation goes,

650
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,020
am I in the clear?

651
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,220
Well, not listening

652
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,220
to your physician isn't

653
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,220
the greatest sign to me.

654
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,770
Well, you're not

655
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,770
the only psychiatrist

656
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,770
in Chicago.

657
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,170
I'll get

658
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,170
a referral from my primary.

659
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,640
Sean...

660
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,640
Viv, we're going.

661
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,640
Hand me my clothes.

662
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,170
Please get me

663
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,170
whatever paperwork

664
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,170
I need to sign,

665
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,940
so I can get out of here.

666
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,810
I'll be back shortly.

667
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,980
Something's just

668
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,980
not right with him.

669
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,280
I agree.

670
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,280
But is it physical or mental?

671
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,780
Your guess is

672
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,780
as good as mine.

673
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,720
Unfortunately, we have

674
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,720
no grounds to hold him.

675
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,410
I'll get the paperwork ready.

676
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,690
Okay,

677
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,690
so your patient is in SVT.

678
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,690
What do you do?

679
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,130
Cardiovert at seven joules.

680
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,130
Right.

681
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,070
So, she's back in

682
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,070
sinus rhythm. What now?

683
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,110
Check her vitals,

684
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,110
establish IV access,

685
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,770
provide fluids if her BP

686
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,770
drops below 75 systolic.

687
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,510
And? The adenosine?

688
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,510
You got a dose?

689
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,340
Um...

690
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,020
Adenosine is scratched out.

691
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,020
Calculate then.

692
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,150
Your patient's gonna

693
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,150
revert back to SVT.

694
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,150
Come on.

695
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,690
Um...

696
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,690
It's a life-and-death

697
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,690
situation here.

698
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,450
6.5 milligrams of adenosine.

699
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,300
It's 0.65,

700
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,300
not 6.5. Here.

701
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,730
Oh, I'm sorry.

702
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,900
What happened?

703
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,900
He can't feel his left arm.

704
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
All right,

705
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
left BP is 80 over 30.

706
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
Check the right. Sats at 70.

707
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,610
Hey, Brandon,

708
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,610
can you squeeze my hand?

709
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,350
No. No, I can't.

710
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,350
Okay.

711
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,250
Right arm's 150 over 100.

712
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,950
What's going on?

713
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,950
All right, legs are cold.

714
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,000
We need a CT angio now!

715
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,000
Got it!

716
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,460
Dad?

717
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,460
What is happening?

718
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,560
Brandon's not getting

719
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,560
blood to his left arm,

720
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,970
but I need

721
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,970
a picture of it to see.

722
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,830
It's possible that the graft

723
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,830
we put in has become occluded.

724
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,430
Occluded? What does that mean?

725
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,770
The first surgery

726
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,770
may not have worked.

727
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,500
So you have to

728
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,500
do it again?

729
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,340
It may be more

730
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,340
complicated than that.

731
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,820
She's in v-fib!

732
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,260
Paddles. Start compressions.

733
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,520
Will, I'll break her ribs.

734
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,520
Charge to 200 joules.

735
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,290
Start compressions now!

736
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,290
Are you sure? I...

737
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,370
Out of my way.

738
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,370
No, Will.

739
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,330
Are we charged?

740
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,330
Two hundred joules.

741
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,040
Holding the CPR. Clear.

742
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,810
One milligram of epi,

743
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,810
charge to 200 again.

744
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,610
Two hundred.

745
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,610
All right, clear.

746
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,220
Pulse is good.

747
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,300
Hey.

748
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,950
Dr. Halstead

749
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,950
decided to intubate.

750
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,580
You know, this woman

751
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,580
is the reason I

752
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,580
stayed in nursing.

753
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,120
My first year as

754
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,120
an OR nurse, I actually

755
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,120
thought about quitting.

756
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,570
You?

757
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,570
Oh,

758
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,570
I had a rough time.

759
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,630
There was this

760
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,630
surgery I scrubbed on.

761
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,670
I think it was

762
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,670
a vascular case.

763
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,070
The resident asked

764
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,070
for a 10 blade scalpel.

765
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,070
It slipped out of my hand,

766
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,070
dropped in the incision.

767
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,380
Oh, my God.

768
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,380
It didn't hurt the patient,

769
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,390
but that resident

770
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,390
reamed me out.

771
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,250
Dr. Rowan stepped in,

772
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,250
called him out,

773
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,350
said everyone in

774
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,350
the OR deserved civility.

775
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,690
Everyone.

776
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,300
Bella Rowan.

777
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,100
Wonderful woman.

778
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,800
Extraordinary teacher.

779
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,310
Sean. Oh, my God.

780
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,550
Oh, my God. Help, someone!

781
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,550
Help my husband, please.

782
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,520
Okay, hey,

783
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,520
I need a gurney here.

784
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,620
Mr. Adams,

785
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,620
can you hear me?

786
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,180
What's wrong with him?

787
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,180
Unresponsive, has a pulse.

788
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,460
Get him in a room.

789
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,950
Bring it over here.

790
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,160
Let's transfer on my count.

791
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,160
Ready, one, two, three.

792
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,570
Here we go.

793
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,570
All right,

794
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,570
he's not breathing.

795
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,110
Get me a laryngoscope

796
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,110
and a 7.5 ET tube.

797
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,110
I got it.

798
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,700
Sean!

799
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,700
Trauma One to prep.

800
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,040
We'll take care of him.

801
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,810
He's totally flaccid.

802
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,810
Don't need drugs.

803
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,680
Monique, you start the IV.

804
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,680
Okay.

805
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,250
Sean...

806
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,250
Okay, you stand right here.

807
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,850
He's got

808
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,850
a massive upper GI bleed.

809
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,080
His stomach's

810
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,080
filling with blood.

811
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,020
I'm in.

812
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,020
April, listen to his lungs.

813
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,020
Yep.

814
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,330
Good breath

815
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,330
sounds bilaterally.

816
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,130
Hang two units of blood

817
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,130
and get another four ready.

818
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,690
What's going on?

819
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,690
Why is this happening?

820
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,260
I don't know,

821
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,260
but we're gonna find out.

822
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,430
Hang saline.

823
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,430
Saline's up.

824
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,430
All right, stay on it.

825
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,240
Got your page.

826
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,990
Dr. Rowan's latest labs.

827
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,520
I am so sorry.

828
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,520
She's in acute renal failure.

829
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,550
Hyperkalemic and

830
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,550
still acidotic.

831
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,390
All right, we'll start her

832
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,390
on low-flow dialysis.

833
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,730
It should correct her

834
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,730
electrolytes and pH.

835
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,730
Will...

836
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,100
I won't stand by

837
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,100
and let her die.

838
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,430
Tell April to call renal.

839
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,410
Graft occlusion is

840
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,410
a possible outcome

841
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,410
of any vascular surgery.

842
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,540
It's nobody's fault.

843
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,420
Okay, so there are

844
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,420
two options, right?

845
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,050
We could either...

846
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,050
Just let me handle this, okay?

847
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,530
Mitch, a moment?

848
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,890
Uh...

849
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,230
What is it?

850
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,160
So the CT

851
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,160
revealed that the graft

852
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,800
I placed in

853
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,800
Brandon's chest kinked,

854
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,500
causing re-coarctation

855
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,540
or essentially

856
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,540
a narrowing of his aorta.

857
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,540
Like before?

858
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,380
I'm sorry.

859
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,780
So... So what?

860
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,780
We're just back

861
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,780
at square one?

862
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,850
Yes, but this time,

863
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,850
things are more complicated.

864
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,390
Now, I can repair

865
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,390
the graft by placing a stent,

866
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,020
and we would do

867
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,020
that in the cath lab.

868
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,560
But the stent will cover

869
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,560
the opening of his

870
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,560
left subclavian artery.

871
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,530
That will cut off

872
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,530
circulation to his left arm,

873
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,240
meaning Brandon

874
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,240
will lose that arm.

875
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,440
Lose his arm?

876
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,640
Mmm-hmm.

877
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,650
No. No, he can't.

878
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,150
He can't. There must be

879
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,150
something else you can do.

880
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,390
I'm sorry, but no.

881
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,990
I'm afraid this is

882
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,990
our only viable option.

883
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,060
Oh, God.

884
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,430
Hey, look, Mitch,

885
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,430
why don't you go be

886
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,430
with your son, okay?

887
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,700
We'll take him up

888
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,700
to surgery soon.

889
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm very sorry.

890
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,440
Pardon me,

891
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,440
Dr. Rhodes.

892
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,140
I know you must've

893
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,140
had a very good reason,

894
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,620
but you didn't present

895
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,620
the other option,

896
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,610
the carotid

897
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,610
subclavian bypass.

898
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,880
Wouldn't that

899
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,880
preserve Brandon's arm?

900
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,330
Dr. Bardovi,

901
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,330
20% to 30% of young patients

902
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,460
will stroke out

903
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,460
and possibly die

904
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,460
when you clamp their carotid.

905
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,970
It's too big of a risk.

906
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,970
Okay, but still...

907
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,430
It's too big of a risk.

908
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,970
What was that all about?

909
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,340
Look, this boy's father...

910
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,340
I know the type.

911
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,840
I grew up with one.

912
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,910
He wants his son to

913
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,910
be something he isn't.

914
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,250
He'll choose the bypass.

915
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,250
It's too dangerous.

916
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,890
But it's his decision,

917
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,890
not yours.

918
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,150
I already opened

919
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,150
Brandon up once.

920
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,150
I'm not gonna do it again.

921
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,700
I'm not gonna risk

922
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,700
this boy's life

923
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,700
just to save his arm.

924
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,500
Huge gastric ulcer.

925
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,500
That's where all

926
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,500
the blood was coming from.

927
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,100
Were you able to

928
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,100
stop the bleed?

929
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,480
Yeah, GI cauterized it,

930
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,480
but that's not the headline.

931
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,080
Sean's endoscopy shows

932
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,080
chronic caustic

933
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,080
esophageal erosions.

934
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,750
And his chest X-ray...

935
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,590
Pneumonitis.

936
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,590
Yeah.

937
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,120
This is a pattern

938
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,120
suggestive of ingesting

939
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,120
some sort of hydrocarbon.

940
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,330
Isn't that in

941
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,330
cleaning products?

942
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,100
And lighter fluid,

943
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,100
motor oil, gasoline.

944
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,000
Extremely toxic.

945
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,470
So we must be talking

946
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,470
about low doses over

947
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,470
a long period of time.

948
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,280
So I was right.

949
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,280
We should be

950
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,280
concerned he's suicidal.

951
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,000
Why assume he's

952
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,000
doing this to himself?

953
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,380
Well, what, you think

954
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,380
someone's poisoning him?

955
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,210
I don't know.

956
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,210
It's possible.

957
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,750
I had a case where

958
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,750
a wife was slipping

959
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,840
something into

960
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,840
her husband's food.

961
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,820
So you think

962
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,820
it's his wife?

963
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,780
You know,

964
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,780
hydrocarbons are

965
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,780
extremely noxious,

966
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,380
so he would've smelled it.

967
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,380
Not necessarily.

968
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,250
They're all over

969
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,250
any aircraft hangar.

970
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,060
With constant exposure,

971
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,060
he could be nose blind.

972
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,970
I don't know.

973
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,970
Suicide? Attempted murder?

974
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,670
I think it might be

975
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,670
something else altogether.

976
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,470
I just

977
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,470
checked in on Dr. Rowan.

978
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,750
I heard

979
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,750
you ordered dialysis.

980
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,820
She's in renal failure.

981
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,820
That's the appropriate

982
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,820
treatment.

983
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,660
I understand

984
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,660
the medicine, Doctor.

985
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,090
Even if you dialyze her...

986
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,090
I am.

987
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,100
Even if you dialyze her,

988
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,100
she's unlikely to

989
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,100
come off the vent.

990
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,470
That means

991
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,470
she'll be bedridden.

992
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,740
Eventually,

993
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,740
she'll need a tracheostomy.

994
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,910
You've already

995
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,910
broken her ribs.

996
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,310
Now she'll have bed sores,

997
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,310
a feeding tube.

998
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,180
Shouldn't quality of life

999
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,180
be a consideration?

1000
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,940
Remember that

1001
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,940
ballplayer I told you about?

1002
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,280
He was a pitcher

1003
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,280
with one arm.

1004
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,280
He was one of the best.

1005
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,810
All right, so,

1006
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,810
you know, we can be strong.

1007
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,740
We can do this.

1008
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,350
The important thing

1009
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,350
is that you're gonna be alive.

1010
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,220
And healthy.

1011
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,890
We'll figure out the rest,

1012
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,890
okay? Together.

1013
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,190
Mitch.

1014
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,190
Yeah.

1015
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,700
Guys, if you can

1016
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,700
hold on for a second.

1017
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,500
Yeah.

1018
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,500
Can I have a word with you?

1019
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,030
Your dad

1020
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,030
will be right back.

1021
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,970
So, I've been thinking

1022
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,970
about Brandon's case,

1023
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,900
and there is

1024
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,900
something else we can try.

1025
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,580
Wrong angle.

1026
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,450
You need to go

1027
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,450
in perpendicular,

1028
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,680
or you'll stay

1029
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,680
in the cortex.

1030
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,850
Okay.

1031
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,860
You're too shallow.

1032
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,260
You need to keep on drilling

1033
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,260
until you hub the needle.

1034
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,830
Not like that.

1035
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,240
Who taught her

1036
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,240
how to do an IO?

1037
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,240
An orangutan?

1038
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,140
Okay. She'll get there.

1039
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,610
We've all gone through this.

1040
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,610
Just take it slowly.

1041
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,140
Go ahead.

1042
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,780
There you go.

1043
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,590
White board says

1044
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,590
carotid subclavian bypass.

1045
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,000
It's just, I thought...

1046
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,260
I presented both options

1047
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,260
to the patient's father.

1048
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,100
As I suspected,

1049
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,100
he chose the carotid

1050
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,100
subclavian bypass.

1051
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,240
And you're gonna do

1052
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,240
a great job, Dr. Rhodes.

1053
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,610
You're an exceptional surgeon,

1054
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,610
and it is an honor to be...

1055
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,410
Dr. Bardovi,

1056
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,410
you don't have to do that.

1057
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,840
You're a fine surgeon,

1058
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,610
and trust me,

1059
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,610
I'm a less-than-perfect

1060
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,610
teacher.

1061
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,390
Mr. Adams,

1062
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,390
can I ask you...

1063
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,300
You ever find yourself

1064
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,300
doing something

1065
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,300
that you know you shouldn't,

1066
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,270
but you just can't stop?

1067
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,340
I have no idea what

1068
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,340
you're talking about.

1069
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,440
My wife would say that

1070
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,440
I watch too much football.

1071
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,440
I'll tell you

1072
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,440
my dirty little secret.

1073
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,910
I went through

1074
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,910
this phase where I would

1075
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,910
come home every night,

1076
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,820
cut my nails every night,

1077
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,820
like down to the quick.

1078
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,430
Couldn't stop.

1079
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,460
On some level,

1080
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,460
I must've been

1081
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,460
satisfying some urge,

1082
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,360
but my hands were bleeding.

1083
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,640
It wasn't good.

1084
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,400
And the point of this?

1085
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,900
The point is that

1086
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,900
I understand

1087
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,900
compulsive behavior.

1088
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,040
You know, it's not rational.

1089
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,040
You can't explain it.

1090
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,040
You just...

1091
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,610
You just do it.

1092
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:01,350
Yeah, but eventually,

1093
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:01,350
like with me,

1094
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:01,350
your fingers bleed,

1095
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,050
or something similar.

1096
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,920
And it just starts

1097
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,920
to cost you too much,

1098
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,630
and you wanna stop.

1099
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,430
I mean, you realize

1100
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,430
that it's interfering

1101
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,430
with your life,

1102
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,430
and you just really,

1103
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,430
really wanna stop.

1104
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,470
Sean, I think you

1105
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,470
have a compulsion,

1106
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,910
and you're tired,

1107
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,910
and you're also

1108
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,910
getting scared.

1109
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,240
I mean,

1110
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,240
who wouldn't be scared?

1111
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,310
All that blood?

1112
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,310
All that vomiting?

1113
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,820
Yes.

1114
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,360
I'm tired.

1115
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,940
Mr. Adams,

1116
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,940
we think you're ingesting

1117
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,940
something very harmful.

1118
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,380
Can you tell us

1119
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,380
what it is?

1120
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,720
Mr. Adams,

1121
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,720
please, we can help you.

1122
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,820
Gasoline.

1123
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,260
I'm sorry? Say again?

1124
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,860
I drink gasoline.

1125
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,880
Is my husband crazy?

1126
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,520
Why would anyone

1127
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,520
drink gasoline?

1128
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,890
I know it's very

1129
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,890
difficult to fathom,

1130
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,150
but I'm quite sure

1131
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,150
that your husband

1132
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,150
is suffering

1133
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,960
from a psychiatric

1134
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,960
disorder known as pica,

1135
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,090
which involves the compulsive

1136
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,090
consumption of non-nutritive,

1137
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,500
and sometimes even

1138
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,500
hazardous substances.

1139
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,890
For some,

1140
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,890
it's paint chips.

1141
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,230
For others, dirt.

1142
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,810
For your husband,

1143
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,810
it's gasoline.

1144
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,310
Why?

1145
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,410
There's no unified

1146
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,410
theory as to the cause.

1147
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,220
All we know is

1148
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,220
that it manifests

1149
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,220
itself as a compulsion,

1150
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,520
an irresistible urge,

1151
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,520
against one's

1152
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,520
conscious wishes.

1153
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,620
Can he stop?

1154
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,860
Probably not on his own,

1155
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,860
but if he'll allow us,

1156
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,860
we can help him.

1157
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,360
Okay.

1158
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,330
We'll do whatever it

1159
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,330
takes to get him healthy.

1160
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,830
Before we discuss

1161
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,830
the course of psychotherapy,

1162
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,170
I'd like to talk to

1163
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,170
you and your husband

1164
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,670
about repairing

1165
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,670
the physical damage.

1166
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,180
Of course. Yes.

1167
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,350
He could've killed himself.

1168
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,750
Sometimes we

1169
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,750
get a win, right?

1170
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,420
Sometimes we get a win.

1171
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,120
If you take one thing

1172
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,120
away from me today,

1173
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,120
let it be this.

1174
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,000
Treat the patient,

1175
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,000
not the disease.

1176
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:32,190
Good. You haven't started.

1177
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:32,190
Just finished the line. Why?

1178
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,930
You were right.

1179
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,930
We shouldn't do this.

1180
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,770
What changed your mind?

1181
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,770
"Treat the patient,

1182
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,770
not the disease."

1183
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,110
Our patient

1184
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,110
wouldn't have wanted this.

1185
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,680
April,

1186
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,680
10 milligrams of morphine,

1187
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,680
and hang a drip, please.

1188
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,620
Dr. Rowan,

1189
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,390
I'm going to extubate you.

1190
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,660
I promise

1191
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,660
you won't feel any pain.

1192
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,870
I'll let you two

1193
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,870
be alone with her now.

1194
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,420
Okay, going to start

1195
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,420
the carotid anastomosis.

1196
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,890
Everybody get ready.

1197
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,890
We're going to

1198
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,890
clamp the left carotid.

1199
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,160
Carla, tell me if you see

1200
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,160
any change on the EEG.

1201
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,390
Right.

1202
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,260
Peripheral cross

1203
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,260
clamp times two?

1204
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,110
Carotid is cross-clamped.

1205
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,110
Brain waves look good.

1206
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,090
Okay, 11 blade,

1207
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,090
followed by 5-0 PROLENE.

1208
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,460
Let's sew this

1209
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,460
graft in quickly.

1210
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,310
Brain waves

1211
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,310
flattening on the right.

1212
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,130
He's impending infarct.

1213
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,510
We only have

1214
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,510
four minutes of hypoxia

1215
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,510
before deficits occur.

1216
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,440
Do we unclamp him?

1217
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,410
We can still call this off

1218
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,410
and take him to the cath lab.

1219
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,580
It's safer.

1220
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,320
Dr. Rhodes.

1221
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,320
No.

1222
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,090
This kid's

1223
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,090
not losing his arm.

1224
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,660
Coming around

1225
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,660
the front wall now.

1226
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,160
Left side brain's 50,

1227
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,160
right side's 70.

1228
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,560
Dr. Bardovi,

1229
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,560
follow me. Eyes on the field.

1230
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,960
Dr. Rhodes, you need

1231
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,960
to get those clamps off.

1232
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,760
Thank you, Marty,

1233
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,760
I'm almost there.

1234
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,580
Left side's 30,

1235
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,580
right side's 50.

1236
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,880
Okay. Done.

1237
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,780
Coming off cross clamp.

1238
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,460
Cross clamps are off.

1239
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,330
I've reestablished flow.

1240
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,620
EEG is normalizing.

1241
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,360
You have

1242
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,360
a good wave pattern.

1243
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,460
He's good.

1244
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,900
Nice work,

1245
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,900
Dr. Rhodes.

1246
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,100
Okay, everyone, let's

1247
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,100
get set up for the stent.

1248
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,140
Good night.

1249
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,870
How could you

1250
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,870
do this to us?

1251
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,380
Excuse me?

1252
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,380
My husband told me.

1253
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,350
He'll lose

1254
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,350
his pilot's license.

1255
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,350
We'll lose everything.

1256
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,160
I'm very sorry.

1257
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,160
I had no choice.

1258
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,660
I am legally

1259
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,660
obligated to report him.

1260
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,960
It's his life.

1261
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,800
I called the FAA.

1262
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,800
I had to.

1263
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,810
Every time he gets on a plane,

1264
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,810
he puts his own life

1265
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,150
and the lives of all of

1266
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,150
his passengers at risk.

1267
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,980
I know this wasn't

1268
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,980
necessarily the win

1269
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,980
that you were looking for,

1270
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,950
but at least

1271
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,950
we saved a man's life.

1272
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,090
See you in the morning?

1273
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,900
I heard

1274
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,900
the surgery went well.

1275
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,750
Yeah, thankfully.

1276
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,920
Yeah, don't worry,

1277
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,920
I won't tell anyone.

1278
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,720
Tell 'em what?

1279
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,720
That you were scared.

1280
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,320
Oh, that's

1281
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,320
what you think, huh?

1282
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,320
Yeah.

1283
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,720
Oh, man, you're

1284
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,720
definitely a Charles.

1285
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,860
You're very perceptive.

1286
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,870
I was,

1287
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,870
after that first time.

1288
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,870
I was afraid.

1289
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,870
I was afraid

1290
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,870
I was gonna lose him.

1291
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,340
I have fears of

1292
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,340
my own, you know.

1293
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,810
Cholera? Typhus?

1294
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,810
Yeah.

1295
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,250
And relationships.

1296
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,950
There are a lot of pitfalls

1297
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,950
in dating a surgeon.

1298
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,720
It's crazy hours,

1299
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,720
stress of the job...

1300
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,620
Great case, Dr. Rhodes.

1301
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,620
Very impressive.

1302
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,490
And thanks for

1303
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,490
the vote of confidence.

1304
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,860
Fawning women

1305
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,860
falling at your feet.

1306
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,840
Yeah, I don't know if I can

1307
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,840
compete with all of that.

1308
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,170
You don't have to compete.

1309
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,010
I'm all in.

1310
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,080
So, your sister...

1311
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,420
Is she a red or

1312
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,420
white wine drinker?

1313
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,590
Um... White.

1314
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,930
Not chardonnay.

1315
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,930
Sauvignon blanc.

1316
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,970
Will?

1317
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,400
Hey.

1318
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,210
I'm so sorry for your loss.
