1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,230
Packed you some of

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,230
last night's lasagna.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,740
Oh, thank you, baby.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,260
Okay.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,260
You good?

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,670
Yes. Bye.

7
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,670
Bye.

8
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,940
Oh, wait. Almost forgot.

9
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,940
Uh, I bought you these.

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,210
Memory foam,

11
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,210
on your feet all day.

12
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,340
I don't know what

13
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,340
I'd do without you.

14
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,310
Yeah.

15
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,660
Yes.

16
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,470
"Yes", what?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,070
I'm sorry that

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,070
it took so long,

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,070
but I do wanna marry you.

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,310
I mean, if the offer

21
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,310
still stands.

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,010
I've been sitting

23
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,010
on this for months,

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,960
just waiting.

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,160
What?

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,160
Yeah.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,560
Oh, my God.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,560
It's beautiful.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,800
Tate, yes!

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,410
Hey.

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,350
Wait, I thought you were

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,350
picking up an extra shift.

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,480
Yeah, I was hoping to,

34
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,520
but Goodwin put

35
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,520
a moratorium on overtime.

36
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,550
Oh, I do not wanna

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,550
go home right now

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,550
and face Mandelbrot.

39
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,220
What, is your new roomie

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,220
still leaving toe nail

41
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,220
clippings on the couch?

42
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,430
Worse. Now, he's doing

43
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,430
jumping jacks in the nude.

44
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,430
Okay, you really

45
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,430
need a new roommate.

46
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,370
I can't make

47
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,370
rent without him.

48
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,410
Well, hey, if worst

49
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,410
comes to worst,

50
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,340
I got plenty of beds

51
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,340
down in the morgue.

52
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah.

53
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,280
Yeah, I bet you do.

54
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,280
I might take you up on that.

55
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,010
Have a good day.

56
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,810
Um, Dr. Halstead?

57
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,810
Yeah?

58
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,220
I, uh... I don't

59
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,220
mean to pry,

60
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,650
but it sounds to me

61
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,650
like you may be

62
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,160
in need of

63
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,160
a little extra cash flow.

64
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,630
Now, just hear me out

65
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,630
for one sec.

66
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,490
I think I can help.

67
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,160
Dr. Manning,

68
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,160
incoming, Trauma Three.

69
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,900
Sixty-one-year-old male,

70
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,900
BP 140 over 90, fever 101.

71
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,910
Called it in himself,

72
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,910
but could hardly breathe

73
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,910
by the time we got there.

74
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,540
Please...

75
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,540
Sir, I need you

76
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,540
to just relax.

77
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,810
Listen to me.

78
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,810
Try to relax, okay?

79
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,910
Listen to me.

80
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,280
All right, let's start

81
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,280
a neb treatment

82
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,480
and get 125 milligrams

83
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,480
Solu-Medrol IV.

84
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,540
Okay, got it.

85
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,490
And an ABG kit...

86
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,090
All right,

87
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,090
let's transfer him.

88
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,090
On my count.

89
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,820
Ready? One, two, three.

90
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,550
Let's get it out.

91
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,550
Let's get that

92
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,550
neb treatment.

93
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,720
Coming up.

94
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,200
Just try to relax, sir.

95
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,570
All right, I need you

96
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,570
to take a deep

97
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,570
breath for me, okay?

98
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,110
There you go.

99
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,110
Do you have any

100
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,110
family we should notify?

101
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,070
No, I need...

102
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,070
I need to speak to Sharon.

103
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,380
Deep breath.

104
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,540
I need to speak to Sharon.

105
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,210
Relax, relax.

106
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,210
Sharon...

107
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,920
Take this in.

108
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,920
McGee.

109
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,250
What did he say?

110
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,550
Something about a Sharon.

111
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,890
"McGee", he said "McGee".

112
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,320
That's Goodwin's

113
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,320
maiden name.

114
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,530
Keep taking

115
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,530
deep breaths, sir.

116
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,040
I had a fever and a headache

117
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,040
for the past week,

118
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,040
figured I had the flu.

119
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,150
Next thing I know,

120
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,150
I can't catch my breath.

121
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,910
Any history of illness?

122
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,510
Had a flare-up

123
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,510
of colitis

124
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,510
a few months back.

125
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,780
Doctor put me on

126
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,780
a course of steroids.

127
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,780
Reggie Dixon.

128
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,690
There she is.

129
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,690
Just like I remember.

130
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,060
It has been way too long.

131
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,060
Oh!

132
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,790
Oh, it sure has.

133
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,460
Reggie and I grew up

134
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,460
in the same neighborhood.

135
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,470
Haven't seen each other

136
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,470
since when?

137
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,510
The summer after

138
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,510
my senior year

139
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,510
in high school.

140
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,510
That's right. That's right.

141
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,510
I'd just gotten

142
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,510
back from Vietnam.

143
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,040
You served?

144
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,210
Sort of. Only thing I ever

145
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,210
shot was my Pentax 1000.

146
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,760
Oh, Reggie was

147
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,760
a photographer with

148
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,760
Stars and Stripes.

149
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,360
Now, they said that

150
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,360
you're having trouble

151
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,360
catching your breath?

152
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,400
Well, I can't say

153
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,400
you're making it any easier.

154
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,990
Stop it.

155
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,400
Mr. Dixon, um, the doctor

156
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,400
that put you on steroids,

157
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,800
can you get us

158
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,800
his information?

159
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,810
I can, but, uh,

160
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,810
he's in Paris.

161
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,810
In Paris?

162
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,240
Yeah, Reuters had me

163
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,240
stationed there,

164
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,240
and I transferred back here.

165
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,470
Time to start

166
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,470
the next chapter.

167
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,050
And is there anyone

168
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,050
we could call?

169
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,280
Are your folks

170
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,280
still living?

171
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,610
How about a wife?

172
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,460
Never married.

173
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,460
Never put down

174
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,460
any roots.

175
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,430
Heard you were

176
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,430
running the show

177
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,430
at this place,

178
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,900
so, I told the dispatcher

179
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,900
to route me here.

180
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,900
Knew you'd have my back.

181
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah.

182
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,500
You know that's right.

183
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,500
I'm glad you did.

184
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,570
Uh, Nurse Doris here's

185
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,570
gonna draw some blood,

186
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,570
so we can order a few tests.

187
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,240
I'll be right back.

188
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,240
Thank you.

189
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,500
Thank you.

190
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,040
So, what are we

191
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,040
looking at here?

192
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,720
Well, he was on a course

193
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,720
of steroids, um,

194
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,310
which could have weakened

195
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,310
his immune system.

196
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,580
We could be looking at

197
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,580
a respiratory infection.

198
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,750
We'll get a chest X-ray

199
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,750
and start him on

200
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,750
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

201
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,320
See what

202
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,320
the labs say, Maggie.

203
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,720
Copy.

204
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,660
If you suspect anything,

205
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,430
run it down, and you

206
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,430
let me know the second

207
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,430
you get results.

208
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,130
Of course.

209
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,130
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
Okay.

211
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,270
Was it just me, or...

212
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,740
No, she was

213
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,740
definitely flirting.

214
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,870
Yeah.

215
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,380
Please help.

216
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,540
April,

217
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,540
what is wrong?

218
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,210
Please, my arm,

219
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,210
it's killing me.

220
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,610
From the weight of this...

221
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,610
What?

222
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,440
What?

223
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,510
Look at the sparkle

224
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,510
on that thing.

225
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,510
Oh!

226
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,750
You are gonna

227
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,750
need some sunglasses.

228
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,380
Congratulations, April.

229
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,020
Congratulations.

230
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,020
Thank you.

231
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,230
Hey, Mags,

232
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,230
you see this thing?

233
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,860
It's hard to miss.

234
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,150
Reese.

235
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,560
So beautiful.

236
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,660
Treatment Two.

237
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,660
Tried to assign him

238
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,660
to someone else,

239
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,640
but he said he would

240
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,640
only talk to you.

241
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,530
Okay.

242
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,740
This is big.

243
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,010
Danny, what's wrong?

244
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,240
My stomach,

245
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,240
it's tied up in knots.

246
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,580
Let's take a look.

247
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,450
Don't they have

248
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,450
a clinic at the shelter?

249
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,510
I'm not at

250
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,510
the shelter anymore.

251
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,510
What?

252
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,550
A woman came in

253
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,550
with her newborn.

254
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
They said

255
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
they needed the bed.

256
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
Told me I had to leave.

257
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,790
They kicked you out?

258
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,290
I spent the night

259
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,290
on the street.

260
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,290
I barely slept.

261
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,370
Hey, can you

262
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,370
close the curtain?

263
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,960
What's going on?

264
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,660
I don't want them

265
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,660
to find me.

266
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,180
We took your

267
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,180
tracking chip out.

268
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,930
They know that I was here.

269
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,680
Don't worry.

270
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,640
I'm gonna keep you safe.

271
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,550
Double-iced latte

272
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,550
with one pump of

273
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,550
sugar-free vanilla.

274
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,820
For Robin.

275
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,220
Excuse me.

276
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,450
Oh, I'm sorry,

277
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,450
you just ordered the

278
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,450
exact same drink as me.

279
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,560
Vanilla? A little

280
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,560
dainty for a surgeon.

281
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,090
What are the odds?

282
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,800
Well, if you limit

283
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,800
the data set

284
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,800
to just lattes,

285
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,970
you've got ice or no ice,

286
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,970
caff or decaf...

287
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,300
Don't forget

288
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,300
the vanilla.

289
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,200
I'd say the odds of

290
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,200
any two random people

291
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,180
ordering the same thing

292
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,180
are about one in 36.

293
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,850
Good with numbers.

294
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,950
Ah! Of course.

295
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,950
Epidemiology.

296
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,650
Wait, are you...

297
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,650
Are you that Charles?

298
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,650
I'll see you later.

299
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,490
Okay, designed it myself.

300
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,720
With one swipe,

301
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,690
you get a board-certified

302
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,690
physician

303
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,630
on your doorstep

304
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,630
within the hour.

305
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,360
A house-call app?

306
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,430
I prefer

307
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,430
"medicinal concierge".

308
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,740
Look, I just launched the beta

309
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,740
and I already got

310
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,740
a write-up in TechCrunch.

311
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,480
Subscriber base

312
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,480
is set to explode

313
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,480
within the next quarter.

314
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,670
And I've got a few

315
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,670
residents on board,

316
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,980
but with an attending,

317
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,980
we can make a killing.

318
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,020
A killing making

319
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,020
house calls?

320
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,690
How does $200 a call sound?

321
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,120
This is the future of

322
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,120
medicine. All right?

323
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,350
And you have

324
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,350
the option to get in

325
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,350
on the ground floor,

326
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
without that

327
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
annoying roommate.

328
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,890
Oh.

329
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,490
Here's one right now.

330
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,860
A 23-year-old male

331
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,860
with a persistent nosebleed.

332
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,040
So, what do you say?

333
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,640
Chicago PD dropped

334
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,640
her off this morning.

335
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,950
They found her

336
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,950
loitering outside of

337
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,950
a convenience store,

338
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,850
jabbering to herself,

339
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,850
disoriented,

340
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,890
no idea where

341
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,890
she'd come from,

342
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,890
or how she got there.

343
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,610
Pamela? I'm Dr. Charles.

344
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,720
You're not Bob.

345
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,720
No.

346
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,020
But you can call me Daniel.

347
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,120
Um, do you mind

348
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,120
if we ask you

349
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,120
a couple of questions?

350
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,430
Dr. Wheeler was

351
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,430
thinking that maybe,

352
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,500
you're feeling

353
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,500
a bit out of sorts.

354
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,100
Do you know

355
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,100
why you're here?

356
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,570
I just wanted some

357
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,570
ice cream, and...

358
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,780
You know what? I think

359
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,780
I might be able to

360
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,780
help you out with that.

361
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,850
What flavor were

362
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,850
you thinking?

363
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,620
Cookie dough.

364
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,620
Oh, dang.

365
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,120
That's my favorite.

366
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,930
You mind if I...

367
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,930
If I look at your hand?

368
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, boy.

369
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,970
You have really

370
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,970
beautiful nails.

371
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,970
You know what, Pamela?

372
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,470
I'm gonna see what

373
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,470
I can do about that

374
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,470
cookie dough, okay?

375
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,100
Okay.

376
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,400
Thanks.

377
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,570
I need a CBC, CMP,

378
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,570
and you better

379
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,570
page cardiology.

380
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,750
Why? I called you in

381
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,750
for a psych consult.

382
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,190
She's not psychotic,

383
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,190
she has endocarditis.

384
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,190
You didn't notice the fever?

385
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,120
The splinter hemorrhages

386
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,120
under her nails?

387
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,690
The cops said

388
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,690
that she was having

389
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,690
a psychotic episode,

390
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,750
so I just assumed that...

391
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,230
An infection is

392
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,230
attacking her heart

393
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,820
and sending micro-strokes

394
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,820
to her brain.

395
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,760
Okay, so, we should

396
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,760
page cardiology, right?

397
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,820
You know what, Jason?

398
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,270
I think I'm gonna

399
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,270
take this myself,

400
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,600
but good work,

401
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,600
really. I mean it.

402
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,910
Maggie?

403
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,910
Already on it.

404
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,170
I was thinking it might be

405
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,170
a good idea to loop in

406
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,610
epidemiology, you know?

407
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,550
Maybe Dr. Robin Charles?

408
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,550
Just to be safe.

409
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,910
Help, help.

410
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,910
My belly. My belly!

411
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,610
My belly is on fire!

412
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,610
It's on fire!

413
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,850
Okay, okay.

414
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,850
Help!

415
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,260
He's got a rash.

416
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,820
It feels... God,

417
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,820
it feels like something's

418
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,820
alive in there.

419
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
It's not a rash.

420
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,500
These are worms.

421
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,510
How the hell

422
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,510
did I get worms?

423
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,610
Have you traveled

424
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,610
recently to any

425
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,610
underdeveloped countries?

426
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,450
Anywhere tropical?

427
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,020
The south of France

428
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,020
is as tropical

429
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,850
as I've gotten in

430
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,850
the past 20 years.

431
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,620
What about before that?

432
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,460
You said you served

433
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,460
with Stars and Stripes.

434
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,930
Did you do any

435
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,930
time in the country?

436
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,920
I was with the 7th Cav

437
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,920
when they took Quang Tri.

438
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,760
What, does that have

439
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,760
something to do with this?

440
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,530
What aren't they

441
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,530
telling me?

442
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,510
Let's not get ahead

443
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,510
of ourselves.

444
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,380
I wanna get a stool sample.

445
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,380
See what the labs say.

446
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,210
Yeah. Just try to rest,

447
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,210
Mr. Dixon.

448
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,210
We'll be back soon.

449
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,850
So, what were you

450
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,850
driving at in there?

451
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,090
I think we're looking at

452
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,090
a parasitic roundworm

453
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,090
called "strongyloides".

454
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,050
Seen a bunch of

455
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,050
cases at the VA.

456
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,660
I'm guessing he picked

457
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,660
it up in Vietnam.

458
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,560
But that was

459
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,560
over 40 years ago.

460
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,370
The worms embed themselves

461
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,370
in the intestinal wall

462
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,870
and can remain

463
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,870
dormant for decades.

464
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,970
The steroids he was on

465
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,970
to treat his colitis

466
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,370
must have suppressed

467
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,370
his immune system,

468
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,010
allowing the larvae

469
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,010
to proliferate.

470
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,480
So, we put him on

471
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,480
an anti-parasitic.

472
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,210
That should

473
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,210
clear him up, right?

474
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,370
The worms have reached

475
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,370
the surface of his skin.

476
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,950
I'd say he's in

477
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,950
a hyperinfective state.

478
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,960
Ms. Goodwin,

479
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,660
I'm sorry,

480
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,660
but most patients

481
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,660
don't survive this.

482
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,560
I don't want you two

483
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,560
throwing in the towel

484
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,560
before we've even started.

485
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,030
Ms. Goodwin, we're just

486
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,030
presenting our

487
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,030
medical opinion.

488
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,130
I don't want your opinion.

489
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,130
I want you to

490
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,130
keep him alive.

491
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,910
So, what'd you find?

492
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,040
Uh, MRSA's

493
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,040
definitely a possibility.

494
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,980
But it's hard to confirm

495
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,980
without a detailed history.

496
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,940
Is there any family

497
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,940
we could talk to?

498
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,720
You know, so far,

499
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,720
nobody that seems

500
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,350
to be in the picture,

501
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,350
but we're still trying.

502
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,820
Then I'll grow some cultures

503
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,820
and fill in the rest

504
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,820
of the puzzle myself.

505
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,760
Look,

506
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,760
before you go, um,

507
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,460
your mom told me

508
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,460
you just broke up

509
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,460
with your boyfriend.

510
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,760
Wow.

511
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,760
I'm sorry. You keep

512
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,760
canceling coffee.

513
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,630
We'll get to it.

514
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,630
Okay.

515
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,870
Look, it's so not

516
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,870
a big deal, but I got

517
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,870
this thing in my office,

518
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,770
it's a pashmina

519
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,770
scarf, you know?

520
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,110
It's been up there

521
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,110
for a while.

522
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,840
We could go up

523
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,840
and get it.

524
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,840
Thank you, Dad.

525
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,010
But I really gotta

526
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,010
get cracking on this.

527
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,010
Of course, you do.

528
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,400
Maybe later.

529
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,880
Kids. People say

530
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,880
the hardest part

531
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
is when they decide

532
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
they don't need you anymore.

533
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,450
Oh, yeah.

534
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,320
Daniel? Daniel, Daniel.

535
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,320
Where are they taking me?

536
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,360
My friend, Dr. Berger,

537
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,360
Alvin, is taking you

538
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,360
upstairs for a quick test.

539
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,230
Gonna take about

540
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,230
five minutes.

541
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,230
No, please.

542
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,290
Please, don't leave me,

543
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,290
Daniel. Please,

544
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,290
don't leave me.

545
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,500
Okay. All right.

546
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:37,410
Listen, Pamela, Dr. Berger,

547
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:37,410
Alvin, really knows

548
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:37,410
what he's doing,

549
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,450
and this is gonna

550
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,450
literally take about

551
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,450
five minutes, okay?

552
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,880
Why don't I take you

553
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,880
upstairs and get you

554
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,880
settled, okay?

555
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,490
Okay.

556
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,490
Okay, here we go.

557
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,270
So, when did

558
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,270
the bleeding start?

559
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,630
This morning.

560
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,630
Couldn't have

561
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,630
come at a worse time.

562
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,140
I don't get 10,000

563
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,140
lines of code written

564
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,140
by the end of the week,

565
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,570
my VC's gonna pull

566
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,570
our series B round.

567
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,070
Series B?

568
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,740
That's pre-IPO.

569
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,850
Besides the bleed,

570
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,850
anything else

571
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,850
bothering you?

572
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,010
Uh, I've got

573
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,010
this headache,

574
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,050
but that's probably

575
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,050
from staring at a screen

576
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,050
for the last 48 hours.

577
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,810
Any history of

578
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,810
autoimmune disorders

579
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,810
or cancer in the family?

580
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,950
Nada.

581
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,320
Any past addiction,

582
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,320
drug use?

583
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,260
Only thing I'm addicted to

584
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,260
is my work.

585
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,000
Seen hundreds

586
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,000
of bleeds in my day,

587
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,730
most of them

588
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,730
from far worse

589
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,730
places than a nose.

590
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,900
Just try to relax, Eliot.

591
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,700
We're gonna get you

592
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,700
all fixed up.

593
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,740
Protective custody?

594
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,740
Mmm-hmm.

595
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,170
We don't have

596
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,170
a suspect, much less

597
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,170
an open investigation.

598
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,880
We legally can't

599
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,880
protect Danny,

600
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,180
unless he gives us

601
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,180
information about the

602
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,180
people who held him captive.

603
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,240
So, talk to him.

604
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,240
I did. I tried.

605
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,150
I went to the shelter

606
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,150
and he wouldn't talk to me.

607
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,350
Well, now, he's gonna

608
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,350
have to sleep on

609
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,350
the street tonight.

610
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,650
Are you okay with that?

611
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,360
No, of course not.

612
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,620
So, can we talk

613
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,620
to him together?

614
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,500
'Cause maybe he'll

615
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,500
open up with me there.

616
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,830
Let's give it a shot.

617
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,830
Okay.

618
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,940
Did you ever hear any of them

619
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,940
call each other by a name,

620
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,940
or a nickname?

621
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,780
Look, you don't have

622
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,780
to be afraid anymore.

623
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,780
You can help us catch them.

624
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,250
Detective

625
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,250
Lindsay's our friend.

626
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,320
If you answer her questions,

627
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,320
she can keep you safe.

628
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,360
It might be a small

629
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,360
detail you remember

630
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,960
about the place

631
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,960
that they kept you.

632
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,770
A landmark,

633
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,770
or any unusual sounds.

634
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,610
My stomach hurts.

635
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,620
I'm gonna let you rest, okay?

636
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,620
You can call me anytime.

637
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,880
I'll be right back, Danny.

638
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,490
He's not ready.

639
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,400
He's obviously terrified.

640
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,030
And I wish that I could help,

641
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,030
but my hands are tied here.

642
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,760
Let me know if

643
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,760
he changes his mind.

644
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,760
Okay.

645
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,730
Good luck.

646
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,180
Hey.

647
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,280
So, Tate stepped up.

648
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,120
What made you finally

649
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,120
accept the man's proposal?

650
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,320
He's been so great

651
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,320
through everything.

652
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,430
And now that it seems

653
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,430
like the TB's gonna

654
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,430
remain inactive, I...

655
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,630
Did you two resolve

656
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,630
all the other issues?

657
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,260
Issues?

658
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,730
You told me that

659
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,730
he didn't want

660
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,730
you working anymore.

661
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,600
Oh, that...

662
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,600
That was just one time.

663
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,840
You didn't discuss it?

664
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,540
How about his ex-wife?

665
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,540
Or you becoming a stepmom?

666
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,610
We talk about

667
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,610
everything, and

668
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,610
I love him. I mean...

669
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,180
This is the happiest day

670
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,180
of my life, and

671
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,180
you're pissing on it.

672
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,920
That's not what I'm doing.

673
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,620
You know what?

674
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,620
Next time you feel

675
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,620
the need to weigh in, don't.

676
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,650
What?

677
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,190
I thought I made it

678
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,190
out of 'Nam alive.

679
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,000
I didn't know there

680
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,000
was a 40-year delay

681
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,000
on that grenade.

682
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,830
Don't talk

683
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,830
like that, Reggie.

684
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,270
I'm a newsman.

685
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,270
Mordant humor

686
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,270
comes with the job.

687
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,050
Do you remember that time

688
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,050
we watched the sun rise

689
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,050
at Rainbow Beach?

690
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,950
Yeah.

691
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,890
Stayed up all night.

692
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,890
All night.

693
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,560
It was good you

694
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,560
brought that flask

695
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,560
of Hennessy to keep us warm.

696
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,620
Corrupting a minor.

697
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,620
Indeed.

698
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,330
Listen, about

699
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,330
when you left...

700
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,840
We were just in

701
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,840
different places

702
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,840
in our lives.

703
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,510
Chalk it up

704
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,510
to bad timing.

705
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,720
I heard through

706
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,720
the grapevine that

707
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,720
you got married.

708
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,890
I did. We had a good run.

709
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,890
But now, we're separated.

710
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,430
I'm really sorry

711
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,430
about that.

712
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,130
Maybe...

713
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,760
Maybe our timing

714
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,730
will be better

715
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,730
this go-round.

716
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,670
Sharon.

717
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,540
Reggie?

718
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,510
Reggie?

719
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,510
I can't...

720
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,690
I need some help in here!

721
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,990
BP's diving.

722
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,990
What happened?

723
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,120
Gastric hemorrhage.

724
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,490
Let's get him on

725
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,490
the rapid transfuser.

726
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,460
Two of red cells,

727
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,460
two of plasma, and

728
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,460
a five pack of platelets.

729
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,020
I need an NG tube.

730
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,020
Got it.

731
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,630
Here, Nat.

732
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,860
Excuse me.

733
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,180
I need cold saline.

734
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,180
Yes, Doctor.

735
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,280
Reggie? Reggie,

736
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,280
stay with me, I'm here.

737
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,920
It's not clearing.

738
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,530
Start a PPI drip,

739
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,530
vasopressin, and page GI.

740
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,900
We need to get

741
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,900
control of this bleed.

742
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,990
On it.

743
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,980
GI's got his bleeding

744
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,980
under control, but his

745
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,980
sats are down to 88,

746
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,760
his lungs are deteriorating.

747
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,220
So, what now?

748
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,960
We'll see how

749
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,960
he responds to the

750
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,960
inhaled nitric oxide.

751
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,960
He's on a PEEP of 10.

752
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,960
There's still

753
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,960
room to increase.

754
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,070
If his sats don't improve,

755
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,070
we might consider

756
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,070
a paralytic drip.

757
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,000
So, we do still

758
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,000
have some options.

759
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,110
Why don't we

760
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,110
put him on ECMO?

761
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,210
Oh, I don't want to

762
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,210
speak for Dr. Choi,

763
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,970
but while putting him

764
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,970
on ECMO might

765
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,970
protect his lungs,

766
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,940
it wouldn't be

767
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,940
addressing

768
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,940
the inflammation

769
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,140
affecting the

770
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,140
rest of his organs.

771
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,380
I agree. ECMO might

772
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,380
buy us a little time,

773
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,120
but it won't help

774
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,120
him fight off

775
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,120
the hyperinfection.

776
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,320
So, you're against it?

777
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,320
Both of you?

778
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,090
Yeah.

779
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,090
That's right.

780
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,620
See what else you

781
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,620
can come up with.

782
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,460
It'd be nice to get

783
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,460
ahead of this thing

784
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,300
instead of always

785
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,300
playing from behind.

786
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,880
Hey, Dr. Charles,

787
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,880
I just got off

788
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,880
the phone with cardiology.

789
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,940
Your patient, Pamela,

790
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,940
they just confirmed.

791
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,940
Endocarditis.

792
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,520
They, um, they putting

793
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,520
her on antibiotics?

794
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,120
No, the plan is to

795
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,120
remove the vegetations,

796
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,120
and reconstruct her aorta.

797
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,890
She's going

798
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,890
into surgery now.

799
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,020
Surgery?

800
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,020
Who authorized that?

801
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,530
Hey, Dr. Vanilla Latte.

802
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,830
I need to collect

803
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,830
another blood sample

804
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
from Pamela. I can't

805
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
grow a decent culture.

806
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,770
I can do you one better.

807
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,770
I can get you

808
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,770
the infected valve itself.

809
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,840
Great.

810
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,840
I'm scrubbing in.

811
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,140
Once again,

812
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,140
we're in the same place

813
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,700
at the same time,

814
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,700
wanting the same thing.

815
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,480
Would you care to run that

816
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,480
through your calculator?

817
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

818
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,550
What's going on here?

819
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,750
Evidently, there's

820
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,750
an issue with consent.

821
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,750
Surgery's been canceled.

822
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,150
Canceled by who?

823
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,150
By me.

824
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,250
Hey, Pamela.

825
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,070
Now, I laid out

826
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,070
everything for her.

827
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,990
I explained the risks,

828
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,990
her alternative.

829
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,370
I have her signature

830
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,370
right here.

831
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,830
That scrawl?

832
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,530
Doesn't matter if you

833
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,530
approve of her penmanship,

834
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,530
I have her consent.

835
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,000
Not her

836
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,000
informed consent.

837
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,180
She's way too impaired

838
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,180
to make that kind of

839
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,180
decision right now.

840
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,070
So, you're gonna

841
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,070
make the decision for her?

842
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,680
We can't get the consent

843
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,680
that you are insisting on

844
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,920
without first

845
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,920
performing surgery.

846
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,450
Sounds like a catch-22.

847
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
She needs the surgery.

848
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
It's urgent and necessary.

849
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,990
Of course you think that.

850
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,990
You're a surgeon.

851
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,250
Your inherent bias

852
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,250
is to cut.

853
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,390
What about you, the shrink?

854
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,390
You don't have a bias?

855
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,830
Well, I'm not afraid

856
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,830
to admit that I'm biased.

857
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,700
My job gets a lot easier

858
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,700
if I can get my hands

859
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,700
on that infected valve.

860
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,470
You know what?

861
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,470
Unfortunately,

862
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,470
not really open for debate.

863
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,570
Performing surgery

864
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,570
without actual

865
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,570
informed consent

866
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,070
is by law, assault.

867
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,740
I mean, you should

868
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,740
thank me, Doctor.

869
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,070
I'm trying to save you

870
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,070
a lot of legal bills.

871
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,710
Well, Dr. Charles, I hope

872
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,710
that when you're done

873
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,710
trying to prove a point,

874
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,510
I still have time

875
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,510
to save her.

876
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,650
Now, if you'll excuse me.

877
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,950
I'm gonna need to

878
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,950
remove that, okay?

879
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,160
All right.

880
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,160
Do your thing, Doc.

881
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,360
Looks like

882
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,360
the bleeding subsided.

883
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,130
Hey, what do you

884
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,130
call that thing again?

885
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,930
A Rhino Rocket.

886
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,930
Cool.

887
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,500
All right,

888
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,500
what do I owe you?

889
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,110
$350, flat rate.

890
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,470
Sounds fair to me.

891
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,470
You got a Square?

892
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,470
Sure do.

893
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,710
Now, before we

894
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,710
finish up, have you

895
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,710
gone swimming lately?

896
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,380
Specifically

897
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,380
in fresh water?

898
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,590
Yeah, I got a couple

899
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,590
acres lakeside up in

900
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,590
Lake Geneva. Why?

901
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,950
Yeah, I'd like to bring

902
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,950
you back to the ED

903
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,950
with us for more tests.

904
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,590
Wait, the hospital?

905
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,560
Guys, er, I'm kind of busy

906
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,560
here. I thought we got

907
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,560
this all fixed up.

908
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,000
We did, probably,

909
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,000
and I'm 95% sure

910
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,000
it isn't serious.

911
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,260
What isn't serious?

912
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,300
Well, there's an infection

913
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,300
I'd like to rule out,

914
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,300
naegleriasis.

915
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,830
And that's

916
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,830
extremely unlikely.

917
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,100
Excuse me, Dr. Halstead,

918
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,100
can I speak with you

919
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,100
for a moment?

920
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,040
Excuse us.

921
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,030
Really, uh, you think

922
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,030
he caught a warm-water

923
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,030
amoeba

924
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,590
in a Wisconsin lake

925
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,590
in October?

926
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,000
Tell me it hasn't been

927
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,000
unseasonably hot lately.

928
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,830
And it would explain

929
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,830
the persistent nose bleeds.

930
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,400
But this app is

931
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,400
about convenience.

932
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,200
Dragging our customers

933
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,200
into the ED

934
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,070
cuts against the value

935
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,070
proposition, okay?

936
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,100
First rule of

937
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,100
customer service.

938
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,780
A satisfied customer

939
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,780
tells two people.

940
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,750
A dissatisfied one

941
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,750
tells 2,000.

942
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,370
I minored in econ,

943
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,370
Noah, I get it.

944
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,320
But surely,

945
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,320
what our customers want

946
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,010
above anything else

947
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,010
is to get better, no?

948
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,210
Of course...

949
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,210
Not to mention

950
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,050
if we suspect something

951
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,050
and don't test for it...

952
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,090
Talk about liability.

953
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,820
A brain-eating amoeba?

954
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,820
You really think

955
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,820
I might have this?

956
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,870
You didn't find me

957
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,870
a place to stay.

958
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,370
No. Not yet.

959
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,640
I'm gonna recommend

960
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,640
admitting you

961
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,640
for the night

962
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,310
if the pain in your

963
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,310
stomach doesn't subside.

964
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,750
My stomach's actually

965
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,750
feeling a little better.

966
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,650
If anyone asks, just

967
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,650
keep saying that it hurts.

968
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,220
Are you angry with me?

969
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,090
What? No... No. I just

970
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,090
want you to stay safe.

971
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,360
I'll, uh, I'll check

972
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,360
back in with you soon.

973
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,400
I... I have an idea.

974
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,670
I could stay at

975
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,670
your place tonight.

976
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,030
If you're worried

977
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,030
about me using,

978
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,040
then don't be.

979
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,040
I'm totally clean. I...

980
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,640
I could sleep on the couch,

981
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,640
or the floor, even.

982
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,570
You'd hardly even

983
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,570
know I was there.

984
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,390
Danny, I don't...

985
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,950
I get it. Never mind.

986
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,220
No, no.

987
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,220
You just, uh...

988
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,050
You caught me off guard.

989
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,050
No, please, I've seen

990
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,050
that look before.

991
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,890
You don't want someone

992
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,890
like me staying at your place.

993
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,060
I'm trash.

994
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,060
No.

995
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,330
The hospital has

996
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,330
strict policies

997
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,170
about doctor-patient

998
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,170
relationships,

999
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,500
and I'm just

1000
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,500
a first-year resident.

1001
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,540
I will figure

1002
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,540
something out, okay?

1003
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,080
Okay.

1004
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,320
There you go.

1005
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,250
Okay.

1006
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,820
Okay,

1007
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,820
let's lift. Yep.

1008
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,260
Don't move him like that.

1009
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,260
If you want him more

1010
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,260
upright, adjust the bed.

1011
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,800
I'm sorry, Ms. Goodwin.

1012
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,800
I'll do it myself.

1013
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,630
I'm gonna go check on

1014
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,630
the latest blood gas.

1015
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,370
I've never seen

1016
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,370
Goodwin like this before.

1017
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,520
Nat, all I know is that

1018
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,410
when Sharon was graduating

1019
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,410
from high school,

1020
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,080
Reggie came back from 'Nam.

1021
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,520
They practically spent

1022
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,520
the entire summer together.

1023
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,910
It was her first real love.

1024
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,030
So, why didn't it

1025
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,030
work out?

1026
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,490
Well, Reggie wanted her

1027
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,490
to travel the world with him,

1028
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,030
but Sharon was going

1029
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,030
to college in the fall,

1030
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,970
and then Bert came along

1031
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,970
and there was just...

1032
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,100
If you had listened

1033
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,100
to me earlier, we wouldn't

1034
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,100
be out of options.

1035
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,340
I'm sorry,

1036
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,340
Ms. Goodwin.

1037
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,470
What's going on?

1038
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,170
The infiltrate's

1039
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,170
in Reggie's lungs.

1040
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,370
Complete white out.

1041
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,370
They're

1042
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,370
barely functioning.

1043
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,210
So, what do we do now?

1044
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,880
Ms. Goodwin, the condition

1045
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,880
his lungs are in,

1046
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,440
there's very little

1047
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,440
hope for recovery.

1048
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,020
We should try to

1049
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,020
make him comfortable.

1050
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,110
What about ECMO?

1051
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,250
I'm afraid all ECMO will do

1052
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,250
is delay the inevitable.

1053
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,490
I have been listening

1054
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,490
to your advice all day,

1055
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,490
and look where we are.

1056
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,930
Ms. Goodwin, all due respect,

1057
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,930
both Dr. Manning and I

1058
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,470
are telling you that

1059
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,470
it isn't gonna help.

1060
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,180
Your concerns

1061
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,180
are noted, Dr. Choi.

1062
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,180
Put him on ECMO.

1063
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,270
I can assign this case

1064
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,270
to another doctor,

1065
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,680
if you prefer.

1066
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,680
Sharon.

1067
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,510
We'll do it.

1068
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,120
What?

1069
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,120
We will put

1070
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,120
Reggie on ECMO.

1071
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,690
Call up to the ICU.

1072
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,290
I'll take care of

1073
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,290
the arrangements myself.

1074
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,110
Thank you, April.

1075
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,110
Yeah.

1076
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,040
Hey, what did Dr. Halstead

1077
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,040
order in there?

1078
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,550
Er, CBC, metabolic panel,

1079
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,550
urinalysis, sed rate

1080
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,550
and a head CT.

1081
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,980
Oh, man. Can...

1082
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,980
Can we scale that back?

1083
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,250
Or is there some kind of

1084
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,250
employee discount

1085
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,250
I'm eligible for?

1086
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,420
It's not coming out

1087
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,420
of your pocket, is it?

1088
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,890
It's gonna come

1089
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,890
out of somebody's.

1090
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,990
Well,

1091
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,990
talk to Will about it.

1092
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,390
I already tried.

1093
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,130
You know, why'd I think

1094
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,130
it'd be a good idea

1095
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,700
to hire my attending,

1096
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,700
you know?

1097
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,830
How am I gonna

1098
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,830
be his boss

1099
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,670
when he knows more

1100
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,670
about medicine than I do?

1101
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,970
It looks like he's

1102
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,970
getting along with

1103
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,970
your client really well.

1104
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,370
We'll see.

1105
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,370
I've gotta work on

1106
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,370
my managerial skills.

1107
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,740
Wait a second.

1108
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,740
Is that...

1109
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,280
Oh. Yeah.

1110
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,620
Oh, yeah!

1111
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,610
This is... This is huge...

1112
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,610
Oh, no, what is he

1113
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,610
up to now?

1114
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,830
Oh, um...

1115
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,920
Let's celebrate

1116
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,920
later, okay?

1117
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,920
Okay.

1118
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,260
All right.

1119
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,030
Oh!

1120
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,470
Excuse me, sorry.

1121
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,330
Oh, April, listen.

1122
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,330
About earlier, sorry.

1123
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,470
Don't worry about it.

1124
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,470
Okay.

1125
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,070
No, really.

1126
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,270
It's not the first time

1127
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,270
my mouth's gotten me

1128
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,270
in trouble.

1129
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,540
I shouldn't

1130
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,540
have said anything.

1131
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,740
I was just trying

1132
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,740
to protect you.

1133
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,680
I've had so long

1134
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,680
to think about this,

1135
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,120
and what Tate

1136
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,120
and I have is real.

1137
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,850
Well, okay.

1138
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,850
In that case,

1139
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,960
if you need anyone

1140
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,960
to go dress shopping

1141
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,960
with, I'm available.

1142
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,570
Danny wants to

1143
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,570
stay at your place?

1144
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,430
Yeah.

1145
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,910
I mean, makes

1146
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,910
perfect sense, right?

1147
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,840
I mean, now that

1148
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,840
he's free of the traffickers,

1149
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,350
there's this big void

1150
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,350
in his life,

1151
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,440
which he wants

1152
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,440
to fill with you.

1153
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,340
Obviously, it can't

1154
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,340
be entertained.

1155
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,950
Then again, rejecting

1156
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,950
him now could

1157
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,950
just be reinforcing

1158
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,120
the abandonment issues

1159
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,120
he's already feeling.

1160
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,980
Wait.

1161
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,260
Did you come here

1162
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,260
to ask my permission?

1163
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,560
The system's incapable

1164
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,560
of keeping a roof

1165
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,560
over his head.

1166
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,860
We can't let him

1167
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,860
sleep on the streets.

1168
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,860
It's too dangerous.

1169
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,990
It'd be just

1170
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,990
for the one night.

1171
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,160
Dr. Reese, having

1172
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,160
a patient stay

1173
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,160
in your home?

1174
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,470
Maintaining

1175
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,470
professional boundaries

1176
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,030
is a fundamental part

1177
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,030
of our work.

1178
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,410
Again, to protect

1179
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,410
both our patients...

1180
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,910
I'm sorry, but I don't

1181
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,910
see any other options.

1182
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,910
Sarah.

1183
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,450
Sarah!

1184
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,150
Sarah.

1185
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,830
Hey, does this look

1186
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,830
like it'll fit Danny?

1187
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,300
I guess. Listen,

1188
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,300
about Danny...

1189
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,660
Oh, could you

1190
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,660
do me a favor?

1191
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,890
See if they have

1192
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,890
any extra blankets

1193
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,890
in the store room,

1194
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,630
I wanna take some home.

1195
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,030
Where is he?

1196
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,510
I'm sorry,

1197
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,510
I tried to stop him,

1198
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,280
but he was so desperate

1199
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,280
to get out of here.

1200
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,610
Did he say where

1201
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,610
he was going?

1202
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,850
Just said that

1203
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,850
he was going back

1204
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,850
where he belongs.

1205
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,620
He's gone. I never

1206
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,620
should have hesitated.

1207
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,030
I knew

1208
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,030
it wouldn't help

1209
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,030
and so did you.

1210
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,540
I figured we had

1211
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,540
safety in numbers.

1212
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,010
I know.

1213
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,880
But if we'd had

1214
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,880
an alternative plan

1215
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,880
to save his life,

1216
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,740
yeah, I would've

1217
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,740
held firm with you.

1218
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,980
But we didn't.

1219
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,150
So, we tried

1220
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,150
the Hail Mary.

1221
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,660
And Goodwin knows

1222
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,660
that we did everything

1223
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,660
we could for her.

1224
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,690
For her?

1225
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,490
Goodwin's not our

1226
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,490
patient, Reggie is.

1227
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,490
Right now, he's suffering.

1228
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,000
Best thing we could've

1229
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,000
done for him

1230
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,100
was to let him

1231
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,100
die with dignity.

1232
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,820
Ms. Goodwin?

1233
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,220
You're here to

1234
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,220
tell me my options.

1235
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,020
I just wanted to know

1236
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,020
if you needed anything.

1237
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,790
No. I'm fine.

1238
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,600
Okay.

1239
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,900
What is it about

1240
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,900
first love that just

1241
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,100
sticks with you.

1242
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,740
It's like...

1243
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,370
It's like those last

1244
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,370
40 years don't even exist.

1245
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,150
One day, he's saying

1246
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,150
goodbye to me,

1247
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,590
and the next,

1248
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,590
he's showing up

1249
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,590
here on a gurney.

1250
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,700
Reggie Dixon.

1251
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,700
These machines

1252
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,700
aren't gonna save him.

1253
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,270
No.

1254
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,110
Yeah.

1255
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,750
Excuse me,

1256
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,750
Ms. Goodwin?

1257
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,760
I've collected

1258
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,760
two signatures.

1259
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,200
One from my attending,

1260
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,200
Dr. Latham,

1261
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,670
the other from Dr. Walters,

1262
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,670
Director of Cardiology.

1263
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,300
I don't care if

1264
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,300
you have 200 signatures,

1265
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,670
it doesn't change the fact

1266
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,670
the patient is too impaired

1267
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,450
to consent to

1268
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,450
a high-risk surgery.

1269
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,350
They were both

1270
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,350
willing to sign

1271
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,350
their names

1272
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,580
to the opinion

1273
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,580
that Pamela's

1274
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,580
surgery is, indeed,

1275
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,550
both urgent and necessary.

1276
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,920
This is

1277
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,920
a blatant end around.

1278
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,890
It's just legal cover

1279
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,890
to keep us all

1280
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,890
from getting sued.

1281
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,890
Am I actually the only person

1282
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,890
who's got this girl's

1283
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,890
best interest at heart?

1284
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,260
Are you

1285
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,260
sure the surgery

1286
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,630
is the best course

1287
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,630
of action?

1288
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,630
Yes.

1289
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,020
And you're confident

1290
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,020
you can fix it?

1291
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,020
I am.

1292
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,930
Then go do it.

1293
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,930
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

1294
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,400
Mmm-hmm.

1295
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,970
Wait, wait, wait.

1296
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,970
Are you kidding me,

1297
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,970
Sharon?

1298
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,640
You're gonna let

1299
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,640
a couple of surgeons

1300
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,940
tell you who's

1301
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,940
mentally competent?

1302
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm the chief psychiatrist

1303
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,000
in the building.

1304
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,610
It's a double doc.

1305
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,610
That overrides you,

1306
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,610
Daniel.

1307
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,810
So, we're just

1308
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,810
running this hospital

1309
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,810
by majority rule now?

1310
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,290
No, no, no. But after

1311
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,290
the day I've had,

1312
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,450
I'm wary of challenging

1313
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,450
the collective wisdom

1314
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,450
of our doctors.

1315
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,090
Okay, okay.

1316
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,090
So, let's just set

1317
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,090
the law aside for now.

1318
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,890
Are we abandoning

1319
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,890
the ethical argument

1320
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,890
altogether, as well?

1321
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,470
It's done, Daniel.

1322
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,230
If you want to file

1323
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,230
a complaint, be my guest.

1324
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,210
Mr. Kaplan,

1325
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,210
Eliot, good news.

1326
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,980
Test came back negative.

1327
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,980
You don't have naegleriasis.

1328
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,440
My brain's not being

1329
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,440
eaten by an amoeba.

1330
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,510
I guess that's

1331
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,510
a good thing.

1332
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,510
Yeah.

1333
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,680
We're all about

1334
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,680
customer satisfaction.

1335
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,350
Okay, so all in,

1336
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,350
it comes

1337
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,090
to $2,134.68.

1338
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,930
You told me

1339
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,930
it would be $350.

1340
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,330
Well, there was the,

1341
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,330
uh, the blood panel...

1342
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,330
Mmm-hmm.

1343
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,510
Urinalysis, er, CT Scan.

1344
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,130
It's all in our

1345
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,130
terms and conditions.

1346
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,130
Wait a minute.

1347
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,540
You're upcharging me

1348
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,540
for something

1349
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,540
I don't even have.

1350
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,410
Well, it's a good thing

1351
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,410
we ran those tests.

1352
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,300
We did find your

1353
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,300
liver function markers

1354
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,300
slightly elevated.

1355
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,880
Now, a good excuse

1356
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,880
to cut back on

1357
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,880
your alcohol intake.

1358
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,920
Now, you're telling me

1359
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,920
I'm an alcoholic.

1360
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,050
Just get me

1361
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,050
out of here. Okay?

1362
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,190
Um...

1363
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,960
Would you like me to

1364
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,960
email you the receipt?

1365
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,790
See that?

1366
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,200
Congratulations.

1367
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,200
You just went anti-viral.

1368
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,670
I didn't expect that.

1369
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,640
I thought

1370
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,640
he'd be relieved.

1371
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,210
Yeah, uh, it's,

1372
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,210
uh, it's hard.

1373
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,270
Concierge patients.

1374
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,420
You know, you were just

1375
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,420
trying to be thorough.

1376
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,520
Yeah, thanks. Listen,

1377
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,520
Noah, I appreciate

1378
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,520
the opportunity,

1379
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,530
but maybe this

1380
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,530
just isn't for me.

1381
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,990
Really?

1382
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,990
Yeah.

1383
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,630
Damn, I'm sorry

1384
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,630
to hear that.

1385
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,170
If I'm leaving you

1386
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,170
in a tight spot,

1387
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,640
I can stay on until

1388
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,640
you find someone...

1389
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,670
Oh, no, no. I appreciate it,

1390
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,670
but I think I can handle it.

1391
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,050
Pamela?

1392
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,590
Pamela Blake. How you doing?

1393
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,590
I just came to see how

1394
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,590
everything was going.

1395
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,160
Much better, thank you.

1396
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,590
Great. I'm really

1397
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,590
glad to hear it.

1398
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,300
I'm sorry, you are?

1399
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,900
I'm Dr. Charles.

1400
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,900
Daniel. We, um...

1401
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,010
We met earlier today

1402
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,010
when you got to the

1403
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,010
hospital, you remember?

1404
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,650
Oh, yeah. Right, yeah.

1405
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,850
Yeah. Okay, well,

1406
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,850
I'm happy to see

1407
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,850
you're doing so well.

1408
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,960
Glad to see she's

1409
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,960
finally coming around.

1410
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,660
Yeah.

1411
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,930
We're gonna have to

1412
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,930
agree to disagree on

1413
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,930
this one, aren't we?

1414
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,670
Yeah, we can just disagree,

1415
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,670
too. That'd be all right.

1416
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Hey, Connor,

1417
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,540
the lab ID'd the bacteria

1418
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,540
from her infected valve.

1419
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,780
Q fever?

1420
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,780
Mmm-hmm.

1421
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,980
She works on a dairy farm

1422
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,980
down-state on weekends.

1423
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,750
I'm heading down

1424
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,750
to the cafeteria

1425
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,750
to write up my report

1426
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,220
for the health department.

1427
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,350
If you're free, I was

1428
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,350
hoping you might help me

1429
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,350
fill in a few details.

1430
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,830
Uh, yeah, I just have to

1431
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,830
sign over a few patients.

1432
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,590
I'll meet you

1433
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,590
down there in 10?

1434
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,370
Great.

1435
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,070
You wanted to know

1436
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,070
why I broke up

1437
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,070
with my boyfriend.

1438
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,620
He was too soft.

1439
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,620
He rolled over every time

1440
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,620
we had a fight.

1441
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,940
But that guy,

1442
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,940
though.

1443
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,450
Anyway, I better

1444
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,450
get downstairs.

1445
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,450
See you later?

1446
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,460
Are you ready?

1447
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,420
Time of death, 20:53.

1448
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,590
Hey, hear anything

1449
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,590
from Detective Lindsay?

1450
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,390
Not yet.

1451
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,790
Hang in there.

1452
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,790
The kid's a survivor.

1453
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,790
PD will find him.

1454
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,630
I'm not just gonna sit

1455
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,630
around and do nothing.

1456
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,520
What, you're gonna go

1457
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,520
out looking for him?

1458
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,690
Come on, Sarah,

1459
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,690
it's a big city. Sarah.

1460
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,180
Give me a minute.

1461
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,180
I'll come with you.

1462
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,680
He offered me

1463
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,680
stock options.

1464
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,620
Stock options?

1465
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,620
And you turned him down?

1466
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,880
Yeah, I know.

1467
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,890
I'm kind of kicking

1468
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,890
myself a little,

1469
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,890
but it's not for me.

1470
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,890
I'll figure out another

1471
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,890
way to make some cash.

1472
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,890
Or just save some.

1473
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,030
How about you

1474
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,030
move in with me?

1475
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,030
Nina, come on.

1476
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,460
I appreciate the offer,

1477
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,460
but if I'm gonna

1478
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,460
move in with you,

1479
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,010
I don't want it to

1480
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,010
be because of money.

1481
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,370
It's not about

1482
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,370
the money.

1483
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,010
It's because I really think

1484
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,010
this has a chance to work.

1485
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,350
So, what do you say?

1486
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,960
It's $8.50.

1487
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,960
Thanks.

1488
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,790
Thank you.

1489
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,790
Let me give you a hand.

1490
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,330
All right.

1491
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,100
Hey, April, you okay?

1492
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,770
You sure?

1493
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,720
April, you're burning up.

1494
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,250
Sorry.

1495
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,250
All right, thank you.

1496
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,220
Thank you.
