1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,730
Morning.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,470
I have to pick up

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,470
Owen at Helen's

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,470
before work.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,210
Yeah, I get it.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,240
You know, um...

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,410
Last night was...

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,410
It was really great.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,510
Yeah, it was.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,450
Huh.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,270
I don't think I've

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,270
seen this one before.

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,430
Helmand Province.

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,810
That was our last

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,810
deployment together.

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,840
Wow.

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,580
Jeff looks so young.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,980
Hey, we're good, right?

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,130
Of course.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,130
Okay.

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,920
Good.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,370
Bye.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,370
See ya.

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,800
This is what I always

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,800
carried in the field.

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,040
Gear for fluid resuscitation,

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,040
hemorrhage control,

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,450
airway management,

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,450
basic meds,

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,450
including OTCs.

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,820
Always have lots of Pepto.

32
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,050
Oh, and tape.

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,150
Can never have too much tape.

34
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,890
Yes, sir.

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,260
It's, uh, a lot

36
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,260
to take in.

37
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,450
I know. When do you deploy?

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,660
Um, twelve weeks, sir.

39
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,270
Look, nothing really

40
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,270
prepares you for war.

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,370
But a day in Chicago,

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,370
the number of gunshots we see,

43
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,140
the Navy sending corpsmen for

44
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,140
a rotation in the ED

45
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,140
is a pretty good primer.

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,440
What's that, sir?

47
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,280
Is it a quick

48
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,280
reference guide?

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,410
Case notes from the field.

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,410
Things I thought

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,410
I shouldn't forget.

52
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,490
Dr. Choi,

53
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,490
we got a drive-up and drop.

54
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,530
Corpsman, with me.

55
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,530
Sir.

56
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,130
All right. I got you,

57
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,130
buddy. I got you, okay?

58
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,130
Hey, what's your name?

59
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,060
Marco.

60
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,060
Marco. Marco, okay.

61
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,940
Okay, you stay with me.

62
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,940
We're gonna take care of you.

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,580
Single GSW.

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,580
Left flank thoracoabdomen.

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,580
No exit wound.

66
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,710
Weak pulse.

67
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,550
Corpsman, cut his shirt off.

68
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,550
Yes, sir.

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,190
Hey, hey. Corpsman,

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,190
what do you hear?

71
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,530
Come on. Hey.

72
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,900
I have weak breath

73
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,900
sounds on the left side.

74
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,330
Means the lung

75
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,330
is collapsed.

76
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,500
Air leaking out is

77
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,500
pressurizing his chest.

78
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,000
He's got

79
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,000
a tension pneumothorax.

80
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,130
Breath sounds

81
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,130
unilateral and tachycardic.

82
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,130
Needle the chest.

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
Hold the pressure.

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
Yes, sir.

85
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,570
In.

86
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,710
Okay. Breath

87
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,710
sounds improving.

88
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,250
Good.

89
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,250
Bring in a board.

90
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,050
All right.

91
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,050
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

92
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,020
All right,

93
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,020
let's move him

94
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,020
on my count.

95
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,250
One, two, three.

96
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,330
Jeff, let's get an

97
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,330
AP chest X-ray and

98
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,330
prep a chest tube.

99
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,420
Got it.

100
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,330
He said, "I'm only 18."

101
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,530
Welcome to Chi-raq.

102
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,270
All right, now, try to

103
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,270
stay off the hoverboard

104
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,340
for at least a week,

105
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,340
Hudson, okay?

106
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,600
Yeah?

107
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,600
Of course.

108
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,670
Bye. Thank you.

109
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,980
Hey, Gayle.

110
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,980
Taking your daily lap

111
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,980
around our gorgeous grounds?

112
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,150
Anything to get out of

113
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,150
the pediatric

114
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,150
ICU for a minute.

115
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,920
I swear, if I hear

116
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,920
another monitor beep,

117
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,250
I'm gonna nosedive

118
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,250
onto Michigan Avenue.

119
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,560
And how is little

120
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,560
Timmy doing?

121
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,060
Hey, cutie.

122
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,430
He's had a good month,

123
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,430
thanks to Dr. Rhodes.

124
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,330
I hoped we'd finally

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,330
get to go outside today.

126
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,330
He's a little wheezy.

127
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,760
Probably best we

128
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,760
head back upstairs.

129
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,760
Okay.

130
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,900
Dr. Manning?

131
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,900
It was nice

132
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,900
seeing you, Gayle.

133
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,960
You, too.

134
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,030
Right away.

135
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,340
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

136
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,240
Hi. My daughter, Alicia,

137
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,240
she stopped nursing.

138
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,240
She's only three months old.

139
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,570
Okay. Well, don't worry.

140
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,570
We'll figure out

141
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,570
what's going on.

142
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,880
Why don't you

143
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,880
follow me into the back?

144
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,880
I'll take the paperwork.

145
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,310
You guys want to

146
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,310
go in the back?

147
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,720
Yep.

148
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,720
All right.

149
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,050
Okay, I got

150
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,050
a new favorite,

151
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,050
Capgras Syndrome.

152
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,550
The belief

153
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,550
a familiar person

154
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,120
has been replaced

155
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,120
with a duplicate.

156
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,720
That's cool.

157
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,360
That was an

158
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,360
unenthusiastic response,

159
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,360
even for you.

160
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,830
Sorry.

161
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,630
It's the new

162
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,630
pathology resident, Mark.

163
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,060
Hmm?

164
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,470
He's in my head.

165
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,760
What's going on?

166
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,740
He's pushing really hard

167
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,740
to get drinks after work.

168
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,240
Hang out on the weekends.

169
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,240
Mmm-hmm.

170
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,250
Be pals.

171
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,250
It's uncomfortable.

172
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,540
Why? Are you worried

173
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,540
something bad will happen

174
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,380
if you become friends?

175
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,650
What? No, it's just

176
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,650
I'd rather be colleagues.

177
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,990
I've got enough friends.

178
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,890
Is there a limit to

179
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,890
the number of people

180
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,890
you can let into your life?

181
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,720
Maybe. Yeah.

182
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,020
What is all this?

183
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,290
Nothing. We're just talking.

184
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,560
Okay.

185
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,900
I've gotta get back.

186
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,100
Are we still on for dinner?

187
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,440
Yeah, sure.

188
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,850
She's gurgling a bit,

189
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,850
but there's no

190
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,850
obstruction in her throat.

191
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,380
She doesn't appear

192
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,380
too dehydrated, and

193
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,380
her membranes are moist.

194
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,550
When did she

195
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,550
stop nursing?

196
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,550
Yesterday.

197
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm gonna

198
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,920
put this up, okay?

199
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,430
I wasn't too worried at first.

200
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,430
My boys were

201
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,430
both finicky eaters.

202
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,590
But when she wouldn't nurse

203
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,590
at all today, then...

204
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,720
Any fever or vomiting?

205
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,820
No, none.

206
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,230
Um...

207
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,930
She's been a bit cranky.

208
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,770
She's been napping

209
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,770
longer than usual,

210
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,770
but that's about it.

211
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,640
Mama, I'm thirsty.

212
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,100
Okay, baby, we will

213
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,100
get you a drink

214
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,270
as soon as we speak

215
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,270
to the doctor, okay?

216
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,750
All right?

217
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,750
No, no, no. I'm so sorry.

218
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,420
Um, we go to the park

219
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,420
every day.

220
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,420
They're exhausted.

221
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,820
My husband will be

222
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,820
here to help any minute.

223
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,280
Don't worry about it.

224
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,950
Uh, let's get a CBC, CMP,

225
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,950
an abdominal

226
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,950
ultrasound and a babygram.

227
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,650
Yes, doctor.

228
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,650
Uh, a babygram?

229
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,750
Uh, an X-ray

230
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,750
of her entire body.

231
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,390
So, this could be serious.

232
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,420
There's no way to

233
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,420
know for sure just yet,

234
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,830
but I want to

235
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,830
cover all our bases.

236
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,760
I should've

237
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,760
brought her in sooner.

238
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,330
It's just with my

239
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,330
husband at work...

240
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,740
Look, you are

241
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,740
juggling three kids, okay?

242
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,740
I get it.

243
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,540
I only have one,

244
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,540
and it's a handful.

245
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,210
I will fill you in as

246
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,210
soon as we know anything.

247
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,940
Thank you.

248
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,920
No, Nina, I've ditched cable,

249
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,720
cut up my credit cards,

250
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,720
and have nothing left

251
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,720
to sell on Craigslist.

252
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,680
Yet, I'm still in

253
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,680
the hole each month

254
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,680
when the vig is due.

255
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,020
Easy there, Vegas.

256
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,360
It's med school loans

257
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,360
and malpractice insurance,

258
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,650
not a note from a bookie.

259
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,260
Either way, I'm broke.

260
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,000
Had to post an ad

261
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,000
for a roommate.

262
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,030
Here, look at this.

263
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,760
Come on,

264
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,760
it'll make you feel better.

265
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,370
What is it?

266
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,110
Molluscum contagiosum.

267
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,680
It's a type of pox virus.

268
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,350
It's a nasty one, actually.

269
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,350
Mmm.

270
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,910
Even so, stunning, right?

271
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,420
It's like 10 pounds

272
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,420
of raspberry rock candy

273
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,420
pressed into a five-pound bag.

274
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Come on, you must

275
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
have a day off, right?

276
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Go then.

277
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,070
It's summertime,

278
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,070
the animals are

279
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,070
really playful, you know?

280
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,070
Elephants are my favorite.

281
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,070
They're so soulful.

282
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,640
Okay, you sold me.

283
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,640
Yeah.

284
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,270
This Saturday,

285
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,270
I'm at the Lincoln Park Zoo.

286
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,370
Okay.

287
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,880
BP 126 over 82.

288
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,880
Heart rate 74. Sats 100%.

289
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,170
Hi, Mr. McGregor,

290
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,170
I'm Dr. Halstead.

291
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,240
I understand you fell,

292
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,240
hurt both wrists.

293
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,420
Yeah, just a

294
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,420
moment of clumsiness,

295
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,420
you know.

296
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,320
But they feel

297
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,320
better already now.

298
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,960
Don't be modest.

299
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,960
He's here. Let him help.

300
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,790
MR. McGREGOR: I put my

301
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,790
hands out just trying to

302
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,790
catch my fall, you know?

303
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,990
Mmm-hmm.

304
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,990
Yeah. Fifteen years

305
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,990
on the street.

306
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,630
I guess I'm not as fast

307
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,630
as I used to be. Yeah.

308
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,530
AP and lateral X-rays

309
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,530
of both wrists.

310
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,530
Okay.

311
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,930
Have you fallen before,

312
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,930
Mr. McGregor?

313
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,010
A few times.

314
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,010
So much action

315
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,010
in the city nowadays.

316
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,580
You stop paying

317
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,580
attention for a second,

318
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,580
bam!

319
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,770
Face plant.

320
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,970
Right.

321
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,880
Pretty big guy,

322
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,880
Dr. Halstead. Football?

323
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,680
Baseball.

324
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,910
Just a fan now, though.

325
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,550
Cubs or Sox?

326
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,710
Southside pride.

327
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,710
Sox all the way.

328
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,520
Ah! I'm a Cubs guy.

329
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,650
I won't hold it

330
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,650
against you.

331
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,990
Hmm.

332
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,990
Love Wrigley.

333
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,820
The way the ivy creeps along

334
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,820
the outfield wall.

335
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,430
You know,

336
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,430
perfect stripes mowed

337
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,430
right into the infield grass.

338
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,400
Breathtaking.

339
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,400
Mmm-hmm.

340
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,660
Do you stay

341
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,660
near the ball park?

342
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,470
During the season.

343
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,470
Sure, why not?

344
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,870
You know, it's fun

345
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,870
seeing the players

346
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,870
in person,

347
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,140
they're larger than life.

348
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,570
Moises Alou.

349
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,570
Sammy Sosa.

350
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,910
Oh, yeah? Wow.

351
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,650
Must be really exciting.

352
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,650
Oh, yeah!

353
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,890
Mr. McGregor,

354
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,890
after your X-rays,

355
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,890
I want to run an EKG.

356
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,650
It'll determine if

357
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,650
a cardiac event caused

358
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,650
your fall. Sound good?

359
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,320
Sure, yeah.

360
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,980
All right.

361
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,980
We'll see you soon.

362
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,330
You know, they haven't

363
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,330
had elephants

364
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,930
at the Lincoln

365
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,930
Park Zoo for ages.

366
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,230
Mmm-hmm.

367
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,260
You think he really met

368
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,260
those baseball players?

369
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,600
Not recently.

370
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,010
Alou and Sosa's last season

371
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,010
with the Cubs was in '04.

372
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,570
So, I guess maybe Mr. McGregor

373
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,570
could have seen them

374
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,570
outside the park, but...

375
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,980
Maybe not.

376
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,080
Unfortunately, homelessness

377
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,080
and mental illness

378
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,080
often go hand in hand.

379
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,020
I'll page Dr. Charles

380
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,020
for a consult.

381
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,150
Okay.

382
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,800
How's Marco doing, sir?

383
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,160
Bullet looks to have

384
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,160
lodged in the midline

385
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,160
between the spine and heart.

386
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,400
May even be touching

387
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,400
the aorta. Bad spot.

388
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,370
You get a lot like him?

389
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,430
The drive-up and drops?

390
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,330
Yeah.

391
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,640
Easy way to get

392
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,640
your boys patched up

393
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,200
without having to

394
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,200
answer any questions.

395
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,440
Hey, Marco.

396
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,420
A trauma surgeon is

397
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,420
gonna come see you.

398
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,090
She'll decide how

399
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,090
best to proceed.

400
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,450
You cutting me open?

401
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,590
Probably.

402
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,670
If the bullet shifts

403
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,670
inside you, it could

404
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,670
do a lot of damage.

405
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,000
No, man.

406
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,500
Not "whatever."

407
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,670
Lot of you guys

408
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,670
come in here and

409
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,670
don't make it out.

410
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,610
If you do,

411
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,610
make it mean something.

412
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,880
I ain't afraid.

413
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,580
Okay.

414
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,460
He's saying that...

415
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,460
The usual.

416
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,760
Revenge.

417
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,170
Timothy Williams,

418
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,170
eight months old.

419
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,800
Diagnosed with

420
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,800
Hypoplastic Left

421
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,800
Heart Syndrome.

422
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,130
Bryan, can you

423
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,130
tell us what that is?

424
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,570
I know.

425
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,570
It's a congenital

426
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,570
heart defect.

427
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,740
Left side of the heart

428
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,740
can't efficiently pump blood,

429
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,110
so the right side has

430
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,110
to pump it to the lungs

431
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,110
and the rest of the body.

432
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,110
Correct.

433
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,120
Now, Tim is on

434
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,120
the heart transplant list.

435
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,780
But he's developing

436
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,780
fluid around his lungs,

437
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,780
a pleural effusion.

438
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,850
He requires

439
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,850
a thoracentesis

440
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,850
to drain it.

441
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,920
The patient is sedated,

442
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,970
and the ultrasound shows

443
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,970
the fluid

444
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,970
surrounding his right lung.

445
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,600
Lidocaine is injected

446
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,600
just below

447
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,600
the surface of the skin,

448
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,060
forming a wheel.

449
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,870
We go through the wheel,

450
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,370
and into

451
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,370
the pleural space,

452
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,110
staying above the rib

453
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,110
because the blood

454
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,110
vessels are below.

455
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,010
If you go too far,

456
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,010
you puncture the lung.

457
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,380
Once you're in,

458
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,380
aspirate the fluid.

459
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,760
Give us a minute.

460
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,670
Gayle, John.

461
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,200
I think it's best

462
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,200
that Tim not leave

463
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,200
the PICU going forward.

464
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,810
No more trips downstairs.

465
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,540
You mean keep him

466
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,540
on the vent.

467
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,050
He's not oxygenating well.

468
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,050
His lungs are very congested.

469
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,010
Hon, he's gonna

470
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,010
get a heart soon.

471
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,380
Listen, everything's gonna

472
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,380
be okay. You hear me?

473
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,380
Mmm.

474
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
I'm gonna check

475
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
the transplant list.

476
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,920
See if there's

477
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,920
been any movement.

478
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,120
Thanks.

479
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,040
Hi.

480
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,340
My husband, Andre,

481
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,340
took the boys

482
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,340
to get some food.

483
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,350
He'll be back soon. Any news?

484
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,740
The blood tests and

485
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,740
babygram were okay.

486
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,080
Nothing abnormal

487
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,080
in the abdominal

488
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,080
ultrasound either.

489
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,250
Thank goodness.

490
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,520
Dr. Manning.

491
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,180
May I take a look at her?

492
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,120
Yeah.

493
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,120
Thank you.

494
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,810
Do you have any family history

495
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,810
of neuromuscular disease?

496
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,440
No, none.

497
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,040
Her deep tendon

498
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,040
reflexes are diminished.

499
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,710
She's floppy.

500
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,710
Her muscles

501
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,710
are losing tone.

502
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,490
What is it?

503
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,490
What do you see?

504
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,220
Uh, a baby's natural

505
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,220
position is to flex the legs.

506
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,790
And when straightened,

507
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,790
there should be

508
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,790
some resistance.

509
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,890
Let's get a CT

510
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,890
of her head.

511
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,960
I want to make sure that

512
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,960
there's no

513
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,960
swelling in her brain.

514
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,860
"Swelling in her brain"?

515
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,200
I don't know that

516
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,200
that's the case,

517
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,200
but we just have to check.

518
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,130
If the CT comes back negative,

519
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,330
then we will do

520
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,330
a lumbar puncture

521
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,330
to test her spinal fluid.

522
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,670
Why?

523
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,670
That'll let us know if

524
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,670
she has an infection.

525
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,110
My poor baby.

526
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,350
Just hang in there,

527
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,350
okay?

528
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,090
We'll know more soon.

529
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,500
That is one sick baby.

530
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,020
What do you think

531
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,020
is going on?

532
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,030
I have no idea.

533
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,070
Surgeon ordered a chest CT.

534
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,070
I'll let you know what's up.

535
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,610
Then what happened?

536
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,680
So they were all looking at me

537
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,680
and clapping, right?

538
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,890
So I started dancing, too.

539
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,890
We partied all afternoon.

540
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,020
Uh, sounds like a blast.

541
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,070
You know, there'll probably be

542
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,070
another fiesta next week.

543
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,230
Families rent that

544
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,230
restaurant for them

545
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,230
all the time.

546
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,620
You should check it out.

547
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,400
All-day party

548
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,400
would do me good.

549
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,500
What was he

550
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,500
telling you about?

551
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,840
A quinceañera he

552
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,840
attended last week.

553
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,110
Didn't miss a detail

554
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,110
about the people he met,

555
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,810
the clothes they wore,

556
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,810
the venue.

557
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,920
I mean, he really

558
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,920
thinks he was there.

559
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,920
But he wasn't.

560
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,910
I know the place

561
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,910
he was talking about,

562
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,910
or I knew it.

563
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,620
It closed 10, 11 years ago.

564
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,620
It's a Starbucks now.

565
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,720
Schizophrenia?

566
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,530
Some kind of

567
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,530
delusional disorder.

568
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,530
I mean, he also admitted

569
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,530
that he binge

570
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,530
drinks sometimes.

571
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,490
Even though he's sober now,

572
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,490
could be

573
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,490
alcoholic hallucinosis.

574
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,400
I'm gonna order

575
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,400
an antipsychotic,

576
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,770
see if we can

577
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,770
narrow this down.

578
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,270
Well, for being

579
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,270
homeless the last 15 years,

580
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,270
he seems pretty okay with it.

581
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,540
Lucky guy.

582
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,540
"Lucky guy"?

583
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,910
Everything okay there, Doc?

584
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,550
Money problems.

585
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,550
Pretty embarrassing.

586
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,280
Kind of all-consuming,

587
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,280
actually.

588
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,250
Buy you lunch?

589
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,380
I'd rather you

590
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,380
write me a check.

591
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,660
Get in line there, amigo.

592
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,590
Her lips are turning blue!

593
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,590
What's happening?

594
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,460
She is in

595
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,460
respiratory distress,

596
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,030
unable to

597
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,030
contract her diaphragm

598
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,030
and chest muscles enough.

599
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,430
I need to intubate, now.

600
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,760
Broselow tape.

601
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,760
Okay.

602
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,440
Mr. and Mrs. James,

603
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,440
I'm gonna need you to

604
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,440
step outside, please.

605
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,470
Sats are falling.

606
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,470
Heart rate's stable.

607
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,940
Pharynx is collapsing

608
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,940
around the scope.

609
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,370
I need crike pressure!

610
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,210
Suction.

611
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,210
Sats still falling, 40%.

612
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
Heart rate's dropping.

613
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
It's at 60. Atropine?

614
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,240
Not yet.

615
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,240
It's been a minute.

616
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,020
Heart rate 30.

617
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,020
O2 sat is zero.

618
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,720
We're running

619
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,720
out of time.

620
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,600
I got it! I'm in!

621
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,790
Give the Atropine.

622
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,790
Right away.

623
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,330
Point five IV push.

624
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,740
Sats coming up.

625
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,270
Heart rate 130. Sats 99.

626
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,380
How long did it

627
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,380
take to intubate?

628
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,380
Almost two minutes.

629
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,340
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

630
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,340
Call PICU for a bed.

631
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,010
Got you.

632
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,010
I have to go

633
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,010
talk to the family.

634
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,720
Want me to join you?

635
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,390
No, no.

636
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,390
I got this, but thank you.

637
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,060
Okay, well, uh,

638
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,060
how about Thursday?

639
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,030
I'm busy Thursday, too.

640
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,030
Pretty busy week.

641
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,640
Run something by you,

642
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,640
Dr. Charles?

643
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,140
Shoot.

644
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,980
I was speaking

645
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,980
with a colleague

646
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,980
this morning.

647
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,940
My age,

648
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,940
intelligent, compassionate,

649
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,940
a great person, but shy.

650
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,420
Asocial?

651
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,420
Uh...

652
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,820
Not a loner per se,

653
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,820
but comfortable being alone.

654
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,160
Recently, he's been

655
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,160
presented with an opportunity

656
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,750
to expand

657
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,750
his social circle.

658
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,720
He wants nothing

659
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,720
to do with it.

660
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,260
So, what are you thinking?

661
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,160
His reaction.

662
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,330
Actually his

663
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,330
overreaction screams

664
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,330
Avoidant Personality Disorder.

665
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,690
Hmm.

666
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,930
This is a colleague?

667
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,000
A close one.

668
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,870
Probably why

669
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,870
I never noticed that

670
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,180
he meets four of

671
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,180
the seven APD criteria

672
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,180
outlined in the DCM.

673
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,810
The psych fits, doesn't it?

674
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,510
Clinically. Yeah, I guess.

675
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,850
Well, I'm gonna have to

676
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,850
talk to him about this,

677
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,950
but I don't want him to feel

678
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,950
criticized or rejected.

679
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,220
Excuse me,

680
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,220
I've got some reading to do.

681
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,730
Do you think "cat lover"

682
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,730
means "cat" or "cats"?

683
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,290
Does it matter?

684
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,620
Good point. Pass.

685
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,170
What's cosplay?

686
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,830
Oh.

687
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,210
Yeah? Okay, another pass.

688
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,710
The roommate search

689
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,710
is not going well.

690
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,740
Well, you're trolling

691
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,740
the Internet.

692
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,740
What do you expect?

693
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,080
It's the hospital

694
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,080
community page.

695
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,380
I don't know,

696
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,380
someone like me.

697
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,480
Oh, you mean, like,

698
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,580
a slightly anal,

699
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,580
overly stubborn,

700
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,580
rule-breaking, control freak?

701
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,840
Oh.

702
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,020
Good luck.

703
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,020
Really? When I'm

704
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,020
already down?

705
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,160
Mr. McGregor's EKG

706
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,160
and troponin

707
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,160
results are normal.

708
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,230
Cardiac event

709
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,230
didn't cause his fall.

710
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,990
Stroke?

711
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,500
Maybe. Or a bleed.

712
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,860
Either way, it could

713
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,860
affect his balance.

714
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,340
Let's get a CT.

715
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,400
So, what does that mean?

716
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,270
There could have

717
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,270
been a brain injury

718
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,270
due to lack of oxygen.

719
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,580
We're running

720
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,580
a cerebral flow study

721
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,350
to make sure that blood

722
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,350
is reaching her brain.

723
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,260
This isn't happening.

724
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,820
Yesterday,

725
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,820
I was singing to her

726
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,820
in the bathtub.

727
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,230
And now, she's hooked up

728
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,230
to all these

729
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,230
machines and nobody...

730
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,600
Dr. Rhodes!

731
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,140
Code Blue.

732
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,970
Code Blue.

733
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,700
No pulse.

734
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,870
All right.

735
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,870
Start compressions.

736
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,070
Get him off

737
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,070
the vent and bag him.

738
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,710
0.07 milligrams of epi.

739
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,580
He's in v-fib.

740
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,450
Charge to 15 joules.

741
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,450
Charge 15.

742
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,680
Charged.

743
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,680
Hold compressions.

744
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,350
Clear.

745
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,330
We're back in sinus rhythm.

746
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,330
We have a pulse.

747
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,670
My God.

748
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,870
This is the floor

749
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,870
where babies die.

750
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,680
He's fourth on

751
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,680
the organ transplant list,

752
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,680
but he doesn't have time.

753
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,690
If, by some chance,

754
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,690
four hearts do

755
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,690
become available,

756
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,380
one still has to

757
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,380
be an HLA match.

758
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,750
I know the odds seem bleak,

759
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,820
but children under a year

760
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,820
have to receive organs

761
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,330
from similarly-aged donors.

762
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,460
The pool of

763
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,460
recipients is smaller.

764
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,070
Yes, but so is the

765
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,070
pool of donors.

766
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,800
Ms. Goodwin, I can't perform

767
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,800
another thoracentesis.

768
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,700
His lungs are too weak.

769
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,510
Without a transplant,

770
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,510
he's gonna die.

771
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,180
I'm contacting

772
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,180
the other doctors

773
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,180
on the donor list.

774
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,150
I'm pleading my case,

775
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,150
and it's...

776
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,080
Okay.

777
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,680
I have a contact

778
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,680
at Gift of Hope,

779
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,680
a friend of a friend.

780
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,950
Hold on.

781
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,390
I will do my best

782
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,390
to get Timothy pushed

783
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,390
to the top of the UNOS list,

784
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,700
but you know how delicate

785
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,700
these matters are.

786
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,820
Thank you.

787
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,670
Dr. Rhodes?

788
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,670
Be careful.

789
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,250
Hey.

790
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,350
Hey.

791
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,050
Still no sparkly

792
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,050
on the finger.

793
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,850
Does that mean

794
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,850
you made a decision?

795
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,920
Not yet.

796
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,450
April, the guy

797
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,450
proposed two months ago.

798
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,060
You owe him an answer.

799
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,830
I know. It's complicated.

800
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,030
He told me

801
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,030
I could quit my job.

802
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,860
I'm worried that means

803
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,860
he thinks I'm a housewife.

804
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,330
I'm not a housewife.

805
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,710
In his house, no less,

806
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,710
the one he shared with his ex.

807
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,370
It's a huge decision,

808
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,370
and it's all happened so fast.

809
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,880
And, of course,

810
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,880
then there's the TB.

811
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,880
Mmm.

812
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,620
I mean, the whole thing

813
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,620
just really makes me anxious.

814
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,180
What?

815
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,250
What are you thinking?

816
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,390
Anxiety is a

817
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,390
powerful emotion.

818
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,730
Would you say that

819
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,730
you feel more nervous

820
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,200
about the situation or

821
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,200
fearful of the future?

822
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,240
I don't know.

823
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,240
Both, I guess.

824
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,240
How've you been sleeping?

825
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,110
You waking up at night,

826
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,110
or any earlier

827
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,110
than you'd like?

828
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,510
What?

829
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,410
Oh, my God.

830
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,410
You're shrinking me.

831
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,950
Three weeks in psych,

832
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,620
and she's Freud.

833
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,220
What?

834
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,230
She said "anxious"

835
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,230
and "worried."

836
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,990
Those are emotions

837
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,990
that convey distress.

838
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,760
You know,

839
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,760
Meigs Field is beautiful

840
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,760
down the river.

841
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,130
The sun reflects off

842
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,130
the water with the blues

843
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,430
and the greens,

844
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,430
and the luminescence...

845
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,840
How you doing there,

846
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,840
Mr. McGregor?

847
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,960
Hey, Dr. Charles,

848
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,960
how are you?

849
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,940
Who are you, um...

850
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,940
Who are you talking to?

851
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,640
It was the nurse. Yeah.

852
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,180
She mentioned how

853
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,180
she walks her dog

854
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,180
along the lakefront.

855
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,250
Took off from there.

856
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,250
Let me tell you something,

857
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,250
Doctor.

858
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,850
There was a time

859
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,850
I used to hate hospitals,

860
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,350
but that's before

861
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,350
I noticed the details.

862
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,920
The staff floating

863
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,920
through the halls

864
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,920
like angels...

865
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,790
There. Do you see that?

866
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,790
White light surrounding.

867
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,560
Oh!

868
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,720
Beautiful aura.

869
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,570
Yeah.

870
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
You know,

871
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
I missed the beginning.

872
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,630
You were talking

873
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,630
about your favorite spot.

874
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,900
Where was that?

875
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,900
South End Meigs Field.

876
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,300
You excuse me

877
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,300
one second?

878
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,300
Absolutely.

879
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,480
I'm here if you need me.

880
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,180
Mr. McGregor get his

881
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,180
antipsychotics yet?

882
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,150
Yes. Two milligrams

883
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,150
of Risperidone.

884
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,720
Little over three hours ago.

885
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,790
You'd think it'd

886
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,790
be making a dent

887
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,790
in his symptoms by now.

888
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,230
Not really happening.

889
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,960
Give me a shout

890
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,960
when the CT results

891
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,960
come in.

892
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,190
You got it.

893
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,300
Hey, can I talk to

894
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,300
you for a second?

895
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,300
Sure.

896
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,430
Not here.

897
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,580
What? No! No!

898
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,580
Absolutely not.

899
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,680
I'm still working

900
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,680
on a diagnosis.

901
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,950
What you're asking

902
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,950
me to do is premature

903
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,950
and completely unethical.

904
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,290
Natalie, please.

905
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,460
You're running

906
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,460
a cerebral blood-flow test

907
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,460
for Alicia.

908
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,160
You clearly think that

909
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,160
brain death is a possibility.

910
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,360
A possibility.

911
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,230
But I will not get

912
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,230
those test results back

913
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,230
for another few hours.

914
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,740
So, all I'm asking

915
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,740
is that you speak

916
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,970
to Alicia's family

917
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,970
about organ donation.

918
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,070
Look, just let me

919
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,070
run an HLA test.

920
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,170
Just to see if she's a match.

921
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,220
Just in...

922
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,220
Should the worst happen.

923
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,910
Okay.

924
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,420
You know that...

925
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,360
If I do that,

926
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,390
I'm insinuating to her parents

927
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,390
that she's definitely gone.

928
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,030
You are putting me

929
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,030
in a terrible position.

930
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,100
You're right.

931
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,640
When Tim was born,

932
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,640
he wasn't breathing.

933
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,140
I performed his first surgery.

934
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,590
When he came to,

935
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,590
I was the first person he saw.

936
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,990
And he put his hand

937
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,990
around my finger.

938
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,730
Please, Nat.

939
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,730
I can't lose this kid.

940
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,110
So, it's about

941
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,110
2:00 in the morning,

942
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,110
pitch black out.

943
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,140
We start taking fire.

944
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,140
Small arms.

945
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,140
Just a few bad guys.

946
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,050
One of our guys drops

947
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,050
into a wadi for cover.

948
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,050
Wham!

949
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,420
Gets hit right

950
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,420
in the foot.

951
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,420
Oh, man.

952
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,890
When I get to him,

953
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,890
he's writhing in agony.

954
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,360
I shine my light

955
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,360
on his boot,

956
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,250
see two tiny

957
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,250
puncture wounds.

958
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,220
So, what was going on?

959
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,430
Slowly, I light up the wadi,

960
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,100
and right there,

961
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,100
staring back at me,

962
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,100
is a cobra.

963
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,330
Get the hell out.

964
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,930
Hood flared.

965
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,930
Ready to strike again.

966
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,340
Man, that's insane.

967
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,840
We just heard.

968
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,840
Our banger, Marco?

969
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,480
CT showed that the bullet

970
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,480
isn't in the midline

971
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,480
or touching the aorta.

972
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,250
It's in the left

973
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,250
paraspinal muscles.

974
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,780
Surgeon gonna

975
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,780
go in and get it?

976
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,120
No. Says it's harmless.

977
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,120
Safer to leave it in there.

978
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,850
Should be as good

979
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,850
as new in a few days.

980
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,290
And back on the street.

981
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,290
Yeah.

982
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,460
Snakes here, too.

983
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,310
Organ donation?

984
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,510
So, Alicia's brain dead?

985
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,170
The test results

986
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,170
have not come back yet.

987
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,040
Then why are you

988
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,040
even here asking us

989
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,040
to cut up our baby?

990
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,310
No, that's not

991
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,310
what I'm saying.

992
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,050
Have you given up on her?

993
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,050
No.

994
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,350
No, I swear I'm doing

995
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,350
everything in my power

996
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,520
to diagnose your daughter.

997
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,620
I don't believe this.

998
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,860
Alicia's life is

999
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,860
hanging in the balance.

1000
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,860
Our baby girl!

1001
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,590
Andre, just...

1002
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,590
No, she's saying

1003
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,590
that there's no hope.

1004
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,230
But there is.

1005
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,230
Alicia is still alive.

1006
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,700
She's supposed

1007
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,700
to be our doctor.

1008
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,300
Mr. James, please.

1009
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,600
I know that this is

1010
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,600
difficult to process,

1011
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,010
but the reality is,

1012
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,010
we don't know

1013
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,640
what the test results

1014
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,640
are gonna say.

1015
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,380
And right now,

1016
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,380
there's a baby

1017
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,380
fighting to survive.

1018
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,590
A baby just like Alicia.

1019
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,690
What would it require?

1020
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,030
We already have

1021
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,030
Alicia's blood.

1022
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,100
All I'm asking is that

1023
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,100
you allow us to test it.

1024
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,960
Alicia's a match.

1025
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,630
Yeah.

1026
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,770
I know this wasn't easy.

1027
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,040
Thank you.

1028
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,740
You know, as a doctor,

1029
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,520
you want to do everything

1030
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,520
in your power

1031
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,520
to save your patient.

1032
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,850
And I am.

1033
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,530
But it's just now...

1034
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,920
If I save my patient,

1035
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,920
it means yours won't make it.

1036
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,890
Mr. McGregor has

1037
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,890
a pituitary tumor.

1038
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,110
A big one.

1039
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,520
Yeah, it appears

1040
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,520
to be pressing

1041
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,520
on the optic chiasm.

1042
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,920
Which, if his vision

1043
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,920
is impaired,

1044
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,920
could explain why he fell.

1045
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,280
How long do you

1046
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,280
think it's been there?

1047
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,060
Based on the size,

1048
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,060
a decade. Maybe even longer.

1049
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,490
Huh.

1050
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,800
Meigs Field,

1051
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,800
torn down in '03.

1052
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,570
In '04, Sammy Sosa

1053
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,570
and Moises Alou

1054
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,830
were still

1055
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,830
fixtures at Wrigley.

1056
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,900
Yeah.

1057
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,800
The restaurant

1058
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,800
where the quinceañera

1059
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,800
took place

1060
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,270
was still

1061
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,270
open for business.

1062
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,410
All the while,

1063
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,410
Mr. McGregor's tumor

1064
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,410
is likely growing,

1065
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,640
putting pressure

1066
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,640
on his optic chiasm.

1067
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,020
He's still really

1068
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,020
congested.

1069
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,160
So order a chest X-ray

1070
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,160
and give him

1071
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,160
5 milligrams of Lasix

1072
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,100
to try and clear

1073
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,100
some of the fluid.

1074
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,770
Dr. Rhodes, it seems like

1075
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,770
he's getting

1076
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,770
worse pretty quickly.

1077
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
Is he gonna make it

1078
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
to the transplant?

1079
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,080
Do you know what

1080
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,080
we did last month?

1081
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,650
We bought a car seat.

1082
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,490
We were so sure

1083
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,490
that we were

1084
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,490
gonna beat the PICU,

1085
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,090
finally take

1086
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,090
our baby boy home.

1087
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,030
The fight is not over yet.

1088
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,830
The important thing

1089
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,830
for you right now

1090
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,700
is to try and stay

1091
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,700
in the present.

1092
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,840
What do we got?

1093
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,920
Joy Billings,

1094
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,920
44-year-old female.

1095
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,080
Triple zero.

1096
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,080
GSW to the chest.

1097
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,120
18 gauge IV in the right AC.

1098
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,120
No drugs given per protocol.

1099
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,690
Baghdad's alive!

1100
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,690
Down time?

1101
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,230
Roughly eight minutes.

1102
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,230
What happened?

1103
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,320
Watching TV with her kids.

1104
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,450
Rival gangs

1105
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,450
start blasting at

1106
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,450
each other outside.

1107
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,260
Stray bullet

1108
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,260
ripped into the house.

1109
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,170
All right,

1110
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,170
let's move her

1111
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,170
on my count.

1112
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,030
Ready? One, two, three.

1113
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,570
Call the blood bank, get a type...

1114
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,010
Police get the shooters?

1115
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,010
Yeah.

1116
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,140
Buddies of the kid

1117
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,140
from this morning, Marco.

1118
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,340
Breath sounds bilaterally.

1119
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,570
She's lost a lot of blood.

1120
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,950
Trigger the MTP.

1121
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,950
Hang blood on

1122
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,950
the rapid transfuser.

1123
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,480
Maggie, need a

1124
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,480
trauma surgeon now.

1125
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,720
She's in the OR.

1126
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,720
Three minutes.

1127
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,380
That's too long. Chest tray.

1128
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,380
Yes, Doctor.

1129
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,550
You're gonna cut her open?

1130
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,460
First incision.

1131
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,920
Second incision.

1132
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,280
Corpsman,

1133
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,280
I need you to take over

1134
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,550
so I can

1135
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,550
cross-clamp her aorta.

1136
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,820
Yes, sir.

1137
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,980
Back and forth

1138
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,980
as if

1139
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,980
you were clapping.

1140
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,060
In.

1141
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,060
Hold compressions.

1142
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,660
Resume compressions.

1143
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,660
Milligram of epi.

1144
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,670
Hold.

1145
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,670
Resume.

1146
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,270
Hold.

1147
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,720
Beat, damn it, beat.

1148
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,720
Come on.

1149
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,990
Asystole.

1150
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,160
Beat.

1151
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,290
Beat!

1152
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,940
Time of death, 15:42.

1153
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,420
And Marco is gonna go home.

1154
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,880
Dr. Rhodes?

1155
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,980
Is there a donor

1156
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,980
in the hospital

1157
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,980
for Timmy?

1158
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,980
We heard a rumor.

1159
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,990
It's her child,

1160
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,990
isn't it?

1161
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,880
Her little girl?

1162
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,290
They're the only

1163
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,290
new patients

1164
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,290
on the floor.

1165
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,020
We've been here

1166
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,020
for eight months.

1167
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,020
We know everybody else.

1168
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,790
It has to be her.

1169
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,790
I'm sorry, Gayle.

1170
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,530
But the HIPAA regulations

1171
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,530
won't allow me

1172
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,530
to discuss another patient.

1173
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,510
Hi.

1174
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,120
The spinal tap

1175
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,120
was clean.

1176
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,830
I've ruled out all

1177
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,830
the common causes.

1178
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,360
We must be looking

1179
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,360
at something rare.

1180
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,420
Have you had any

1181
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,420
foreign visitors?

1182
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,490
Anyone outside of your

1183
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,490
normal social circle?

1184
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,930
No.

1185
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,930
Has your house been sprayed

1186
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,930
with pesticides?

1187
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,240
No, none of that.

1188
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,240
Nothing. No.

1189
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,170
I'd like to reach

1190
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,170
out to toxicology...

1191
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,840
Would you look at them

1192
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,840
over there,

1193
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,840
watching like vultures?

1194
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,570
Why don't they show

1195
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,570
some damn respect?

1196
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,740
Andre.

1197
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,680
My fault, son.

1198
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,850
I shouldn't have shouted.

1199
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,120
Mr. and Mrs. James,

1200
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,120
I'm so sorry

1201
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,120
that you're going...

1202
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,690
Those, um...

1203
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,060
Those grass stains.

1204
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,230
When you take

1205
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,230
the boys to the park,

1206
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,230
what do you do with Alicia?

1207
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,860
I lay her down

1208
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,860
on her stomach

1209
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,860
for tummy time.

1210
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,400
You know what?

1211
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,440
I'd like to consult

1212
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,440
with Infectious Diseases.

1213
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,000
Excuse me, please.

1214
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,180
Pupils are reactive.

1215
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,760
Mr. McGregor, can you

1216
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,760
follow the light

1217
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,760
with your eyes?

1218
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,060
How about now?

1219
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,030
Mr. McGregor,

1220
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,030
how many fingers

1221
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,030
am I holding up?

1222
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,330
Three.

1223
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,330
Okay.

1224
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,200
And now?

1225
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,630
One.

1226
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,740
Good job.

1227
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,740
I'll be right back.

1228
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,510
Legally blind?

1229
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,820
No, he can detect

1230
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,820
sharp lights

1231
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,820
and block images.

1232
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,020
Probably how he

1233
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,020
made out my size earlier.

1234
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,620
But anything more

1235
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,620
than a few feet away

1236
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,620
is likely just a blur.

1237
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,260
His pituitary tumor,

1238
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,260
is it operable?

1239
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,490
I'll have neuro consult,

1240
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,490
but I suspect

1241
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,490
it's a prolactinoma.

1242
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,900
If so, medication alone

1243
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,900
should shrink it enough

1244
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,600
to ease the pressure

1245
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,600
off the optic chiasm.

1246
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,570
So, he's gonna get

1247
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,570
some of his sight back.

1248
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,900
Fifteen years.

1249
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,900
Homeless, essentially blind.

1250
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,900
I mean, that's a crap hand.

1251
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,850
He should be pissed.

1252
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,850
Yet, he's happy as can be.

1253
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,820
Crazy I got

1254
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,820
this patient today.

1255
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,020
My experience,

1256
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,020
we get the patients we need.

1257
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,330
You've created a monster,

1258
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,330
you know that?

1259
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,900
Turns out the English language

1260
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,900
is primarily

1261
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,900
comprised of buzzwords

1262
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,460
for borderline

1263
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,460
personality disorders.

1264
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,270
And now that I know them,

1265
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,270
I can't have a conversation

1266
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,540
without immediately

1267
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,540
seeing the psych in people,

1268
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,870
which is clearly

1269
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,870
an impulsive reaction,

1270
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,780
which, by the way,

1271
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,780
could also suggest

1272
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,580
a borderline

1273
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,580
personality disorder.

1274
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,520
I mean, I can't even

1275
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,520
not analyze myself.

1276
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,280
And now I'm using

1277
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,280
double negatives.

1278
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,150
You're a first-year

1279
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,150
psych resident.

1280
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,280
Compulsive diagnosing

1281
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,280
is par for the course.

1282
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,050
My first year,

1283
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,750
I was convinced

1284
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,750
that a friend of mine

1285
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,730
had dissociative

1286
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,730
identity disorder,

1287
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,830
because suddenly he would

1288
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,830
only listen to Euro disco.

1289
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,000
Really.

1290
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,630
My advice.

1291
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,270
Think less, listen more.

1292
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,840
You'll be just fine.

1293
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,370
Sir...

1294
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,710
Just wanted to

1295
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,710
thank you for today.

1296
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,840
My pleasure.

1297
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,320
I'm spent.

1298
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,980
Not gonna be easy

1299
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,980
over there.

1300
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,150
You'll get through it.

1301
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,710
The medicine, sure.

1302
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,350
The rest...

1303
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,790
Well, I just hope

1304
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,790
I can handle my emotions

1305
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,790
as well as you.

1306
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,430
Good luck.

1307
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,250
Botulism?

1308
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,250
Isn't that a food thing?

1309
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,440
I'm still

1310
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,440
breastfeeding.

1311
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,510
Most cases actually come from

1312
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,510
contaminated soil.

1313
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,550
It can be absorbed

1314
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,550
through the skin.

1315
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,550
The park. Tummy time.

1316
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,820
Is it treatable?

1317
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,480
Yes. Yes.

1318
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,620
We will start

1319
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,620
Alicia on an antitoxin

1320
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,860
that will provide antibodies

1321
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,860
to stop

1322
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,860
the disease's progress.

1323
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,290
But what about the vent?

1324
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,420
The neurotoxin

1325
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,420
from the bacteria

1326
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,940
is what caused

1327
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,940
the muscle weakness.

1328
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,230
I believe she will

1329
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,230
make a full recovery.

1330
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,160
Thank you so much, Doctor.

1331
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,570
Thank you.

1332
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,560
Hey.

1333
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,980
What's it this time?

1334
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,220
Gout.

1335
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,220
Oh.

1336
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,720
May I?

1337
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,900
What do you think?

1338
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,200
An explosion of

1339
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,200
brilliant crystals.

1340
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,300
Like Hawaiian shave ice.

1341
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,400
Hmm.

1342
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,240
I know how you pathologists

1343
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,240
love food references.

1344
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,840
Yes, we do.

1345
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,220
Yeah. Uh, okay.

1346
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,050
No, I understand.

1347
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,820
Thanks for your time,

1348
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,820
Dr. Laurel.

1349
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,360
Damn it.

1350
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,870
It's gonna come through.

1351
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,510
How do you do it?

1352
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,710
They're just babies.

1353
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,710
Well...

1354
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,680
On rough days, I call Helen.

1355
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,530
Ask her to watch Owen

1356
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,530
for a few extra hours

1357
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,600
while I do

1358
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,600
something to decompress.

1359
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,790
A good meal, a long walk.

1360
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,930
Just something to

1361
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,930
let my emotions settle.

1362
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,740
I find a safe space.

1363
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,850
See you tomorrow.

1364
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,280
Night.

1365
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,760
Hey. How'd the rest

1366
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,760
of your day go?

1367
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,730
Not so sure I want

1368
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,730
to talk about work.

1369
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,100
Yeah, I may have

1370
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,100
overstepped a bit earlier.

1371
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,340
So you were analyzing me?

1372
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,930
Unintentionally, though.

1373
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,930
Ugh.

1374
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,610
I'll make it up to you

1375
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,610
with burgers at Au Cheval?

1376
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,810
And you can tell me all about

1377
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,810
how the Bears are doing.

1378
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,650
But you know

1379
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,650
nothing about football.

1380
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,380
Exactly.
