1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,800
Get them off!

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,800
Get them off of me, please!

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,800
Get them off of me!

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,780
They're on me!

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,780
Get them off of me!

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,870
Get them off of me!

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,640
Robin Charles, early 30s.

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,640
Delusional and combative.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,770
Lacerations on the soles

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,770
of her feet.

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,840
Treatment Six.

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,680
She's on 4 milligrams

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,680
of risperidone.

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,680
Nothing given in the field.

15
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,910
Vitals?

16
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,910
No.

17
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,580
Too agitated.

18
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,580
Couldn't get her hooked up.

19
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,220
Get them off of me!

20
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,130
Are we set? On my count.

21
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,130
One, two, three. Gentle.

22
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,020
Robin, do you know

23
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,020
where you are?

24
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,020
Do you know who I am?

25
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,170
Help me! Help me, please!

26
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,170
We need to sedate her.

27
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,570
Five of olanzapine,

28
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,570
50 of Benadryl.

29
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,360
Two of Ativan.

30
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,360
Two of Ativan!

31
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,170
Get them off of me.

32
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,440
No! No! No! No...

33
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,080
Dr. Rhodes?

34
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,320
So, you, um, starting

35
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,320
to figure out

36
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,760
why I didn't want her

37
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,760
leaving the hospital?

38
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,320
She was rational.

39
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,320
She was lucid.

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
I warned you.

41
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
Robin was fine, okay?

42
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,390
Suddenly, she just...

43
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,770
Suddenly, look at her now!

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
This is on you. You did this.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,400
I gave her 5

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,400
milligrams of olanzapine

47
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,100
and she responded well.

48
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,140
So, we're gonna

49
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,140
titrate up to 10 a day.

50
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,040
Past that,

51
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,040
Med isn't the place for her.

52
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,080
Robin belongs in a long-term

53
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,080
locked facility.

54
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,910
Dr. Latham.

55
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,150
Go, Dr. Rhodes.

56
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,150
We'll text you if

57
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,150
there's any change.

58
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,710
Go.

59
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,280
Okay.

60
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,490
Thank you.

61
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,600
Daniel, you should go home

62
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,600
and get some rest.

63
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,040
You have to take care

64
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,040
of yourself.

65
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,700
Are you taking your meds?

66
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,940
Well, at least go up

67
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,940
to your office and lie down.

68
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,830
You see this?

69
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,830
Mandatory penis examinations.

70
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,800
"Under Illinois State Law,

71
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,800
all male emergency

72
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,800
department workers

73

"are required to have

74
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,810

"to be administered

76

"Please contact him

directly."

79
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,980
Want me to prep you

80
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,980
a treatment room?

81
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,280
Graduation week.

82
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,540
Childish pranks,

83
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,540
not to mention

84
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,950
the binge drinking

85
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,950
and the stunts.

86
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,550
Every year, we have an ED

87
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,550
full of morons.

88
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,110
Youth, Dr. Stohl.

89
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,790
Yeah.

90
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,760
No. No, there are no exams.

91
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,790
No, it's a practical joke!

92
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,030
Dr. Shore,

93
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,030
Dr. Halstead, don't forget,

94
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,530
Keoni's luau tonight,

95
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,530
my grad party.

96
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,630
We'll be there.

97
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,630
Absolutely.

98
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,830
Great.

99
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,170
Mai Tais and poke.

100
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,430
Mmm-hmm.

101
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,430
PiÃ±a colada for me.

102
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,310
See you later.

103
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,310
Hey.

104
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,870
You and Nina look happy.

105
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,200
Yeah.

106
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,420
Hey, you two need to know

107
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,420
that Robin Charles is in Six.

108
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,450
What happened?

109
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,450
Psychotic break.

110
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,880
Oh, my God.

111
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,920
You're up.

112
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,920
Incoming. Poly trauma.

113
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,320
Go, go, go, go, go.

114
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,460
Twenty-two-year-old male.

115
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,460
Peds versus auto.

116
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,860
GCS 12, BP 100/70,

117
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,860
heart rate 125.

118
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,730
Got a student ID.

119
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,730
Kid's name is Marwan Haddad.

120
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,730
Hit-and-run.

121
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,240
The car dragged him,

122
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,240
like, half a block.

123
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,860
Sexton, FAST his belly.

124
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,860
On it.

125
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,430
Need X-rays.

126
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,430
Chest and pelvis.

127
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,570
And left lower leg.

128
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,570
Probably a Tib-Fib fracture.

129
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,940
Let's move him.

130
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,940
One, two, three.

131
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,710
Poor breath sounds

132
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,710
on the left side.

133
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,780
Christina.

134
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,290
It's okay.

135
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,290
It's okay. I'm Dr. Manning.

136
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,290
This is Dr. Halstead.

137
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,980
We're going to take

138
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,980
really good care

139
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,980
of you, okay?

140
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,320
Christina.

141
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,650
Easy. Easy.

142
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,160
Belly's clear.

143
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,930
He's shocky. I'm intubating.

144
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,700
Bilateral rib fractures.

145
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,830
Bilateral

146
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,830
pulmonary contusions.

147
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,130
And hemothorax on the left.

148
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,230
Sexton, chest tube.

149
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,230
On it.

150
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,100
Doris, hang two units

151
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,100
of O-neg on the level one.

152
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,470
Got it.

153
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,470
We got a medical history?

154
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,140
No. I spoke to his roommate.

155
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,140
Marwan's a Syrian refugee.

156
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,470
He's here to go to school.

157
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,470
That's about

158
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,470
all the guy knows.

159
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,740
His parents are on a plane.

160
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,540
They're flying in

161
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,540
from Germany,

162
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,540
to go to his graduation.

163
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,880
Poor guy.

164
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,210
Chest tube's in.

165
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,780
Good work.

166
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,480
Can you imagine?

167
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
Kid survives

168
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
cluster bombs in Aleppo,

169
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,690
just to come to Chicago

170
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,690
and get hit by a car.

171
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,620
Let me know when

172
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,620
he wakes up, all right?

173
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,060
I want to get a statement,

174
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,060
figure out who did this.

175
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,560
Absolutely. Thanks, Jay.

176
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,560
Yeah.

177
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,600
Dr. Rhodes,

178
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,600
I have news for you.

179
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,100
Oh, I should say

180
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,100
"Good morning."

181
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,230
Good morning, Dr. Latham.

182
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,330
If I'm not mistaken,

183
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,600
you don't seem to be

184
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,600
your usual self.

185
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,410
Tired?

186
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,410
No. I'm all right.

187
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,410
Thanks.

188
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,040
Okay. Good.

189
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,480
Did you page me?

190
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,480
Yes.

191
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,110
You remember

192
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,110
when I told you that

193
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,110
you weren't

194
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,680
my first choice

195
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,680
for this fellowship?

196
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,780
Yeah.

197
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,880
It was a South African woman

198
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,880
from Groote Schuur.

199
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,580
Well, the hospital has

200
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,580
allowed for another

201
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,580
second-year CT fellow,

202
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,490
so she's here,

203
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,490
joining our team.

204
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,390
Dr. Rhodes,

205
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,390
meet Dr. Bekker.

206
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,360
Ava.

207
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,920
Connor.

208
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,400
I'm sure

209
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,400
you two will enjoy

210
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,400
working together.

211
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,100
I'll leave you two

212
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,100
to get acquainted.

213
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,280
He's very odd. Asperger's?

214
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,410
Dr. Latham is

215
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,410
a great surgeon,

216
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,410
teacher and friend.

217
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,750
Oh. Loyal. That's sweet.

218
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,090
You know what, Dr. Bekker?

219
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,090
I'm not sure we will

220
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,090
enjoy working together.

221
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,090
Leah?

222
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,190
Okay.

223
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,330
Mr. Kellogg,

224
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,330
I'm the charge nurse.

225
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,730
Is Dr. Charles

226
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,730
ready to see me?

227
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,790
I texted him I was coming.

228
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,500
He may not be

229
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,500
checking his messages.

230
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,010
He had a family emergency.

231
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,040
He told me that I could

232
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,040
see him any time.

233
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,040
He promised.

234
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,780
I'm sorry.

235
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,780
But I can have one of

236
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,780
his residents see you.

237
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm not talking

238
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,680
to some underling.

239
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,040
Is Dr. Charles here?

240
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,210
Yes.

241
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,390
But I don't think he's

242
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,390
going to be available.

243
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,890
You tell him that

244
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,890
I'm not going to be

245
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,890
treated this way.

246
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,660
I'm going to stay right here

247
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,660
and wait until he comes out.

248
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,280
Okay.

249
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,630
Hey. Get me a cup

250
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,630
of coffee.

251
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,800
The vending machine's

252
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,800
right there.

253
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,760
April, about last night...

254
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,400
No. It's just as much

255
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,400
my fault.

256
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,470
It never happened.

257
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,740
Dr. Choi, April, you're up.

258
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,180
Cesar?

259
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,180
Don Crocker,

260
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,180
47-year-old male.

261
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,620
Shortness of breath,

262
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,620
chest pains.

263
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,910
You're going to

264
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,910
Treatment Four.

265
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,750
Passed out on the stairs.

266
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,750
Neighbor found him.

267
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,950
I'm lucky.

268
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,750
BP 90/70.

269
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,750
Heart rate's at 110.

270
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,980
Twelve lead in the ambo.

271
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,360
All right, Mr. Crocker,

272
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm Dr. Choi.

273
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,860
We're going to take

274
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,860
good care of you,

275
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,860
all right?

276
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,130
Okay.

277
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,760
Let's transfer on my count.

278
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,760
Ready? One, two, three.

279
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,810
Twelve lead shows a STEMI.

280
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,810
Activate the team.

281
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,770
Mr. Crocker,

282
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,770
you're having a heart attack.

283
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,570
Aspirin?

284
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,140
Yeah, 81 milligrams

285
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,140
and four of morphine.

286
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,410
Mr. Crocker, is there

287
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,410
anyone we should call?

288
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,410
Friends? Family?

289
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,650
No.

290
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,780
Someone at work?

291
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,790
Work from home.

292
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,790
Most days don't even

293
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,790
leave the apartment.

294
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,790
So, no one?

295
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,950
No.

296
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,990
Mr. Crocker, you've got fluid

297
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,990
backing up into

298
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,990
your heart and lungs.

299
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,470
That's why you're having

300
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,470
difficulty breathing.

301
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,930
April, let's give him

302
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,930
10 milligrams of Lasix

303
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,930
and place a foley.

304
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,230
We're going to get

305
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,230
the excess water

306
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,230
out of your system.

307
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,400
Okay.

308
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,110
Mr. Crocker?

309
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,110
He's lost consciousness.

310
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,040
I've got a pulse.

311
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,040
Take him up to the cath lab.

312
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,010
I'll intubate him there.

313
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,010
Page Cardiology.

314
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,810
Ready?

315
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,810
Yeah.

316
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
Why'd she do it?

317
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,490
Mmm.

318
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,490
Cut her hair.

319
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,790
A woman changes

320
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,790
her hair like that,

321
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,790
it's a big deal, right?

322
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,890
It means something.

323
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,260
Absolutely.

324
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,630
Yeah. So?

325
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,470
Well, don't ask me.

326
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,940
Oh, my God. What?

327
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,470
Are you coming to

328
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,470
my party tonight?

329
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,380
I don't know.

330
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,380
I haven't thought

331
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,380
about it.

332
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,040
Okay. Well, it won't be

333
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,040
the same without you.

334
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,480
All right.

335
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,480
Look, I'm busy, okay?

336
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,610
Okay.

337
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,750
But you are coming

338
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,750
to my party.

339
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,790
Hey.

340
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,790
Hmm?

341
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,590
Glad you took my advice.

342
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,500
She's sleeping.

343
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,500
At least let me buy you

344
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,500
some breakfast.

345
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
Cup of coffee, maybe.

346
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,250
Dr. Charles?

347
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,920
I have been reviewing

348
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,920
Robin's history,

349
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,080
just to make sure

350
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,080
we haven't missed

351
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,080
anything and...

352
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,160
Well, uh,

353
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,160
some of her symptoms,

354
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,320
they're not consistent

355
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,320
with a psychiatric disorder.

356
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,390
Dr. Reese...

357
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,390
Let her finish.

358
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,170
Two days ago,

359
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,170
when Robin came

360
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,170
to the hospital,

361
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,230
she was running

362
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,230
a mild fever, 100.2,

363
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,230
and her BP was elevated.

364
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,300
Now, at the time,

365
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,300
we didn't think anything

366
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,300
of it...

367
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,140
That's 'cause it's

368
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,140
a very mild fever.

369
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,700
And, of course

370
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,700
her BP was elevated.

371
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,480
She was on a forced hold.

372
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,480
She was agitated.

373
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,380
But when Robin was

374
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,380
brought in today,

375
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,220
it seemed

376
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,220
she was experiencing

377
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,220
visual hallucinations.

378
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,310
Now, auditory hallucinations

379
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,310
indicate a mental disorder,

380
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,690
but visual hallucinations

381
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,690
should be considered organic

382
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,690
until proven otherwise.

383
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,390
I think we all wish

384
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,390
that Robin had

385
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,230
a treatable physical

386
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,230
condition rather than...

387
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,390
I want to check

388
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,390
her ceruloplasmin levels

389
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,860
and run an FTA-ABS

390
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,860
as well as an MRI and EEG

391
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,730
to rule out sclerosis

392
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,730
and epilepsy.

393
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,730
Of course. Do it.

394
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,240
What's the matter with you?

395
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,980
She's trying to

396
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,980
make me feel better.

397
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,020
And bless her,

398
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,020
but she's grasping

399
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,020
at straws. Come on.

400
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,950
Are you so blinded

401
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,950
by your fear

402
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,990
that Robin inherited

403
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,990
her problems from you

404
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,720
that you won't even

405
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,720
entertain an alternative?

406
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,520
False hope, Sharon.

407
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,520
Come on. I don't need any.

408
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,090
You don't know that.

409
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,990
Where's the Daniel

410
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,990
who leaves no stone unturned

411
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,990
when diagnosing a patient?

412
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,190
Where's the Daniel

413
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,190
who never gives up?

414
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,940
Don't you think

415
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,940
your own daughter

416
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,940
deserves that much?

417
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,280
Thanks.

418
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,650
Hey, what are we

419
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,650
looking at?

420
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,740
He needs a new valve.

421
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,050
Ava Bekker, CT fellow,

422
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,050
Ethan Choi,

423
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,050
Chief Resident of the ED.

424
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,790
So, we crack his chest,

425
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,790
replace the valve.

426
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,690
Well, we don't need

427
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,690
to crack his chest.

428
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,360
Uh, Mr. Crocker's

429
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,360
been assessed

430
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,360
as intermediate risk,

431
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,300
and Transcatheter Aortic

432
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,300
Valve Replacement, TAVR,

433
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,740
is now FDA approved

434
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,740
for patients at that level.

435
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,930
We get excellent results

436
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,930
with open aortic

437
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,930
valve replacement.

438
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,410
With TAVR, you're just

439
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,410
inviting complications.

440
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,140
I don't agree.

441
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,570
Why put the patient

442
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,570
through a long operation

443
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,570
and a long pump run?

444
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,880
He can have

445
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,880
a functional heart again

446
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,880
in under two hours.

447
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,820
The less invasive,

448
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,820
the better.

449
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,820
Exactly.

450
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,480
Excuse me.

451
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,480
You're an emergency

452
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,480
medicine resident.

453
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,420
Why are we even talking?

454
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,420
Excuse you?

455
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,980
Because I value

456
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,980
Dr. Choi's opinion.

457
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,630
And I think you'll find

458
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,630
that Dr. Latham will

459
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,630
back me on the TAVR.

460
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,120
Fine.

461
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,830
I'm sorry you got

462
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,830
brought into this.

463
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,030
I didn't know about Robin.

464
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,030
I'm sure you want to be

465
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,030
with her.

466
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,440
Yeah. I'm all right,

467
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,440
but thanks.

468
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,440
This won't take long.

469
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,870
I'll let you know

470
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,870
how he does.

471
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,070
Thanks, man.

472
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,070
Mmm-hmm.

473
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,640
What level of oxygen

474
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,640
is he on?

475
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,810
100%.

476
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,750
Left upper lobe is

477
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,750
segmentally collapsed.

478
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,750
Probably plugged up

479
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,750
from a clot in his airway.

480
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,750
Yeah. Let's get

481
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,750
a bronchoscopy.

482
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,590
Yeah, clear out

483
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,590
any obstructions.

484
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,630
Hey, I never asked,

485
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,630
why'd you decide

486
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,630
to cut your hair?

487
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,860
Time for a change.

488
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,920
Oh.

489
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,630
I'm looking

490
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,630
for Marwan Haddad.

491
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,670
Oh, are you family?

492
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,210
We go to school together.

493
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,440
Oh, well,

494
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,440
he's being treated

495
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,440
right now.

496
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,540
Why don't you wait

497
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,540
in the lobby

498
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,080
and I'll tell you when

499
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,080
you can see him, okay?

500
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,450
Oh, Dr. Choi, take a look

501
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,450
at this girl in Two.

502
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,690
Probable distal

503
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,690
radial fracture

504
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,690
and concussion.

505
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,390
This young genius tied

506
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,390
a rope around a rafter

507
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,690
and tried to swing across

508
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,690
the school cafeteria.

509
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,060
What?

510
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,160
You'll see.

511
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,430
Oh, by the way,

512
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,430
I'm missing

513
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,430
my coffee mug.

514
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,830
Some cretin obviously thought

515
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,830
it would be amusing

516
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,830
to steal it.

517
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,140
I'll make sure to look out

518
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,140
for it, Dr. Stohl.

519
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,770
Thank you.

520
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,410
Closed distal radius

521
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,410
fracture.

522
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,480
Monkey suit.

523
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,480
Uh-huh.

524
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,290
Of course.

525
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,290
Swinging from the rafters,

526
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,290
gotta have a monkey suit.

527
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,390
So stupid.

528
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,390
No.

529
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,790
You should've seen

530
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,790
people's faces

531
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,790
when they saw you.

532
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,330
It was so clutch.

533
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,430
Senior prank.

534
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,430
We're graduating

535
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,430
from high school.

536
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,270
We'll need the Ortho

537
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,270
resident to see her.

538
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,770
I'm afraid we're going to

539
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,770
have to cut this suit

540
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,770
to set your arm.

541
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
No! It's a rental.

542
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
I'm sorry.

543
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,910
Your friend

544
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,910
lost consciousness

545
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,910
when she fell?

546
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,640
Yeah. I was

547
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,640
kind of worried.

548
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,080
Concussion is always

549
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,080
a concern.

550
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,580
I want to get a CAT scan,

551
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,580
head and neck,

552
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,580
just to be sure.

553
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,180
Don't worry. You'll be

554
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,180
out of here in no time.

555
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,250
I'll call Ortho.

556
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,560
Oh, Dr. Choi, you're coming

557
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,560
to my party tonight, right?

558
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,230
Uh...

559
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,430
Thanks, but I'm not

560
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,430
gonna be able to make it.

561
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,430
Early call tomorrow.

562
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,900
You sure? One Mai Tai.

563
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,440
Sorry.

564
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,900
Okay.

565
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,580
The valve is in position

566
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,580
and open.

567
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,590
I'm injecting dye now

568
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,590
to check it.

569
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,750
Fluoro.

570
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,590
Left coronary artery

571
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,590
looks good, but I'm not

572
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,590
seeing the right.

573
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,160
Could be occluded.

574
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,160
Can you get the wire in?

575
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,660
Let me try and cannulate

576
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,660
the right coronary artery.

577
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,490
Can't, the lumen's blocked.

578
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,740
There's no flow

579
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,740
on the right side.

580
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,240
Seeing right side

581
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,240
ST changes.

582
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,970
Calcium deposit

583
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,970
must have broken off

584
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,530
from the old valve

585
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,530
and occluded the RCA.

586
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,670
His heart is dying.

587
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,670
We've got to

588
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,670
open him up now.

589
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,950
What we should have done

590
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,950
in the first place.

591
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,520
And we're already making calls

592
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,520
to find her another bed.

593
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,320
We'll keep Robin here until

594
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,320
we can get her transferred

595
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,320
to a long-term facility.

596
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,690
We'll take good care of her.

597
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,690
I've dialed back

598
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,690
on her sedation.

599
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,730
Robin? Honey?

600
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
Get away from me.

601
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
Get away.

602
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,230
Get away from me.

603
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,230
Get away from me!

604
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,230
Make him go!

605
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,470
Dan, Dan, Dan,

606
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,470
we got this.

607
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,180
You were right.

608
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,950
The tests I ran,

609
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,950
there's no indication

610
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,280
of any organic

611
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,280
medical condition

612
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,410
I'm sorry.

613
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,690
Robin's showing dyskinesia.

614
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,690
Did you notice that before?

615
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,420
The jerky movements?

616
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,760
Yeah, I assumed it's from

617
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,760
the antipsychotics.

618
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,460
Yeah. It could be.

619
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,000
Did you order

620
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,000
a paraneoplastic panel?

621
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,330
For auto-antibodies? Why?

622
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,110
Could we just run one?

623
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,110
Of course.

624
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,480
Graft is in place.

625
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,480
Let's get him off of bypass.

626
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,580
Unclamping the aorta.

627
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,350
Let's get his heart

628
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,350
beating on its own.

629
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,350
Defibrillate.

630
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,660
Clear.

631
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,740
Sinus rhythm.

632
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,930
Cut to 2 liters.

633
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,560
Hold on.

634
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,560
His right heart

635
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,560
is ballooning.

636
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,300
Back on full support.

637
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,300
Marty, what's he on?

638
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,340
Dobutamine at eight,

639
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,340
dopamine at five.

640
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,740
Give him

641
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,740
a milrinone loading dose,

642
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,480
epinephrine bolus

643
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,480
of 50 micrograms

644
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,710
and start inhaled nitric.

645
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,890
That's not

646
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,890
going to cut it.

647
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,890
His heart isn't coming back.

648
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,750
He's not leaving

649
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,750
this room without ECMO.

650
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,050
Won't that just set him up

651
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,050
for complications later?

652
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,320
Why do all the residents

653
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,320
in this hospital

654
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,450
think they can offer

655
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,450
their opinions?

656
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,290
No ECMO.

657
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,290
His heart is strong enough

658
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,290
to come back on its own.

659
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,630
I disagree.

660
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,190
Noted,

661
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,190
but this is my case.

662
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,360
All right,

663
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,360
cut to 2 liters.

664
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,400
The heart's

665
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,400
coming back.

666
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,010
Septum is midline,

667
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,010
SVR acceptable.

668
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,810
Pressure's holding.

669
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,780
Good call, Dr. Rhodes.

670
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,450
Yeah.

671
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,620
Let's decannulate.

672
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,170
His sats are down to 80.

673
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,140
There's his latest X-ray.

674
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,460
No improvement.

675
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,310
How much vent support

676
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,310
are we giving him?

677
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,900
Maxed out.

678
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,440
He's on bronchodilators,

679
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,440
and he's still not getting

680
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,440
enough oxygen.

681
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,950
Seventy-five percent.

682
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,950
Mmm.

683
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,440
If we don't correct

684
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,440
his hypoxia,

685
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,420
we're looking at

686
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,420
anoxic brain injury.

687
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,420
Mmm-hmm.

688
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,650
Let's get him up to the ICU

689
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,650
and put him on

690
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,650
cardiopulmonary support.

691
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,080
Right.

692
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,950
Your patient

693
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,950
has a friend here.

694
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,950
Girlfriend, maybe.

695
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,850
Oh, good.

696
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,850
I'll go talk to her.

697
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,430
Okay.

698
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,430
Thanks, Nat.

699
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,530
How long you been waiting?

700
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,170
I don't know,

701
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,170
about an hour.

702
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,170
Typical.

703
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,170
They lie to you here.

704
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,970
Stand up for your rights.

705
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,910
Hi. Are you

706
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,910
Marwan's girlfriend?

707
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,740
Is your name Christina?

708
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,910
Yes.

709
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,440
How do you know my name?

710
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,160
When he first came in,

711
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,160
he called out for you.

712
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,760
Do you know anything

713
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,760
that may help me treat him?

714
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,070
Any medical history?

715
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,070
Medication?

716
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,590
We haven't known

717
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,590
each other that long.

718
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,590
Okay.

719
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,940
We're taking Marwan up

720
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,940
to the intensive care unit.

721
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,630
If you want,

722
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,630
you can come wait up there.

723
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,180
All right. I'll have someone

724
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,180
come grab you, okay?

725
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,810
Dr. Stohl. I, uh...

726
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,310
I found your mug.

727
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,310
Where?

728
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,390
Thank you.

729
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,200
I'll, um, call Maintenance

730
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,200
to get it down.

731
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,000
Hello?

732
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,510
It's a joke.

733
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,110
There are no inspections!

734
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,110
It's a joke!

735
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,510
Get me Maintenance.

736
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,210
Here's

737
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,210
the paraneoplastic panel.

738
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,550
Wow.

739
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,780
Look at that.

740
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,780
You were right,

741
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,780
Dr. Reese.

742
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,800
It is objective.

743
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,800
It's physical.

744
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,800
Well done.

745
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,190
Where's the tumor?

746
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,560
There.

747
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,310
It's so tiny.

748
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,750
All that.

749
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,640
Page Dr. Latham.

750
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,800
Good news.

751
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,800
Your CT was negative.

752
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,500
You're gonna be fine.

753
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,230
See? I told you!

754
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,600
It isn't that.

755
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,610
She never does

756
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,610
anything wrong.

757
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,610
Straight A's, all Honors.

758
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,160
She got into Harvard.

759
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,810
Well, we'll start

760
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,810
the discharge paperwork.

761
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,820
Parents on their way?

762
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,820
Yes.

763
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,120
The school had trouble

764
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,120
getting a hold

765
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,120
of them, but yeah.

766
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,290
Hey.

767
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,560
So, what's with you

768
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,560
and Dr. Choi?

769
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,490
Nothing. What are you

770
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,490
talking about?

771
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,230
Oh, come on, April.

772
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,230
I'm your brother.

773
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,230
No. There's nothing

774
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,230
with me and Dr. Choi. Noah!

775
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,600
I just broke up with Tate.

776
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,840
You think I'm gonna jump

777
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,840
into another relationship?

778
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,540
Let me just say,

779
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,540
maybe Dr. Choi is no

780
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,540
all-pro football player,

781
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,350
but he is one hell

782
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,350
of a doc.

783
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,590
With decent

784
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,590
earning potential.

785
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,590
I'm just saying.

786
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,200
Maggie, where's Robin?

787
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,200
Let me call you back.

788
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,570
They took her upstairs.

789
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,570
She's getting a scan.

790
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,600
Doctor...

791
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,840
I saw Robin's scheduled

792
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,840
for surgery.

793
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,750
She has Anti-NMDA

794
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,750
Receptor Encephalitis.

795
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,010
It's very rare.

796
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,010
Dr. Charles had the idea

797
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,010
to test for it.

798
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,610
Some auto-immune response...

799
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,610
Gone awry.

800
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,620
Robin has

801
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,620
a mediastinal teratoma,

802
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,620
a benign one,

803
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,460
but her body's attacking

804
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,460
the tumor,

805
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,860
and it's also

806
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,860
attacking her brain.

807
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,530
Yeah, and the resulting

808
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,530
inflammation is what's caused

809
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,530
her psychiatric symptoms.

810
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,730
So, when

811
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,730
the tumor's removed...

812
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,500
Hopefully the psychosis

813
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,500
should resolve itself.

814
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,030
Wait. What's going on?

815
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,000
Come on in.

816
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,750
I'll remove the teratoma

817
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,750
via mediastinoscopy,

818
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,680
a minimally

819
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,680
invasive procedure.

820
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,290
Shouldn't take

821
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,290
more than 90 minutes.

822
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,140
You're gonna be okay.

823
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,940
I love you.

824
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,290
Dr. Latham,

825
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,290
I would like to assist.

826
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,850
Absolutely not.

827
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,360
Given your relationship

828
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,360
to the patient,

829
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,420
it would be inappropriate

830
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,420
and ill-advised.

831
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,620
I do not want you

832
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,620
in my OR.

833
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,960
It would still

834
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,960
be your surgery.

835
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,960
I just want to be there...

836
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,800
Dr. Rhodes, my understanding

837
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,800
of human behavior

838
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,800
may be limited,

839
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,140
but you are not acting

840
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,140
in the professional manner

841
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,140
that I am accustomed to.

842
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,040
Like any other friend

843
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,040
or family member,

844
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,670
you will sit

845
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,670
in the waiting room.

846
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,310
Dr. Bekker,

847
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,310
ah, will assist.

848
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,320
As soon as your

849
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,320
parents get here,

850
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,320
you can go.

851
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,660
How can I explain

852
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,660
what I did?

853
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,520
I don't even

854
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,520
understand it myself.

855
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,000
I do.

856
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,000
You got into Harvard.

857
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,570
Sometimes we work so hard,

858
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,570
hold ourselves so tight,

859
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,840
when we finally reach

860
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,840
our goal,

861
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,530
we go a little crazy,

862
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,530
swing from the rafters.

863
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,580
I don't know.

864
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,180
Listen to me.

865
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,180
You're gonna go to

866
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,180
a fantastic school.

867
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,240
Get a great job,

868
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,240
and 10 years from now,

869
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,290
you'll just think of this

870
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,290
as a happy memory.

871
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,540
Uh, Noah says you're not

872
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,540
coming to his party?

873
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,200
I'd really like it

874
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,200
if you did.

875
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,420
Should be done soon.

876
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,900
I was wrong to take Robin

877
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,900
out of the hospital.

878
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,470
I'm sorry.

879
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,440
Well...

880
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,020
I have certainly

881
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,020
been wrong, too.

882
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,220
Seeing the whole thing

883
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,220
through the prism

884
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,220
of my own fears.

885
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,770
Since I was a kid,

886
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,770
I always wondered

887
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,040
if there was something

888
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,040
I could've done

889
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,940
to stop my mom

890
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,940
from killing herself.

891
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,580
I obviously

892
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,580
couldn't save my mom,

893
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,650
but I was sure as hell

894
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,650
gonna try and save Robin.

895
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,390
At one point, I considered

896
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,390
bringing that up.

897
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,260
Decided it probably wouldn't

898
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,260
have been helpful.

899
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,060
Yeah, probably not.

900
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,660
Well...

901
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,740
She's not gonna want to have

902
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,740
anything to do with me

903
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,900
after this is all over.

904
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,900
That's for sure.

905
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,580
Any word?

906
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,180
No, not yet.

907
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,160
Everything okay?

908
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,360
Yeah.

909
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,770
She did well.

910
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,770
The tumor's out.

911
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,700
Now, we just have to rid

912
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,700
Robin's body

913
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,570
of the antibodies

914
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,570
with plasmapheresis.

915
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,650
Should take two hours,

916
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,650
and hopefully

917
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,650
she'll be okay.

918
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,200
Hey, Reese.

919
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,200
I've been looking for you.

920
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,260
I thought you might

921
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,260
want this back.

922
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,890
It was a gift.

923
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,890
Why would I want it back?

924
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,870
Oh, you know,

925
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,870
when people break up,

926
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,870
you give stuff back.

927
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,280
It's a Rubik's Cube, Joey.

928
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,280
Not a diamond ring. Keep it.

929
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,940
One more thing.

930
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,250
I'm dating Valerie.

931
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,050
I just thought

932
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,050
you should know.

933
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,630
I'm glad

934
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,630
you found someone.

935
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,890
Thanks.

936
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,180
Christina?

937
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,180
How are you doing?

938
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,830
We are doing

939
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,830
everything we can

940
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,830
for Marwan.

941
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,830
I'm pregnant.

942
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,130
We didn't mean it to happen.

943
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,130
We thought we

944
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,130
were being careful.

945
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,200
We were going to get married

946
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,200
after graduation.

947
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,710
Nobody knows.

948
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,710
You haven't

949
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,710
told your families?

950
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,380
We were going to tell

951
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,380
his parents tonight.

952
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,620
I am so sorry you both

953
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,620
have to suffer like this.

954
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,010
Dr. Choi?

955
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,670
Mr. Crocker.

956
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,580
They did have to

957
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,580
open your chest,

958
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,680
but you came through

959
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,680
just fine.

960
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,780
Oh, thank you.

961
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,550
Sure.

962
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,490
For caring.

963
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Hey.

964
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Hey. How's Robin?

965
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,760
She's good. Thanks.

966
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,760
Uh, you saw Mr. Crocker?

967
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,860
Yeah.

968
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,460
Pretty young to have

969
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,460
that kind of heart trouble.

970
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,340
Could be genetics, or...

971
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,340
He said he's alone, right?

972
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,280
He's not married.

973
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,280
No friends. No family.

974
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,280
None.

975
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,440
Loneliness puts you at risk

976
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,440
for heart disease.

977
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,580
That for real?

978
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,580
Yeah.

979
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,910
I think we all know

980
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,910
that love can hurt, right?

981
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,180
But loneliness?

982
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,180
That'll kill you.

983
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,520
What is it, Natalie?

984
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,090
Look at his X-rays.

985
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,090
Diffuse airway disease.

986
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,490
Even with CPS,

987
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,490
his lungs are getting worse.

988
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,830
Fast.

989
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,130
This poor kid.

990
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,100
What, are his parents

991
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,100
just flying here

992
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,100
to bury him?

993
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,400
Why can we not figure out

994
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,400
what's wrong with him?

995
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,610
We've been so focused

996
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,610
on his injuries.

997
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,580
Maybe there's

998
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,580
an underlying condition,

999
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,580
not related to the accident,

1000
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,180
that we don't know about?

1001
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,580
When Marwan got

1002
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,580
his bronchoscopy,

1003
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,580
his tidal volume dipped.

1004
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,220
It shouldn't have.

1005
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,220
Right.

1006
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,660
The paralytics

1007
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,660
should've relaxed

1008
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,660
his chest wall.

1009
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,260
So, why are his airways

1010
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,260
still so constricted?

1011
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,260
Why can't he breathe?

1012
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,230
What if it's as simple

1013
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,230
as Marwan's got asthma?

1014
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,840
That would make sense.

1015
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,840
He needs steroids.

1016
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,270
But, Natalie,

1017
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,270
if we're wrong,

1018
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,410
they'll put him at risk

1019
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,410
for infection and myopathy,

1020
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,740
and that could

1021
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,740
wind up killing him.

1022
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,370
Well, we are out of options.

1023
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,370
If we don't do

1024
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,370
something now, he will die.

1025
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,950
Candace, 125 milligrams

1026
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,950
of solu-medrol IV.

1027
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,170
Dr. Halstead,

1028
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,170
Dr. Manning?

1029
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,210
The patient's parents

1030
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,210
are here.

1031
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,210
They just arrived.

1032
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,870
Great.

1033
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,440
Hi.

1034
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,440
Hello.

1035
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,280
Thank you for

1036
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,280
taking care of him.

1037
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,610
How is he?

1038
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,240
He was seriously injured,

1039
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,290
and our main focus right now

1040
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,290
is his lung function.

1041
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,920
Tell me, is Marwan,

1042
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,920
by any chance, asthmatic?

1043
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,120
Yes, yes,

1044
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,120
since he was a child.

1045
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,120
It comes and goes.

1046
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,600
His X-ray is ready.

1047
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,090
Please, come with us.

1048
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,980
Bilateral consolidation's

1049
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,980
markedly improved.

1050
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,980
His airway pressures

1051
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,980
are coming down.

1052
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,180
What does that mean?

1053
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,290
It means

1054
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,290
we think your son's

1055
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,290
gonna be all right.

1056
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,660
Thank you.

1057
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,150
Mmm-hmm.

1058
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,590
Candace, let's start

1059
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,590
weaning him off

1060
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,590
cardiopulmonary support.

1061
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,890
You can stay

1062
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,890
with your son.

1063
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,630
Marwan's recovering.

1064
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,940
You should go

1065
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,940
introduce yourself.

1066
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't know.

1067
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,470
They should know

1068
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,470
who you are.

1069
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,860
Are you good?

1070
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,860
Yeah.

1071
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,100
Some days,

1072
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,100
I really love my job.

1073
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,480
Asthma.

1074
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,480
Astute diagnosis, Doc.

1075
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,040
Hey, don't give me

1076
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,040
all the credit.

1077
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,340
I wouldn't have gotten there

1078
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,340
if it wasn't for you.

1079
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,650
You're the genius.

1080
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,450
Marwan's awake.

1081
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,450
I got a statement from him.

1082
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,680
Ah, great.

1083
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,680
I'll go check on him.

1084
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,090
Thanks, Nat.

1085
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,090
Mmm-hmm.

1086
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,090
So, it's, uh, Noah's

1087
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,090
graduation party tonight.

1088
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,090
Yeah.

1089
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,790
Should be fun.

1090
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,790
Yeah.

1091
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
Natalie asked me

1092
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
to go with her.

1093
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,800
You mind?

1094
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,030
No. Of course not.

1095
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,170
You sure?

1096
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,280
Yeah.

1097
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,590
All right. You know,

1098
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,590
I'll tell her I pass.

1099
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,720
You need to get

1100
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,720
your act together.

1101
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,780
Hey.

1102
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,780
Is it time to go?

1103
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,880
Nina, I haven't been

1104
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,880
fair to you.

1105
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,490
You deserve someone

1106
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,490
as committed to you

1107
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,490
as you are to him,

1108
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,650
and I haven't been

1109
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,650
that person.

1110
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,090
This is about Natalie,

1111
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,090
isn't it?

1112
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,170
You lied to me, Will.

1113
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,100
You said there was nothing

1114
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,100
between you.

1115
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,460
I don't know if

1116
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,460
she has feelings for me.

1117
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,780
But I have feelings for her,

1118
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,780
and I can't go on pretending.

1119
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,770
All this time? Pretending?

1120
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,280
Nina, I care about you...

1121
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,750
Get out of here, Will. Go!

1122
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,150
I'll get my stuff

1123
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,150
out of your apartment.

1124
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,230
Sooner the better.

1125
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,690
There are balloons

1126
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,690
in my office?

1127
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,860
Hundreds of them.

1128
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,860
I can't get in.

1129
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,220
Oh.

1130
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,330
I'll call housekeeping.

1131
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,330
Maggie...

1132
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,100
Do people hate me?

1133
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,970
No, Dr. Stohl.

1134
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,770
It's quite the reverse.

1135
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,330
Then why?

1136
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,840
You know the saying,

1137
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,840
"You only hurt

1138
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,840
the ones you love."

1139
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,660
A tumor?

1140
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,660
Yeah.

1141
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,390
Reaction to your antibodies

1142
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,400
caused your

1143
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,400
psychiatric symptoms.

1144
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,230
So, I was crazy,

1145
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,230
but I wasn't crazy?

1146
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,560
Yeah,

1147
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,560
something like that.

1148
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,010
You should know something.

1149
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,050
It was your dad

1150
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,050
that came up

1151
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,050
with the diagnosis.

1152
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,590
Robin, he's hardly left

1153
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,590
your side.

1154
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,530
You should talk to him.

1155
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,460
Hi, sweetie.

1156
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,000
Honey. Um...

1157
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,010
Robin, I, uh...

1158
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,300
So, I think we can

1159
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,300
call today a draw.

1160
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:04,080
Didn't realize we were

1161
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:04,080
in a competition.

1162
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:04,080
Come on.

1163
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,080
You know, you're quite

1164
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,080
the gossip magnet.

1165
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,310
Your mother

1166
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,310
committed suicide,

1167
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,780
you drove

1168
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,780
your girlfriend crazy,

1169
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,250
and you murdered

1170
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,250
your attending,

1171
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,250
Dr. Downey.

1172
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,590
Well, then, you'd better

1173
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,590
watch yourself, hadn't you?

1174
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,830
I like dangerous men.

1175
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,960
Whoo!

1176
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,030
I want you.

1177
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,350
Come on.

1178
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,290
April.

1179
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,770
Dr. Choi.

1180
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,130
Ethan.

1181
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,500
You're still here?

1182
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,730
Mmm. Five minutes,

1183
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,730
and I'm gone.

1184
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,740
So good to hear

1185
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,740
about Robin.

1186
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,680
Yeah.

1187
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,800
Well, we made it through

1188
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,800
another year, Daniel.

1189
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,280
Gonna get

1190
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,280
a new bunch of residents

1191
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,280
to drive us crazy.

1192
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,850
Le plus Ã§a change, baby.

1193
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,320
Le plus Ã§a change.

1194
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,990
Good night, Sharon.

1195
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,990
Good night.

1196
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,430
Dr. Charles.

1197
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,600
Mr. Kellogg?

1198
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,660
I've been here all day.

1199
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,730
You haven't answered

1200
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,730
any of my messages.

1201
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,840
I'm very sorry

1202
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,840
I've had a, uh...

1203
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,840
An unusual day.

1204
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,470
Is there any way

1205
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,470
we could talk first...

1206
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,470
Liar!
