1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,830
You look good.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,830
Stop.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,200
I've just been

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,200
worried about you.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,880
Things are going well?

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,610
No more rats

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,610
since they put me

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,610
on the risperidone.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,850
That's good. That's good.

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,850
So, you're feeling

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,850
better, then?

12
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,150
Yeah. And I

13
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,150
want to get the hell

14
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,150
out of here.

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,960
Robin, there's something

16
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,960
that I have to tell you.

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,270
The reason why

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,270
you're in here...

19
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,600
I asked your father

20
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,600
to check in on you.

21
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,610
I had no idea

22
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,610
that he would

23
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,610
do something like...

24
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,200
It's not your fault.

25
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,200
You couldn't have known

26
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,200
he'd do this.

27
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,640
It's not all bad.

28
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,510
Hey, they let me

29
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,510
use the shower.

30
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,380
Not without

31
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,380
supervision, though.

32
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,020
They are worried

33
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,020
about suicide in here,

34
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,620
so no shoelaces, no belts.

35
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,120
See the sink?

36
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,120
No faucet.

37
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,430
Evidently,

38
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,430
if you wrap your gown

39
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,430
around your neck just right,

40
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,490
you can use it

41
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,490
to strangle yourself.

42
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,570
You don't belong in here.

43
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,570
Not according to

44
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,570
the petition Dad filed.

45
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,300
Article 6 of the Mental Health

46
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,300
and Disabilities Code.

47
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,940
No. I'm serious, Robin.

48
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,940
So you heard rats.

49
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,940
So what?

50
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,950
This is not

51
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,950
the solution.

52
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,840
What can I do?

53
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,260
Oh, I really appreciate

54
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,260
your being here.

55
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,130
Support from friends

56
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,130
and family is crucial

57
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,790
for the therapeutic process,

58
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,790
so thank you.

59
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,230
Committed against her will?

60
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,670
She can't even

61
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,670
shower by herself.

62
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,700
That is some

63
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,700
therapeutic process.

64
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,870
I think we all wish

65
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,870
this could've

66
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,870
happened differently,

67
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,540
but, you know,

68
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,540
at least she's getting

69
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,540
the care that she needs,

70
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,700
and she's safe and secure.

71
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,700
No. She's locked up.

72
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,540
In prison.

73
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,540
It's not the same thing.

74
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,020
This place is what is

75
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,020
gonna drive her crazy.

76
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,020
She needs to be out of here.

77
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,240
Good morning, Nat.

78
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,240
Morning.

79
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,050
Hey, Natalie,

80
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,050
have you seen Reese?

81
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,450
No. Sorry.

82
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,450
Hey, how's Robin doing?

83
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,750
I've been meaning

84
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,750
to ask, but...

85
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,150
I know,

86
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,150
it's a delicate situation.

87
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,350
She's dealing. Yeah.

88
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,350
Okay.

89
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,190
Well, if you need anything,

90
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,190
just please ask.

91
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,750
Thanks.

92
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,750
Okay.

93
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,590
April, today's match day.

94
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,590
Did Noah land here at Med?

95
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,960
Texted him a dozen times.

96
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,960
No response.

97
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,530
They're only taking

98
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,530
one local student,

99
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
so that makes me think

100
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
he didn't get it.

101
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,730
Or maybe he just wants

102
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,730
to tell you in person.

103
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,200
No news could be

104
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,200
good news, too.

105
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,260
Let's hope.

106
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,810
It means "White butterfly"

107
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,810
in Portuguese.

108
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,910
Yeah, that doesn't

109
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,910
clear things up.

110
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,210
It's a Brazilian

111
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,210
superstition.

112
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,740
So, if the first butterfly

113
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,740
you see in the year

114
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,740
is white, it's good luck.

115
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,410
I saw one a few weeks ago.

116
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,320
Technically, doesn't that

117
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,320
only bring you luck?

118
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,980
Wouldn't Noah need

119
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,980
to have seen this white...

120
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,590
Seriously? You really want

121
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,590
to analyze the cosmic power

122
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,590
of an insect sighting?

123
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,020
Probably an argument

124
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,020
I don't win, huh?

125
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,730
Dr. Choi, incoming!

126
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,170
Peds versus auto.

127
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,170
You're going to Baghdad.

128
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,170
Courtney?

129
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,170
Gary Foster, 32.

130
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,170
Tripped and fell

131
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,170
into oncoming traffic.

132
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,500
He got plowed by a taxi.

133
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,170
GCS 15, vitals stable,

134
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,170
16 gauge in the right AC.

135
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,800
Loss of consciousness?

136
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,800
Yeah, briefly,

137
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,680
but he was talking

138
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,680
by the time we got there.

139
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,940
Wanted to make sure

140
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,940
no one blames

141
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,180
the cab driver

142
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,180
for what happened.

143
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,190
It was my fault.

144
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,190
I felt myself falling.

145
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,190
I just couldn't stop it.

146
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,740
It's okay, Mr. Foster.

147
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,740
It was an accident.

148
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,220
Let's transfer on my count.

149
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,220
One, two, three.

150
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,730
Breath sounds clear

151
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,730
and present bilaterally.

152
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,170
BP 122 over 70.

153
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,170
Heart rate 112. Sats 100%.

154
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,500
Let's roll him off

155
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,500
the board slowly.

156
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,340
Easy.

157
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,340
Okay, okay, okay.

158
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,340
Good God! That hurts!

159
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,820
Okay, Mr. Foster,

160
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,820
listen to me close, okay?

161
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,820
Okay.

162
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,410
Can you touch your chin

163
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,410
to your chest?

164
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,410
Hmm?

165
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,250
Good, good, good.

166
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,250
Now, left to right.

167
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,790
Good. C-spine's clear.

168
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,790
We can lose the collar.

169
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,820
All right, April,

170
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,820
50 of fentanyl for the pain.

171
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,730
Let's get X-rays.

172
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,730
Chest, pelvis, left humerus.

173
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,430
I also want a CT head,

174
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,430
abdomen, and pelvis,

175
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,430
and let's get an EKG.

176
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,970
This is bad, isn't it?

177
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,970
Just try to stay calm,

178
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,970
Mr. Foster.

179
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,030
Okay.

180
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,770
It's okay.

181
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,770
We're gonna help you.

182
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,380
Reese, you got a second?

183
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
Uh, so,

184
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
I just saw Robin.

185
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,980
It seems like

186
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,980
her therapy's going well.

187
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,250
It is. It is. She is lucid

188
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,250
and responding

189
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,250
to her medication.

190
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,480
Most importantly,

191
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,480
she is letting us help her.

192
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,960
I wasn't sure

193
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,960
she'd be so trusting,

194
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,150
considering how

195
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,150
this went down.

196
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,760
So, she tells me

197
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,760
that you guys

198
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,290
are diagnosing this

199
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,290
as schizophreniform.

200
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,660
Yeah, it's looking

201
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,660
like that.

202
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,630
Now, from what I've read,

203
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,630
to be able to make

204
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,630
that call,

205
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,500
the symptoms have to last

206
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,500
for at least a month.

207
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,830
Is that how long

208
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,830
you guys are planning

209
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,830
on keeping her?

210
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,300
Uh, well, right now,

211
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,300
it's all about making sure

212
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,300
her psychosis is under control

213
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,930
and her meds

214
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,930
are dosed appropriately.

215
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,570
Anything about...

216
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,570
Thank you.

217
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,110
...release dates,

218
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,110
you really should speak

219
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,110
with her attending.

220
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,910
Right. Dr. Kwon.

221
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,910
I actually did.

222
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,120
He reminded me that

223
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,120
patience is a virtue.

224
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm pretty sure

225
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,920
that Dr. Charles

226
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,680
put those words

227
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,680
in his mouth.

228
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,090
Reese,

229
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,090
this is all messed up.

230
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,250
I'm sorry, Connor,

231
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,250
but I don't know

232
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,250
what you want me to say.

233
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,470
If Robin had been

234
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,470
committed in Indiana,

235
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,470
she'd be released already.

236
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,000
Same with Michigan.

237
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,000
Same with Wisconsin.

238
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,800
All of those states

239
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,800
have shorter holds.

240
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,530
But this is Illinois,

241
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,530
and I don't make the laws.

242
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,630
Tell me

243
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,630
this couldn't be treated

244
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,630
on an outpatient basis.

245
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,180
That's not up to me.

246
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,570
Is she, or is she not

247
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,570
a danger to herself?

248
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,650
At this exact moment, no,

249
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,650
but it's not that simple.

250
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,910
Yes, it is.

251
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,020
Ah! So, what's the word?

252
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,190
I matched my first choice.

253
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,590
Really?

254
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,590
Emergency medicine.

255
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,290
That's great!

256
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,290
I'm so happy for you!

257
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,190
Really? You got

258
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,190
the Med spot?

259
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,440
Knew you could do it.

260
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,440
I had my eye on you

261
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,440
from the get-go.

262
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,460
Don't worry about Stohl.

263
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,460
I won't.

264
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,010
Does Natalie know?

265
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,100
Not yet. I was waiting

266
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,100
to see where I wound up.

267
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,670
Hmm.

268
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,670
Keoni? What did you do?

269
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,050
No clue.

270
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,380
Jeff, with me.

271
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,380
We're going

272
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,380
to Treatment Two.

273
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,050
Doing a DIY reno

274
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,050
on the bar.

275
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
Been tripping over

276
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
construction supplies

277
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
all week.

278
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,850
Must have twisted my ankle.

279
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,850
Didn't notice till

280
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,850
it got really bad.

281
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,950
All right, cool.

282
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,950
Let's take a look.

283
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,330
Hop up there.

284
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,330
Take a look at this flat tire.

285
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,330
These your construction boots?

286
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm Hawaiian, brah.

287
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,160
Slippers are multipurpose.

288
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,200
You got a nail

289
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,200
in your foot, dude.

290
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,570
You're kidding?

291
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,470
Wow. It doesn't hurt?

292
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,840
Been barefoot

293
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,840
or in slippers

294
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,840
since I could walk.

295
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,980
Calluses so tough,

296
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,980
I could walk on hot coals

297
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,980
and wouldn't even flinch.

298
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,980
Swing your foot

299
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,980
up there for me.

300
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,620
Let's get a CBC,

301
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,620
a CMP, and a tetanus,

302
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,180
and have Danny come down

303
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,180
with a portable X-ray machine.

304
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,280
Okay.

305
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,720
You've been living

306
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,720
in Chicago 20 years, Keoni.

307
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,720
Put on some shoes.

308
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,820
And give up

309
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,820
the endless summer?

310
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,820
Never.

311
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,960
Hey, April.

312
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,960
Bummer about Noah.

313
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,300
What?

314
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,300
You didn't hear?

315
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,270
Jeff got the Med spot.

316
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,270
Oh. Well, good for him.

317
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,270
I'm sure Noah

318
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,270
matched somewhere great.

319
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,280
Her stomach's been hurting her

320
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,280
for a few days now,

321
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,140
but an hour ago,

322
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,140
everything just went haywire.

323
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,450
She's been screaming in pain.

324
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,450
She gets really confused.

325
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,610
Abdominal pelvic ultrasound.

326
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,610
On it.

327
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,410
Okay, Allison,

328
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,410
can you tell me

329
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,410
exactly where it hurts?

330
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,510
I just got braces

331
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,510
put on last week.

332
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,150
See the confusion?

333
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,150
And her eyes,

334
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,150
she can't even focus.

335
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,590
It's called "nystagmus."

336
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,590
Is she taking any drugs?

337
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,190
No. No, no, no.

338
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,190
Has Allison

339
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,190
started menstruating?

340
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,730
I don't know. Maybe.

341
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,430
Is she sexually active?

342
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,430
Could she be pregnant?

343
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,760
She's only 13!

344
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,200
Look, I don't think so.

345
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,200
I'm just a stepdad, so...

346
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,800
Ali, baby! I'm sorry.

347
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,800
I came as fast as I could.

348
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,110
Baby, what's happening?

349
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,110
I don't understand.

350
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,170
She said

351
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,170
she was feeling better

352
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,170
when I left for work.

353
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,210
Not seeing any free fluids,

354
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,210
no ovarian abnormalities.

355
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,750
All right,

356
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,750
let's do a CBC, CMP,

357
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,750
chest X-ray, cultures,

358
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,880
head CT, tox screen,

359
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,880
blood and urine,

360
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,880
and a serum pregnancy.

361
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,590
Wait, pregnancy? What? No.

362
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,590
Ali is still a virgin.

363
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,720
She hasn't even started

364
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,720
talking about boys yet.

365
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,560
I understand, but these

366
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,560
are standard tests.

367
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,330
We just need to run them

368
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,330
to be safe, okay?

369
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,990
Can you just give her

370
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,990
something for the pain,

371
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,990
please?

372
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,660
I'm sorry, but we can't

373
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,660
do that until the tests

374
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,660
are finished.

375
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,970
Baby, what's going on?

376
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,970
Keep away from me!

377
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,740
We will figure

378
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,740
this out, okay?

379
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,740
I'll be back shortly.

380
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,510
I can grab you

381
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,510
some more pillows

382
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,510
if you need them.

383
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,750
If it were only that easy.

384
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
Mr. Foster,

385
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
I got your X-rays

386
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
and scans.

387
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,850
There are

388
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,850
multiple fractures

389
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,850
on your left side.

390
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,620
L1 through L4 of your spine,

391
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,620
humerus, pelvis, and ribs.

392
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,660
Good news is

393
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,660
they won't require surgery.

394
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,660
They'll heal on their own.

395
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,060
How long will that take?

396
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,060
On average,

397
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,060
six to eight weeks.

398
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,860
After that, between rehab

399
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,860
and physical therapy,

400
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,800
likely a year

401
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,800
before you're back

402
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,800
to full strength.

403
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,040
A year.

404
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,040
Might as well

405
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,040
be forever.

406
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,970
Now, there is

407
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,970
one more injury.

408
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,710
The head CT revealed

409
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,750
a left-sided

410
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,750
subdural hematoma

411
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,750
and skull fracture.

412
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,250
Our neurosurgeon,

413
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,250
Dr. Abrams,

414
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,550
wants to schedule

415
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,550
surgery immediately.

416
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,650
What happens if I decline?

417
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,820
Mr. Foster,

418
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,820
you're bleeding

419
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,820
inside your brain.

420
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,820
If the pressure

421
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,820
within your skull

422
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,360
isn't released,

423
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,360
it will get worse.

424
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,220
It's highly likely

425
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,220
you'll die.

426
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm already dying.

427
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,500
I have ALS.

428
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,500
It's progressing rapidly.

429
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,140
That's why I fell.

430
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,410
By the time my bones heal,

431
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,250
the disease

432
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,250
will be ravaging me.

433
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,950
Yeah, but you'll be alive.

434
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,950
Barely.

435
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,180
Confined to a wheelchair,

436
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,680
hooked up to a ventilator.

437
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,590
No. I don't want that.

438
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,590
No surgery.

439
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,510
I mean, there shouldn't

440
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,510
even be a debate. We can

441
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,510
save Mr. Foster's life.

442
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,100
I understand, April,

443
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,100
but unfortunately,

444
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,100
that's not the issue.

445
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,240
His hematoma's worsening.

446
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,240
He's gonna bleed to death.

447
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,750
At this rate, he's got

448
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,750
a couple weeks at best.

449
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,380
We have to act.

450
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,380
We can't.

451
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,280
I've studied Mr. Foster's

452
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,280
advanced directives,

453
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,320
so has the hospital's

454
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,320
legal counsel.

455
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,120
It's ironclad.

456
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,920
So, that just makes it

457
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,920
okay to do nothing?

458
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,360
April, part of

459
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,360
Mr. Foster's directive

460
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,360
instructs that upon death,

461
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,090
his organs and tissues

462
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,090
be donated.

463
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,660
Clearly,

464
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,660
this isn't a rash decision,

465
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,660
so what's the discussion?

466
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,470
That we have to sit by

467
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,470
and watch a man die

468
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,940
when we can easily

469
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,940
extend his life.

470
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,070
It's wrong.

471
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,940
Yeah, well,

472
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,940
we may not agree

473
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,940
with his decision,

474
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,170
but it is his choice

475
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,170
to make.

476
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,880
Transfer the patient

477
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,880
to the ICU.

478
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,180
Sharon?

479
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,350
I need a minute.

480
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,350
Yes.

481
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,720
Hey, update me on Allison?

482
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,990
White count's

483
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,990
moderately elevated,

484
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,990
but her fever's rising,

485
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,230
and she's disinhibited

486
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,230
with a decreased level

487
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,230
of consciousness.

488
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,670
Drug overdose?

489
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,670
Tox screen was negative.

490
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,170
As was every other test.

491
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,940
Pregnancy, urinalysis,

492
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,940
chest X-ray, CT,

493
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,940
pelvic ultrasound.

494
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,740
Neurologic infection?

495
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,540
Meningitis?

496
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,540
Encephalitis?

497
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,540
You get an LP?

498
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,170
Just did. CSF was clear.

499
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,850
Whatever this is, it's viral.

500
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,850
The lab's running a PCR.

501
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,190
Okay. Keep me posted.

502
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,190
Mmm-hmm.

503
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,720
Hey, Doris told me

504
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,720
you matched in

505
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,720
Emergency Medicine.

506
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,950
That's awesome.

507
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,990
Way to go, Clarke.

508
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,990
Good to have you.

509
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,990
Thanks.

510
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,260
Hey, um, there is

511
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,260
something that I've

512
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,260
been meaning to talk...

513
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,660
Natalie!

514
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,260
She's seizing.

515
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,100
Oh, my God,

516
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,100
make it stop!

517
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,140
Two of Ativan.

518
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,140
Got it.

519
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,870
Sats are dropping, 77, 76.

520
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,910
Allison,

521
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,910
can you feel this?

522
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,040
I need to intubate.

523
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,550
No drugs.

524
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,550
Her jaw is loose.

525
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,850
We're gonna fix this.

526
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,910
Okay, almost.

527
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,910
Yeah.

528
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,690
No, no, no, no, no.

529
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,690
You're gonna choke her!

530
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,350
She won't be able

531
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,350
to breathe otherwise.

532
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,230
I'm in.

533
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,230
Okay. I got it. I got it.

534
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,330
Secure the tube

535
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,330
and start bagging.

536
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,570
Stat chest X-ray and call

537
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,570
up to the pediatric ICU

538
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,570
for a bed.

539
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,740
Wait, ICU?

540
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,740
What's going on with her?

541
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,340
Hey, man. I got your labs.

542
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,810
Good news only, please.

543
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,440
Can I sit?

544
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,280
Uh-oh.

545
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,280
Everything's normal

546
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,280
except your blood glucose.

547
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,280
It's extremely high.

548
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,420
Diabetes.

549
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,420
Yes.

550
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,690
I'm gonna start you

551
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,690
on IV fluids and insulin

552
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,690
and order hemoglobin A1C.

553
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,090
Get a better reading

554
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,090
on your sugar levels.

555
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,560
Diabetes can make

556
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,560
your feet numb.

557
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,990
That's why I didn't

558
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,990
realize I had a nail

559
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,990
in my foot, isn't it?

560
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,700
Yeah.

561
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,670
I've been sick for a while.

562
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,670
Look, the important thing...

563
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,000
We caught it.

564
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,670
Some lifestyle adjustments,

565
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,670
and you'll get way

566
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,670
out ahead of this thing.

567
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,580
Yeah, sure.

568
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,040
Look, I get it.

569
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,040
Change isn't easy,

570
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,850
but in the long run,

571
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,850
it's the only way.

572
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,680
I'm gonna page Endocrinology,

573
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,680
have them come down

574
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,680
for a consult.

575
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,420
They should be able to answer

576
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,420
all your questions.

577
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,970
Hey.

578
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,970
Allison's LP results.

579
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,970
Encephalitis.

580
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,140
Oh, my God. HSE?

581
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,140
Yeah.

582
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,970
Fever, neuro issues,

583
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,970
seizures, now the coma...

584
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,970
Virus fits the symptoms.

585
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,340
Yeah.

586
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,710
I just didn't see it coming.

587
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,710
I mean, she's 13. Herpes?

588
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,460
April!

589
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,660
BP's falling.

590
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,660
94 over 66.

591
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,060
Heart's racing.

592
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,060
Pulse is 120.

593
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,760
All right,

594
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,760
lungs are wet. Sats?

595
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,970
Can't get a reading.

596
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,470
Fingers are swollen,

597
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,470
purple. Pulse ox monitor

598
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,470
can't register.

599
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,640
Get a blood gas.

600
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,250
Toes are purple.

601
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,250
Earlobes, too.

602
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,440
Blood in the eyes,

603
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,440
nasal passage.

604
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,810
What's happening?

605
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,180
Your circulation's

606
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,180
being cut off.

607
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,620
Oxygen's not moving well

608
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,620
through your body.

609
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,880
Why?

610
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,880
I'm not sure.

611
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,980
PCO 256, PAO 255.

612
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,290
All right, let's increase

613
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,290
the oxygen to 10 liters.

614
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,720
April?

615
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,760
Is he still being

616
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,760
transferred to the ICU?

617
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,130
Hold off for now.

618
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,170
Let's test for DIC.

619
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,370
If that's what

620
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,370
we're seeing,

621
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,040
I think there may be

622
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,040
a way to convince Gary

623
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,040
to fix his brain bleed.

624
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,850
Oh. Hey, were you

625
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,850
looking for me?

626
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,280
Uh... Please join us,

627
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,280
Dr. Charles.

628
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,060
This is Nicole Jansen

629
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,060
of Shipley...

630
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,070
Shipley Austin & Shea.

631
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,900
I'm representing

632
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,900
the interest

633
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,900
of Robin Charles.

634
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,860
Lawyers?

635
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,900
I'm hoping you can

636
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,900
provide some clarity

637
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,140
on the circumstances

638
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,140
surrounding Ms. Charles'

639
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,140
involuntary hold.

640
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,010
I don't see how

641
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,010
it's not clear.

642
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,540
A petition was filed

643
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,540
in accordance

644
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,540
with state law.

645
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,020
And within 24 hours,

646
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,020
Dr. Kwon here signed...

647
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,750
I will get to Dr. Kwon.

648
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,350
First, I want to talk about

649
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,350
the filing of the original

650
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,350
petition by Dr. Charles,

651
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,190
the hospital's

652
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,190
Chief of Psychiatry,

653
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,190
but also my client's father.

654
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,960
Interesting.

655
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,240
Allison has HSV type 2,

656
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,040
which is more

657
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,040
commonly associated

658
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,040
with genital herpes than oral.

659
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,480
Genital? No.

660
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,350
Ali doesn't do that.

661
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,350
And when? Where?

662
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,620
She's either at school,

663
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,620
or at home with one of us.

664
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,620
Right, Kevin?

665
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,160
Yeah, look, I work from home.

666
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,160
Nothing's going on

667
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,160
at the house.

668
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,620
Okay, no boys

669
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,620
come over, ever.

670
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,630
I know girls

671
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,630
don't tell their mothers

672
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,630
everything.

673
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,460
God knows I didn't,

674
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,460
but Ali and me, we talk.

675
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,800
Have you noticed

676
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,800
any change in Allison's mood,

677
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,230
or personality

678
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,230
in the last few days?

679
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,230
No.

680
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,710
Besides being sick,

681
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,710
she's been her usual

682
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,710
happy self. Why?

683
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,470
Allison's abdominal pain

684
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,470
is inconsistent with

685
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,470
the HSE diagnosis,

686
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,740
and it may be a sign

687
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,740
of sexual assault.

688
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,440
We'd like to perform

689
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,440
a more extensive pelvic exam

690
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,440
just to be sure.

691
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,780
Is that

692
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,780
really necessary?

693
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,480
Come on, it's not gonna

694
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,480
have any effect on how

695
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,480
you treat her, is it?

696
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,050
There might be

697
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,050
some internal damaging

698
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,920
and bleeding that needs

699
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,920
to be repaired,

700
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,190
and it is possible

701
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,190
she may have contracted

702
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,190
another STD.

703
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,730
Look, can it just wait?

704
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,730
Can it wait

705
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,130
until we just have

706
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,130
a moment to figure out...

707
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,760
It's okay.

708
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,500
It's okay.

709
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,500
You can perform the exam.

710
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,040
Are you sure?

711
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,040
Yeah.

712
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,410
Um, if this is that,

713
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,410
I need to know. I'm sorry.

714
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,000
Babe. Baby...

715
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,080
We'll get started

716
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,080
right away.

717
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,750
I'll start Robin's

718
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,750
discharge paperwork.

719
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,750
Thank you.

720
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,990
Hmm. Little heads-up,

721
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,990
you know,

722
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,990
would've been nice.

723
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,300
I found out just

724
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,300
before you did.

725
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,300
I mean, come on.

726
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,470
Rhodes' name's

727
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,470
on the building,

728
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,570
so he gets to decide

729
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,570
who's fit to be released?

730
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,910
Is this a joke?

731
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,910
Sharon, it's Robin!

732
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,470
I thought that you guys

733
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,470
would at least

734
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,470
go to the wall for Robin.

735
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,510
Daniel, if we don't

736
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,510
make a deal in this room,

737
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,990
the next place we'll meet

738
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,990
will be in front of a judge

739
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,990
with Robin

740
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,490
and a team of doctors

741
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,490
that they've assembled

742
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,490
to challenge our every move.

743
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,220
That's not good for anyone,

744
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,220
especially for you.

745
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,700
Okay, well, then,

746
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,700
I appreciate

747
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,700
you looking out for me.

748
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Daniel. Daniel, come on.

749
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,490
Thank you very much.

750
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,490
Absolutely.

751
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,900
Dr. Charles, don't.

752
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,900
It'll just start...

753
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,900
Not now, not now.

754
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,440
Hey, Connor. Connor.

755
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,440
I'm just curious.

756
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,210
So, you're the one

757
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,210
who's gonna be taking care

758
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,210
of Robin now?

759
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,400
Yeah.

760
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,400
I mean, you're

761
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,400
a surgical fellow, buddy.

762
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,850
You're working

763
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,850
36-hour shifts.

764
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,380
Uh-huh. So, I'll adjust

765
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,380
my schedule and

766
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,380
we'll make it work.

767
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,780
But what happens next time

768
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,780
she has a psychotic break?

769
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,050
I mean, even if you're home,

770
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,050
you're not equipped

771
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,050
to deal with it.

772
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,250
Every second

773
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,250
that she spends

774
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,250
in that ward,

775
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,730
her resentment

776
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,730
towards you grows.

777
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,590
Can't you see

778
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,590
that I'm trying

779
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,590
to do you a favor?

780
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,460
Don't do me

781
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,460
any favors! Don't!

782
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,970
Look, I came to you

783
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,970
out of concern

784
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,970
for Robin, not panic!

785
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,400
And you escalated things!

786
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,570
You don't have a clue

787
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,570
what you are dealing with.

788
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,640
Is this some kind of game

789
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,640
to you where you get

790
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,640
to be the hero?

791
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,270
Is that what it is?

792
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,270
No, this is not a game.

793
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,070
You made a mess,

794
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,070
and I'm fixing it.

795
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,070
Right.

796
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,670
By bringing in

797
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,670
Daddy's big guns.

798
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,670
Well done.

799
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,980
She is not

800
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,980
a little girl anymore!

801
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,450
Okay? You can't

802
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,450
make up for your own

803
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,450
failings as a father

804
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,450
by treating her

805
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,450
like one now!

806
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,790
Give it up.

807
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,160
Allison's pelvic exam

808
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,160
yielded evidence

809
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,160
of vaginal trauma.

810
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,130
Perforated hymen,

811
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,130
mucosal tears,

812
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,130
severe edema, swelling.

813
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,540
All clear evidence

814
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,540
of sexual assault.

815
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,170
Timeline?

816
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,400
The status of

817
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,400
the bruising indicates

818
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,810
the trauma took place

819
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,810
about five

820
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,810
to seven days ago,

821
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,710
consistent with

822
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,710
the incubation period

823
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,710
of the encephalitis.

824
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,380
Poor baby.

825
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,050
All right, I'll activate

826
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,050
the rape protocols

827
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,050
and notify PD.

828
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,250
This case

829
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,250
is now a crime.

830
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,250
Yeah.

831
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,220
We'll talk to the parents

832
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,220
about what comes next.

833
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,560
All right.

834
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,560
Thanks, Ms. Goodwin.

835
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,860
Mmm-hmm.

836
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,320
And where are you going?

837
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,020
Gonna go get

838
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,020
some fresh air.

839
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,020
With your clothes

840
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,020
over your arm?

841
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,990
I've seen

842
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,990
too many people skip out

843
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,990
after getting bad news.

844
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,190
It never ends well.

845
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,390
What does it matter

846
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,390
if I stay or if I go?

847
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,770
The results

848
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,770
are the same.

849
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,770
I doubt that.

850
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,150
Move.

851
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,150
No chance.

852
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,210
So, where does

853
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,210
that leave us?

854
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,790
I'm scared.

855
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,430
It's okay.

856
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,430
Come on back.

857
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,440
I know someone

858
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,440
you should talk to.

859
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,510
Ah, a shrink?

860
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,700
Something like that.

861
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,620
The trauma nurse

862
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,620
won't let me be

863
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,620
in there with her.

864
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,090
It's protocol,

865
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,090
just while they're

866
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,090
collecting evidence.

867
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,530
It won't be long, though.

868
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,860
I'm gonna go get

869
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,860
a cup of coffee.

870
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,860
You want one?

871
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,530
No.

872
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,440
Wait, wait. Can I ask you...

873
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,440
Can I ask you something,

874
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,440
Dr. Manning?

875
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,370
Of course.

876
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,180
Could you be having

877
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,180
unprotected sex regularly

878
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,150
with someone with herpes

879
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,150
and not catch it?

880
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,650
Not even be aware

881
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,650
that they have it?

882
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,780
Yes.

883
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,450
I don't want to believe

884
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,450
it could be true,

885
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,960
but the only person

886
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,960
who was alone with Ali

887
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,960
in the past week was Kevin.

888
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,760
I can't think

889
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,760
of anyone else

890
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,760
it might've been.

891
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,100
Ms. Nicholson,

892
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,100
Huh?

893
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,260
You can be with

894
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,260
your daughter now.

895
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,670
Thank you.

896
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,300
I'm just being

897
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,300
paranoid, right?

898
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,550
I suppose I can't talk

899
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,550
to the girl for

900
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,550
some time, right?

901
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,880
No.

902
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,790
Um, the mom thinks

903
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,790
the stepdad

904
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,790
might've done it.

905
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,490
Wouldn't surprise me.

906
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,490
That's where

907
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,490
I was gonna start.

908
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,330
Seriously, Jay,

909
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,990
I don't know

910
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,990
how you go to work

911
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,990
and do this every day.

912
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,130
I could say

913
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,130
the same thing

914
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,130
for you.

915
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,280
I gotta take this.

916
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,680
My feet are cold.

917
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,250
I'll get you

918
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,250
some more blankets.

919
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,420
Everything hurts.

920
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,260
It's from

921
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,260
Disseminated Intravascular

922
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,260
Coagulation, DIC.

923
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,690
Clots are forming

924
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,690
inside your vessels,

925
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,690
blocking blood flow

926
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,800
and depriving you

927
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,800
of oxygen.

928
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,840
Your organs are failing.

929
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,930
Unfortunately,

930
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,930
in this condition,

931
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,600
they're not suitable

932
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,600
for transplant.

933
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

934
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,540
I won't be able to donate?

935
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,210
No.

936
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,970
There's got

937
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,970
to be something

938
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,970
you can do.

939
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,350
Mr. Foster, if you allow us

940
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,350
to operate on the hematoma,

941
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,990
that puts us

942
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,990
in a better position

943
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,990
to treat the DIC.

944
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,890
No. Then we're back

945
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,890
to where we started.

946
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,850
I'm laying here

947
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,850
with broken bones

948
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,850
that won't heal

949
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,990
before I'm locked up

950
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,990
on life support.

951
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,300
Listen, you can't let

952
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,300
my organs die

953
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,300
before I do.

954
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,340
Please?

955
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,580
There is a fix

956
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,580
for the DIC. Heparin.

957
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,380
It's a drug

958
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,380
that prevents the clots

959
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,380
from getting larger.

960
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,780
Mr. Foster,

961
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,780
heparin is a blood thinner,

962
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,560
which means it will

963
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,560
also significantly worsen

964
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,560
the bleeding in your brain.

965
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,260
Instead of weeks to live,

966
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,260
you'll have only hours.

967
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,520
Weeks weren't much,

968
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,370
but that gave me time

969
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,370
to say goodbyes.

970
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,930
Hours, though.

971
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,240
Mr. Foster,

972
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,240
if we're gonna start

973
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,240
the heparin...

974
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,470
The sooner, the better.

975
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,280
Yeah.

976
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,850
You don't have to do this.

977
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,850
You can change your mind.

978
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,290
What would you like to do?

979
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,700
Give me the heparin.

980
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,460
Gary, are you sure?

981
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,900
Yes.

982
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,310
Okay. Excuse us.

983
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,510
April!

984
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,880
We cannot do this, Ethan.

985
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,880
He was clear in his decision.

986
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,590
Because you pressured him,

987
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,590
made him feel he had

988
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,590
to choose right now.

989
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,120
No, I gave him

990
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,120
his medical options,

991
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,780
and he decided on

992
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,780
what was best for him.

993
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,380
Don't put this on me.

994
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,380
It is on you.

995
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,630
Your hands may have been tied

996
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,630
by his advance directive,

997
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,720
but giving him heparin,

998
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,720
knowing it's lethal,

999
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,720
that's assisted suicide.

1000
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,790
April, we can't save Gary,

1001
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,170
but one organ donor

1002
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,170
can save up to eight lives.

1003
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,930
One tissue donor can improve

1004
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,930
the lives of up to 50 others.

1005
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,570
Because of him,

1006
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,570
58 people get a second chance.

1007
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,600
Put in the order for heparin.

1008
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,370
No.

1009
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,020
Then I'll do it myself.

1010
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,860
This is everything you had

1011
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,860
when you were admitted.

1012
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,430
Thank you.

1013
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,100
You can't hold me

1014
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,100
here any longer.

1015
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,500
I know.

1016
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,900
Look...

1017
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,900
Whatever you have to say,

1018
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,150
I don't want to hear it.

1019
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,150
I just want you

1020
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,150
to be safe, Robin.

1021
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,580
I'm going to be.

1022
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,590
With Connor.

1023
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,630
What is up,

1024
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,630
family?

1025
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,100
Matched at Chicago Med!

1026
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,410
Emergency Medicine, baby!

1027
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,410
Let's get it!

1028
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,670
April, we did it!

1029
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,410
What? I don't understand.

1030
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,410
I thought Jeff

1031
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,410
got the match.

1032
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,480
What? No, no, no.

1033
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,480
It's official.

1034
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,290
Only one local spot at Med,

1035
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,290
and it's all mine!

1036
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,620
Oh, I'm home!

1037
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,000
I knew you'd do it.

1038
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,000
Had my eye on you

1039
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,000
from the get-go.

1040
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,800
Hey, what's going on?

1041
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,930
I matched in Honolulu.

1042
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,930
Chicago Med wasn't

1043
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,930
even on the list.

1044
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,310
Good luck, Clarke.

1045
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,310
Thanks.

1046
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,670
I just assumed...

1047
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,110
I mean, you must have known

1048
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,110
about this for a while now.

1049
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,350
Yeah.

1050
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,350
Why didn't

1051
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,350
you say anything?

1052
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,390
I don't know.

1053
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,390
I just felt like it

1054
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,390
was time to move on.

1055
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,550
Okay.

1056
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,550
Hey, Nat?

1057
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,220
Sorry, Jeff. I need her.

1058
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,220
Will, can I grab you

1059
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,220
for a second?

1060
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,790
Let's talk later?

1061
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,790
Yeah.

1062
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,830
I spoke to the parents

1063
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,830
together and independently.

1064
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,000
And?

1065
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't like the stepdad

1066
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,000
for the guy.

1067
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,010
He offered

1068
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,010
to give a polygraph

1069
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,010
and submit his DNA.

1070
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,940
Offenders don't usually

1071
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,940
behave that way.

1072
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,480
Any other leads?

1073
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,040
Uh, Allison's

1074
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,040
comprehensive tox screen

1075
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,040
detected trace amounts

1076
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,140
of triazolam in her blood.

1077
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,380
That's a benzo, right?

1078
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,290
Yeah, a sedative hypnotic

1079
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,290
with amnestic properties.

1080
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,480
The stepdad's an accountant.

1081
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,480
I don't see him

1082
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,480
getting his hands on that.

1083
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,920
Unless maybe

1084
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,920
he was prescribed it.

1085
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,590
I mean, it is sometimes

1086
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,590
used for insomnia.

1087
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,820
Yeah, it definitely

1088
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,820
puts you out.

1089
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,390
The hospital uses it

1090
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,390
mostly to treat

1091
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,390
patient anxiety,

1092
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,460
usually before procedures,

1093
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,460
MRI scans, things like that.

1094
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,130
So, she could've

1095
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,130
gotten it here.

1096
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,430
Did you give it to her

1097
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,430
before the CT scan?

1098
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,940
No.

1099
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,800
Another doctor then, maybe.

1100
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,140
Did the mom mention

1101
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,140
any other recent

1102
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,140
medical issues?

1103
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,650
No. Nothing.

1104
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,650
Other than the symptoms

1105
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,650
that brought her in today.

1106
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,920
Braces. Allison did

1107
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,920
just get her braces on.

1108
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,180
Dentists also sometimes

1109
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,180
use triazolam.

1110
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,930
After you pass,

1111
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,930
you'll immediately

1112
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,930
be taken into the OR,

1113
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,230
where your organs

1114
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,230
and tissues

1115
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,230
will be recovered.

1116
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,270
When that happens,

1117
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,270
will it hurt?

1118
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,270
No.

1119
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,970
The bleeding in your brain

1120
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,970
will starve it of oxygen.

1121
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,670
You'll lose consciousness,

1122
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,780
and then you'll shut down.

1123
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,810
I'll be dead.

1124
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,220
Your brain will be.

1125
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,220
But your body

1126
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,220
will still be alive.

1127
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,380
But you won't be able

1128
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,380
to control your breathing.

1129
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,790
The organs still

1130
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,790
need oxygen, though,

1131
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,790
so we need...

1132
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,030
You want to adjust

1133
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,030
my advance directive.

1134
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,670
Just the DNI.

1135
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,940
We need your consent

1136
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,940
to intubate you

1137
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,940
once you lose consciousness

1138
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,300
to protect the organs

1139
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,300
until you get into the OR.

1140
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,540
Do we have

1141
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,540
your permission?

1142
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,180
Yes. Mmm-hmm.

1143
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,480
Okay.

1144
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,260
Right there.

1145
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,410
You think

1146
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,410
I'm making a mistake.

1147
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,850
Earlier this year,

1148
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,850
I suffered a miscarriage.

1149
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,400
My child never got

1150
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,400
a chance at life.

1151
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,040
I would give anything,

1152
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,030
just for one moment.

1153
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:19,840
You may not have

1154
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:19,840
as much time as others,

1155
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:19,840
but you still have some.

1156
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,510
I'm sorry for your loss.

1157
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,110
But my time is over.

1158
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,990
The only positive is

1159
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,990
my death can help

1160
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,990
other people.

1161
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,160
I know.

1162
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,430
It looks like

1163
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,430
I'm giving up.

1164
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,830
But this is everything

1165
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,830
I've been living for.

1166
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,870
This is it.

1167
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,880
Yeah.

1168
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,150
Okay.

1169
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,160
I'm ready.

1170
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,760
Hanging meds

1171
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,760
is a nurse's responsibility.

1172
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,760
I will do it.

1173
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,290
Making a break

1174
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,290
for it, Keoni?

1175
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,290
Really?

1176
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,530
Seemed like

1177
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,530
a good idea

1178
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,530
at the time.

1179
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,900
Figured Maggie was

1180
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,900
sending over a shrink.

1181
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,630
Oh, no. You get me.

1182
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,330
I appreciate the red carpet,

1183
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,330
but there's nothing

1184
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,330
you can do.

1185
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,470
In the back of my mind,

1186
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,470
I knew it was diabetes.

1187
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,380
I should've never

1188
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,380
come to the hospital.

1189
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,940
Because what?

1190
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,940
Denial is a good solution?

1191
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,780
You don't understand, Sharon.

1192
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,780
My family, diabetes kills.

1193
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,290
Now, it's my turn.

1194
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,520
Your genetics

1195
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,520
don't doom you, Keoni.

1196
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,020
No? I eat healthy.

1197
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,720
I don't drink the coladas

1198
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,720
or the daiquiris

1199
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,720
that I make at the bar.

1200
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,750
I exercise. Yet, here I am.

1201
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,750
I did what I was

1202
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,750
supposed to do.

1203
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,200
Yeah, and unfortunately,

1204
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,100
people like you and I

1205
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,100
have to do that and more

1206
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,100
to break the cycle.

1207
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,500
Yes, I have diabetes, too.

1208
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,130
And I've lost family also.

1209
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,910
I didn't know.

1210
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,910
Many don't.

1211
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,810
And it's not

1212
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,810
because I'm hiding it,

1213
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,020
but because I've got it

1214
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,020
under control,

1215
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,550
and I have for

1216
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,550
the last 14 years.

1217
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,130
There are people

1218
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,130
in this hospital

1219
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,130
who have to surrender.

1220
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,790
You have an opportunity.

1221
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,160
You better take it.

1222
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,610
It's gonna be okay.

1223
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,410
Dr. Reese?

1224
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:50,220
If, um, you would like

1225
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:50,220
to continue your residency

1226
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,720
under a different attending,

1227
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,280
I would

1228
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,280
completely understand.

1229
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,870
Hey, Keoni.

1230
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,870
Wanted to say goodbye.

1231
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,870
You good?

1232
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,180
Work in progress,

1233
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,180
but I'll get there.

1234
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,740
Heard you're taking off

1235
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,740
for the sunshine.

1236
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,050
Oahu. You're

1237
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,050
my last patient.

1238
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,490
A native Hawaiian.

1239
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,490
Must be fate.

1240
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,490
You might be right.

1241
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,460
Uh, Ms. Goodwin wanted you

1242
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,460
to have your nail.

1243
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,070
You know what?

1244
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,070
I don't need it.

1245
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,430
He ho'omaka hou 'ana.

1246
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,400
"A new beginning."

1247
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,570
You and me both.

1248
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,310
Yeah, we'll just

1249
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,310
have to wait.

1250
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,060
Oh! This view.

1251
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,060
Oh, how I've missed

1252
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,060
this view.

1253
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,990
Or just a view.

1254
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,440
So, uh, dinner.

1255
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,500
The pantry is

1256
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,500
not really stocked.

1257
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,510
We could go out.

1258
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,610
Or order in.

1259
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,780
It's probably for the best.

1260
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,780
Just for tonight.

1261
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,080
Look, I know you went

1262
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,080
out on a limb.

1263
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,360
So, thank you.

1264
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,790
I'm just so happy

1265
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,790
to be out of there.

1266
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,640
Come here.

1267
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,140
Doctor? Doctor?

1268
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,610
What is it?

1269
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,610
She's awake.

1270
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,140
She's awake.

1271
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,680
Breathing trial looks good.

1272
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,590
I'm gonna take this

1273
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,590
tube out, okay, Allison?

1274
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,590
All right.

1275
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,720
Ready?

1276
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,420
It's okay.

1277
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,890
Breathe, and there

1278
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,890
you go. Okay.

1279
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,200
Where am I?

1280
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,230
You got sick, honey.

1281
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,230
We had to take you

1282
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,230
to the hospital.

1283
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,040
How long am I gonna be here?

1284
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,040
I don't want to miss

1285
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,040
the school dance.

1286
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,110
Aw, sweetie.

1287
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,420
Hi, baby.

1288
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,690
The orthodontist?

1289
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,390
I was in the waiting room

1290
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,390
the whole time,

1291
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,390
just checking my emails.

1292
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,890
When she came out,

1293
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,890
she smiled,

1294
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,890
showed me her braces,

1295
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,020
didn't seem any different.

1296
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,730
The police suspect

1297
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,730
instead of nitrous,

1298
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,730
he used triazolam.

1299
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,300
It knocked her out,

1300
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,300
ensured she had no memory

1301
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,300
of the assault.

1302
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,970
Sick bastard.

1303
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,940
I know this is a lot

1304
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,940
to process, but once

1305
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,940
Allison is stronger,

1306
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,380
the detective would like

1307
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,380
to come in and ask her

1308
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,380
a few questions.

1309
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,380
Look, Ali just had

1310
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,380
a brush with death,

1311
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,550
and all she cares about

1312
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,550
is if she can still go

1313
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,550
to the Junior High Dance.

1314
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,140
She's so innocent.

1315
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,490
I don't want

1316
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,490
to take that from her.

1317
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,590
One day,

1318
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,590
we'll have to,

1319
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,590
but not today.

1320
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,830
We understand.

1321
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,160
We'll be back

1322
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,160
in the morning

1323
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,160
to check on her.

1324
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,230
Good night.

1325
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,650
Jeff's locker's

1326
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,650
cleared out,

1327
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,650
and he left.

1328
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,190
Yeah, about an hour ago.

1329
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,230
Did you know?

1330
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,230
That he wanted

1331
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,230
to move on from Med?

1332
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,430
Yes. But I didn't know

1333
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,430
that you didn't.

1334
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,800
He left without

1335
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,800
even saying goodbye?

1336
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,800
That's not cool.

1337
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,440
No. It was

1338
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,440
the right play.

1339
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,210
The conversation about

1340
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,210
why wouldn't have done

1341
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,210
either of us any good.

1342
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,710
Slips out in the night,

1343
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,710
and still somehow

1344
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,710
he makes it chivalrous.

1345
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,750
I'm happy for Jeff.

1346
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,750
Fresh start.

1347
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,580
Yeah.

1348
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,050
Dr. Halstead.

1349
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,050
Night, Maggie.

1350
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,430
Nina and I

1351
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,430
are gonna meet Jay

1352
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,430
at Molly's.

1353
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,760
You want to join?

1354
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,760
Put this day behind us?

1355
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,760
Uh...

1356
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,630
Yeah. That sounds great.

1357
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,600
Uh, I just... I have to

1358
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,600
do something first,

1359
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,140
so I'll meet

1360
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,140
you guys there.

1361
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,300
Okay.

1362
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,700
Gary's organ recovery

1363
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,700
went well.

1364
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,070
A lot of lives

1365
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,070
are being saved tonight.

1366
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,040
Just wish it felt

1367
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,040
more like a win.

1368
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,140
So much

1369
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,140
for white butterflies.

1370
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,550
I think we make

1371
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,550
our own luck, anyway.

1372
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,000
I should get back

1373
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,000
to the ED.

1374
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,130
Yeah. Yeah.

1375
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,880
I'll see you tomorrow.

1376
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,460
So, then the guy says,

1377
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,400
"If we would've

1378
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,400
done it my way,

1379
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,990
"we could've

1380
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,990
walked out of here."

1381
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,940
Oh...

1382
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,800
That's really

1383
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,800
horrible, Jay.

1384
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,810
Who told you that one?

1385
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,280
Dad.

1386
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,280
I should've known.

1387
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,470
Come on.

1388
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,470
Of course.

1389
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,140
He's disgusting.

1390
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,810
Whoa.

1391
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,440
Hey.

1392
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,150
Wow.

1393
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,480
Big change.

1394
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,550
Yeah. I, um, felt like

1395
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,550
I needed something new.

1396
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,330
Looks really nice.

1397
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,330
Thank you.

1398
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,800
Yeah, it looks great.

1399
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,800
I like it.

1400
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,800
Thanks. I'm glad.

1401
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,860
Well, we all like it.

1402
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,860
What are you

1403
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,860
having to drink?

1404
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,440
Oh, I will, um...

1405
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,440
I'll take a beer.

1406
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,570
Four shots of tequila.

1407
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,570
Got it.

1408
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,570
Yes, please.

1409
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,750
Babe?

1410
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,920
Robin?

1411
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,200
No!

1412
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:28,250
Robin, look at me. Robin.

1413
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,840
Ah! God!

1414
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,150
Robin! Robin!

1415
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,150
No, no, no, no, no!

1416
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,980
No, no, no. Please.

1417
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,980
Robin, open the door.

1418
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,890
Open the door.

1419
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,890
Please open the door.

1420
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,560
Please open the...

1421
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,890
Open the door!

1422
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,160
Robin, please.

1423
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,160
Please open the door.

1424
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,160
Get away from me!

1425
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,870
Please! Robin!

1426
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,870
No, no, no, no, no!

1427
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,270
Robin, please.

1428
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,270
No!

1429
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,180
Come on!
