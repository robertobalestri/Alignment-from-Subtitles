1
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,240
That's my Uncle

2
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,240
Miles on the grill.

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,240
Uncle Miles?

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,940
Is that ginger head

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,940
with you?

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,840
Is that my

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,840
baby girl Becca?

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,280
Can you believe

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,280
how big she's gotten?

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,920
Hey, Grandma.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,920
Hey, sweetie.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,390
This is Will.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,390
Hi, Will.

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,120
Hi. Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,590
Why don't you go

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,590
see your Uncle Will?

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,960
Okay.

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,370
Stay with Will.

19
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,370
Hi.

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,430
Okay.

21
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,490
Denise?

22
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,740
Hey, Mags.

23
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,740
I didn't think you

24
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,740
were gonna come.

25
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,340
Oh!

26
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,140
Just decided

27
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,140
to fly in at the last minute.

28
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm glad you did.

29
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,250
Will Halstead, come over here

30
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,250
and meet my sister, Denise.

31
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,250
Okay, let me hand her over.

32
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,250
I'll take her.

33
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,520
Yeah, nice to meet you.

34
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,520
Come on, sweetie.

35
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,350
All right.

36
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,760
Hi, Denise.

37
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,090
So are you to blame

38
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,090
for the big mouth

39
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,090
on this one?

40
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,830
Please, Maggie's been sassy

41
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,830
ever since she could talk.

42
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,730
It's not my fault.

43
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,730
I was born that way.

44
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,070
So, what should we do?

45
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,660
I'm off on Monday

46
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,660
and the weather's

47
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,660
supposed to be great.

48
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,770
I'm actually flying back

49
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,770
to Dallas in a few hours.

50
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,740
I got to be back

51
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,740
at the makeup

52
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,740
counter tomorrow.

53
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,880
Let's make

54
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,880
the most of it then.

55
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,940
Okay.

56
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,780
Come on. Let's go say

57
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,780
hi to everybody.

58
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,910
Hey.

59
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,310
Morning, Ms. Goodwin.

60
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,550
Good morning.

61
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,960
What brings you

62
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,960
in on a Saturday?

63
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,820
I could ask you

64
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,820
the same thing.

65
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,690
I'm filling in as

66
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,690
trauma attending.

67
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,090
We haven't had

68
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,090
an elective heart surgery

69
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,090
in a week.

70
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,860
Yes, I know we've

71
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,860
had some cancellations

72
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,860
since Dr. Downey died,

73
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,460
but we can't expect

74
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,460
to rebuild a destination

75
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,460
program overnight.

76
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,000
We've got a great team.

77
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,000
Word will spread.

78
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,570
Connor! Incoming.

79
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,570
With you.

80
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,850
Patient name, Glenn Simon,

81
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,850
57-year-old male.

82
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,820
GCS 15, vitals stable.

83
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,380
Got knocked off his horse

84
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,380
at the polo ground.

85
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,790
Gross deformity

86
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,790
to the right femur.

87
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,910
All right,

88
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,910
let's go to T Three.

89
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,690
Mr. Simon, can you

90
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,690
tell us what happened?

91
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,120
My buddy Harvey is a cheater.

92
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,120
That's what happened.

93
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,220
Tried to pull

94
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,220
a 90-degree ride-off.

95
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,220
Knocked me clear off my pony.

96
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,490
All right, let's get

97
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,490
X-ray and call Ortho.

98
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,560
Got it.

99
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,460
All right, let's move him

100
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,460
on my count.

101
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,530
Ready? One, two, three.

102
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,570
Mr. Simon, any pain?

103
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,570
Not there.

104
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,640
Okay.

105
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,880
Looks like

106
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,880
you found it.

107
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,880
Yep.

108
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,110
Let's get him off the board.

109
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,240
All right,

110
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,240
on my count.

111
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,240
One, two, three.

112
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,790
Gently. There we go.

113
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,390
Get an IV started.

114
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,390
Hang a bolus of saline.

115
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,120
And 5 milligrams of

116
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,120
morphine for the pain.

117
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,690
We're gonna get you

118
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,690
fixed up, Mr. Simon.

119
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,490
I never like to admit

120
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,490
that my wife was right,

121
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,330
but I'd be in a lot less pain

122
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,330
if I stuck to golf...

123
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,460
Like she asked me to...

124
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,630
Mr. Simon?

125
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,630
Mr. Simon,

126
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,630
can you hear me?

127
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,160
He's stroking.

128
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,580
All right,

129
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,580
give 20 milligrams

130
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,580
of labetalol.

131
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,210
Let's get him

132
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,210
to CT and echo now.

133
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,810
Maybe I'll come

134
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,810
and visit in Dallas.

135
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,840
I can use some

136
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,840
primping.

137
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,780
You know, I actually

138
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,780
might be out of town

139
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,320
a bit over

140
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,320
the next two months.

141
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,920
But after that, yeah.

142
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,620
Bye.

143
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,130
So, uh, how long has she

144
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,130
been living in Dallas?

145
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,040
I don't know.

146
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,040
She moved maybe nine,

147
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,040
ten years ago.

148
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,470
Let me guess.

149
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,470
Because of a guy?

150
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,070
Something like that.

151
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,470
Denise!

152
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,480
Is she all right?

153
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,570
Whoa, easy, Denise.

154
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,910
Denise?

155
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,910
It's okay.

156
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,110
I'm right here.

157
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,490
Are you okay?

158
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,490
I can't see.

159
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,320
Okay, okay,

160
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,320
okay, okay.

161
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,690
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

162
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,690
I can't see.

163
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,660
Breathe.

164
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,170
You should've seen it.

165
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,170
Yeah, pretty good.

166
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,070
What's gotten into you?

167
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,010
What? Nothing.

168
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,850
Okay,

169
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,850
something's different.

170
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
You look happy.

171
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,290
I'm just glad to

172
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,290
have a weekend shift.

173
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,310
Looking forward

174
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,310
to a quiet day.

175
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,520
Hey, Nat.

176
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,190
Will has the day off.

177
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,190
Thought Jeff could follow you.

178
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,420
Sure. Okay.

179
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,130
All attending to...

180
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
What do we got?

181
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
Mid-20s male.

182
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,630
Found him down by

183
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,630
the train station.

184
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,080
GCS 14. Fever's 103.

185
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,080
BP's 160 over 90.

186
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,080
Heart rate 110.

187
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,680
Sir, can you tell

188
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,680
us what happened?

189
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,010
I don't think

190
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,010
you'll get very far.

191
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,070
He doesn't speak

192
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,070
a word of English.

193
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,880
No ID.

194
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,880
This is everything

195
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,880
we found on him.

196
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,380
It's a foreign currency.

197
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,550
Let me see that.

198
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,610
Yeah, it's Thai.

199
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,720
If he just arrived

200
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,720
to the US,

201
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,260
he could have brought

202
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,260
whatever this is with him.

203
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,820
Let's track down

204
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,820
a translator online.

205
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,730
Right. Let's get him

206
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,730
to T Two.

207
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,730
Okay.

208
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
Mr. Simon, we're taking you

209
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
up to the surgical ICU.

210
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,260
You understand?

211
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,270
Glenn, honey. I'm here.

212
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,510
Glenn? Glenn.

213
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,040
Mrs. Simon?

214
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,010
Why isn't my husband

215
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,010
saying anything?

216
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,050
Mrs. Simon, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

217
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,050
I'm taking care

218
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,050
of your husband.

219
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,840
Why don't we find

220
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,840
somewhere where

221
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,840
we can talk?

222
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,460
So your husband has what is

223
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,460
called a bifurcated vena cava.

224
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,120
It allowed the emboli

225
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,120
from his leg fracture

226
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,100
to bypass his lungs

227
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,100
and go straight

228
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,100
into his brain.

229
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,500
With your consent,

230
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,500
I would like to operate.

231
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,670
I'd like to get

232
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,670
a second opinion.

233
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,940
Glenn has a partner

234
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,940
who's on the board

235
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,940
at the Mayo Clinic,

236
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,210
and I'm sure he could refer us

237
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,210
to a cardiologist there.

238
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,210
I understand. As long

239
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,210
as he has the fracture,

240
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,980
he's at risk of

241
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,980
having another stroke.

242
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,840
And we can't fix his

243
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,840
leg until I fix his heart.

244
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,320
Waiting could put him

245
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,320
in even greater danger.

246
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,420
Fool still thinks

247
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,420
he's 25 years old.

248
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,060
I came here to give him

249
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,060
a piece of my mind,

250
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,060
and now this.

251
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,690
Mrs. Simon,

252
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,470
we have a great

253
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,470
team here at Gaffney.

254
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,510
I believe when your husband

255
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,510
comes out of surgery,

256
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,540
he's gonna be good

257
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,540
and ready to receive

258
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,540
a piece of your mind.

259
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,970
Okay.

260
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,480
Will... Uh, Dr. Halstead

261
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,090
gave her a dose

262
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,090
of IV steroids.

263
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,760
Now her vision is

264
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,760
starting to return.

265
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,090
Any idea what may

266
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,090
have caused this?

267
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,090
Not yet.

268
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,700
Can we get

269
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,700
you anything?

270
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,460
No, you both got

271
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,460
enough on your plate.

272
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,660
And I'm fine. Really.

273
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,400
Denise, I would really

274
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,400
encourage you to stay.

275
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,610
I really... I'm okay.

276
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,970
Where are you going?

277
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,640
If I leave now,

278
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,640
I can still catch my flight.

279
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,910
But a second ago,

280
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,910
you couldn't see your hand

281
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,910
in front of your face.

282
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,720
Yeah, and now I can.

283
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,380
Thanks for the great care.

284
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,620
Don't be stubborn, Denise.

285
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,950
You know I've

286
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,950
always had migraines.

287
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,320
This is just

288
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,320
another passing episode.

289
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,320
A transient blindness

290
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,860
can actually be caused

291
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,860
by a number of things.

292
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,090
We should run some more tests.

293
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,220
Exactly.

294
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,070
What happens

295
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,070
the next time that you have

296
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,070
one of your passing episodes

297
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,530
and you're driving

298
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,530
on the expressway?

299
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,830
Fine. Fine.

300
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,830
Can we make this quick?

301
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,370
This is what I get

302
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,370
for trying to take on

303
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,370
a 12-pound pot roast.

304
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,640
Good news is it's just

305
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,640
a second-degree burn.

306
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,280
Might blister and swell a bit,

307
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,280
but you'll live to

308
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,280
cook another day.

309
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,280
BP's 160 over 90.

310
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,760
Let's page OB,

311
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,760
have them take a look.

312
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,520
You're, uh,

313
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,520
seven months along?

314
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,620
Yeah. Why?

315
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,760
Honey, are you okay?

316
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,760
Oh, everything's okay.

317
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,700
Your wife's blood pressure

318
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,700
is slightly elevated.

319
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,170
I'd like to get some labs

320
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,170
and an ultrasound

321
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,170
just as a precaution.

322
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,970
Is that necessary?

323
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,870
I've been seeing

324
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,870
my doula regularly,

325
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,170
and she says

326
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,170
everything's good.

327
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,540
I'm right on track

328
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,540
for a home birth.

329
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,800
I know

330
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,710
you must think we're some

331
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,710
granola-fed hipsters,

332
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,710
but that's not it.

333
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,850
My sister miscarried

334
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,850
after an amnio,

335
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,920
and I promised myself

336
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,920
I would do everything

337
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,920
as natural as possible.

338
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,950
And that includes

339
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,950
protecting my baby

340
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,950
from the harmful sound waves.

341
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
I understand

342
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
completely.

343
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,620
But in some cases,

344
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,620
high blood pressure

345
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,620
can affect fetal growth.

346
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,150
I just want to rule out

347
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,150
any possible complications.

348
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,090
Well, I guess it's good

349
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,090
to be on the safe side.

350
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,090
Right, honey?

351
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,920
The patient's

352
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,920
not speaking Thai.

353
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,740
If I had to guess

354
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,740
based on his inflection,

355
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,740
it's an Indonesian dialect.

356
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,750
If you want, I'll contact

357
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,750
the network administrator,

358
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,220
see who they have in Jakarta.

359
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,780
Please. Thank you.

360
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,780
Thank you.

361
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,420
Okay.

362
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,420
So, Mr. Clarke. Fever,

363
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,420
chills, vomit, diarrhea.

364
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,800
Chikungunya,

365
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,800
Dengue, Yellow fever?

366
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,240
Maybe, that or one

367
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,240
of 100 other diseases.

368
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,900
Welcome to the future.

369
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,370
Migration, climate change,

370
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,370
the whole world

371
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,370
is on our doorstep.

372
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,040
So what do you

373
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,040
do when you have

374
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,050
an infectious disease

375
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,050
of an unknown origin?

376
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,790
I'd start with CBC,

377
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,790
CMP, blood, sputum,

378
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,790
urine cultures...

379
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,120
Uh, rapid mono and strep.

380
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,120
Good.

381
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,380
You start the H&P,

382
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,620
and I'll put in the order

383
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,620
and hang some

384
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,620
IV Metronidazole.

385
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,620
Will do.

386
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,390
Actually, totally my fault.

387
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,390
Overdid it on the PT.

388
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,960
Had to do that last leg lift,

389
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,960
and this is my reward.

390
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,200
Am I boring you, Doctor?

391
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,270
Oh, no, sorry.

392
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,970
I stayed up all night

393
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,970
attacking the library,

394
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,970
got all the way to Bowlby.

395
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,510
Mmm-hmm.

396
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,510
Bowlby? Great stuff.

397
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,670
Made Charles Darwin

398
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,450
the fascination

399
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,450
of an entire

400
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,450
generation of shrinks.

401
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,710
Bowlby said that Darwin

402
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,710
had a panic disorder.

403
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,520
Oh, yes, ma'am.

404
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,520
Charlie had a dark side.

405
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,450
Wait till you get

406
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,450
to Barloon and Noyes.

407
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,050
Dr. Charles, Dr. Reese,

408
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,050
thanks for coming down.

409
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,520
What's up, Ethan?

410
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,520
What do you got?

411
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,160
Amanda Kendrick-Dobbs.

412
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,160
Seven months pregnant,

413
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,160
gravid belly,

414
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,790
history of fetal movement

415
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,790
and Braxton Hicks

416
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,790
contractions,

417
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,460
all signs of

418
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,460
a normal pregnancy.

419
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,300
So what's the issue?

420
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,900
There's no baby.

421
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,160
Dr. Rhodes?

422
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,160
I'm Leah Bardovi.

423
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,120
I'm starting my surgical

424
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,120
residency here.

425
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,630
Welcome to Chicago Med.

426
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,590
So, clinically speaking,

427
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,590
the patient will be dead?

428
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,430
Just long enough for me to do

429
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,430
the repair on his aorta.

430
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,910
And then we will warm him up

431
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,910
and restart the heart.

432
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,430
Hmm.

433
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,710
Did a lot of these

434
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,710
under Dr. Downey?

435
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,810
A few.

436
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
You know, he's the

437
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
reason I applied here.

438
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,220
When I got my match,

439
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,220
I told my dad

440
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,380
that I'm going to be training

441
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,380
under the greatest surgeon

442
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,380
in the world.

443
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,860
And now,

444
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm just honored

445
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
to be learning

446
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
from his protégé.

447
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,120
Cooling jackets prepped?

448
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,590
Standing by.

449
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,250
Then let's

450
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,250
do this. Scalpel.

451
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,330
Appreciate the visit,

452
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,230
but we just want to make sure

453
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,230
the baby's okay.

454
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,860
Why are you here again?

455
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,370
Oh, we try and look in

456
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,370
on all our expectant mothers

457
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,170
as part of a routine

458
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,170
wellness assessment.

459
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,470
It was actually Dr. Reese

460
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,470
who flagged your

461
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,470
high blood pressure.

462
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,180
Yeah, have you been

463
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,180
under any stress lately?

464
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,970
Maybe something at work?

465
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,110
Oh, I'm not working.

466
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,080
I haven't been since

467
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,080
we moved here last year.

468
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,950
Yeah, when my firm

469
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,950
transferred me from Denver,

470
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,990
we thought it'd be a good time

471
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,990
for Amanda to stay at home,

472
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,750
focus on the baby.

473
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,960
Where did you say

474
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,960
Dr. Choi was, again?

475
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,290
We're pretty sure

476
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,290
he's just waiting

477
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,390
for the rest of

478
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,390
your blood work.

479
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,870
We will go check in

480
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,870
with him right now.

481
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,100
Thanks both for your time.

482
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,100
Okay. Great.

483
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,600
Good luck to you.

484
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,600
Thank you.

485
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,700
Notice how she didn't ask

486
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,700
about any test results

487
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,700
or anything?

488
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,600
Oh.

489
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,980
Yeah.

490
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,750
That's 'cause on some level,

491
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,750
she knows the truth.

492
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,980
So what are we looking at?

493
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,850
I don't know, Reese.

494
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,850
What are we looking at?

495
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,490
Uh, well,

496
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,490
no grandiose delusions

497
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,790
or other signs of underlying

498
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,790
psychiatric illness,

499
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,950
so I think we can

500
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,950
rule out psychosis.

501
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,950
Mmm-hmm.

502
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,860
Then how is this

503
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,860
even possible?

504
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,500
Well, in a lot of cases,

505
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,500
the anxiety produces

506
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,500
a hormonal reaction.

507
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,770
Causes all of the physical

508
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,770
signs of pregnancy

509
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,770
without a growing fetus.

510
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,610
We need to figure out

511
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,610
why having a baby's

512
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,610
so important to her.

513
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,110
Or more specifically,

514
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,110
why being pregnant

515
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,110
is so important to her.

516
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,610
Right.

517
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,840
So, what do we do now?

518
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,710
I see no value

519
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,710
in withholding this

520
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,710
from them any longer.

521
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,220
So, what do you say, Doctor?

522
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,990
Do you want me

523
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,990
to break the news?

524
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,930
No,

525
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,930
don't worry, Grandma.

526
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,930
No, I'll let you know

527
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,930
as soon as

528
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,930
the tests come back.

529
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,910
Me, too. Bye.

530
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,140
Hey.

531
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,140
Hi.

532
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,300
How's your sister?

533
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,300
Stubborn as ever.

534
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,880
I am here for you

535
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,880
if you need anything. Okay?

536
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,880
Thank you.

537
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,880
Yeah.

538
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,750
Dr. Manning.

539
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,680
Hey, Mags.

540
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,890
Uh, the translator

541
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,890
in Jakarta struck out.

542
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,690
Apparently,

543
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,690
there are over 700

544
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,690
languages in Indonesia.

545
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,130
What about his fever?

546
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,130
He's up to 104.

547
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,300
Let's get him into

548
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,300
a negative pressure room.

549
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,890
Hang some IV Tylenol,

550
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,090
and let's see if

551
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,090
there's any way

552
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,260
we could put

553
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,260
a rush on those labs.

554
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,500
Okay.

555
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,370
What was that?

556
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,700
What was what?

557
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,370
You, Jeff, the body language,

558
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,370
the touching on the shoulder.

559
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,280
Something is definitely up.

560
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,850
Hmm...

561
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,150
You mean I'm right?

562
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,250
Do you think it's weird?

563
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,520
What, you hooking up

564
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,520
with your late husband's

565
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,520
best friend?

566
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,460
Not hooking up.

567
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,460
Whatever you

568
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,460
want to call it.

569
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,090
You're asking me

570
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,090
if it's weird.

571
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,090
Yeah.

572
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,690
A little.

573
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,160
Don't stress out about it.

574
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,000
I learned a long time ago

575
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,000
that you have to do

576
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,000
what makes you happy,

577
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,610
even if some people

578
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,610
think it's strange.

579
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,470
Dr. Manning.

580
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,600
Okay.

581
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,450
What's happening?

582
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,450
He's in bronchospasm.

583
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
Let's bag him and

584
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
get some racemic epi

585
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,320
and 125 milligrams

586
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,320
of Solu-Medrol IV.

587
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,450
Sats are still dropping.

588
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,820
I need a better airway.

589
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,230
Let's tube him.

590
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,230
Twenty of Etomidate,

591
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,230
100 of Sux.

592
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,560
You're gonna intubate?

593
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,560
Mmm-hmm.

594
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,230
Here you go.

595
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,230
He won't be able to speak

596
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,230
to a translator if we do that.

597
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,240
We don't have to

598
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,240
worry about a translator

599
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,240
if he stops breathing.

600
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,840
Dr. Manning.

601
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,640
I'm in.

602
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,280
Start a neb treatment.

603
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,280
I got it.

604
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,380
Sats are coming up.

605
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,280
There's got to be someone

606
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,280
somewhere in this city

607
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,050
who can communicate

608
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,050
with this guy.

609
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,050
All right, I'm on it.

610
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,790
Placement's good.

611
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,190
Sorry, if it felt like

612
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,190
I second-guessed you there.

613
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Let's get him moved, okay?

614
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Yes, Doctor.

615
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,790
Call upstairs.

616
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,990
All right,

617
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,990
go on bypass.

618
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,650
Cool to 20,

619
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,650
but do not crash cool.

620
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,440
Find me when he gets

621
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,440
to 32 degrees,

622
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,440
and we'll arrest the heart.

623
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,040
Yes, Dr. Rhodes.

624
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,710
So far, so good.

625
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,660
He's taken well

626
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,660
to the anesthetic.

627
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,090
We should be able to start

628
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,090
the repair in an hour or so.

629
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,760
Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

630
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,420
Mrs. Simon

631
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,420
was just telling me

632
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,830
how impressed she was

633
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,830
with your confidence.

634
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,770
Could you excuse us, please?

635
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,770
I need a quick word

636
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,770
with Dr. Rhodes here.

637
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,900
Where's Dr. Latham?

638
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,210
I was just about to page him.

639
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,720
You signed up for

640
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,720
a high-risk surgery

641
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,550
without consulting

642
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,550
an attending?

643
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,220
All I did was open

644
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,220
him up and cannulate.

645
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,590
It is the Sabbath.

646
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,860
I didn't want to bother

647
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,860
Dr. Latham until I had to.

648
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,460
Glenn Simon is a man

649
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,460
with lots of connections.

650
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,070
You were worried before

651
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,070
about the state

652
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,070
of the department.

653
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,540
You'll have even

654
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,540
more to worry about

655
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,540
if you don't pull this off.

656
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,040
Page Dr. Latham now.

657
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,510
These machines

658
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,510
are the worst.

659
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,660
You obviously

660
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,660
haven't seen the ones

661
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,660
down in pathology.

662
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,650
Just, I'd kill for

663
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,650
a bag of Vitner's.

664
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,360
Mmm, don't overthink it.

665
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,690
Go for the next best thing.

666
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,160
Hey, Will, you got

667
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,160
a second for a curbside?

668
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,190
Yeah.

669
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,190
Thanks.

670
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,000
Rapid strep

671
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,000
and mono were negative,

672
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,000
LP normal.

673
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,140
I'm afraid it's

674
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,140
something exotic,

675
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,270
but we won't have

676
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,270
the cultures back

677
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,270
for another couple of days.

678
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,870
And now with

679
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,870
the bronchospasm...

680
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,440
Yeah, it could be

681
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,440
almost anything.

682
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,580
Exactly.

683
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,990
And I gotta confess,

684
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,990
I am at a complete loss.

685
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,180
Well, whenever I find

686
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,180
myself in the weeds,

687
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,690
I go back to something

688
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,690
one of my clinical

689
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,690
attendings used to say.

690
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,760
"The answer is

691
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,760
always in the history."

692
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,070
That's your pearl of wisdom?

693
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,010
We can't get a history.

694
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,010
We're lost in a maze.

695
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,410
Then retrace

696
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,410
your steps.

697
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,170
Every decision you made,

698
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,170
each path you took

699
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,170
or didn't take.

700
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,740
Examine it all.

701
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,310
Sorry, Nat.

702
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,310
Will, what do the presence

703
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,080
of retinal

704
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,080
autoantibodies indicate?

705
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,040
What?

706
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,760
This mean what

707
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,760
I think it means?

708
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,760
Right?

709
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,000
I have cancer?

710
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,000
Possibly.

711
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,000
"Possibly"?

712
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,370
We don't know for sure.

713
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,380
There's a chance

714
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,380
that your loss of vision

715
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,680
was caused by your body

716
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,680
fighting some kind of tumor.

717
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,080
Is there any history of

718
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,080
cancer in your family?

719
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,450
I don't know.

720
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,450
Uncle Paul.

721
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,580
He's fighting

722
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,580
bladder cancer right now.

723
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,180
Really?

724
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,380
Any other medical history

725
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,380
I should know?

726
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,690
Any injuries

727
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,690
or any illnesses

728
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,690
or surgeries?

729
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,520
No.

730
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,520
Denise?

731
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,990
No.

732
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,670
I'm gonna send you

733
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,670
over for a CT scan.

734
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,270
In the meantime,

735
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,710
let's take a quick look.

736
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,740
Enter.

737
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,850
If you require lights,

738
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,850
you'll have to

739
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,850
turn them on yourself.

740
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,080
Sabbath rules.

741
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,060
Dr. Latham, I understand

742
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,060
I should have consulted you

743
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,030
before recommending surgery,

744
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,960
but I'd developed

745
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,960
a rapport with Mrs. Simon,

746
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
and I thought since

747
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
you observe the Sabbath...

748
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,030
A man's life

749
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,030
always takes precedence.

750
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,360
So, you plan on

751
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,360
opening up the heart,

752
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,280
tying off

753
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,280
the bifurcated branch,

754
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,070
and closing everything

755
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,070
back up in 30 minutes?

756
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,070
Mmm-hmm.

757
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,010
Any longer and there

758
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,010
could be significant

759
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,010
cognitive deficits.

760
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,310
I understand.

761
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,150
If you don't

762
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,150
over-sew the connection,

763
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,050
he could develop

764
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,050
a deadly pseudoaneurysm.

765
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,690
That might take

766
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,690
an even experienced

767
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,690
surgeon an hour.

768
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,430
Pardon me, Dr. Rhodes.

769
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,300
The patient's temp

770
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,300
is down to 32 degrees.

771
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,800
Thank you, Leah.

772
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,610
You realize that by waiting

773
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,610
as long as you did to call me,

774
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,740
you've given us

775
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,740
no other surgical option.

776
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,640
I thought this

777
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,640
was our best course.

778
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Thirty minutes.

779
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,440
I can make it in time.

780
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,490
I've done surgeries equally

781
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,490
as challenging before.

782
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,390
While assisting

783
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,390
Dr. Downey.

784
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,450
Yes.

785
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,490
In the cockpit,

786
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,950
a co-pilot's seat

787
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,950
is right next

788
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,950
to the captain's,

789
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,530
but the view out of the window

790
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,530
is surprisingly different.

791
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,900
Our bodies

792
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,900
are complicated.

793
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,770
Sometimes, um,

794
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,770
signals get crossed,

795
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,650
and our brains say one thing

796
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,650
and our bodies

797
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,650
hear something else.

798
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,380
I don't understand.

799
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,380
Is there something

800
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,380
wrong with the baby?

801
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,920
Yes. Well...

802
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,920
Not exactly. Um...

803
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,220
It's complicated.

804
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,030
What exactly are you saying?

805
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,290
Um...

806
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,830
Is there someone here

807
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,390
who can actually explain to us

808
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,390
what's going on, please?

809
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,530
If you give

810
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,530
Dr. Reese a minute,

811
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,770
I think you'll find

812
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,770
that she has

813
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,770
an excellent grasp of...

814
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,110
So, go ahead.

815
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,110
Explain, Dr. Reese.

816
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,510
I am sorry,

817
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,510
but there is no baby.

818
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,880
We lost the baby?

819
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,250
No. You never had one.

820
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,720
You don't know what

821
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,720
you're talking about.

822
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,090
No, see, the evidence

823
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,090
is actually right here. Um...

824
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,530
You have a condition

825
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,530
called pseudocyesis.

826
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,570
Uh, you may have

827
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,570
heard it referred to as

828
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,570
a hysterical pregnancy.

829
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,260
Are you saying

830
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,260
my wife is crazy?

831
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,960
No, she's not.

832
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,960
She's not saying that at all.

833
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,970
She's saying that sometimes

834
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,970
the mind has the ability

835
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,300
to play tricks on the body.

836
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,640
I... I can feel my baby.

837
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,640
I don't care what

838
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,640
this ultrasound shows. It...

839
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,410
Your machine must be broken.

840
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,780
I can assure you it's not.

841
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,780
Your blood test confirms it.

842
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,010
Well,

843
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,010
then your lab's broken, too,

844
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,010
'cause I'm pregnant. I am!

845
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,070
Honey.

846
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,070
Okay, okay.

847
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,140
No! No.

848
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,140
Hey, back off.

849
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,740
No! No!

850
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,740
Honey, honey.

851
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,850
Honey...

852
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,850
Get away from her!

853
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,850
Get me out of here!

854
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,950
We need

855
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,950
some help in here!

856
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,950
Let me go!

857
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,960
No!

858
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,960
It's okay.

859
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,660
Dr. Charles, I'm sorry.

860
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,660
Hey, hey, hey!

861
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,040
Where are we?

862
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,940
Body temperature's

863
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,940
at 20 degrees Celsius.

864
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,040
Flow down.

865
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,250
Clamp.

866
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,450
Clamp is on.

867
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,450
Give cardioplegia.

868
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,320
Plegia's on.

869
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,260
Heart's arrested.

870
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,260
Start the clock.

871
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,600
Stage is yours,

872
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,600
Dr. Rhodes.

873
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,030
Metz and Debakey.

874
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,030
Here, Doctor.

875
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,240
Okay.

876
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,250
Upper abdomen looks clear.

877
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,990
Wait a minute.

878
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,990
What's this?

879
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,920
I think this thing

880
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,920
is acting up again.

881
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,730
Maggie, do me a favor

882
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,730
and reboot it.

883
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,670
I had it serviced last week.

884
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,670
It should be fine.

885
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,440
Yeah, but right here.

886
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,140
It's my prostate gland.

887
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,450
I'm a transgender woman.

888
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,840
My doctor recommended

889
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,840
not removing the prostate,

890
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,540
'cause the surgery

891
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,540
would be too complicated.

892
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,880
Well,

893
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,880
it's definitely enlarged.

894
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,710
Before I send you

895
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,710
over to the scan,

896
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,310
I'm gonna need to

897
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,310
order another panel.

898
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,520
Maggie, run down

899
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,520
to phlebotomy,

900
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,150
have them draw up a CMP

901
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,150
and check her PSA levels.

902
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,720
Tina can do that for you.

903
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,720
I'm a civilian today.

904
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,160
But you have much

905
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,160
more sway with the lab.

906
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,270
I'll be right back, okay?

907
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,170
If you want me out of

908
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,170
the room, just say so.

909
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,140
Well, excuse me.

910
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,140
Why didn't you tell me

911
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,140
your sister used to be a man?

912
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,550
It's not my place.

913
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,550
It's up to the patient.

914
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,170
Then you should've

915
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,170
gotten her to tell me.

916
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,340
This is crucial

917
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,340
medical history.

918
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,180
How long ago

919
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,180
did she transition?

920
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,120
About nine years ago.

921
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,760
Was it hard for you?

922
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,820
Harder for her.

923
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,440
If it were my family,

924
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,600
she would have been disowned.

925
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,140
Well, it's taken time.

926
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,310
We had a lot to learn.

927
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,050
Mr. Dobbs, please calm down.

928
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,050
We just want to help you.

929
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,460
You've done enough.

930
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,630
The second she wakes up,

931
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,630
we're out of here.

932
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,900
I think that'd be a mistake,

933
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,900
but I'm not gonna

934
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,900
stand in your way.

935
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,160
We're done.

936
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,100
So?

937
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,480
He's sending her home

938
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,480
as soon as

939
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,480
the sedative wears off.

940
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,710
We're gonna let them leave?

941
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,710
Yep.

942
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,110
We can't put her

943
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,110
on a psych hold?

944
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,880
Doesn't meet the criteria.

945
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,780
I mean, is she

946
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,780
a danger to herself

947
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,780
or others?

948
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,120
Is she unable

949
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,120
to take care of

950
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,120
her basic needs?

951
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,720
I've been

952
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,720
doing some reading.

953
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,990
There was this one case

954
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,990
where they put

955
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,990
a woman under anesthesia

956
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,420
and her belly deflated

957
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,420
and she thought

958
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,420
she had a miscarriage.

959
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

960
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,060
So...

961
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,900
Are... Are you actually

962
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,900
suggesting that we do that?

963
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,070
I'll go get her

964
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,070
discharge started.

965
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,570
So, we're giving up?

966
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,350
When's the last time

967
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,350
you had some sleep?

968
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,120
Are you sending me home?

969
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,120
No.

970
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,180
I just think it

971
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,180
might be a good idea

972
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,180
to get some rest.

973
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,220
You know?

974
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,220
You've been up all night.

975
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,560
Come back tomorrow,

976
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,560
start fresh.

977
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,730
Yeah, you're, uh...

978
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,700
You're right.

979
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,140
I, uh, should

980
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,140
get out of here.

981
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,880
Do you know how many cases

982
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,880
we're looking at yet?

983
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,580
Natalie.

984
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,580
One second.

985
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,410
Okay.

986
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,640
Yes, I will test him right now

987
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,550
and send over the results

988
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,550
as soon as we get them.

989
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,810
Thank you.

990
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,950
Who was that?

991
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,950
The health department.

992
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,090
Looks like our John Doe

993
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,090
might have the measles.

994
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,060
Measles? But he doesn't have

995
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,060
any Koplik spots.

996
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,530
Doesn't always

997
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,530
present that way.

998
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,930
Well, then how

999
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,930
did you figure...

1000
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,930
Ah!

1001
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,600
It's a belt buckle.

1002
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,600
Flip it over.

1003
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,510
"I Survived The Stampede"?

1004
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,700
It's a roller coaster.

1005
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,570
That amusement park

1006
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,570
down in Champaign,

1007
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,210
they just confirmed that

1008
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,210
they had an outbreak

1009
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,210
of the measles.

1010
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,080
Five cases, kids who

1011
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,080
were never vaccinated.

1012
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,840
This whole time

1013
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,840
we were assuming

1014
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,080
that he brought

1015
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,080
this exotic disease

1016
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,080
into the country with him.

1017
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,450
And now,

1018
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,450
it actually looks like

1019
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,450
he caught it here.

1020
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,320
The labs will confirm it.

1021
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,190
What?

1022
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,560
I've known you

1023
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,560
all these years,

1024
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,070
and I never realized

1025
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,070
how genius you are.

1026
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,430
I'm serious.

1027
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,440
How did you even think

1028
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,440
to look at the belt buckle?

1029
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,530
When you're in the weeds,

1030
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,530
always go back to the history.

1031
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,210
No, wait! Wait for me!

1032
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,580
Perfect.

1033
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,160
My husband just went

1034
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,160
to go get the car, so...

1035
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,160
I'm really sorry.

1036
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,720
I wish I had done

1037
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,720
a better job

1038
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,720
explaining things.

1039
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,360
Explain what?

1040
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,430
That I'm hysterical?

1041
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,430
That I'm not

1042
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,430
carrying a baby?

1043
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,040
I'm sure my boss

1044
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,040
is regretting ever

1045
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,040
offering me this position,

1046
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,630
and I really wanted to be

1047
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,630
good at it,

1048
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,150
and now, well, again, I'm...

1049
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,280
I'm really sorry.

1050
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,010
You're lucky.

1051
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,120
What? I'm lucky?

1052
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,530
You care about what you do.

1053
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,860
You know what I did

1054
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,860
before I moved here?

1055
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,470
I was a skier,

1056
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,470
an extreme skier.

1057
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,790
Wow.

1058
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,500
Sounds like quite

1059
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,500
an adrenaline rush.

1060
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,500
Yeah.

1061
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,170
But it was more than that.

1062
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,610
It wasn't just

1063
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,610
something that I did.

1064
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,270
But it was who you were.

1065
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,270
Yeah.

1066
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,050
What you said about my baby,

1067
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,380
is it true?

1068
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,580
Yeah.

1069
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,770
Maggie?

1070
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,770
What happened?

1071
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,640
Uh, she wouldn't let

1072
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,640
me examine her.

1073
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,640
She's leaving.

1074
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,070
What?

1075
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,910
Did you know it was offensive

1076
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,910
to use the word "transgender"

1077
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,910
as a noun?

1078
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,480
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1079
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,680
Okay.

1080
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,680
Yeah.

1081
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,550
What happened?

1082
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,890
Exactly what I

1083
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,890
should have expected

1084
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,890
from a dude from Canaryville.

1085
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,450
Oh, come on, Denise,

1086
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,450
he's a little awkward

1087
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,450
and all,

1088
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,120
but he's good people.

1089
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,460
And a great doctor.

1090
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,460
You know what?

1091
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,360
I'll have my prostate checked

1092
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,360
when I get back.

1093
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,000
No! You're not leaving.

1094
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,000
Not without

1095
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,000
a definitive diagnosis.

1096
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,100
You need to have all this

1097
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,100
checked out annually, Denise.

1098
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,340
You want to know why

1099
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,340
I don't come back that much?

1100
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,370
I don't always need everybody

1101
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,370
judging my choices, okay?

1102
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,840
Please, the family?

1103
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,840
They embrace you.

1104
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,580
I'm not talking

1105
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,580
about the family.

1106
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,710
I'm talking about you.

1107
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,290
The second I see you

1108
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,290
at the family reunion,

1109
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,290
you're...

1110
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,510
You're throwing shade about

1111
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,510
how you were born this way.

1112
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,850
I was mocking myself.

1113
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,120
Just admit it.

1114
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,890
You hate what

1115
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,890
I've done to myself.

1116
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,930
I miss my brother.

1117
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,430
Is that such a bad thing?

1118
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,430
Well, he's gone, damn it!

1119
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,760
Not to me!

1120
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,270
Not totally!

1121
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,790
Look,

1122
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,790
I'm sorry that I hurt you,

1123
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,790
but I'm not gonna lose you.

1124
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,640
So, if I have to

1125
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,640
drag you kicking

1126
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,020
and screaming

1127
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,020
into that CT scanner,

1128
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,220
that's what I'm gonna do.

1129
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,530
I'm scared.

1130
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,860
We'll get through this.

1131
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,240
Time?

1132
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,310
Six minutes.

1133
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,450
Precisely.

1134
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,150
Six minutes, 11 seconds.

1135
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,320
You still

1136
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,320
have another layer to go.

1137
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,550
Damn it.

1138
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,550
More suction.

1139
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,590
You have

1140
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,590
a clear line to the vessel.

1141
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,590
Suction is not your problem.

1142
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,890
You're not gonna make it.

1143
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,160
I have plenty of time.

1144
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,260
Not at

1145
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,260
the pace you're going.

1146
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,860
You've done 57% of the work

1147
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,860
in 81% of your allotted time.

1148
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,540
You are not

1149
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,540
gonna get there.

1150
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,770
Your nonstop

1151
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,770
number crunching

1152
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,770
isn't helping.

1153
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,300
Thirty minutes.

1154
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,300
That's what we agreed.

1155
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,300
That's what you promised.

1156
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,080
I'm taking over.

1157
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,080
Step aside, Dr. Rhodes.

1158
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,410
I can do this.

1159
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,410
Step aside!

1160
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
Dr. Downey may have been quick

1161
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
to put his faith in you,

1162
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
but my faith

1163
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
takes longer to earn.

1164
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,250
I've spent nearly

1165
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,250
my entire life feeling

1166
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,250
at war with my gender.

1167
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,080
It figures the one piece

1168
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,080
I didn't get rid of

1169
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,330
is what's gonna kill me.

1170
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,340
Biopsy came back.

1171
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,840
Pretty much

1172
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,840
what we suspected.

1173
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,370
You have prostate cancer.

1174
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,610
With treatment,

1175
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,610
I am hopeful

1176
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,610
it can be cured.

1177
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,450
But, uh, you'll need

1178
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,450
to see a urologist

1179
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,450
as soon as you get home.

1180
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,780
Thank you.

1181
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,950
You're welcome.

1182
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,020
There is a second option.

1183
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,090
You could stay in Chicago,

1184
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,090
and let us take care of you.

1185
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,700
I'd like that.

1186
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,270
Okay.

1187
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,800
Okay.

1188
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,570
Okay.

1189
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,880
Hey, you tracked

1190
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,880
down a translator?

1191
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,880
No.

1192
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,820
That's his cousin, Farah.

1193
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,820
Turns out his

1194
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,820
name is Pitopang.

1195
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,120
He speaks Mamuju.

1196
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,920
Came here

1197
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,920
from West Sulawesi

1198
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,920
a month ago

1199
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,360
to work in his

1200
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,360
uncle's restaurant.

1201
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,390
Always wanted to

1202
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,390
ride a roller coaster.

1203
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,090
Wow. Thanks, April.

1204
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,660
Okay.

1205
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,530
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

1206
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,140
Your cousin has the measles,

1207
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,140
but he should

1208
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,140
make a full recovery.

1209
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,090
My cousin said thank you,

1210
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,390
and he thinks you two

1211
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,390
make a great couple.

1212
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,090
Mmm.

1213
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,660
Mmm.

1214
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,730
And yes, ladies,

1215
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,730
he is fluent in Spanish.

1216
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,240
You think he

1217
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,240
hired a publicist?

1218
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,250
Doesn't need to.

1219
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,250
He's a Rhodes.

1220
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,440
Plus he looks like that.

1221
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,350
Hey. There's our rising star.

1222
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,940
Yes.

1223
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,290
What are you talking about?

1224
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,290
"40 Rising Stars Under 40."

1225
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,620
Yeah, you're number 11.

1226
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,300
Hey, don't feel bad.

1227
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,300
There's always next year.

1228
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,530
Or maybe the cover of People.

1229
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,770
I swear I knew

1230
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,770
nothing about this.

1231
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,300
If you say so.

1232
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,910
By the way,

1233
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,910
how'd the surgery go?

1234
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,480
Uh, yeah, it was good.

1235
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,260
Thought you were going home.

1236
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,480
Uh, I was just going

1237
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,480
back over Darwin.

1238
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,660
According to Hayman,

1239
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,590
Darwin's issues

1240
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,590
might have been

1241
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,590
entirely physiological.

1242
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,660
Perhaps some kind of

1243
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,660
mitochondrial disorder.

1244
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,530
Huh.

1245
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,530
Mmm-hmm.

1246
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,100
You don't say.

1247
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,030
Yeah, I... I ran into

1248
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,030
Amanda on my way out,

1249
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,840
and I found out

1250
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,840
that she used to be

1251
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,840
an extreme skier.

1252
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,670
Really?

1253
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,050
Uh, I don't know,

1254
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,050
maybe being pregnant

1255
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,180
was her way of replacing

1256
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,180
what she had left behind.

1257
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,690
Nature abhors a vacuum,

1258
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,690
I guess.

1259
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,520
Speaking of which, um...

1260
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,060
You mind?

1261
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,350
Ms. Goodwin?

1262
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,690
Dr. Rhodes.

1263
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,460
I don't know if

1264
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,460
you've seen this,

1265
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,460
but there's a new issue out.

1266
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,190
Yeah. Uh...

1267
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,830
I had no idea that

1268
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,830
I was gonna be

1269
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,830
a part of this article.

1270
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,570
No one called or contacted me,

1271
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,570
and if they had,

1272
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,640
I never would have...

1273
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,640
I approved it.

1274
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,100
You did?

1275
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,950
It's good publicity.

1276
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,010
Yes, but did you

1277
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,010
actually read this?

1278
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,010
I mean,

1279
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,650
"Dashing young surgeon

1280
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,320
"is poised to lead

1281
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,320
Chicago Med

1282
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,320
into the future."

1283
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,490
No, I have

1284
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,490
no problem with that.

1285
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,600
Ms. Goodwin,

1286
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,600
look, the surgery today,

1287
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,310
Dr. Latham was right.

1288
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,600
I wasn't gonna make it.

1289
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,770
I thought I was

1290
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,770
more ready than I am.

1291
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,650
So, if you're looking

1292
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,650
to promote the department,

1293
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,980
you should look to him.

1294
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,610
I mean,

1295
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,610
he is a great surgeon.

1296
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,520
Latham is a great surgeon,

1297
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,520
but they wanted

1298
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,520
someone under 40.

1299
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,730
Stay humble, Dr. Rhodes.

1300
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,730
Your time will come.

1301
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,730
Huh?

1302
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,100
What do you think?

1303
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,190
Too big?

1304
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,600
No, you'll grow into it.

1305
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,000
You are now an honorary member

1306
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,000
of the Lockwood tribe.

1307
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,740
Thank you.

1308
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,740
I will wear it with pride.

1309
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,380
Who are you looking at?

1310
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,570
No one.

1311
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,510
Ah!

1312
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,710
That cute pathologist,

1313
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,710
Dr. Shore.

1314
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,450
Nina.

1315
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,450
Nina?

1316
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,820
Mmm.

1317
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,820
Ah.

1318
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,560
Well, don't feel like

1319
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,560
you've to stay here

1320
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,560
and entertain me.

1321
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,360
I've seen enough

1322
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,360
of you for one day.

1323
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,820
Okay.

1324
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,090
How do I look?

1325
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,090
Mmm.

1326
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,710
You know,

1327
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,710
when I think about Malcolm,

1328
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,340
it's times like these

1329
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,340
that I miss the most.

1330
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,000
Malcolm?

1331
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,680
Mmm.

1332
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,550
Go on.

1333
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,960
Hey.

1334
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,970
You ever figure out

1335
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,970
what you wanted?

1336
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,100
Yeah. Yeah,

1337
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,100
I think I did.

1338
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,430
At Johns Hopkins,

1339
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,430
they have a Shabbat elevator.

1340
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,410
It stops on every floor.

1341
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,210
No need to press a button.

1342
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,850
What can you do?

1343
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,410
Down?

1344
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,930
Good Shabbos, Dr. Latham.

1345
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,340
Shabbat shalom,

1346
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,340
Dr. Rhodes.
