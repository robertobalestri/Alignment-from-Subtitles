1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,960
Dr. Latham.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,960
Dr. Rhodes.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,260
Light day today.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,500
That's good,

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,590
because we just

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,590
got a call

7
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,370
from Mercy Hospital

8
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,370
over in Rock Island.

9
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,380
They have a young woman

10
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,100
with a type A

11
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,100
aortic dissection

12
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,480
who needs a valve-sparing

13
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,480
root replacement.

14
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,210
Rare, difficult procedure.

15
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,870
Mmm-hmm. And none of

16
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,870
the surgeons there have

17
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,040
any experience with it.

18
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,380
Have the air ambulance

19
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,380
bring her in,

20
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,950
and I'll clear an OR.

21
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,050
I'm afraid we can't.

22
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,350
She's multi-trauma

23
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,350
from a car accident,

24
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,620
and she's too unstable

25
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,620
to travel.

26
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,960
Then they'll have to perform

27
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,960
the standard repair.

28
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,090
Dr. Latham, I...

29
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,360
I do not like to travel.

30
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,130
I can understand that,

31
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,130
given your situation...

32
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,830
You can say it.

33
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,830
My Asperger's.

34
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,570
Dr. Latham, these cases

35
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,570
are indeed rare.

36
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,270
And while I have

37
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,270
assisted you

38
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,270
on one before,

39
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,010
I would like to be able

40
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,010
to say that I have done

41
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,010
one running lead.

42
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,780
Now, it's only

43
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,780
a 20-minute chopper flight,

44
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,480
and we don't even

45
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,480
have to spend the night.

46
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,050
This is important to you.

47
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,310
It is.

48
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,390
Perhaps I shouldn't

49
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,390
be so rigid.

50
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,830
A broadening experience

51
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,830
might do me good.

52
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,900
All right, Dr. Rhodes.

53
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,900
You'll get your procedure.

54
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,940
We'll even

55
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,940
spend the night.

56
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,630
A hotel.

57
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,230
It'll be interesting.

58
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,780
I'll let them know.

59
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,880
More like five under.

60
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,880
It was 10 under.

61
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,050
I just like

62
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,050
to be careful, okay?

63
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,650
I have a history.

64
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,750
Hey, guys.

65
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,020
Morning.

66
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,020
Hey.

67
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,690
That a new

68
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,690
stethoscope?

69
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,390
Oh, yeah.

70
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,160
Owen got a hold of

71
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,160
the last one, so...

72
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,130
Hey, those stuffed animals

73
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,430
are not gonna

74
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,430
diagnose themselves.

75
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,770
All right, blondie.

76
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,630
Coffee later?

77
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,270
You got it, red.

78
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,680
Have a good day.

79
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,680
Thanks.

80
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,410
Hey, babe.

81
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,820
You forgot your lunch.

82
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,910
Tate, I could've

83
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,910
gotten something here.

84
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,310
Potato chips,

85
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,310
pickles and a Zagnut bar?

86
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,080
Pregnant ladies get

87
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,080
to pretty much eat

88
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,080
anything they want, huh?

89
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,390
We could fill you with

90
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,390
a gallon of hormones,

91
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,760
then analyze your diet.

92
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,460
Enjoy your lunch.

93
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,400
Thank you.

94
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,400
You're welcome.

95
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,900
Incoming,

96
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,900
Dr. Manning. Treatment Two.

97
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,960
Got it.

98
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,870
Gabe Moore, eight years old,

99
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,310
with advanced

100
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,310
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,

101
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,510
found seizing at home,

102
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,510
temp 104.

103
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,480
1 milligram of Versed

104
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,480
in the field.

105
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,880
All right,

106
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,880
hang in there, okay?

107
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,270
All right,

108
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,270
come on back.

109
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,840
All right, on my count.

110
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,840
Come on.

111
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,120
One, two, three.

112
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,090
All right, get this

113
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,090
out of here, please.

114
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,020
Compression bags.

115
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
Equal and reactive to light.

116
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,600
Does he see oncology here?

117
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,860
Er, yeah, Dr. Hurwitz.

118
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,230
Get his current med list

119
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,230
and give a dose of

120
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,230
vanco and ceftriaxone.

121
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,600
Vanco and ceftriaxone,

122
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,600
got it.

123
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,110
Does he have a mother

124
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,110
we should call?

125
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,670
She passed when

126
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,670
he was a baby.

127
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,670
Okay.

128
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,340
Dad?

129
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,340
I'm right here.

130
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,380
These doctors are gonna

131
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,380
take good care of you.

132
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,310
He's seizing!

133
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,520
Give one of Ativan,

134
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,520
push 500 milligrams Dilantin.

135
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,580
Oh, my God.

136
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,990
Let's get some labs,

137
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,990
CBC, CMP, CT head,

138
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,990
blood cultures and an EEG.

139
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,530
The seizure may be

140
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,530
caused by his fever.

141
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,000
However, it is possible

142
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,000
that the cancer's spread

143
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,000
to his brain.

144
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,160
When was his last scan?

145
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,260
Couple of months ago.

146
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,560
Let's get an infused MRI.

147
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,040
I just want to see

148
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,040
if the cancer's spread, okay?

149
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,260
Okay.

150
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,570
Dr. Manning?

151
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,570
Yeah.

152
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,270
Excuse me, please.

153
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,340
I just called

154
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,340
the pharmacy.

155
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,220
Dad hasn't filled

156
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,220
Gabe's chemo

157
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,220
in three months.

158
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,050
He's withholding

159
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,050
his medication.

160
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,910
Maybe he filled it

161
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,910
someplace else?

162
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,720
His oncologist

163
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,720
ordered straight

164
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,720
through the hospital,

165
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,990
no other way

166
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,990
to get it.

167
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,060
He's just waiting

168
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,060
for his son to die?

169
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,500
Mr. Moore,

170
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,350
we are aware that

171
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,350
your son was prescribed

172
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,350
a new oral chemo

173
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,680
and that you have been

174
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,680
withholding it.

175
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,180
I'm not withholding them.

176
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,550
I understand that

177
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,550
you're a single father

178
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,890
and that this must be

179
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,890
incredibly hard for you...

180
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,980
It's not about me.

181
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,860
But if you are willingly

182
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,860
keeping your son off

183
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,860
of his meds...

184
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,260
It's his decision.

185
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,260
Excuse me?

186
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,260
Gabe's.

187
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,030
He's been through

188
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,030
four courses of chemo.

189
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,870
The nausea, the pain,

190
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,270
the drugs to treat

191
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,270
the nausea and the pain,

192
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,270
it was awful.

193
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,300
That doesn't mean

194
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,300
you can just stop trying.

195
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,640
He begged me all through

196
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,640
the last course.

197
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,110
But I wouldn't stop it.

198
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,280
And it didn't help at all.

199
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,280
None of them helped.

200
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,440
So this time,

201
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,440
I let him decide.

202
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,110
Well, he can't decide.

203
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,050
He's eight years old, okay?

204
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,420
His brain is literally

205
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,420
not developed enough

206
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,420
to process this.

207
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,890
Life and death and forever

208
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,890
are concepts

209
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,690
that he cannot

210
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,690
fully understand yet.

211
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,560
Gabe does understand.

212
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm sorry,

213
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,600
but we need to

214
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,600
start your son

215
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,600
on his new chemo.

216
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,400
No, I won't authorize that.

217
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,210
I will be back soon

218
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,210
to check on your son.

219
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,210
DCFS can have a court order

220
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,210
to start the chemo

221
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,210
in two hours.

222
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,750
Let's get

223
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,750
the MRI result first.

224
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,980
See if the cancer's

225
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,980
spread so much

226
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,790
that it's no longer

227
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,790
even treatable.

228
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,960
Ms. Holloway,

229
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,960
I'm Dr. Halstead.

230
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,400
I hear you had

231
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,400
some trouble today.

232
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,900
I fell down. Big deal.

233
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,330
Well, says here

234
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,330
your troponin level is 0.08.

235
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,110
That means you fell down

236
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,110
because you were having

237
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,110
a small heart attack.

238
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,400
Ever had any

239
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,400
heart trouble before?

240
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,710
I don't know,

241
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,710
I don't go to doctors.

242
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,000
Dr. Halstead?

243
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,310
Your blood glucose is 458.

244
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,310
You're diabetic?

245
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,980
Mmm. That's what they say.

246
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,050
Let's get a VBG,

247
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,050
give her 10 units

248
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,050
of IV regular insulin

249
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,220
and bolus her a liter of NS.

250
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,890
I'll call endocrine

251
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,890
for a consult,

252
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,590
and let cardiology know

253
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,590
we're admitting her.

254
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,860
Admitting me?

255
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,660
Yeah, that's right.

256
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,560
Diabetes can cause

257
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,560
numerous problems,

258
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,300
including coronary

259
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,300
artery disease.

260
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,800
And I wanna admit you

261
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,800
to run a few tests

262
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,800
on your heart.

263
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,600
And more importantly,

264
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,600
get your diabetes

265
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,600
under control.

266
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,840
Nope, not gonna happen.

267
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,200
Why is that?

268
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,940
Are you gonna feed

269
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,940
Zachary Taylor

270
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,100
and Millard Fillmore?

271
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,570
I'm sorry?

272
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,810
My cats.

273
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,450
Named after

274
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,450
the first 12 presidents.

275
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,290
Let's start getting

276
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,290
your sugar down,

277
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,690
and we'll talk

278
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,690
in a little bit.

279
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,320
Got us a crazy cat lady.

280
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,790
Mmm-hmm.

281
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,990
Drs. Rhodes and Latham,

282
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,990
Mayor Hendricks.

283
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,390
Call me Jim.

284
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,700
My family and I can't

285
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,700
thank you enough for coming.

286
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,140
I assure you we will do

287
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,140
everything we can

288
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,140
for your daughter.

289
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,590
If there's anything

290
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,590
that you need,

291
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,700
please let Bob or me know.

292
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,930
We will. Thank you.

293
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,410
Must be hard

294
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,410
staying upbeat

295
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,210
under such

296
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,210
trying circumstances.

297
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,180
Guess if you're

298
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,180
a politician,

299
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,180
it's expected.

300
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,850
Tough case?

301
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,230
Kids get sick,

302
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,230
I understand that.

303
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,030
But seeing what

304
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,030
their parents do to them,

305
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,600
that drives me nuts.

306
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,330
Yeah.

307
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,140
Coffee time?

308
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,580
That's right.

309
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,580
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm swamped.

310
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,110
Oh, no problem.

311
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,540
Uh, lunch maybe.

312
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,410
Absolutely.

313
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,410
Okay.

314
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
Hey, Will?

315
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
Yeah?

316
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,620
Did you and Natalie

317
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,620
ever have a thing?

318
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,320
What?

319
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,300
Natalie and me? No.

320
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,100
I mean,

321
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,100
we're good friends, and

322
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,560
you know,

323
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,560
she's a great doctor,

324
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,330
but we never dated

325
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,330
or anything.

326
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,240
Okay.

327
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,240
Besides, who cares?

328
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,680
The only person in the world

329
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,680
I have a thing for

330
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,680
right now is you.

331
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,270
You're such a charmer.

332
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,420
You saw Ms. Holloway?

333
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,190
Yep, thanks for

334
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,190
the heads-up.

335
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,190
Mmm-hmm.

336
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,950
Diabetes studies keep

337
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,950
the lights on upstairs.

338
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,050
Glad I could help.

339
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,390
Huh. That's odd.

340
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,960
She was an architect.

341
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,520
Why is that odd?

342
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,070
Well, her hemoglobin A1C

343
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,070
and lipid panel indicate

344
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,370
she takes extremely

345
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,370
poor care of herself.

346
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,910
You know, it seems

347
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,910
out of character

348
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,910
for someone,

349
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,840
I assume,

350
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,840
pays great attention

351
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,840
to detail.

352
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,240
Slow day for head-shrinkers

353
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,240
around here. You want me

354
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,240
to have a chat?

355
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,850
Sure, knock yourself out.

356
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,510
Shoot me her chart.

357
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,510
Sure.

358
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,420
Hello there, Mrs. Holloway.

359
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,490
Well, hello there.

360
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,820
He's breathing so hard.

361
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,690
He's septic.

362
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,300
We need to give

363
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,300
the antibiotics time.

364
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,740
He'd scream out in his sleep

365
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,740
when it first started

366
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,940
and get these pains.

367
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,770
But he kept on fighting.

368
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,580
I quit my job

369
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,580
to take care of him.

370
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,770
Then help him

371
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,770
keep fighting.

372
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,910
Tell him that

373
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,910
there's a chance

374
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,910
this new chemo could work.

375
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,950
But look at him.

376
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,020
He's not fighting anymore.

377
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,250
He's done.

378
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,890
And I will not flog him

379
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,890
against his wishes.

380
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,990
My boy deserves

381
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,990
better than that.

382
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,800
Incoming trauma.

383
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,800
Dr. Choi. We're going to 2.

384
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,600
Got it, Maggie.

385
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,600
Grace Snow, 26.

386
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,270
Driver in a two-car MVC.

387
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,930
Found hypotensive

388
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,930
and tachypneic,

389
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,530
but responded to

390
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,530
a liter bolus on the ride.

391
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,370
I'm Dr. Choi.

392
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,370
You're at Chicago Med.

393
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,480
All right. Let's transfer.

394
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,150
On my count. Ready?

395
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,150
One, two, three.

396
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,050
Grace, does any

397
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,050
of this hurt?

398
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,360
Let's get trauma labs,

399
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,360
blood gas and a fast scan.

400
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,130
Becca...

401
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,130
What?

402
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,850
Becca driving crazy.

403
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,020
Courtney, I thought

404
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,020
this one was the driver.

405
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,570
They said she was.

406
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,530
I'm her husband.

407
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,530
What happened?

408
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,660
She was in a car accident.

409
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,140
Oh, my God, Grace,

410
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,140
are you okay?

411
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,570
Crashed the car...

412
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,540
Possibly some small fluid

413
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,540
in Morrison's pouch.

414
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,740
Since vitals are stable,

415
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,740
let's get a pan scan.

416
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,280
She keeps

417
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,280
mentioning Becca.

418
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,510
Was there someone else

419
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,510
in the car?

420
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,100
Uh, I don't know.

421
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,680
Does she know

422
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,680
someone named Becca?

423
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,880
If there's another victim

424
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,880
still out there,

425
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,880
we need to find her.

426
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,010
Maggie, call PD.

427
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,010
Might be another injury

428
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,010
in the field.

429
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,850
Wait, wait,

430
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,850
there's no other victim.

431
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,060
Becca is Grace's tulpa.

432
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,050
Her what?

433
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
A sentient being

434
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
that lives inside her body.

435
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,100
Becca is Grace's tulpa.

436
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,850
I created her.

437
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,710
You created Becca?

438
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,810
It's how tulpas work.

439
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,080
First, you start

440
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,080
with an image in your mind

441
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,680
of a person

442
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,680
or a character

443
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,680
you might like.

444
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,360
Then you spend some time

445
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,360
with her each day.

446
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,990
Eventually, she takes on

447
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,990
a personality of her own.

448
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,930
She becomes

449
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,930
three-dimensional.

450
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,200
Huh. That's interesting.

451
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,170
So how do you know

452
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,170
what Becca thinks?

453
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,560
I talk to her.

454
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,070
It's tricky at first.

455
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,510
She likes to stay

456
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,510
in the background.

457
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,100
But lately

458
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,100
she's been fronting

459
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,100
more and more.

460
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,680
Fronting?

461
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,980
Taking over my body.

462
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,940
My muscles, my eyes.

463
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,290
Wasn't always easy,

464
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,290
giving over total control

465
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,290
like that,

466
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,350
but you get used to it.

467
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,950
There's a website

468
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,950
that teaches you how.

469
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
So, is that what happened

470
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
today in the car?

471
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
Yeah.

472
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,300
Okay.

473
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,300
I let her drive.

474
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,300
I shouldn't have.

475
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,770
She's not very good at it.

476
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,570
But we got into an argument,

477
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,840
and she got upset

478
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,840
and lost control.

479
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,710
Which is why we decided

480
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,710
that you, Grace,

481
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,710
wouldn't see her anymore.

482
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,340
Right?

483
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,370
Right.

484
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,740
They're ready for

485
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,740
Mrs. Scott in CT.

486
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,220
Okay, well, very nice

487
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,220
to meet you, Grace.

488
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,060
Um, we hope that

489
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,060
both you and Becca

490
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,060
are feeling better soon.

491
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,360
As long as

492
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,360
scans are negative,

493
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,360
I'll observe for a few hours,

494
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,830
and then you can

495
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,830
admit her to psych.

496
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,730
The differential's long.

497
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,510
Could be dissociative

498
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,510
identity disorder,

499
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,510
schizophrenia...

500
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,910
Or it could

501
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,910
just be a tulpa.

502
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,850
I mean, I'm not ruling out

503
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,850
any of that other stuff yet,

504
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,610
but until we see

505
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,610
signs of impairment,

506
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,080
we have to consider

507
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,080
the possibility

508
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,590
that she really

509
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,590
could've created

510
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,590
an alter ego

511
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,280
that she believes

512
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,280
cohabits her body.

513
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,420
But tulpas aren't

514
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,420
in the DSM.

515
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,520
So what?

516
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,750
She's clearly disturbed.

517
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,750
We need a diagnosis.

518
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,630
Well, it's challenging.

519
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,290
And I look forward

520
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,290
to seeing where you land.

521
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,530
Hey, I just got off

522
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,530
the phone with PD.

523
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,300
They've got several

524
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,300
eyewitness accounts

525
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,300
of the accident,

526
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,470
saying that your patient

527
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,470
accelerated directly

528
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,470
into traffic.

529
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,040
They think it was

530
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,040
a suicide attempt.

531
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,340
Hmm.

532
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,080
Just got a little

533
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,080
more complicated.

534
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,080
Mmm-hmm.

535
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,310
Graft is in.

536
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,310
Let's re-implant

537
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,310
the coronaries.

538
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,290
We'll do

539
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,290
the left coronary first

540
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,290
due to its anterior location.

541
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,760
MALE LOCAL SURGEON:

542
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,760
How far do you prefer

543
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,760
to dissect for implantation?

544
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,920
5

545
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,920
or 6 centimeters.

546
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,290
MALE LOCAL SURGEON:

547
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,290
Even when

548
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,290
it's a little shorter,

549
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,200
there could be some tension.

550
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,890
That rarely

551
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,890
becomes problematic.

552
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,270
FEMALE LOCAL SURGEON:

553
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,270
Though Kessler et al.

554
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,270
did report

555
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,530
pseudoaneurysm formation

556
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,540
in 20% of implants

557
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,540
under tension.

558
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,700
Which we can avoid

559
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,700
with added dissection.

560
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,110
MALE LOCAL SURGEON:

561
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,110
So, you'd prefer to risk

562
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,110
a branch injury

563
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,740
and possibly force

564
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,740
a double bypass?

565
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,800
No.

566
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,140
I believe Dr. Rhodes means

567
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,140
we can do a Cabrol,

568
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,850
attach an 8 millimeter

569
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,850
woven graft

570
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,050
to the left coronary

571
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,920
in order to ease

572
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,920
the tension.

573
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,220
Am I correct, Dr. Rhodes?

574
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,390
Yes. Yes,

575
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,390
that is what we should do.

576
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,900
Open an 8 millimeter

577
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,900
woven graft.

578
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,530
What's the verdict?

579
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,010
Definitely in the red

580
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,010
on the old

581
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,010
eccentricity meter,

582
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,100
but not really any

583
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,100
alarm bells to speak of.

584
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,340
So we can't hold her?

585
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,110
Not if she wants to go.

586
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,110
Totally her call.

587
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,610
Figured. Thanks.

588
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,180
You know, it used to be,

589
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,180
if a doctor told a patient

590
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,310
to do something,

591
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,310
they just did it.

592
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,580
You been binging on

593
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,580
Dr. Quinn,

594
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,580
Medicine Woman again?

595
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,990
No, I'm just saying,

596
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,990
things were different,

597
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,990
all right?

598
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,690
Like guys didn't need

599
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,690
to tell women

600
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,820
every single thing

601
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,820
they were feeling.

602
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,260
My father never did.

603
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,060
Are we still talking

604
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,060
about diabetes?

605
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,230
Brought the rest

606
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,230
of that assessment

607
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,230
for you to fill out.

608
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,600
Can I ask you,

609
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,600
that handsome doctor,

610
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,600
is he seeing anyone?

611
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,330
Dr. Halstead?

612
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,010
Actually, I believe he is.

613
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,540
Not the one with the hair.

614
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,840
The big one, in the vest.

615
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,110
Dr. Charles?

616
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,980
Actually, I have no idea.

617
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,560
Hey, buddy.

618
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,560
Where's your dad?

619
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,530
He went to the bathroom.

620
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,900
Can I go home?

621
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,070
Not yet. We're still

622
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,070
working on your fever.

623
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,960
Okay.

624
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,370
You like video games?

625
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,770
Yeah, I do.

626
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,880
So,

627
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,120
you know when

628
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,120
your character dies

629
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,120
and the game ends,

630
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,290
you can just start over

631
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,290
and play again?

632
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,490
Uh-huh.

633
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,920
Okay, well,

634
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,920
when people die,

635
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,920
it's different.

636
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,800
There are no do-overs.

637
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,660
You can't just

638
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,660
start a new game.

639
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,470
I know. You don't think

640
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,470
or do anything

641
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,040
because you're

642
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,040
not here anymore.

643
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,910
Like my mom.

644
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,040
Right.

645
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,740
So if you only have

646
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,740
one chance,

647
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,450
wouldn't you want to fight

648
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,450
like crazy to keep going

649
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,180
for as long as you can?

650
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,950
I did, but nothing worked.

651
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,950
It just hurt a lot.

652
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,020
I know.

653
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,790
Gabe,

654
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,290
we want to be able

655
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,290
to give you a new medicine.

656
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,000
And I'm afraid

657
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,000
if you don't take it,

658
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,840
you are gonna die.

659
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,740
And I don't want that.

660
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,740
Thank you.

661
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,680
But everybody has

662
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,680
their time to live.

663
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,420
I've had mine.

664
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,020
I want to see

665
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,020
what's next.

666
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,900
Grace, I'm sorry,

667
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,900
but we have to ask you,

668
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,880
did you try to

669
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,880
kill yourself today?

670
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,710
What? No.

671
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,080
You said before

672
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,080
that you and Becca

673
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,080
were having an argument.

674
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,630
What was that about?

675
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,630
Nothing.

676
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,030
She just gets upset

677
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,030
with me sometimes.

678
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,350
Upset?

679
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,350
Not upset, just...

680
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,700
Like, she doesn't understand

681
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,700
how I could love someone

682
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,700
who wants to keep us apart.

683
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,530
I imagine

684
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,530
that'd be hard for her.

685
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,800
It is. Really is.

686
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,770
I mean,

687
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,770
she's my best friend.

688
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,180
Why should I have

689
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,180
to stop seeing her?

690
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,180
I don't always connect

691
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,180
with other people.

692
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,920
So when there's one person

693
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,920
you can talk to

694
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,920
and be yourself with,

695
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,620
who isn't gonna judge you

696
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,620
or hurt your feelings...

697
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,730
Knowing I have

698
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,730
a really good friend

699
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,730
should make Mark happy.

700
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,800
But it doesn't.

701
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,270
I don't understand why.

702
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,810
Grace, are you sure

703
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,810
that you weren't trying

704
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,810
to end your life today?

705
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,370
No.

706
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,310
I don't know.

707
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,740
Maybe.

708
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,940
I just... I don't know.

709
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,960
Put her

710
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,960
on a five-day hold?

711
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,760
Yeah. Poor woman.

712
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,760
Mmm-hmm.

713
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,540
At least we can

714
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,540
narrow it down to

715
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,540
something psychiatric.

716
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,460
Maybe put her on a trial

717
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,460
of antipsychotics?

718
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,740
I don't know.

719
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,270
Becca tried

720
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,270
to kill Grace.

721
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,150
Yeah, but let's not forget,

722
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,150
Becca is Grace.

723
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,420
I mean, we might yet find

724
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,420
that she's psychotic,

725
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,920
but she could also just be

726
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,350
cracking under the pressure

727
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,350
of forcibly being cut off

728
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,350
from a part of herself.

729
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,720
Wait, you don't think

730
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,720
she is actually

731
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,090
within the bounds

732
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,090
of functionality?

733
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,720
I think we need

734
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,720
more information,

735
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,720
don't you?

736
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,990
Grab me when

737
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,990
her husband gets back.

738
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,500
I think it might be time

739
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,500
for us all to, um...

740
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,130
To meet Becca.

741
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,370
ST elevation,

742
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,370
she's having an MI.

743
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,010
Give her an aspirin, nitro,

744
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,010
and push five milligrams

745
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,010
of morphine.

746
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,480
What can I do?

747
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,480
Get her on 10 liters of O2.

748
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,040
Lydia, we're gonna

749
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,040
get you through this.

750
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,040
Stay with me.

751
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,350
Lydia,

752
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,350
lift your tongue up.

753
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,990
Morphine's in.

754
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,290
Send another troponin

755
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,290
and get a 12-lead.

756
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,090
Ms. Holloway, you just had

757
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,090
another heart attack.

758
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,820
I need to get you up

759
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,820
for angiography

760
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,700
and probably

761
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,700
a stent right now,

762
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,700
do you understand?

763
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,160
Yes.

764
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,160
Good.

765
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,330
But I'm not doing it.

766
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,500
I told you,

767
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm going home to my cats.

768
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,100
Maybe I have not been

769
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,100
clear enough.

770
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,500
How many cats?

771
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,140
Twelve.

772
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,840
Draw a red top tube as well.

773
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,840
Give me a few minutes.

774
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,740
I think we might've

775
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,740
found a reason

776
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,740
for her to stay.

777
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,880
Hey, back in the OR,

778
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,880
thanks for not letting me

779
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,880
look like an idiot.

780
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,520
Oh, no need to

781
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,520
thank me for it.

782
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,790
Still, I appreciate it.

783
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,160
I always thought that

784
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,160
needing to be rescued

785
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,160
was a sign of weakness.

786
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm starting to see

787
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,500
it's more complicated

788
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,500
than that.

789
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,570
Dr. Latham!

790
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,940
So glad

791
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,940
you could join us.

792
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,570
Now, we may not be Chicago,

793
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,480
but I bet you guys have

794
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,480
never had a wicked sidecar

795
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,310
inside a 100-foot

796
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,310
rock dome.

797
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,750
Come on.

798
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,750
No, I'm...

799
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,310
Dr. Rhodes, Mike Evans,

800
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,310
Chamber of Commerce.

801
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,440
Hey, pleasure to meet you.

802
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,750
Let's get you a drink.

803
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,810
Absolutely.

804
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,320
Strap yourself in.

805
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,360
Ms. Holloway's case

806
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,360
has a psych component

807
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,360
after all.

808
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,160
Toxoplasmosis.

809
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,960
That's a parasite

810
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,960
from cat feces.

811
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,940
Which lives

812
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,940
in the victim's brain

813
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,940
forever,

814
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,670
and in women,

815
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,670
toxo creates a compulsion

816
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,670
to take care of cats.

817
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,280
Makes one wonder,

818
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,280
do cat lovers

819
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,280
get toxoplasmosis,

820
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,670
or does toxo make

821
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,670
them cat lovers?

822
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,510
Interesting, but not

823
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,510
terribly relevant.

824
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,310
What is relevant

825
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,310
is its other effects

826
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,310
on women.

827
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,460
They become less concerned

828
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,460
with their own welfare.

829
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,560
Which might be

830
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,560
fueling her refusal

831
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,560
to let us take care of her.

832
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,920
All right.

833
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,830
Let's go tell her.

834
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,830
Sure you want to do that?

835
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,060
There's a parasite

836
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,060
in her brain.

837
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,720
Yeah. But there's no cure

838
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,720
for toxo.

839
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,060
You'd be giving her

840
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,060
information she can't

841
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,060
do anything with.

842
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,340
Her decision-making

843
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,340
capability is compromised.

844
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,000
Knowing the truth

845
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,000
could help her change

846
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,000
how she thinks.

847
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,170
Eh, a lot easier said

848
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,170
than done.

849
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,170
Still, it's our

850
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,170
responsibility to

851
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,170
let her decide.

852
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,340
Fair enough.

853
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,440
All right.

854
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,610
So what you're saying is,

855
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,760
I've been living alone

856
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,760
for 10 years,

857
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,760
keeping to myself,

858
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,060
all because of a parasite?

859
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,560
It's certainly a factor.

860
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,930
It alters your thoughts,

861
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,930
but it doesn't dictate them.

862
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,630
I mean, you must have

863
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,630
noticed differences

864
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,630
from when you were younger.

865
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,500
I used to go out more.

866
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,600
Had more friends,

867
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,600
always liked to travel.

868
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,640
But as the years went on,

869
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,470
I didn't really feel like

870
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,470
doing those things anymore.

871
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,370
But wouldn't it be great

872
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,370
if you did?

873
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,380
Maybe.

874
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,120
Doesn't seem

875
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,120
so interesting now.

876
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,090
Well, that's it,

877
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,090
why not?

878
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,290
You're the same person

879
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,290
you used to be.

880
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,520
Am I?

881
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,000
You just said

882
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,000
there's a bug in my head

883
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,000
pulling the strings.

884
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,030
But now that you know,

885
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,030
you can do something

886
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,030
about it.

887
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,530
Make better decisions.

888
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,900
There's no reason

889
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,900
you can't

890
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,900
reach down inside

891
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,930
and find the person

892
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,930
you were.

893
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,070
I don't know.

894
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,940
Ms. Holloway,

895
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,940
I think the chance

896
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,940
to be yourself again

897
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,500
is worth fighting for.

898
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,720
See if we can get her

899
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,720
in the cath lab today.

900
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,920
Sure.

901
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,350
You okay?

902
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,460
Nina asked if

903
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,460
there was ever anything

904
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,460
between Nat and me.

905
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,390
Really?

906
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,670
Well, technically,

907
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,670
there wasn't.

908
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,300
I mean, we never went out.

909
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,640
Mmm-hmm.

910
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,600
But okay, no,

911
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,600
I wasn't completely honest.

912
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,210
I should... I should

913
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,210
tell her the truth, right?

914
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,810
I mean,

915
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,810
we're in a relationship.

916
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
That should be

917
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
built on honesty.

918
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,210
You're asking my advice?

919
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,310
Women don't

920
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,310
usually appreciate

921
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,860
hearing about their

922
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,860
boyfriend's feelings

923
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,860
for other women.

924
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,650
But it's the right

925
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,650
thing to do.

926
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,650
Ah.

927
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,190
Isn't it?

928
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,130
Hi.

929
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,600
Gabe's blood gases

930
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,600
are getting worse.

931
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,670
We're getting to a point

932
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,670
where we may

933
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,670
have to intubate.

934
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,610
And that'll get him through

935
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,610
till you can get

936
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,610
the infection under control?

937
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,710
The antibiotics still

938
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,710
aren't turning it around.

939
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,980
And there's

940
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,980
a very good chance

941
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,980
that once we intubate,

942
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,890
we may not be able

943
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,890
to get the tube out again.

944
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,130
Wait, I won't be able

945
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,130
to talk to him again?

946
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,020
It's possible.

947
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,790
I'm sorry.

948
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,360
God.

949
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,420
Excuse me.

950
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,620
Dr. Manning.

951
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,370
We're not there

952
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,370
quite yet.

953
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,860
I'll be back.

954
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,640
The radiologist

955
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,640
hasn't read the MRI yet,

956
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,640
but I don't care.

957
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,150
We need to get Gabe

958
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,150
that chemo.

959
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,180
But, April, bringing in

960
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,180
Family Services...

961
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,780
Okay, you feel

962
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,780
for the dad. I get it.

963
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,320
But you are Gabe's doctor.

964
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,480
And that boy understands

965
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,250
more about his situation

966
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,250
than you think.

967
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,620
Natalie, if you don't

968
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,620
call DCFS, I will.

969
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,970
Okay. I'll talk to Goodwin.

970
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,110
You can see it

971
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,110
on their websites.

972
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,110
Tulpas go on dates

973
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,110
with other tulpas.

974
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,580
Dates.

975
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,580
How does that work?

976
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,310
You bring your tulpa,

977
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,310
they bring theirs.

978
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,310
It's nuts.

979
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,080
I can't believe

980
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,080
that you're

981
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,080
taking it seriously.

982
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,140
Well, what we're doing

983
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,140
is we're taking

984
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,140
Grace seriously.

985
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,310
Which is why it's important

986
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,310
for us to get a sense

987
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,250
of who this

988
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,250
alternate personality is

989
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,550
and how

990
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,550
she presents herself.

991
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,080
Okay?

992
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,690
Hi, Grace.

993
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,760
How are you feeling?

994
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,860
Okay.

995
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,160
So we were wondering,

996
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,710
um, if it might be

997
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,710
possible for us to

998
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,710
say hello to Becca.

999
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,370
You too?

1000
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,470
Yeah.

1001
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,150
Okay. It'll just take

1002
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,150
a moment.

1003
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,610
Take all the time

1004
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,610
you need.

1005
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,760
What's up?

1006
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,430
Hello, Becca.

1007
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,360
I'm Dr. Charles,

1008
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,360
and this is Dr. Reese.

1009
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,910
I think you know Mark.

1010
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,530
Hey.

1011
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,850
Mark, would you like

1012
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,850
to get us started off?

1013
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,180
Becca,

1014
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,320
I heard that

1015
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,320
you and Grace

1016
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,320
had a fight.

1017
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,380
So?

1018
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,260
I'd like to hear

1019
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,260
about it.

1020
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,260
I'm sure you would.

1021
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,600
Um, Becca, the more

1022
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,600
forthcoming you could be...

1023
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,430
Fine.

1024
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,900
I was explaining

1025
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,900
how you don't love her.

1026
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,170
Of course I love her.

1027
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,940
Then why don't you want her

1028
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,940
to have any friends?

1029
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,000
This is crazy.

1030
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,050
Grace, can I please

1031
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,050
just talk to you?

1032
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,180
No. You deal with me.

1033
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,740
I want Grace to have friends,

1034
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,740
but she spends

1035
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,740
all day and night online.

1036
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,320
That's where

1037
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,320
her friends are.

1038
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,190
Chatrooms for tulpamancers!

1039
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,650
For what?

1040
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,990
Tulpamancers,

1041
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,990
that's what they call it.

1042
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,260
Grace wasn't always

1043
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,260
like this.

1044
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,260
She used to be normal.

1045
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,660
"Used to be"?

1046
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,590
Grace and I were married

1047
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,590
for two years

1048
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,590
before you showed up.

1049
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,430
I didn't "show up."

1050
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,230
Grace just told you

1051
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,230
about me last year.

1052
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,930
What does that mean?

1053
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,840
It means she created me

1054
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,840
in high school.

1055
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,740
High school?

1056
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,740
Yeah.

1057
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,410
I'm the reason she was

1058
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,410
able to move out of

1059
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,410
her parents' house.

1060
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,660
I'm the reason

1061
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,660
she got up the courage

1062
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,660
to meet you at that party.

1063
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,990
Grace, can I

1064
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,990
please just...

1065
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,990
I'm the one

1066
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,150
who's been with her

1067
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,150
all these years.

1068
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,250
Not you. Me.

1069
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,520
Whoever you are,

1070
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,090
you tell my wife

1071
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,090
that she has to choose.

1072
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,740
It's either Becca or me.

1073
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,490
Obviously, she is

1074
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,490
profoundly disturbed,

1075
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,650
which we should've known

1076
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,650
when she first said "tulpa."

1077
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,860
Why are we treating her

1078
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,860
like she is sane

1079
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,860
when she isn't?

1080
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,420
Wouldn't that be

1081
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,420
a little too easy, though?

1082
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,190
I mean, sure,

1083
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,190
we could, you know,

1084
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,130
slap a label on her,

1085
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,130
put her in some

1086
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,130
diagnostic box,

1087
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,400
pour some medicine on top,

1088
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,600
but sometimes

1089
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,600
it's a little more

1090
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,600
complicated than that.

1091
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,270
She had an argument

1092
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,270
with her made-up friend

1093
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,270
while her subconscious

1094
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,270
crashed the car.

1095
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,570
It seems

1096
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,570
pretty simple to me.

1097
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,840
Grace is definitely

1098
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,840
a fractured personality.

1099
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,880
But it's all the more reason

1100
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,880
that we have a responsibility

1101
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,350
to dig deeper

1102
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,350
and figure out why.

1103
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,950
All right. I'm sorry,

1104
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,950
Dr. Charles,

1105
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,950
but I like boxes.

1106
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,080
None of this

1107
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,080
makes any sense.

1108
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,950
It is all so subjective.

1109
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,350
I hate it. I mean,

1110
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,350
where's the science?

1111
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,120
Dr. Reese,

1112
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,120
every medical discipline,

1113
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,120
psychiatry included,

1114
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,070
is as much art

1115
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,070
as it is science.

1116
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,500
Well, I don't see

1117
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,500
the science or the art.

1118
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,200
You know,

1119
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,200
everybody was so surprised

1120
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,540
when I went into this,

1121
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,540
me, the lab geek.

1122
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,340
Well, they were right.

1123
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,340
I don't belong here.

1124
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,280
Uh, excuse me

1125
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,280
for a second, guys.

1126
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,280
Sure.

1127
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,360
Looks like you're having

1128
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,360
a good time.

1129
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,860
Ah.

1130
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,760
Very nice young woman.

1131
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,030
We're going up to my room.

1132
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,870
She has an irregular mole

1133
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,870
she'd like me

1134
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,870
to take a look at.

1135
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,870
Was that her idea or yours?

1136
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,840
Here, Doc,

1137
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,840
let me freshen that up.

1138
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,180
Uh... Why don't

1139
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,180
the three of us go over

1140
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,180
to the steakhouse?

1141
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,540
My treat.

1142
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,320
Dr. Rhodes,

1143
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,320
are you trying to...

1144
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,320
What is the expression?

1145
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,890
Interrupt my flow?

1146
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,600
No. No, I'm not.

1147
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,900
Night.

1148
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,780
Are they putting in

1149
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,780
the tube now?

1150
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,380
Dad, I'm...

1151
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,160
Scared.

1152
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,160
I know, buddy.

1153
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,220
But the doctor's gonna

1154
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,220
give you some medicine

1155
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,890
so you sleep

1156
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,890
and it won't hurt.

1157
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,390
Right?

1158
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,560
That's right.

1159
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,970
Dr. Manning?

1160
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,970
Yes?

1161
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,130
I'll be right back.

1162
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,880
DCFS is on their way.

1163
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,640
Okay. Um... Just tell them

1164
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,640
I need a minute.

1165
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,280
Fine, but they won't

1166
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,280
wait long.

1167
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,540
Okay.

1168
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,580
I just want you to know

1169
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,580
you're the best son

1170
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,580
a dad could hope for.

1171
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,120
You are so brave,

1172
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,760
and I am so proud of you.

1173
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,290
And I love you

1174
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,970
so, so much.

1175
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,040
Ms. Holloway.

1176
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,620
Where are you going?

1177
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,620
Home.

1178
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,650
Andrew Jackson gets anxious

1179
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,650
when you don't change

1180
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,650
his water.

1181
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,810
Okay, but we decided

1182
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,810
that you'd stay

1183
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,810
and get a full workup.

1184
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,320
You decided that.

1185
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,720
But, Ms. Holloway...

1186
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,520
I'm not sure I even believe

1187
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,520
all this toxic

1188
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,520
whatever business.

1189
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,720
And even if I did,

1190
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,720
would it be me

1191
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,720
believing you,

1192
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,720
or the parasite?

1193
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,070
What was the point

1194
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,070
in even telling me

1195
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,070
all that stuff?

1196
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,810
She's just gonna be back

1197
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,810
with another coronary event.

1198
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,470
Funny thing about the truth,

1199
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,470
it rarely sets anyone free.

1200
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,690
I think she likes you.

1201
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,090
I hope

1202
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,090
that's a compliment.

1203
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,820
Actually, it's more

1204
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,820
of a diagnostic clue.

1205
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,720
Turns out men with toxo

1206
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,720
are more attractive

1207
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,720
to infected women.

1208
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,240
And it also makes them

1209
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,240
rumpled, introverted,

1210
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,170
dismissive of rules

1211
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,170
and secretive.

1212
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,770
Are you

1213
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,770
insinuating something?

1214
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,470
Not insinuating,

1215
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,470
directly stating

1216
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,770
that you might have

1217
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,770
toxo, too.

1218
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,310
Yeah. Thanks, Nancy Drew,

1219
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,310
but it's not possible.

1220
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,850
You know I'm not

1221
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,850
a cat person.

1222
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,680
Actually, I had no idea.

1223
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,550
Maybe because you are

1224
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,550
so secretive.

1225
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,110
Oh, I take it back,

1226
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,110
Perry Mason.

1227
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,120
You ever consider

1228
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,120
the law?

1229
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,120
Hmm.

1230
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,190
You are avoiding.

1231
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,890
Why don't we just

1232
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,890
do a blood test?

1233
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,590
Okay, yeah, sure.

1234
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,590
Yeah?

1235
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,820
Blood test,

1236
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,820
good idea, great.

1237
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,060
Great, I will find you

1238
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,060
after work.

1239
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,190
See you then.

1240
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,900
Hey, somebody help!

1241
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,370
She's tachycardic

1242
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,370
and tachypneic.

1243
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,370
Sats at 84.

1244
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,280
Grace, does this hurt?

1245
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,280
Hey, what's happening?

1246
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,440
Is she bleeding?

1247
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,240
I don't think so.

1248
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,240
Belly's benign.

1249
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,240
CTs were negative.

1250
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,620
Rhythm's gone.

1251
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,620
EKG leads

1252
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,620
are coming off.

1253
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,590
She's sweating like crazy.

1254
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,590
Let's get the crash cart!

1255
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,620
Heart attack?

1256
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,620
No cyanosis or pallor.

1257
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,120
Let's check

1258
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,120
her rhythm.

1259
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,320
Uh... Fast but regular.

1260
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,130
Wait.

1261
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,970
Grace, talk to Becca.

1262
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,970
What?

1263
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,830
Talk to her, Grace.

1264
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,330
Sarah.

1265
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,640
Can you talk

1266
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,640
to Becca?

1267
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,080
Is she there?

1268
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,080
What's she telling you?

1269
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,800
To breathe.

1270
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,010
This could be

1271
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,010
blunt cardiac trauma.

1272
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,340
Let's get an EKG,

1273
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,340
labs, and an echo.

1274
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,710
No, no, no, wait.

1275
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,710
Breathe.

1276
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,770
Anything else?

1277
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,810
Calm. Imagine us

1278
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,810
in a peaceful place.

1279
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,750
Okay, then listen to her.

1280
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,750
Reese, we need...

1281
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,750
Listen to her.

1282
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,770
Sats back up to 96.

1283
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,200
She was having

1284
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,200
a panic attack.

1285
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,170
And Becca talked her down.

1286
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,960
Hey,

1287
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,960
I got your call.

1288
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,230
Dr. Latham, are...

1289
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,690
Something wrong?

1290
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,330
That woman,

1291
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,840
she asked me to get ice

1292
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,840
for our drinks,

1293
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,270
and when I returned,

1294
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,270
she was gone,

1295
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,270
as was the $200

1296
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,270
in my wallet and my watch

1297
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,630
that my parents gave me

1298
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,630
for graduation! I...

1299
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,670
Really?

1300
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,940
Your skepticism

1301
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,940
was well-founded.

1302
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,380
I should have

1303
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,380
never allowed myself

1304
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,380
to get involved like that.

1305
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,750
My mother

1306
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,750
will be very upset.

1307
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,970
Gabe's MRI results.

1308
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,940
His tumors are shrinking?

1309
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,540
Doesn't make sense, right?

1310
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,240
I mean, chemo can suppress

1311
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,240
the immune system,

1312
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,210
and the immune system

1313
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,210
helps fight cancer.

1314
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,550
So being off chemo might have

1315
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,550
allowed his immune system

1316
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,550
to recuperate.

1317
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,580
It would explain his fever,

1318
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,580
signs that his body's

1319
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,580
starting to fight again.

1320
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,090
And it's fighting

1321
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,090
the cancer.

1322
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,380
Yeah. I mean,

1323
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,380
withholding chemo

1324
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,260
might actually

1325
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,260
have saved his life.

1326
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,260
Ms. Goodwin,

1327
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,260
we don't need to do this.

1328
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,290
I'm sorry,

1329
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,290
it's in the hands

1330
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,290
of DCFS now.

1331
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,100
No, no. I was wrong.

1332
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,100
He doesn't need

1333
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,100
the medication.

1334
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,160
What's going on?

1335
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,900
Mr. Moore,

1336
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,900
I'm placing you

1337
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,900
under arrest...

1338
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,570
No, no, no, please!

1339
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,570
...for medical

1340
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,570
child neglect.

1341
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,980
Dr. Manning?

1342
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,980
No, just stop.

1343
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,980
Everything is okay.

1344
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,980
Excuse me, ma'am.

1345
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,070
I'm not leaving my son.

1346
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,240
No, you need

1347
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,240
to listen to me.

1348
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,220
Okay? Gabe's tumors

1349
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,220
are shrinking

1350
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,750
because he didn't get

1351
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,750
the chemo.

1352
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,150
Gabe is gonna get better!

1353
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,240
He's gonna live?

1354
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,110
He's got a long ways

1355
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,110
to go, but yes.

1356
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,290
Sir, I need your hands.

1357
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,330
Adam, we'll fix this.

1358
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,740
Whatever happens,

1359
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,740
it was worth it.

1360
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,650
Hey, man.

1361
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,950
Hey, there.

1362
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,360
So, here's the deal.

1363
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,550
I'm gonna need everything

1364
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,550
that she took from my friend,

1365
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,690
and I'm gonna

1366
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,690
give you one hour.

1367
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,560
I'm sorry, I don't know

1368
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,560
what you're talking about.

1369
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,900
Dr. Latham came all the way

1370
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,900
out here to save the life

1371
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,900
of the Mayor's daughter.

1372
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,740
So, how do you think

1373
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,740
the Mayor's gonna react

1374
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,740
when he hears

1375
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,370
that you ripped

1376
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,370
that doctor off?

1377
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,110
The watch and the $300.

1378
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,440
It was only $200.

1379
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,010
Call it punitive damages

1380
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,010
for pain and suffering.

1381
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,150
Come on, man.

1382
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,750
One hour.

1383
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,290
Much better.

1384
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,460
Thank you.

1385
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,160
His temp's coming down.

1386
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,970
Antibiotics are

1387
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,970
finally working.

1388
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,530
Goodwin said his aunt

1389
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,530
will stay with him

1390
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,080
until she can get

1391
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,080
the charges dropped.

1392
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,110
I'm sorry I got

1393
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,110
so worked up earlier. I...

1394
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,550
You had a point.

1395
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,210
I get these thoughts

1396
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,210
and urges now.

1397
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,550
Maybe it's this

1398
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,550
little tyrant

1399
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,550
in my uterus.

1400
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,480
You think?

1401
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,950
I'll be really glad

1402
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,950
when this part is over.

1403
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,490
The part where

1404
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,490
every decision you make

1405
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,490
is because of your child?

1406
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,160
I hate to break it to you,

1407
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,160
but that one's forever.

1408
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,370
Hey.

1409
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,370
Hey, ready to go?

1410
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,870
Oh. Yeah.

1411
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,740
Hey, by the way, um,

1412
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,640
you know, when I asked you

1413
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,640
about Natalie before,

1414
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,740
I really appreciate

1415
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,740
your being honest with me.

1416
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,940
Yeah.

1417
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,410
Look, Nina,

1418
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,410
about that...

1419
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,150
Yeah?

1420
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,720
Well, just...

1421
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,220
Of course.

1422
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,150
Relationships are

1423
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,150
built on trust, right?

1424
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,160
Yes.

1425
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,630
Which is why I feel like

1426
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,630
I need to tell you something.

1427
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,100
You know Dr. Rauch

1428
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,100
in Cardiology?

1429
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,370
I dated him.

1430
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,130
Yeah?

1431
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,230
Okay. I like Rauch.

1432
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,480
I also dated

1433
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,480
Jay Flint in GI.

1434
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,740
Flint? Heavyset guy?

1435
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,650
Oh, it was just

1436
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,650
a summer thing.

1437
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,920
Dr. Sherman was

1438
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,920
a little more serious,

1439
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,920
but I don't know.

1440
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,730
Your friend

1441
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,730
wanted to make sure

1442
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,730
that you got these back.

1443
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,860
She had an emergency

1444
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,860
phone call.

1445
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,860
She had to leave.

1446
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,930
It turns out

1447
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,930
that the whole thing

1448
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,930
was just a big, old mistake.

1449
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,370
This is too much.

1450
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,370
I only had $200.

1451
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,240
Yeah, she just felt terrible

1452
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,240
about the whole thing.

1453
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,710
She wanted

1454
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,710
to buy you dinner.

1455
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,070
Hmm.

1456
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,440
Is that really

1457
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,440
what happened?

1458
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,550
Dr. Latham, I'm sorry

1459
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,550
that I brought you

1460
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,550
out here.

1461
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,820
My ambition

1462
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,820
to do the surgery

1463
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,820
got the best of me.

1464
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,520
It was selfish.

1465
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,120
Well, don't apologize.

1466
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,530
All in all, I had

1467
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,530
a really good time.

1468
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,240
How's she doing?

1469
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,240
Which one? Grace? Becca?

1470
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,470
Who knows?

1471
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,470
Mr. Scott,

1472
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,070
if there's a part of Grace

1473
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,710
that she didn't feel

1474
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,710
comfortable sharing

1475
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,710
with you before,

1476
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,250
is it not at all possible

1477
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,250
to see anything

1478
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,250
that's happened here

1479
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,620
as a sign of progress?

1480
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,720
Progress?

1481
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,990
Yeah, I just learned

1482
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,990
how unbalanced

1483
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,990
my wife really is

1484
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,530
and that

1485
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,530
she doesn't need me.

1486
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,890
She needs Becca.

1487
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,730
I'm done.

1488
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,670
This was a total disaster.

1489
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,600
I'm not so sure

1490
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,600
that's true.

1491
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,310
I mean,

1492
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,310
from Grace's perspective,

1493
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,280
this could be as close

1494
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,280
to a win as we can get.

1495
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,910
She just chose her tulpa

1496
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,910
over her husband,

1497
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,310
her tulpa

1498
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,310
that almost killed her.

1499
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,490
I just saw her tulpa

1500
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,490
talk her off a ledge.

1501
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,560
I have no idea

1502
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,560
what to think.

1503
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,820
Like it or not,

1504
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,590
the line between

1505
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,590
a psychological illness

1506
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,630
and a coping mechanism

1507
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,630
is a blurry one.

1508
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I mean, just 'cause

1509
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
we don't give them

1510
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
names and voices

1511
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,290
doesn't mean

1512
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,290
we don't all have

1513
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,290
different sides.

1514
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,190
I mean, our personalities

1515
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,190
change based on

1516
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,190
how much sleep we get,

1517
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,370
how hungry we are.

1518
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,480
Hell, intestinal bacteria

1519
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,040
could be

1520
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,040
the determining factor

1521
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,040
in our emotions.

1522
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,980
Look,

1523
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:31,990
I know you think of yourself

1524
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:31,990
as an analytical thinker

1525
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:31,990
and a scientist,

1526
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,060
and that you're wondering

1527
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,060
if you have a place

1528
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,060
in psychiatry right now.

1529
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,830
But I also see this

1530
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,830
other Sarah in there,

1531
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,960
and she's filled

1532
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,960
with intuition

1533
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,960
and compassion, humanity.

1534
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,830
And when you

1535
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,830
put them both together,

1536
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,540
like during Grace's

1537
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,540
panic attack today,

1538
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,010
it's when I see

1539
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,010
a sensational psychiatrist.

1540
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,860
Toxo screen. You a fainter?

1541
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,860
Or can we do this

1542
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,860
sitting up?

1543
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,220
You mind if we hold off

1544
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,220
on that right now?

1545
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,930
Come on.

1546
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,930
I got a better idea.

1547
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,870
Believe it or not,

1548
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,870
studies show that cat videos

1549
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,340
are actually good for people.

1550
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,900
Huh.

1551
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,900
Mmm.

1552
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,000
They increase energy

1553
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,000
and positive emotions.

1554
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,980
It's crazy, right?

1555
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,980
Yeah.

1556
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,440
But you know,

1557
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,440
in the interest of

1558
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,440
full disclosure

1559
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,220
and to repudiate

1560
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,220
this bizarre accusation

1561
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,220
of secretiveness,

1562
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,510
I never had a problem

1563
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,510
with cats.

1564
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,410
Really? Yeah?

1565
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,410
Really.

1566
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,850
Matter of fact,

1567
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,250
I actually had a cat once.

1568
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,290
Huh.

1569
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,290
Yeah. Name of Pete.

1570
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,500
Abyssinian-Siamese mix.

1571
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,040
Used to jump on my chest

1572
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,040
in the morning

1573
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,040
to wake me up.

1574
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,370
Had these claws

1575
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,370
that could tear a tin can.

1576
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,410
But he never hurt

1577
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,410
a living soul, that Pete,

1578
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,680
which was

1579
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,680
especially good news

1580
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,680
for all those mice

1581
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,470
that lived in my walls...
