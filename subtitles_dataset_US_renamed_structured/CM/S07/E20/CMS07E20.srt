1

we've never met before,

2
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:07,833
but there's something about him
that seemed familiar.

3
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,270
There.

4
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,185

when this was taken.

5
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:12,664
- So you two were close?

6
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,015
- Your father
never wanted you to know.

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:17,191
We were in love.

8
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,453
- There's a blue Impala.

9
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:20,716
Been idling there
for, like, 15 minutes.

10
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,326

11
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,849

has very strong ties

12
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:26,069

13
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,070

17
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:34,034
- Well, there's still some
state and criminal cases

18
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,165
going forward, but...

19
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:38,560
You've been awarded
$1.2 million.

20
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:42,042
- My offer's been accepted,
buying that building.

21
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,307
Oat milk, huh?

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,265
- Mm, it's supposed to be
better for the environment.

23
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,312
But still getting it in
a disposable cup, so...

24
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:53,923
- A bit of a wash.

25
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,881
- Small talking about coffee.

26
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:58,362
We've become those coworkers.

27
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:00,234
- We could always talk
about work.

28
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,366
Pulled a LEGO out
of a patient's nose last night.

29
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,846
- Oh, that's exciting stuff.

30
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,239
- The patient was 34 years old.

31
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:08,111
- Oh.
- Dr. Halstead.

32
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:10,548
Pleasant surprise.

36

Um, wow.

42

43

I love that.

44

00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:19,613
I need to press
on your tummy,

181
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,310
and you let me know if it
hurts, okay?

182
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,792
Anything?

183
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:27,011
What about now?

184
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,579
- Ow, that hurts.
Don't press anymore.

185
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:31,973
- I won't. I promise.

186
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:35,106
So, Eva, what is
your favorite food?

187
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,543
- Ice cream.

188
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,327
- Mmm, delicious.

189
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,765
If I brought you a big bowl
right now, would you eat it?

190
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:42,897
- I don't think I could.

191
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,594
It hurts too much.

192
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,335
- I get it.

193
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,250
I need to talk to your parents
for a minute.

194
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,297
An ultrasound will confirm,

195
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,604
but pretty sure
it's her appendix.

196
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:56,519
It needs to come out.

197
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,260
- So make a list
of everything you need...

198
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,131
ultrasound, other supplies...
and I'll have

199
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:01,829
Stefan bring them.

200
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:03,004
- I'm not a surgeon.

201
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:06,094
And we can't do
the operation here.

202
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,791
Eva needs the hospital.

203
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,053
- I'm more comfortable at home.

204
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,402
- Nikola.

205
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:11,752
It's Eva.

206
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,318
Listen to the doctor.

207
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:18,846
- Okay, what else?

208
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,500
I want the best surgeon.

209
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,414
And you're not leaving my side.

210
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,984
- Oh, fudge!

211
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,725
- I'll take over.
Thanks.

212
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,988
I'm Nurse Lockwood.
This is Dr. Asher, OBGYN.

213
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:32,599
- I'm Mary, uh, Morgan.

214
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:34,818
This is my... this is
my husband, Jesse.

215
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:35,993
- Nice to meet you both.

216
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,821
So Morgan,
how far along are you?

217
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:39,170
- 37 weeks?

218
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,737
- We're supposed to have
three more, right?

219
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:41,999
- Your first baby, huh?

220
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,871
- It's that obvious?
- Aww.

221
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:45,002
Good vitals.

222
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,569
Baby heart rate's 136.

223
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:47,744
- 136?

224
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:48,745
Is that good?

225
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:49,877
- It's excellent.

226
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,269
- There you go.

227
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:52,575
Morgan, has
your water broke yet?

228
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:53,881
- Uh, no.

229
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:55,883
But... but Jesse's been timing
the contractions.

230
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:57,362
- How far apart are they?

231
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,017
- Damn. I didn't push
the timer button.

232
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,062
I thought that I did.

233
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:01,976
- Pushing the button.

234
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,368
Timer's on.

235
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:04,674
- Okay Morgan, I'm going
to check you out, okay?

236
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,241
- Okay.

237
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,027
All right, you're about
5 centimeters dilated.

238
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:11,072
- What's that mean?

239
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:13,117
- Baby's on its way.

240
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:14,641
- Okay, Morgan,
do you have a birth plan?

241
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,294
I think I want to do
a natural childbirth

242
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:17,731
without drugs.

243
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,297
This is...

244
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,516
- Two minutes. Two minutes.

245
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,386
- All right, guys,
we're going to move

246
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,605
up to labor and delivery.

247
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,693
Go from there.

248
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,260
- Oh, God.

249
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,957
We're going to be
parents today.

250
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,045
- Morgan, Jessie,
I'm a midwife.

251
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,133
Would you like me
to stay with you?

252
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:30,178
- Yes!
- Yes.

253
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:31,745
- Okay. Okay.

254
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,401
- Mr. Henderson, Dr. Archer.

255
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:37,838
This is Dr. Choi.
- Morning.

256
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:38,882
- Miles.

257
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:39,883
My daughter, Anya.

258
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,189
Apologies for the mud bath.

259
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,843
We were doing
an obstacle course race,

260
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,627
you know.

261
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,411
Rope climb, army crawl...

262
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:47,891
- You know,
father-daughter bonding.

263
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:49,850
- Good, clean family fun.

264
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,460
- Yeah, it was till I fell.

265
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,157
Eh, just missed a handhold

266
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:54,637
and hit the ground
kind of funny.

267
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:56,247
- Yeah?
Can you flex up and down

268
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,162
for me?
- Yeah, yeah.

269
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,424
- As far as you can.

270
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:00,948
- Did you hit your head?

271
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,603
Experience any dizziness,
loss of consciousness?

272
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,429
- No. No.

273
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:05,735
Just a bruised ego.

274
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,607
- Well, I'll get
an x-ray to be sure,

275
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,478
but I think it's just a sprain.
- Cool.

276
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:10,914
- There's another race
in a couple of weeks.

277
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,220
Think he'll be ready?

278
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:13,482
- Well, hell yeah,
I'll be ready.

279
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:14,875
Come on.

280
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:16,398
- A tech will be by
with that x-ray in a minute.

281
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,660
- All right.
- Thank you.

282
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,270
- Thanks.

283
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,924
- It seems
pretty straightforward.

284
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,056
No surgery necessary.

285
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,927
So I'm going to peel off.

286
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,276
- Okay, Chief.

287
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,931
- Then my health is better?

288
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,106
- Yes.

289
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,760
Your donor screening labs,
overall,

290
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,109
have slightly improved.

291
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:35,852
But the numbers are still
not ideal for surgery.

292
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,593
- Is it a yes or a no?

293
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,464
- I still want
a pre-op clearance

294
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,118
from internal medicine
in cardiology,

295
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:42,729
but as of now, yes.

296
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:45,209
You can donate a portion
of your liver to Zeke.

297
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,255
- Oh, Zeke, it's
finally happening.

298
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:48,865
- Ms. Belkin?
- Yeah?

299
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,304
- It's important for you
to know that even though we've

300
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:55,132
approved the surgery,
the operation

301
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,568
hasn't gotten any simpler.

302
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,313
These situations
can be life-threatening.

303
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,880
- Understood.

304
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:06,883
But it's not my life I'm most
concerned about right now,

305
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:11,888
so whatever consent
you need, you have it.

306
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,282
- Okay.

307
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:15,631
Let's get you admitted.

308
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,763
- Okay.

309
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:19,940
I love you, honey.

310
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,289
- Love you too, Grandma.

311
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:26,816
♪

312
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,169
- Okay, Zeke, so this is
what's going to happen next.

313
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,650
- I don't think I can do this.

314
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,305
- Look, I know it's scary.

315
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:40,351
But Dr. Blake...
she's the absolute best.

316
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:41,831
You know, it'll
all be over soon,

317
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,877
and afterwards, you're going
to feel so much better.

318
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,574
- You don't understand.

319
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:48,882
My parents died of COVID.

320
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:51,058
And I think I gave it
to them because I wasn't

321
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:54,539
old enough to be vaccinated.

322
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,369
Now this operation... I could
kill my grandmother, too.

323
00:11:58,413 --> 00:11:59,675
- Hey, hey, hey.

324
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,111
That's not going to happen.

325
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,591
- You don't know that.

326
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:06,073
- Hey.

327
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:10,468
- I don't want to put
my grandma in danger...

328
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,949
but I don't want to die.

329
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,559
- Hey, hey, hey.

330
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,779
I don't want to die.

331
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,172
- It's okay, Zeke.

332
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:19,739
It's all right.

333
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:26,833
- And I'm not just tired.
I'm utterly exhausted.

334
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,139
But it's like all the time.

335
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:32,360
I'm also sore,
stiff, the works.

336
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,710
- And Dorian, how long
you've been feeling that way?

337
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,886
- Off and on for a few months.

338
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,540
I finally dragged myself
out of bed

339
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,759
to see what was going on.

340
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,804
And I hate hospitals.

341
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,501
But I heard
Maggie Lockwood works here,

342
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:46,287
so thought I'd give Med
the benefit of the doubt.

343
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,463
- Okay.
So you know Maggie?

344
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,378
- I haven't seen her
since high school.

345
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:51,553
But, yeah.

346
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,641
- No kidding?

347
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,034
Maggie's on a case upstairs,

348
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:55,252
but I can let her know
you're here.

349
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:56,297
- No.

350
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,081
No, that's... that's okay.

351
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,430
I don't want to bother her.

352
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,388
- Okay, so tell me.

353
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,868
What was Maggie like back then?

354
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:04,740
- Just a little whirlwind.

355
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,091
She was popular, valedictorian.

356
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,485
She ran every club back then.

357
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,095
- Yep. Sounds like Maggie.

358

00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:15,039
- Does not want
to take the suture.

536
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,390
Okay, let's try this again.

537
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,566
The vein is so friable.

538
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,045
It's like tissue paper.

539
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,699
Don't want it to tear.

540
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,571
- You through the vein wall?

541
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:28,227
- Coming out the other side.

542
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,532
Got it.

543
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:30,533
- Nice job.

544
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:31,969
- One suture.

545
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,668
Long way to go.

546
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,411
- You're
doing great, honey.

547
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:39,716
Just keep breathing.

548
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,414
- You keep breathing.

549
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,719
Oh, I changed my mind.

550
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:43,720
I can't do this.

551
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:44,721
I want the epidural.

552
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:45,766
- I'm sorry, Morgan.

553
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:46,767
We're way far past that point.

554
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,942
You're too deep into labor.

555
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:49,509
- Okay, a few more
big pushes, Morgan.

556
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:50,553
- Okay.

557
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:51,728
- Oh, my God.

558
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:52,860
That's a head.

559
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:55,732
- Now breathe out
and push.

560
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,560
Slow and steady.
Keep on pushing.

561
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:58,648
You got this.

562
00:20:58,692 --> 00:20:59,606
- Yeah, the head's out.

563
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:01,042
Head is out.

564
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,609
What?
Head went back in.

565
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:03,740
What happened?

566
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:05,133
- Okay, Maggie, turtle sign.

567
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,874
Get her in McRoberts,
apply suprapubic pressure.

568
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,310
- All right, Jesse.
I need you to step back.

569
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:09,703
The nurse is going
to take over for us.

570
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,661
- What's going on?
Is my baby okay?

571
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,097
- Yes, shoulders
are just stuck.

572
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,534
- Morgan,
on your next contraction,

573
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,623
I want you to push
exactly as you have been.

574
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,015
I'm going to push
from above

575
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,147
while Dr. Asher pulls
from below.

576
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,279
- Okay.
- Okay?

577
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,323
- Okay.

578
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,282
- Push.

579
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,805
That's it.

580
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,894
That's it, Morgan.
You're doing great.

581
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:29,070
Keep pushing.

582
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:31,768
- The baby's coming.

583
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,466
Yes!
Got him.

584
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,864
It's a boy.

585
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,649
- Oh, my God.

586
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,128
He's beautiful.

587
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:47,306
- He's enormous.

588
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,966
- So interest rates
are going up again.

589
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,446
You landed
your apartment building

590
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,447
just in time.

591
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,362
- I guess I got lucky.

592
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,494
- You still are.

593
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,322
Got a tenant for you.

594
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,845
- I'm not ready
for renters yet.

595
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,368
Units aren't even done.

596
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,109
- Think of it this way:
one less renter to find

597
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,458
is one less headache.

598
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:10,590
- Yeah, all right.

599
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:11,591
Send me their info.

600
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:12,635
- You already got it.

601
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,463
It's Dr. Asher.

602
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:15,464
- No.

603
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:18,424
Just not a good idea.

604
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,773
- All right.

605
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:21,557
But I'll keep looking.

606
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,864
We can figure out
the finder's fee later.

607
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,474
- Uh, no, Doris.

608
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,828
- Is that Miles' MRI?

609
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,221
- Yeah.

610
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:36,833
- Ah.

611
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,618
I'll back you up.

612
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:43,536
- Hey, Miles.

613
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:44,798
We got your results.

614
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,277
Where's Anya?

615
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,627
- Had to take a work call.

616
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,106
- Oh, we can wait for her.
- No, no, no.

617
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,107
It's fine.
It's fine.

618
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:52,066
I don't want to interrupt her.

619
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:55,069
It's a new job.

620
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:58,377
- Okay, so your MRI
revealed optical neuritis.

621
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,118
It's inflammation
of your eye that causes

622
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,946
discomfort and vision loss.

623
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,035
- Good news is, typically,
optical neuritis

624
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,211
will resolve on its own
with time.

625
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,996
- Good news implies there's...

626
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,607
there's bad news.

627
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:14,480
- The MRI also revealed
two small plaques

628
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:16,133
in your motor cortex.

629
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:18,309
Now, we'll run
some more tests to confirm,

630
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:20,529
but that finding plus neuritis,

631
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,139
I think it's likely
we're looking

632
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:23,576
at multiple sclerosis.

633
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,406
- Wow.

634
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,451
MS?

635
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:30,626
For real?

636
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,498
- I'm afraid so.

637
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,024
- That's muscular, right?

638
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:40,462
I'm going to lose
more than just a step.

639
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:44,597
I'm going to keep getting
weaker and weaker.

640
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,556
- When Anya comes back,
we can discuss

641
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,731
next steps to help you...

642
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:49,863
- No.

643
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,735
Do not tell my daughter.

644
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:55,999
- We won't.

645
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,438
Right, Dr. Choi?

646
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:06,401
♪

647
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,795
- Zeke?

648
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,579
- He's doing wonderfully.

649
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:13,060
- As soon as you're feeling up
to it, you can go visit him.

650
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,802
- He asked me
to give you a message.

651
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,456
You rock, Grandma.

652
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,199
Celeste?

653
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,505
- BPs dropping, 88 over 62.

654
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,680
- Celeste?

655
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:25,638
- Heart rate's on the rise.

656
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,727
134.

657
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,771
- Damn it.

658
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,164
She's bleeding.

659
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:31,513
Bolus a liter and then two
of blood, two of plasma.

660
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:32,514
Let's go.

661
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:33,776
- It's got to be
the hepatic vein.

662
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,431
Didn't hold the sutures.

663
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,998
We've got to open her back up.

664
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:46,310
- Clearly, they're not
discussing Miles' diagnosis.

665
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:48,530
- Maybe he's, you know,
still processing

666
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:51,141
or trying to find
the right words.

667
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,621
You know,
didn't want to scare her.

668
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:54,884
- Or he's just not
ever going to tell her.

669
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:58,453
The longer you hold on secrets,
the harder they are to admit.

670
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,324
My father took all
of his to the grave.

671
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,413
- I completely appreciate
where you're coming from.

672
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:05,242
But I mean, how he wants
to go about it...

673
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:06,592
kind of up to him, right?

674
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:10,204
- But it's a betrayal.

675
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:11,945
By keeping quiet,
he's doing to Anya

676
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,337
what my father did to me.

677
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:20,083
- Normal,
every single test.

678
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:21,607
- Yes.

679
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,914
I also did a CT head,
MRI and additional blood labs

680
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,263
for endocrine disorders.

681
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:28,352
And they were all normal too.

682
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,180
- I don't understand.
Is this good or bad?

683
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:31,660
- Right now, I don't know.
- You don't know.

684
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:33,357
You don't know.
I'm so tired of that answer.

685
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,664
- Dr. Scott, she's
over-breathing the vent.

686
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,840
RSBI is 50.

687
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,494
- What does that mean?

688
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,843
- Eva's breathing
well on her own again.

689
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:43,193
Eva, can you hear me?

690
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:45,544
Okay.
Set up the extubate.

691
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,502
- So she doesn't need
the machine anymore?

692
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,374
- No.
It doesn't appear so.

693
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,855
- And you don't know why
this happened either, do you?

694
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,074
- I don't.

695
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:56,163
I'll re-review her labs,
her history.

696
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,208
- That's backwards.

697
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:05,041
- Mrs. Corluka, you said
a doctor treated Eva

698
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:06,390
shortly after she was born.

699
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,566
But I don't see it
listed in the records.

700
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,306
- We didn't go to the hospital.

701
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,308
The doctor came to our home.

702
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,615
One night,
her SIDS monitor went off.

703
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:16,139
I went into her room,
picked her up,

704
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,488
but she was fine.

705
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,316
The doctor did an exam,
but found nothing.

706
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,623
It never happened again.

707
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,190
- SIDS monitor.

708
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,366
You know, I'd like
to run one more test:

709
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:27,194
an exome sequencing analysis.

710
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:28,630
- What is that?

711
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:31,285
- It's a genetic test
that targets proteins.

712
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:32,982
I think it might provide us
with some answers.

713
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:36,464
But it is expensive
and can sometimes cause issues

714

716
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,167

717
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:54,787
- Dr. Choi.

718
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,136
Have a minute?

719
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,441
- Of course.

720
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:58,878
- I know my dad.

721
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:01,532
And whenever he's keeping
something from me, he says,

722
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,709
"Everything's fine."

723
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,928
He's saying that about his MRI.

724
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:08,539
It makes me worried
that it's not.

725
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,455
- I'm sorry, Anya,
but I can't disclose anything.

726
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:12,935
HIPAA rules.

727
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:14,458
- I guess I just have
to trust

728
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:16,112
that he's telling me the truth.

729
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:21,465
- Anya, you know,
with your dad's vision trouble,

730
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,859
he might need you
to help with the fine print.

731
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:26,079
You know what the CARES Act is?

732
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:27,254
- No.

733
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:30,649
- It requires hospitals
to give access

734
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,912
to patient medical records.

735
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:36,306
This is linked to their portal.

736
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,745
Maybe you can help your dad
put in his personal information

737
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:41,964

Okay.

00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:50,320
Thanks.

- Central hypoventilation
syndrome, CCHS,

770

is a non-inherited gene
mutation that affects

771
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,156
the autonomic nervous system.

772
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,638
In Eva's case, her brain forgot
to tell her body how deeply

773
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,553
or how often to breathe.

- Well, she had been
getting by.

777
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:38,733
But today,
with the appendectomy,

778
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,344
she needed extra oxygen
to come out of anesthesia.

779
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:43,520
She couldn't do it.

780

But there are treatments.

Eva's case is mild.

784

most vulnerable

a ventilation machine

896
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:20,379
- Yeah, it's been a long day.

897
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:21,815
I just want to go home.

898
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:23,773
- Pamela, what's going on?

899
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,427
I know I hurt you
after surgery.

900
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:27,821
Just a bit vague on how.

901
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,388
- It's not you, it's me.

902
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:30,389
- Oh.

903
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,433
Well, thank you.

904
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:32,478
That clears up everything.

905
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,175
Come on, Pamela, talk to me.

906
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:37,178
If I... if I've done
something, just tell me.

907
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:38,658
- I told you,
it's not you, it's me.

908
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:40,355
It's literally me.

909
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:44,142
The clip didn't hold
because I didn't engage it

910
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,883
tightly enough.

911
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:49,321
I couldn't engage it.

912
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:50,974
- What do you mean couldn't?

913
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,370
- My hand at rest.

914
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:56,980
Rock steady.

915
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:59,896
But when I pinch
my fingers together...

916
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:08,905
There's something wrong
with my hand, Crockett.

917
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:12,909
There's something really wrong.

918
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:15,695
- Hey. Hey. It's okay.

919
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:27,576
- Thank you.

920
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,970
Oh, hey, I was hoping
I'd catch up with you.

921
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:31,972
When you get
your schedule tomorrow,

922
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:34,148
let's find time
for another practice session.

923
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:36,629
- Okay.

924
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:39,458
- Listen, um, I realize

925
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:41,634
that I haven't fully expressed

926
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:44,506
my gratitude
for all that you've done.

927
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,380
You're still bearing the brunt
of the consequences,

928
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:51,252
and I'm the one
that got you into this mess.

929
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:54,647
So thank you.

930
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,910
- Appreciate that.

931
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:00,000
I also appreciate you
not congratulating me

932
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,306
on my apartment building.

933
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,308
- What?

934
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:06,267
- Well, that's been
the takeaway for most people.

935
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,008
- Huh.

936
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,749
Don't listen to them.

937
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,490
You're a good man,
Will Halstead.

938
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:12,491
You stepped up.

939
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:15,972
But then, you always do.

940
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:29,290
- Looking for an apartment?
- Yep.

941
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:32,424
A few decent ones.
We'll see.

942
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,383
- You know, my units
aren't totally done yet.

943
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:38,473
- Oh.

944
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:40,475
- Actually, one is livable.

945
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:43,261
Just needs a coat of paint.

946
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:45,872
But if you want it, it's yours.

947
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,526
- I don't know.
That's...

948
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,005
- What?

949
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:51,834
- Are you sure?

950
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:53,532
- Yeah.

951
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:54,794
Yeah, I'm sure.

952
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:57,840
- Well, then okay.

953
00:37:57,884 --> 00:38:00,408
Yeah.

954
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:02,323
Thank you.

955
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,673
- Yeah, we'll sort
the lease out tomorrow.

956
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:06,806
And I'll get you the keys then.

957
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,161
You should know,
I'll be across the hall.

958
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:15,554
So...

959
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:19,384
- So... neighbors?

960
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:21,211
- Neighbors.

961
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:26,260
- Thank you.

962
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,568
- Hey, I think you know
my patient in four.

963
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:30,743
- I do?

964
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:31,874
- You went
to high school with him.

965
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:33,093
Dorian Harwell.

966
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,095
- Oh, my God.
Dorian Harwell.

967
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:38,403
I haven't seen him in 25 years.

968
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:39,447
Is he all right?

969
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:40,535
- He had
a grade 1 glioma.

970
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:41,754
Waiting on
a neurosurgeon consult,

971
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:43,277
but his prognosis is good.

972
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,931
- Is he okay to see visitors?
- Uh-huh.

973
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:46,019
- Okay.
- Maggie.

974
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:47,368
- Yeah?
- Um...

975
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:52,330
Is he my father?

976
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,593
- Oh, sweetie, no.

977
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,290
- Okay.

978
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:01,426
But if he isn't, then who is?

979
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,166
- You've never asked me
that before.

980
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,472
- I know.

981
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,909
But just meeting Dorian,
it just made me think.

982
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,783
- I'm sorry, Vanessa.

983
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:12,175
But I can't tell you.

984
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:14,787
Your biological father
and I agreed

985
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,963
that we would never
contact you.

986
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:18,704
I broke that agreement,

987
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:23,317
but I can't make
that choice for him.

988
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,840
- But maybe you could
just reach out and ask him

989
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:25,885
if he'd like to meet me.

990
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:28,627

We didn't stay in touch.

Anya got to hear

Miles' reasons for withholding
the truth from her.

1003
