1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:04,047
.

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:06,267
- Oh, my God.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,659
Is this why you ended things
with me?

4
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,139
- Ended things with you?

5
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,489
Did you go out
with my daughter?

6
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,491
- There are several tumors.
- Is it malignant?

7
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:16,016
- We'll send the tissue
for pathology.

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,408
- Is that your wedding ring?

9
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:19,062
- The Chief of ED
at Andrew's hospital

10
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,324
is retiring.

11
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:21,804
Andrew wants
to put me up for the job.

12
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:24,589
- It's been nice, you know,
having my old rival back.

13
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,592
But, uh, you gotta do
what's right for you.

14
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:29,768
- Is my 5:30 Thursday
still available?

15
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,336
- I'm trying to lighten
my patient load.

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,860
- I deserve a little more
of an explanation.

17
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,080
After 20 years, I don't--
I don't make the cut?

18
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:40,736
- I have developed feelings
for you, Daniel.

19
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:45,132
- Thank you.

20
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,525
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, there.

21
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,961
- I was just on my--
- What are you doing?

22
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,354
You go.

23
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,356
- I'm on my way up
to Medical Records.

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,010
Need to sign a few charts.

25
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,316
- Nice to see you.

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,882
- Have a good day.

27
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,540
- Hey. Hey, Lonnie?

28
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,587
Look, I accept the fact

29
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,892
that you can't
treat me anymore,

30
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,851
and I--I respect that.

31
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:10,287
But, I--it's also--

32
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:12,507
it's important
for me to tell you

33
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,076
that--that the--
the work we did together?

34
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,514
Um, you really helped me.
A lot.

35
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:23,083
And I wanted
to thank you for it.

36
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,258
- I appreciate that, Dan.

37
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,174
Okay, take care.

38
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:31,482
- Hey.

39
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:37,227
Daniel?
- Hey.

40
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,577
- You seeing her
in person again, huh?

41
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:42,276
- No, you know,
she, um--she dumped me.

42
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,842
- She's been your therapist
for years.

43
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,627
What happened?

44
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,585
- She developed feelings
for me.

45
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,893
- Feelings?
- Yeah, romantic feelings, man.

46
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,155
- She give you a referral?

47
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,809
- Well, sure, but I mean,
you know,

48
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:57,247
changing shrinks is not
exactly like changing sneakers.

49
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,423
You know?
- True, true.

50
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,860
Are you okay?
-  Yeah.

51
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,342
How're you doing?

52
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:08,432
- You know, I think
I left my phone in the car.

53
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,652
Look, I'm going
to be here all day,

54
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,306
so if you want
to talk some more...

55
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,698
- I'm fine.

56
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,787
But thank you,
and I'll see you around.

57
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:17,180
- All right.

58
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,273
- You're going to T2.
Thank you.

59
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,624
- Hey, biopsy results
come back yet?

60
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,322
- Not yet,
but the lab promises

61
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:31,629
that sometime today.

62
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,892
- You know there's
a good chance it's benign.

63
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:36,460
- I'm not so sure.

64
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:39,202
I had cancer before.
- Oh.

65
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,595
- It's just--

66
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,381
- You're afraid
your cancer's come back.

67
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,907
- breathing shakily]

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,261
- Chest sounds good.

69
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,872
X-rays, a lot better.

70
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:58,439
As long as he continues
to improve,

71
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,092
I don't see any reason why
we can't discharge him.

72
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:02,225
- Oh.
- It still hurts.

73
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:05,315
- Yeah, well, pneumonia's
no joke, D-man.

74
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,403
Look, I'ma give your mom
some medicine

75
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,275
to make you feel better, okay?

76
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,281
Due to his pneumonia,

77
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,325
it'll be a couple weeks
before he can

78
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,023
go back on chemo.
- Okay.

79
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,851
- Any word from Terrell?

80
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,244
- No.

81
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,812
And he's never stayed away
this long.

82
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:24,856
This isn't like him.

83
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:29,861
- Thank you.
- Sure.

84
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,082
- Morning, Ms. Goodwin.

85
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,301
- Dr. Shentu.

86
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,216
- Seems like the Med staff
is adapting well

87
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,652
to our new guidelines.

88
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,088
- Yournew guidelines.

89
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,698
And you really think so?

90
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,265
- In any case,
I appreciate the cooperation.

91
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,919
- My God, look out!

92
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:52,275
Please, help me!
- We got you.

93
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,711
It's okay, it's okay.

94
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:56,323
- I need a 911
and the emergency response team

95
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,889
out front, main entrance.

96
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:02,067
Single vehicle crash,
driver responsive.

97
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,809
The patient's car
hit a concrete barrier.

98
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,289
The airbag deployed,

99
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,986
but no visible signs of injury.

100
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,074
Heart rate's steady.

101
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,728
- Having a lot
of generalized pain.

102
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:12,469
- Okay, everyone,
let's get ready.

103
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,079
Got it? On my count.

104
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:16,430
One, two, three.

105
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:18,736
Okay, let's get a cannula
and IV in.

106
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,303
Let's put her up on a monitor,
draw trauma labs.

107
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,522
We need x-rays stat.

108
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,871
- Yup.
- Dr. Shentu.

109
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,442
- BP 95/65.

110
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,531
- Heart rate and sats
not picking up.

111
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,359
Cycle it again.

112
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,318
- Clear.

113
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,408
- Chest is okay.

114
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,628
No hemo or pneumothorax.
Mediastinum is normal.

115
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,978
Ultrasound? Thank you.

116
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,157
Fast is negative.

117
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,550
- Got an ID.

118
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:50,942
Name's Gia Lindahl.

119
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,553
- I can see
if there's a history.

120
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,206
- She's too distracted
to clear her C-spine.

121
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,512
Let's keep
the collar on for now.

122
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:57,297
- Dr. Shentu, pupils?

123
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,820
- Yeah. Spare penlight?

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,567
Pupils equal and reactive.
Little sluggish.

125
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,351
- Ms. Lindahl,
can you hear me?

126
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,961
- Ms. Lindahl?

127
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,528
GCS 12.

128
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:12,790
- She is a patient here.

129
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,444
One of the first
we treated for COVID.

130
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,490
Been back a few times
with long-haul symptoms.

131
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,926
- Give her 50 mics
of fentanyl.

132
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,231
Let's get a pelvis x-ray,

133
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,711
and let's send her up to CT
for a pan scan,

134
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,147
and make sure we add
a tox to her blood and urine.

135
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,323
- Yep.

136
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,196
- Dr. Shentu, why don't
you see this through?

137
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,893
- Uh, certainly.

138
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,939
- And Dr. Taylor,
you run point.

139
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:33,158
Doris, let's get the doctor
a pair of scrubs.

140
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,638
- Okay.

141
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,991
- Did you just assign
the compliance officer

142
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,297
to a medical case?

143
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,777
- He's a critical care doctor

144
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,474
who's credentialed at Med.

145
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,607
- He's a bureaucrat.
A suit.

146
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,913
- Nevertheless, I know
you'll be accommodating.

147
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:52,830
- Yeah, do me a favor,
keep me briefed

148
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:55,180
on Dr. Shentu's
performance today.

149
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,486
- Sure.

150
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,536
♪

151
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:06,366
.

152
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,976
Oh, God.

153
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,761
Why does my body
feel like it's on fire?

154
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,197
- Given everything we've seen,

155
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:14,765
we think you have a condition
called fibromyalgia.

156
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,506
Let's give her
another 50 of fentanyl.

157
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,815
Fibromyalgia?

158
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,425
- We've seen it
in long-haul COVID patients

159
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,775
like yourself; there's
even a name, "Fibro-COVID."

160
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,342
- What causes it?

161
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,344
- We think it's due
to a problem in the way

162
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,650
that the spinal cord
and the brain

163
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:30,868
process pain signals.

164
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:31,869
It's not life-threatening,
but it is--

165
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:33,610
- It's terrible.

166
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:35,264
- We need
a rheumatology consult,

167
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:36,700
but for right now,
we're giving you

168
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:38,006
more pain meds
so you can get some rest,

169
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:38,963
all right?

170
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,008
- The good news, Gia?

171
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,313
According to your scans,

172
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:42,967
there were no serious injuries
with your crash.

173
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,796
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,277
I should have never
driven myself.

175
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,279
- Dr. Taylor and I are
just happy you're safe

176
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:51,759
and getting
the treatment you need.

177
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,115
- Fibromyalgia.
- That's tough.

178
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,290

FDA-approved for fibromyalgia.

185

And per your new mandates,

187
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,222
our doctors can't prescribe
off-label meds

188

the situation

and we'll make sure
you get out of here.

531
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:14,463
- Living arrangements all set.

532
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:18,337
And a van is on the way
to pick you up.

533
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,860
- Thank you, Dr. Charles.

534
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:22,819
- You know, Terri,

535
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,995
there's something
that I've been curious about.

536
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,867
- Yeah?

537
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,609
- When you checked yourself
into a hospital

538
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,872
where you knew
that Stevie worked,

539
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:34,091
you had to think
that eventually

540
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:37,007
she was gonna find out
that you were here.

541
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:38,182
- I did.

542
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,272
I--I wanted to be
near her,

543
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,927
and I thought

544
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:45,799
eventually I would want
to see her.

545
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:47,975
- But...

546
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:51,370
- The better I got,

547
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:55,330
the more I felt I was
turning my life around,

548
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,114
the less I wanted to see her.

549
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:59,116
Does that sound terrible?

550
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,683
- No.

551
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,598
- I love my daughter.

552
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:07,255
I--I do,
but she can be negative.

553
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,998
Even if she doesn't say it,

554
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,522
Stevie always thinks I'll fail.

555
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,437
I know I've given her
plenty of reasons

556
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:18,397
to think that, but--

557
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,965
- Not necessarily something
you need right now.

558
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,663
- No.

559
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:31,018
- Ah, Dr. Shentu.

560
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,411
You know, I heard
about your inability

561
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,455
to treat your patient.

562
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,631
But hey,
you stand by your rules.

563
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:36,893
Somebody's gotta set
an example.

564
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:40,854
- Dr. Shentu?
Dr. Taylor needs you.

565
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,379
- I decided
to scan her heart again

566
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,468
just to be sure, and look.

567
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:47,948
You can see
the beginning stages of--

568
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,080
- Diastolic collapse
of the right ventricle.

569
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:52,431
- It's a sign of impending
cardiac tamponade.

570
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,869
- Congratulations,
her condition is now emergent.

571
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:57,610
We can perform
the pericardiocentesis

572
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,655
without consent.
Doris, bolus fluids.

573
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:02,832
Add 125 milligrams
of solumedrol,

574
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,008
and set up a pericardial tap.

575
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:10,013
- Heart rate 145,
BP 88/48.

576
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,058
- She's tanking.

577

♪

578
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,195
What do you think?

579
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,240
Maybe this could
have been avoided?

580

- Come on in.

583
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:37,824
- Um, my mom...

584
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:40,783
was, uh, was she bipolar
her whole life?

585
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,959
- The disorder does tend
to be genetic,

586
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,787
but it doesn't usually present

587
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:48,008
till late teens, early 20s.

588
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:50,358
- And the drinking? The drugs?

589
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:54,014
- Most likely an attempt
to self-medicate her condition.

590
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:55,189
You know, problem is,

591
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,496
it just invariably
makes it worse.

592
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,108
- I used to get
so angry at her.

593
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:03,676
I thought she was
a drug addict.

594
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,808
- Happens all the time.

595
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,070
You know, a, uh,

596
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:10,117
a psychiatric illness
goes undiagnosed,

597
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,163
people just assume
that it's an addiction issue.

598
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:16,558
- I thought the drinking,
drugs, were the cause,

599
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:19,343
not the other way around.

600
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:20,823
- I mean, situations like that,

601
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,564
they can, in a strange way,

602
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,828
turn into kind of a--
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

603
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:30,964
- Yeah, I'm always just, uh,

604
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,488
waiting for her
to fall apart again.

605
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,056
- Well, of course you are,
because that's what she did

606

over and over again
your entire life.

607
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:43,585
Stevie, you gotta try
and take it easy on yourself.

608
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,979
I think you should be
giving yourself credit for...

609
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:50,200
Recognizing the importance
of seeing

610
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:52,028
somebody that you love
in a new way.

♪

612
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:06,390
- Okay, um, so if you do
have to stop working,

613
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,610
you'll want
a risk-averse portfolio.

614
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:11,047
So I'd--I'd get you
out of the mutual funds

615
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,876
and put you in dividend stocks,

616
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,009
and, uh, maybe an annuity.

Yeah.

Thank you.

I've had cancer before.

Okay.

Everybody.

637
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,643
Just some of us know it
more than others.

638
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,560
In a way, we're the lucky ones.

in the ICU for observation,

646
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:05,466
and tomorrow you'll be
transferred to Rheumatology.

647

There they'll work up a plan
to address your fibromyalgia.

- Okay.

649

Ms. Goodwin,
about the, uh, directives

650
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:22,526
that I recently implemented,

651
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,572
I think some of them
might be too stringent,

652
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:27,923
given the frenzied nature
of an ED.

653
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,751
I will adjust them accordingly.

654
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,579
- If you think that's best.

655
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:39,282
- Ah, well played, Ms. Goodwin.
Well played.

656
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:42,024
I'm assuming that was
the precise outcome

657
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,069
you were hoping for
when you assigned

658
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:44,548
Dr. Shentu to the case?

659
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:48,204
- Dr. Archer,
you have a devious mind.

660
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:49,815
- Maybe not as devious
as yours.

661
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:53,775
- What kind of person
even becomes

662
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:56,038
a compliance officer, anyway?

663
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,779
- He's a good guy.

664
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:00,173
And a good doctor.

665
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,914

666
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,480
Look at you.
