1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:04,047
.

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:06,267
- Oh, my God.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,659
Is this why you ended things
with me?

4
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,139
- Ended things with you?

5
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,489
Did you go out
with my daughter?

6
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,491
- There are several tumors.
- Is it malignant?

7
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:16,016
- We'll send the tissue
for pathology.

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,408
- Is that your wedding ring?

9
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:19,062
- The Chief of ED
at Andrew's hospital

10
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,324
is retiring.

11
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:21,804
Andrew wants
to put me up for the job.

12
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:24,589
- It's been nice, you know,
having my old rival back.

13
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,592
But, uh, you gotta do
what's right for you.

14
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:29,768
- Is my 5:30 Thursday
still available?

15
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,336
- I'm trying to lighten
my patient load.

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,860
- I deserve a little more
of an explanation.

17
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,080
After 20 years, I don't--
I don't make the cut?

18
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:40,736
- I have developed feelings
for you, Daniel.

19
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:45,132
- Thank you.

20
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,525
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, there.

21
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,961
- I was just on my--
- What are you doing?

22
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,354
You go.

23
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,356
- I'm on my way up
to Medical Records.

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,010
Need to sign a few charts.

25
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,316
- Nice to see you.

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,882
- Have a good day.

27
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,540
- Hey. Hey, Lonnie?

28
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,587
Look, I accept the fact

29
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,892
that you can't
treat me anymore,

30
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,851
and I--I respect that.

31
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:10,287
But, I--it's also--

32
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:12,507
it's important
for me to tell you

33
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,076
that--that the--
the work we did together?

34
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,514
Um, you really helped me.
A lot.

35
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:23,083
And I wanted
to thank you for it.

36
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,258
- I appreciate that, Dan.

37
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,174
Okay, take care.

38
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:31,482
- Hey.

39
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:37,227
Daniel?
- Hey.

40
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,577
- You seeing her
in person again, huh?

41
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:42,276
- No, you know,
she, um--she dumped me.

42
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,842
- She's been your therapist
for years.

43
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,627
What happened?

44
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,585
- She developed feelings
for me.

45
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,893
- Feelings?
- Yeah, romantic feelings, man.

46
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,155
- She give you a referral?

47
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,809
- Well, sure, but I mean,
you know,

48
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:57,247
changing shrinks is not
exactly like changing sneakers.

49
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,423
You know?
- True, true.

50
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,860
Are you okay?
-  Yeah.

51
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,342
How're you doing?

52
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:08,432
- You know, I think
I left my phone in the car.

53
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,652
Look, I'm going
to be here all day,

54
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,306
so if you want
to talk some more...

55
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,698
- I'm fine.

56
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,787
But thank you,
and I'll see you around.

57
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:17,180
- All right.

58
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,273
- You're going to T2.
Thank you.

59
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,624
- Hey, biopsy results
come back yet?

60
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,322
- Not yet,
but the lab promises

61
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:31,629
that sometime today.

62
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,892
- You know there's
a good chance it's benign.

63
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:36,460
- I'm not so sure.

64
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:39,202
I had cancer before.
- Oh.

65
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,595
- It's just--

66
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,381
- You're afraid
your cancer's come back.

67
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,907
- breathing shakily]

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,261
- Chest sounds good.

69
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,872
X-rays, a lot better.

70
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:58,439
As long as he continues
to improve,

71
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,092
I don't see any reason why
we can't discharge him.

72
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:02,225
- Oh.
- It still hurts.

73
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:05,315
- Yeah, well, pneumonia's
no joke, D-man.

74
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,403
Look, I'ma give your mom
some medicine

75
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,275
to make you feel better, okay?

76
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,281
Due to his pneumonia,

77
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,325
it'll be a couple weeks
before he can

78
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,023
go back on chemo.
- Okay.

79
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,851
- Any word from Terrell?

80
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,244
- No.

81
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,812
And he's never stayed away
this long.

82
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:24,856
This isn't like him.

83
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:29,861
- Thank you.
- Sure.

84
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,082
- Morning, Ms. Goodwin.

85
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,301
- Dr. Shentu.

86
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,216
- Seems like the Med staff
is adapting well

87
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,652
to our new guidelines.

88
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,088
- Yournew guidelines.

89
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,698
And you really think so?

90
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,265
- In any case,
I appreciate the cooperation.

91
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,919
- My God, look out!

92
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:52,275
Please, help me!
- We got you.

93
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,711
It's okay, it's okay.

94
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:56,323
- I need a 911
and the emergency response team

95
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,889
out front, main entrance.

96
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:02,067
Single vehicle crash,
driver responsive.

97
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,809
The patient's car
hit a concrete barrier.

98
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,289
The airbag deployed,

99
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,986
but no visible signs of injury.

100
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,074
Heart rate's steady.

101
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,728
- Having a lot
of generalized pain.

102
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:12,469
- Okay, everyone,
let's get ready.

103
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,079
Got it? On my count.

104
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:16,430
One, two, three.

105
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:18,736
Okay, let's get a cannula
and IV in.

106
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,303
Let's put her up on a monitor,
draw trauma labs.

107
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,522
We need x-rays stat.

108
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,871
- Yup.
- Dr. Shentu.

109
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,442
- BP 95/65.

110
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,531
- Heart rate and sats
not picking up.

111
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,359
Cycle it again.

112
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,318
- Clear.

113
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,408
- Chest is okay.

114
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,628
No hemo or pneumothorax.
Mediastinum is normal.

115
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,978
Ultrasound? Thank you.

116
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,157
Fast is negative.

117
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,550
- Got an ID.

118
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:50,942
Name's Gia Lindahl.

119
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,553
- I can see
if there's a history.

120
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,206
- She's too distracted
to clear her C-spine.

121
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,512
Let's keep
the collar on for now.

122
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:57,297
- Dr. Shentu, pupils?

123
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,820
- Yeah. Spare penlight?

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,567
Pupils equal and reactive.
Little sluggish.

125
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,351
- Ms. Lindahl,
can you hear me?

126
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,961
- Ms. Lindahl?

127
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,528
GCS 12.

128
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:12,790
- She is a patient here.

129
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,444
One of the first
we treated for COVID.

130
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,490
Been back a few times
with long-haul symptoms.

131
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,926
- Give her 50 mics
of fentanyl.

132
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,231
Let's get a pelvis x-ray,

133
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,711
and let's send her up to CT
for a pan scan,

134
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,147
and make sure we add
a tox to her blood and urine.

135
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,323
- Yep.

136
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,196
- Dr. Shentu, why don't
you see this through?

137
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,893
- Uh, certainly.

138
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,939
- And Dr. Taylor,
you run point.

139
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:33,158
Doris, let's get the doctor
a pair of scrubs.

140
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,638
- Okay.

141
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,991
- Did you just assign
the compliance officer

142
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,297
to a medical case?

143
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,777
- He's a critical care doctor

144
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,474
who's credentialed at Med.

145
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,607
- He's a bureaucrat.
A suit.

146
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,913
- Nevertheless, I know
you'll be accommodating.

147
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:52,830
- Yeah, do me a favor,
keep me briefed

148
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:55,180
on Dr. Shentu's
performance today.

149
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,486
- Sure.

150
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,536
â™ª

151
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:06,366
.

152
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,976
Oh, God.

153
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,761
Why does my body
feel like it's on fire?

154
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,197
- Given everything we've seen,

155
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:14,765
we think you have a condition
called fibromyalgia.

156
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,506
Let's give her
another 50 of fentanyl.

157
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,815
Fibromyalgia?

158
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,425
- We've seen it
in long-haul COVID patients

159
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,775
like yourself; there's
even a name, "Fibro-COVID."

160
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,342
- What causes it?

161
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,344
- We think it's due
to a problem in the way

162
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,650
that the spinal cord
and the brain

163
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:30,868
process pain signals.

164
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:31,869
It's not life-threatening,
but it is--

165
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:33,610
- It's terrible.

166
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:35,264
- We need
a rheumatology consult,

167
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:36,700
but for right now,
we're giving you

168
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:38,006
more pain meds
so you can get some rest,

169
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:38,963
all right?

170
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,008
- The good news, Gia?

171
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,313
According to your scans,

172
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:42,967
there were no serious injuries
with your crash.

173
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,796
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,277
I should have never
driven myself.

175
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,279
- Dr. Taylor and I are
just happy you're safe

176
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:51,759
and getting
the treatment you need.

177
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,115
- Fibromyalgia.
- That's tough.

178
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,290
- Yeah.

179
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,205
So how are you thinking
of treating her?

180
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,425
- There's data on patients
responding very well

181
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,644
to Xyrem.
- Xyrem?

182
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:11,866
As I recall, it's not
FDA-approved for fibromyalgia.

183
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,128
- Right.
- Yeah, it's only approved

184
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:14,695
for cataplexy and narcolepsy.

185
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,000
We'd be using it off-label.

186
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,306
And per your new mandates,

187
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,222
our doctors can't prescribe
off-label meds

188
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,876
without the patient's consent.

189
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,921
- And she's sedated now,
so she can't.

190
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,880
- Well, then as soon
as she wakes,

191
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:27,490
we'll, uh, explain
the situation

192
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,274
and ask for consent.

193
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,973
- Yeah, seems like
your only option.

194
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:37,979
- Dr. Scott!

195
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,110
I understand we're doing
a transplant

196
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:40,460
on a patient of yours.
- Yeah, yeah.

197
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,418
I was glad you and Dr. Blake
got the case, man.

198
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,637
- Well, we're gonna take
good care of her, all right?

199
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,116
- Thank you.

200
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,510
- Dylan, I could use
an extra set of hands in here.

201
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,947
- 30-something male. GCS 10.

202
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:52,602
He was found passed out
in the street, inebriated.

203
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,169
Right arm swollen
and discolored.

204
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,084
- Terrell.
- You know him?

205
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,564
- Yeah, since we were kids.

206
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,000
His son's a patient upstairs.

207
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,610
- Paramedics gave Narcan
in the field,

208
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,916
but zero response.

209
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,440
Still hypothermic.
- Terrell, you hear me?

210
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,575
â™ª

211
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,533
- Get away from me.

212
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:11,665
- Look, I'm just trying
to help, man.

213
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,580
- Not you.

214
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:14,755
- All right, he's rousable.

215
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,408
Let's get this board
out of here.

216
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,280
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

217
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,718
- Temp's 93.

218
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:22,676
- All right,
let's swap this out

219
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:23,894
for one of our warmer blankets.

220
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:26,810
And get him a liter
of NS on the warmer.

221
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:28,595
Right arm's pretty tight.

222
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:29,944
Hand's cold.

223
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,902
Can't feel distal, ulnar,
or radial pulse.

224
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,209
- Compartment syndrome.

225
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,515
Heart's a little tachy.

226
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:38,648
- Foley output.
5cc's of dark urine.

227
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,781
- Dead muscle's
causing him to go into rhabdo.

228
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,086
- Could be disaster
for his kidneys.

229
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,479
- He needs a fasciotomy.
Call Dr. Archer.

230
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,307
- On it.

231
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:52,270
â™ª

232
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:53,968
- Hey.

233
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,099
Any history you can share?

234
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,145
Help us treat him?

235
00:08:57,188 --> 00:09:00,017
- Terrell's kind of a mystery.

236
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:02,542
When we were kids,
he was funny, smart.

237
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,673
Then he drops out,

238
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,980
starts hanging
with the wrong crowd.

239
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:08,548
After that,
things went downhill.

240
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,290
- It's tough to see
a life fall apart.

241
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,772
- He's been MIA for a while.

242
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,339
I'm gonna go tell
his wife he's here.

243
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,384
- Yeah.
- All right, thanks.

244
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,651
- Morning.

245
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,827
- Hey.

246
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,568
- Here you go.

247
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:29,960
I hear that Stevie's
going back to Michigan

248
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,005
to be with her husband?

249
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,441
- Yeah, so?

250
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,010
Don't start with me.

251
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,839
Where is Trini?

252
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,014
- They're short-staffed
at the ICU.

253
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,668
She's covering.
- Well, I need her.

254
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,539
She's supposed to make
a house call with me.

255
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,323
- Oh. I'll go.

256
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,890
- Trini knows the patient,
you don't.

257
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,370
- What?

258
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:49,763
Am I not the nurse
with more experience

259
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,634
than anyone else down here?

260
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,505
- Sorry, Nurse Lockwood.
I'm sure you've seen it all.

261
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:54,811
I'm grateful
for your assistance.

262
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,857
- Huh.

263
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,207
Charge Nurse Lockwood.

264
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,426
You're in a good mood.
- So are you.

265
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,211
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,430
- Dr. Hammer.
Good news, huh?

267
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:08,782
- What's that?
- Your mom.

268
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,044
I was just up
in the Psych Ward.

269
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,959
I saw
that they're discharging her.

270
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,438
- Oh, right. Yeah.

271
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:22,404
Kind of put them
in their separate corners,

272
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,014
but other than that--
- My mother's here?

273
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,059
Why didn't you tell me?

274
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:27,365
- I couldn't.
- Why?

275
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,368
- Because she gave me
express orders not to.

276
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,631
- Well, this doesn't
make any sense.

277
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:32,893
Did you commit her?

278
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:34,503
- I'm sorry, I can't
discuss that with you.

279
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,678
- She's my mother!

280
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:36,940
- Doesn't matter, Stevie.

281
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,986
She's a patient here,
and she has rights.

282
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,248
- Okay, where is she?

283
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,902
- Stevie--
- This is ridiculous.

284
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,251
- Come on.

285
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:44,644
Are you really gonna
make me call security?

286
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:51,651
â™ª

287
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:56,743
- Terri, good morning.

288
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,223
Um.

289
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:02,618
So Stevie found out
that you're here.

290
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,967
- How is she?

291
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,926
- She's a little confused.

292
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,797
Right? She's--she's angry.

293
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,800
She's--she's hurt.

294
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,497
But, um...

295
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,151
how would you like
to handle this?

296
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:15,631
What--what would you like
me to tell her?

297
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,158
- Wait here, please.

298
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,209
- What's up?

299
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,603
- Nothing.

300
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:34,563
Nice.

301
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,436
- Patient's
a financial planner.

302
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,048
He's, uh, done well.
- Mm.

303
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,398
- Dr. Halstead.
- Hey, Lenny.

304
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,793
This is Maggie Lockwood,
our charge nurse.

305
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,795
- Hey.

306
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,405
Ellis is ready.

307
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,497
- Ellis, hi.
- Hey.

308
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,455
Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

309
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,631
I want you to meet my friend,
Maggie Lockwood.

310
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,766
- My pleasure, Maggie.

311
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,202
- Hi.

312
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:11,208
â™ª

313
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:14,995
.

314
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:18,389
- When I was bathing him
this morning, he looked paler.

315
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,348
- I normally have
a healthy glow.

316
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,610
- Okay.

317
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,046
Well, we're gonna need
to open the box

318
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,178
so I can take a look.

319
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:25,614
- Can't be for long.

320
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:29,531
- Polio paralyzed
Ellis's diaphragm

321
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:30,793
and intercostal muscles,

322
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,621
so without the respirator,

323
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:35,102
every breath requires
conscious effort.

324
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,538
- Polio.

325
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,800
- Contracted it
when he was five,

326
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,454
a month
before the vaccine came out.

327
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:40,716
- Good timing, eh?

328
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,804
- Turning it off.

329
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:52,641
â™ª

330
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:55,339
- Those were my ward mates.

331
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,993
- Ellis has been
in the iron lung

332
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,560
for 60 years.

333
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:02,477
- 63.
But who's counting?

334
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,174
- He's also instructed me
more than once

335
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,481
never to refer to him
as a polio victim.

336
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:10,964
- Life threw me a curveball,
that's all.

337
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,140
I got lots to be thankful for.

338
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:18,362
Found some friends,
work I enjoy,

339
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,842
good docs like Halstead.

340
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,065
Hey, how's your love life, huh?

341
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:28,503
Last time we talked,
it wasn't so good.

342
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,505
- Hasn't gotten any better.

343
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,463
- Mm, I'm all ears.

344
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:33,943
- Nothing to tell.

345
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:37,294
Ellis, I'm seeing
peripheral cyanosis

346
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,166
and you're skin is cold.

347
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,558
Maggie, pulse, please.

348
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,129
- Bradycardia.

349
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:47,696
His HR's in the 50s.

350
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,611
- We need an EKG.
I brought one.

351
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:50,786
You good
for a few more minutes?

352
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,745
- Oh, yeah.
I need the exercise.

353
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:59,186
- So, um, your mom
has given me permission

354
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:01,492
to share her medical history
with you.

355
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:04,191
- Well, that's big of her.
- Have a seat, please.

356
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:05,279
- I'm okay.

357
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:10,197
- So you're mom
admitted herself.

358
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,589
She was very depressed

359
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,765
and, uh, was worried
about self-harm.

360
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,071
- Oh, my God.

361
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:17,900
- She has been diagnosed
with bipolar disorder.

362
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,510
All right?
Which has, of course,

363
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:22,035
been exacerbated
by her alcohol abuse.

364
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,907
But admitting herself
to the hospital,

365
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,475
seeking help--
really good sign.

366
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:29,651
And I have to say,
with, uh--

367
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:30,826
with treatment, right?

368
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,045
With therapy,
with medication, she's--

369
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,699
- I've been trying
to reach her for weeks.

370
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:35,918
No answer.

371
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,920
She just hasn't returned
any of my calls.

372
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:41,750
I'm, um--
I'm moving back to Michigan,

373
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,404
but I didn't know
if I should.

374
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,840
- You know, Stevie,

375
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,929
I'm so sorry that you've had
to go through this.

376
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:50,063
- Yet you were just fine
keeping me in the dark.

377
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,763
- Look, if it's
any consolation,

378
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,330
you're mom?

379
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:59,594
She's doing very well.

380
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:02,292
- Yeah, okay.

381
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,164
But did it have to mean
cutting me out of her life?

382
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:08,820
â™ª

383
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:16,785
- So Doc, am I gonna live?

384
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:18,569
- Well, our heart rate's
hovering around 49,

385
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,528
not quite the picture
of heart health.

386
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,356
- Any more good news?

387
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,879
- EKG also shows low voltage,

388
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,402
and I wish your BP was higher.

389
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:28,579
However, these alone don't
point to anything specific.

390
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,320
- Blood work?
- Yeah.

391
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,758
So Ellis, we gotta place a line
so we can collect your samples.

392
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,064
Unfortunately, you know,

393
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,283
the only place
we have access to

394
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,327
is your neck.

395
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:40,983
- Gets better and better.

396
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,767
- Mr. Turner, I'm gonna
ask you to remain

397
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,769
as still as possible.

398
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,250
- Uh-huh. And shut up.
I--I get it.

399
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:50,688
- And we're in.

400
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,393
I know a private lab nearby.

401
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:00,829
I'll have them run the tests.

402
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,744
We'll get a quick turnaround.

403
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,093
- Should I be worried?

404
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,138
- Hey, whatever's causing
your symptoms,

405
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,009
we'll deal with it.
- Okay.

406
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,233
- Sorry about before.

407
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:16,584
I shouldn't have made that
crack about your love life.

408
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:18,325
- What's going on with you?

409
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:19,979
- I'll talk to you
about it later.

410
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,068
You need to get to the lab.

411
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:26,594
- We won't know the size

412
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:27,943
of the recipient's
abdominal cavity

413
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,249
until we open her up.

414
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:31,164
So we'll resect
the donor liver then

415
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:32,513
according
to the body weight ratio.

416
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,384
- Right, get as close
a match as possible.

417
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,560
- Good morning.

418
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:37,953
How's everyone doing?

419
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,694
- We're all a little nervous.

420
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:42,305
- Her most of all.
- Yeah.

421
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,306
So how you feeling?

422
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,699
- Good. Ready to go.

423
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,396
- And how's our recipient?

424
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,660
- Stable, lightly sedated,
but no reason not to proceed.

425
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:52,141
- They're gonna make you
all well, honey.

426
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,621
- The techs are gonna
be in shortly

427
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,971
to take your daughter
and you, Mr. Byers, to pre-op.

428
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,669
- I love you.

429
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:02,978
â™ª

430
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,894
- So we'll see you guys
on the other side, yeah?

431
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:07,896
You all right?
All right, I'll see you.

432
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:10,464
Hey, Pamela? Pamela.

433
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:11,900
Hey, look, I spoke with Avery,

434
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:13,336
and I made it clear
you had no idea

435
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,381
we'd gone out.

436
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:15,556
- You mean, so she
wouldn't think

437
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,731
that her mom
was snaking her boyfriend?

438
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,910
- What a mess.
- I know, come on.

439
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,520
I want to make things right.

440
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,261
I want to make things right
between you and me.

441
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,657
Look, I also told Avery
I had--I had feelings for you.

442
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,311
- Okay, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

443
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,227
I never should have let
myself get involved.

444
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,925
You're a surgeon.
You're on my team.

445
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,361
That's all.

446
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:45,977
â™ª

447
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:49,938
.

448
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:52,201
- Dr. Taylor, Dr. Shentu,
need you.

449
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,637
O2 started dropping.

450
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:56,466
I put her on a mask
at 10 liters.

451
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,294
- Need a chest x-ray.

452
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:02,777
- I'm hearing a rub.

453
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,431
Okay, clear.

454
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:08,478
- Her heart shadow
looks a little fuzzy.

455
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,002
- Ultrasound?
- Yeah.

456
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,656
- It's gonna be okay, Gia.

457
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:19,272
- Okay.

458
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,664
Pericardial effusion.

459
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,579
- Why didn't your morning
work up catch it?

460
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,146
- Wasn't on CT,
but things change.

461
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,757
Could be a blunt cardiac injury
from the crash.

462
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,977
We need to perform
pericardiocentesis.

463
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,326
- Dr. Shentu, it's not
indicated at this time.

464
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,414
She's not in tamponade.

465
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,155
- She's protecting her airway,

466
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,723
her condition is not emergent.

467
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:38,247
- And with a non-emergent
invasive procedure,

468
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,163
we need Gia's permission
before we can perform it.

469
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:42,947
- Like the Xyrem?

470
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,080
Yes.

471
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,082
Another new guideline.

472
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,912
- Well, let's hope she regains
consciousness soon.

473
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:57,179
â™ª

474
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:03,403
- Resected the left lateral
segment.

475
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,286
- Graft-to-recipient
weight ratio is 4.2%.

476
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,027
- All right,
resection complete.

477
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,203
Go ahead and put that on ice
for Lily's transplant.

478
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,553
Let's get ready to close.

479
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,468
- You're heart rate's
not getting any better.

480
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,342
Same as your BP.

481
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:32,736
- What are you not telling him?
- What?

482
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,043
- Halstead.
What are you not telling him?

483
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,960
Come on, come on.
I'm in an iron lung.

484
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,353
I'm allowed to be nosy.

485
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,187
- I had a biopsy.

486
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,536
- Cancer, maybe?

487
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:54,584
And why didn't you tell him?

488
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,760
- I don't want
people worrying about me.

489
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,938
- Yeah, I get that.

490
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:05,334
I'm not much
for pity parties, myself.

491
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:06,509
- No.

492
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:13,516
- So what are you going to do
if it's positive?

493
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,475
- I don't know.

494
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:22,221
â™ª

495
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,745
Depends on how serious it is.

496
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:28,662
Chemo, radiation, surgery.

497
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:32,318
I'd have to stop working.

498
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:37,018
- So how are you set
for retirement?

499
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,543
I don't know.
I haven't thought about that.

500
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:42,806
- Yeah, but you should.

501
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,679
So you want me to take a look
at your financials with you?

502
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:48,377
- I can't ask you to do that.
- Why not?

503
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:51,075
- Because you're my patient.
- Get your phone.

504
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,773
Pull up your accounts
and email them to me,

505
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,601
and we'll go over them
together.

506
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,430
- Now?
- Yeah.

507
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:00,737
- I don't believe
in putting things off.

508
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,400
- Hi, Terrell.

509
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:15,056
Hi, I am Dr. Archer,
this is Dr. Hammer.

510
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:17,406
I was the surgeon who performed
a procedure on your forearm.

511
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,322
What happened?

512
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,150
- You were found
near Washington Park.

513
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,456
You were passed out
and laying on your arm,

514
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:24,761
which lead to a condition

515
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:27,373
which needed
to be treated surgically.

516
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,593
- You're lucky Dr. Archer
was able to operate so quickly.

517
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,421
It could have been
very serious.

518
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,729
- Does my wife know?

519
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:38,122
- Yeah, uh, she's here
in the PICU with your son.

520
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,604
- Yeah, she must be so mad.

521
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:42,823
- Do you want me
to have her come see you?

522
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:45,391
- No.

523
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:47,044
No, please.
Not like this.

524
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,874
Can I go home today?

525
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,528
- Well, I wouldn't
recommend it,

526
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:55,183
but, uh, if you insist--
- I do.

527
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,055
And, um--

528
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:01,537
and then after I'm dressed,
I'll--I'll see her.

529
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:02,973
- All right, well,
you rest,

530
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:05,672
and we'll make sure
you get out of here.

531
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:14,463
- Living arrangements all set.

532
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:18,337
And a van is on the way
to pick you up.

533
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,860
- Thank you, Dr. Charles.

534
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:22,819
- You know, Terri,

535
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,995
there's something
that I've been curious about.

536
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,867
- Yeah?

537
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,609
- When you checked yourself
into a hospital

538
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,872
where you knew
that Stevie worked,

539
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:34,091
you had to think
that eventually

540
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:37,007
she was gonna find out
that you were here.

541
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:38,182
- I did.

542
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,272
I--I wanted to be
near her,

543
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,927
and I thought

544
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:45,799
eventually I would want
to see her.

545
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:47,975
- But...

546
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:51,370
- The better I got,

547
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:55,330
the more I felt I was
turning my life around,

548
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,114
the less I wanted to see her.

549
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:59,116
Does that sound terrible?

550
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,683
- No.

551
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,598
- I love my daughter.

552
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:07,255
I--I do,
but she can be negative.

553
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,998
Even if she doesn't say it,

554
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,522
Stevie always thinks I'll fail.

555
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,437
I know I've given her
plenty of reasons

556
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:18,397
to think that, but--

557
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,965
- Not necessarily something
you need right now.

558
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,663
- No.

559
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:31,018
- Ah, Dr. Shentu.

560
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,411
You know, I heard
about your inability

561
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,455
to treat your patient.

562
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,631
But hey,
you stand by your rules.

563
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:36,893
Somebody's gotta set
an example.

564
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:40,854
- Dr. Shentu?
Dr. Taylor needs you.

565
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,379
- I decided
to scan her heart again

566
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,468
just to be sure, and look.

567
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:47,948
You can see
the beginning stages of--

568
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,080
- Diastolic collapse
of the right ventricle.

569
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:52,431
- It's a sign of impending
cardiac tamponade.

570
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,869
- Congratulations,
her condition is now emergent.

571
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:57,610
We can perform
the pericardiocentesis

572
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,655
without consent.
Doris, bolus fluids.

573
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:02,832
Add 125 milligrams
of solumedrol,

574
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,008
and set up a pericardial tap.

575
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:10,013
- Heart rate 145,
BP 88/48.

576
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,058
- She's tanking.

577
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:17,151
â™ª

578
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,195
What do you think?

579
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,240
Maybe this could
have been avoided?

580
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:27,378
.

581
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:30,773
- You mind?

582
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:33,080
- Come on in.

583
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:37,824
- Um, my mom...

584
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:40,783
was, uh, was she bipolar
her whole life?

585
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,959
- The disorder does tend
to be genetic,

586
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,787
but it doesn't usually present

587
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:48,008
till late teens, early 20s.

588
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:50,358
- And the drinking? The drugs?

589
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:54,014
- Most likely an attempt
to self-medicate her condition.

590
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:55,189
You know, problem is,

591
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,496
it just invariably
makes it worse.

592
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,108
- I used to get
so angry at her.

593
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:03,676
I thought she was
a drug addict.

594
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,808
- Happens all the time.

595
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,070
You know, a, uh,

596
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:10,117
a psychiatric illness
goes undiagnosed,

597
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,163
people just assume
that it's an addiction issue.

598
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:16,558
- I thought the drinking,
drugs, were the cause,

599
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:19,343
not the other way around.

600
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:20,823
- I mean, situations like that,

601
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,564
they can, in a strange way,

602
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,828
turn into kind of a--
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

603
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:30,964
- Yeah, I'm always just, uh,

604
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,488
waiting for her
to fall apart again.

605
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,056
- Well, of course you are,
because that's what she did

606
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:39,842
over and over again
your entire life.

607
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:43,585
Stevie, you gotta try
and take it easy on yourself.

608
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,979
I think you should be
giving yourself credit for...

609
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:50,200
Recognizing the importance
of seeing

610
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:52,028
somebody that you love
in a new way.

611
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:58,992
â™ª

612
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:06,390
- Okay, um, so if you do
have to stop working,

613
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,610
you'll want
a risk-averse portfolio.

614
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:11,047
So I'd--I'd get you
out of the mutual funds

615
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,876
and put you in dividend stocks,

616
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,009
and, uh, maybe an annuity.

617
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:19,578
- It's my doctor.

618
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,190
- Go ahead.

619
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,976
- Hello?

620
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,022
Yeah.

621
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:33,983
Thank you.

622
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,335
- Your biopsy?

623
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:39,685
- Yeah.

624
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,295
- Negative?

625
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:46,300
Well, that's good news.

626
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:48,258
Why aren't you jumping
up and down?

627
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:53,133
- This isn't
my first go-around.

628
00:26:54,743 --> 00:26:57,006
I've had cancer before.

629
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,879
And I guess the--

630
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:01,532
the possibility
of it coming back,

631
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,709
it just--

632
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,972
- It will always be a worry.

633
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:10,150
Can I give you a little advice?

634
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:16,286
Okay.

635
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,507
- We all live
on a razor's edge.

636
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,075
Everybody.

637
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,643
Just some of us know it
more than others.

638
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,560
In a way, we're the lucky ones.

639
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:33,652
We have the good sense to...

640
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:37,046
Cherish every moment.

641
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,009
- So it looks like we'll
keep you in the mutual funds.

642
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:48,231
- Okay.

643
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,625
- All right,
making the chevron incision.

644
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:54,237
- Ready?

645
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,811
- So now you'll stay
in the ICU for observation,

646
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:05,466
and tomorrow you'll be
transferred to Rheumatology.

647
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:09,600
There they'll work up a plan
to address your fibromyalgia.

648
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:11,733
- Thank you, Dr. Shentu.
- Okay.

649
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:21,177
Ms. Goodwin,
about the, uh, directives

650
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:22,526
that I recently implemented,

651
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,572
I think some of them
might be too stringent,

652
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:27,923
given the frenzied nature
of an ED.

653
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,751
I will adjust them accordingly.

654
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,579
- If you think that's best.

655
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:39,282
- Ah, well played, Ms. Goodwin.
Well played.

656
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:42,024
I'm assuming that was
the precise outcome

657
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,069
you were hoping for
when you assigned

658
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:44,548
Dr. Shentu to the case?

659
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:48,204
- Dr. Archer,
you have a devious mind.

660
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:49,815
- Maybe not as devious
as yours.

661
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:53,775
- What kind of person
even becomes

662
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:56,038
a compliance officer, anyway?

663
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,779
- He's a good guy.

664
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:00,173
And a good doctor.

665
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,914
- Well.

666
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,480
Look at you.

667
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,840
Dr. Shentu?

668
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:16,015
- Yes?

669
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:17,146
- I was wondering
if you'd like

670
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,800
to go to a concert
with me tonight?

671
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,890
Durand Jones.
I've got an extra ticket.

672
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,892
If you think it's appropriate.

673
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:25,111
- Huh.

674
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:27,069
You mean, uh,
within my guidelines?

675
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:32,814
Um, yes.

676
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,076
I would love to go.

677
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,255
- Wow, this is great.

678
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,256
I didn't think
there was anywhere

679
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,910
you could still make 5%.

680
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:45,653
- Ellis?

681
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,220
Ellis, talk to me.

682
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:48,569
Ellis?

683
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:51,180
He just lost consciousness.

684
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,486
- I got his labs back.

685
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:54,531
Thyroid function's
in the toilet.

686
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:56,316
I'm hoping this levothyroxine
will do the trick.

687
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,623
- Poor guy, everything
he's been through...

688
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:03,279
- Hey, if anybody
can beat this, it's Ellis.

689
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:08,328
â™ª

690
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:11,592
- Terrell, how you feeling?
- Uh, okay.

691
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:13,594
Now when can I get out of here?

692
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:15,596
- Well, your vitals are good.

693
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,337
I just need you to sign
discharge forms.

694
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,041
- Where?
- Oh, just your signature here.

695
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,913
And then just check the box
that says that you agree

696
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,392
to the terms and conditions.

697
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:32,831
- There's two boxes?

698
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,397
- Oh, the one that says
"I agree."

699
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:36,878
- Yeah, uh--

700
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:38,662
- That one.
- No, yeah, right.

701
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:42,188
Right, right, right, right.

702
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,973
- You know, you're probably
gonna be here for a bit.

703
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:46,975
Why don't you order yourself
some food?

704
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,498
- Yeah, so what's good?

705
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,457
- Uh, nothing.

706
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,154
But, uh, if I was you,

707
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:53,460
I'd probably get
the roast beef.

708
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:58,465
- Yeah, the roast beef...

709
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:01,511
- Roast beef.

710
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:04,166
- Yeah, roast beef.

711
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,952
- Great.
I'll let the nurses know.

712
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,910
I'll get this in the works.

713
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:14,568
â™ª

714
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,096
Hey.

715
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,532
Terrell.

716
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:24,708
I'm pretty sure he can't read.

717
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:25,927
- Can't read?

718
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:27,624
- People can be
really good at hiding it.

719
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:30,453
You had no idea?
- No.

720
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:32,934
- He had trouble
with the discharge forms.

721
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:34,414
He couldn't read the menu.

722
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:36,546
- I mean, he dropped out
of high school at 17,

723
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,939
be he knew how to read by then.

724
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:40,246
- Unless that's why
he dropped out.

725
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,076
- You know,
come to think of it,

726
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,121
he did always have trouble
telling left from right.

727
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:48,036
We'd make jokes about it.

728
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,820
And he'd mix up words.

729
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:52,911
You know, I've seen
kids like that.

730
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,129
Stevie, don't discharge him
yet, all right?

731
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:55,478
- Yeah.
- All right.

732
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:03,182
.

733
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:05,010
- Damn, you again, huh?

734
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,707
- Since you lost consciousness,

735
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,752
we need to do
a brief neuro exam.

736
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:10,580
Standard--
- Where's Dr. Hammer?

737
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,060
- You know, I'm sorry,
but she had an emergency.

738
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,453
- Well, you're not
doing it.

739
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:15,411
- Aw, come on, T.

740
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:16,499
Just let me do this,

741
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:17,761
and then you can
get out of here.

742
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:21,417
- All right.

743
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,985
All right, let's just
get it over with.

744
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,683
- Okay, so without
moving your head,

745
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,033
follow my finger.

746
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,734
Good. All right.

747
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:36,432
Now, I'ma say
four things to you,

748
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:37,868
and I need you
to repeat them back to me

749
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:39,696
in the order
that I say them, okay?

750
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,915
- Whatever.
- All right.

751
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,396
Cow, pig, duck, horse.

752
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:48,792
Cow.

753
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:49,793
Pig.

754
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:50,794
Duck.

755
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:52,187
Horse.

756
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:57,236
- Horse.
Pig, duck, cow.

757
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,672
- All right.

758
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,587
Now, with your good hand,

759
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,764
I need you to touch
your nose, ear, and chin.

760
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:04,983
- Come on, man, what was that?

761
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,986
- Nose, ear, chin.

762
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:19,606
- All right,
let's get you processed.

763
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:20,999
- Hurry up.

764
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:28,571
- Okay, all bile ducts
reattached.

765
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:29,964
Finished up the hepatic artery.

766
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,531
Removing clamps.

767
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:36,275
- Yeah, not hearing
any systemic circulation.

768
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,277
- Yeah, liver's
not pinking up either.

769
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,279
- Looks like hepatic artery
thrombosis.

770
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:41,758
We're gonna need
to remove that clot.

771
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,195
Get me a small Fogarty balloon

772
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,327
and 500 units of heparin,
Betty.

773
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:47,808
- Reopening the hepatic
arterial anastomosis.

774
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:50,637
- Sats down to 91.

775
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,942
- Inflate.

776
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,727
- The balloon's too small.

777
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,989
Next size catheter, right?

778
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,469
- The patient's
not even a year old.

779
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:58,471
Any wider and we risk
perforating the vessel.

780
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,126
- Well, I don't see
as we have any other choice.

781
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:02,779
- Reset. One size up.

782
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:09,177
â™ª

783
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,311
Oh, this one feels too tight.

784
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:13,660
I do not want
to rupture this artery.

785
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,271
- Sats are still lowering.

786
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,186
86. 84.

787
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,101
- We might have to go back
to the smaller catheter.

788
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,885
- Why don't you let me try?

789
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,539
I might have a better angle.

790
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,801
- Here.

791
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:31,199
â™ª

792
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,201
Crockett.
- Give me a sec.

793
00:34:37,727 --> 00:34:39,207
Now.

794
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:43,646
Here's the clot.

795
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,867
- Sats climbing.
88, 93.

796
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,869
96 and holding.

797
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,218
- Moment of truth.

798
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:58,966
- Yeah.
Looks like an adequate flow.

799
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,753
- A quick turnaround, Ellis.

800
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:04,928
I'm impressed.

801
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,495
- Quality medical care.

802
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:09,498
- I'm gonna send over
an endocrinologist,

803
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,544
make sure this doesn't
happen again.

804
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:12,719
- Thank you, Doc.

805
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:14,068
- Hey, take care.

806
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,159
â™ª

807
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:20,640
- You gonna be okay?

808
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:22,120
- I should be asking you that.

809
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,908
- Nice meeting you,
Nurse Lockwood.

810
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:29,997
- You too.

811
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,999
both: Bye.

812
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,834
- Can I give you a kiss?

813
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:42,749
Sure.

814
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:49,973
â™ª

815
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:58,417
- Here.

816
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:04,162
So you asked what was going on.

817
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,164
I had a biopsy.

818
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,513
- Oh, Maggie.

819
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:10,255
- No, no, no, no.
It's benign.

820
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:13,127
I'm okay.
- That's great news.

821
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,346
- Yeah, it is.

822
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:18,785
- Well, long as
we're coming clean,

823
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:20,265
I wish Stevie was staying.

824
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,139
But like Ellis says,

825
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,793
life can throw you a curveball.

826
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:32,277
â™ª

827
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,540
- Terrell, honey,
let him speak.

828
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,106
It's important.

829
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,239
- You need to be tested
by a specialist,

830
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:39,632
but I believe you have

831
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:42,417
a neurological condition
called dyslexia.

832
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:45,246
Something you were born with.
- Dyslexia?

833
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,640
- It affects how the brain
processes information.

834
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:49,119
You know how you've
always had trouble

835
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:51,905
with left and right,
and how you mix up words.

836
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:54,212
- Everybody does that.

837
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,517
- It's, uh...

838
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:58,738
It's why you never learned
to read.

839
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:00,435
- Dude, who says I can't read?
- Terrell, come on.

840
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:01,828
Listen, it's not your fault.

841
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:03,830
And it doesn't mean
that you're not smart.

842
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:06,006
- No, no. Not at all.

843
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:07,486
- It's a learning disability.

844
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:11,316
It has nothing to do
with intelligence.

845
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,187
You should have been
diagnosed as a kid

846
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,233
and helped,
but, psh, let's face it,

847
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,712
our school?

848
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:18,671
They didn't have the funding
for that kind of thing.

849
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:22,022
- I thought I was stupid.

850
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:24,851
- No. No, baby. No.

851
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:27,549
- It's not too late
to change things, bro.

852
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,640
Dyslexia is not
all that uncommon,

853
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,860
and there's plenty
that can be done for you.

854
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:41,084
â™ª

855
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:56,274
- His life could have been
so different if he'd known.

856
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,805
- That was great work today,
Dr. Marcel.

857
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,546
- Thank you. You too.

858
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:12,377
- Okay, well, good night.
- Good night.

859
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,510
- Oh, God, Crockett...

860
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,645
It's better this way.

861
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:22,430
- Is it?

862
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,176
Not the way I see it.

863
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:36,314
â™ª

864
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,887
- Dan--
- Lonnie, just hear me out.

865
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,411
- No, there's something
I gotta say to you.

866
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,504
A colleague of mine
had this pretty...

867
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:56,551
remarkable breakthrough today
where they--

868
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:58,336
they were able see somebody

869
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:01,991
who had been in their life
for a long, long time,

870
00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:03,689
in a completely
different light.

871
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:08,171
And it--it kind of
got me thinking,

872
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:12,785
um, you know, I've been, um,

873
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:14,482
I've kind of been at sea

874
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:17,616
since you told me that you

875
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,357
couldn't be
my therapist anymore.

876
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,576
And I thought

877
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,885
that that was because
what I missed was

878
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:29,628
the work that we did together.

879
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:32,674
But now what I'm thinking,
is maybe...

880
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,290
Maybe what I really miss
is you.

881
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:46,732
â™ª

882
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,867
- Hi, honey.

883
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:56,916
- Come on in.

884
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:05,620
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Sure.

885
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,234
It's my own space.

886
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:15,891
I feel safe.

887
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,067
- It's really nice, Mom.

888
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:19,329
- There's a rec room,

889
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:20,896
showers...

890
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,028
- And we're self-governed.

891
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:24,378
No one tells us what to do.

892
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,903
- Oh, honey,
I wasn't talking about you.

893
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:30,645
- It's okay, Mom.

894
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,257
- Would you like some tea?

895
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:35,911
- Yeah, that'd be great.

897
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:43,876
Listen, Mom...

898
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:47,836
Are you gonna be okay
with me leaving?

899
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,060
- I'll be fine, Stevie.

900
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:55,278
And...

901
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:59,500
I'm really going
to make it this time.

902
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,502
- I know you are.

903
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,423
- I love you.
