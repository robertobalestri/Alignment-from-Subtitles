1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:04,265
.

2
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:05,831
No!

3
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:08,051
Is there any chance
the Vas-COM caused this?

4
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,313
It's certainly possible.

5
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:11,185
Then Dr. Cooper
may have killed her.

6
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,187
Dr. Marcel,
I already told you--

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,710
Back off, Dr. Blake.

8
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:16,103
I'm considering applying

9
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:18,018
for a fellowship
in transplant surgery.

10
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:20,542
Did you get any sleep
last night?

11
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:21,760
Didn't we just have
this conversation?

12
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:23,675
I was mothering you,
and I shouldn't.

13
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,025
I won't do it again.

14
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:27,157
You've essentially been
parenting your mother.

15
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,767
I don't want to be here!

16
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:30,160
Do you know anyone
I can call

17
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:32,293
to get
an illegally-parked van towed?

18
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,599
It's gone!
They towed it.

19
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:37,385
Stay with me tonight, okay?
We'll figure it out.

20
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:40,736
Oh, you'll know this one.

21
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:42,868
Outdated surgical
procedure misused

22
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:45,523
to treat mental disorders.
Eight letters.

23
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:47,786
Breakfast.
Too many letters.

24
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,049
Can I see your arm?

25
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,836
Oh, sorry.
It was in the bathroom.

26
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,707
It just looked so--
No, no, no. No, wear it.

27
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,058
No, it looks good on you.

28
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:01,235
That's looking better.

29
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,672
I should hope so.

30
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:05,891
I'm a model patient.

31
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,545
Could use some improvement

32
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:10,200
in the roommate department,
though.

33
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,290
Think maybe you could
clean up a little bit

34
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:14,683
while I'm at work today?

35
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,120
Wouldn't be an issue
if you loaned me the $500

36
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:18,426
to get my van
out of the impound.

37
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:19,731
I already told you.

38
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:21,646
Money's tight
until the end of the month.

39
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,910
Some anonymous jerk makes
a phone call, and like that,

40
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,826
I'm out of my home
and a pile of cash.

41
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,742
Seem fair to you?

42
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,570
Mom, I promise
I'm gonna help you.

43
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,746
But at least right now,
you have a roof over your head.

44
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:37,445
And a doting daughter.

45
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,405
I gotta run.
I'm late for work.

46
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,409
Lobotomy. Eight letters.

47
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:48,151
Oh, oh, oh.

48
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,892
What I was saying
was like, hey, Trish--

49
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:50,893
Hey.

50
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,721
You two are so cute together.

51
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,375
Anyone ever tell you
that you could be sisters?

52
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:58,161
Oh, come on, girl.
Say it again.

53
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,728
Come on.

54
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,251
Oh, trust me.
That was meant more

55
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,514
as a compliment to me
than an insult to you.

56
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,908
Why would she say
we look alike?

57
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,605
Does she know about us?

58
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,433
Trish? No.

59
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,740
Okay, that makes it sound
like there's someone who does.

60
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,178
I'm right. Somebody does know.

61
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:17,441
Okay, yes. Sharon does.
Ms. Goodwin?

62
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:18,703
Is that how I got this job?

63
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:19,922
No, I can assure you that.

64
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,402
No,
it almost worked against you.

65
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:23,317
Sharon was very reticent
when she found out.

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,579
So she doesn't
even want me here?

67
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:26,189
That's not what
I'm trying to say.

68
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,451
Does anyone actually think
that I belong here?

69
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,149
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

70
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:33,240
No one else knows. I swear.
Okay.

71
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,764
Except for Dr. Charles.
What?

72
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,200
Oh, my God, everyone's gonna
think that I'm here

73
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,680
because of nepotism.
It was in confidence.

74
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,464
I promise, he's not gonna
tell anybody, I swear.

75
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,292
Okay,
but she knows, Maggie.

76
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,816
Vanessa, you don't have
to prove yourself to anybody.

77
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,776
We've got a trauma incoming.
We're up.

78
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,302
Astrid Meadows, 21 years old,

79
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,999
punched her fist
through a plate glass window.

80
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,958
Looked like arterial bleeding
at the forearm.

81
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,481
Controlled with a tourniquet.

82
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:58,656
All right. Astrid,
I'm Dr. Taylor.

83
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,831
We're going to
take care of you.

84
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,877
Oh, my God,
they're still here!

85
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,575
Who's still here?
The snakes.

86
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,490
They're coming
out of the vents.

87
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,275
Why isn't anybody
doing anything?

88
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,580
We think
she might be tripping.

89
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,887
Okay. On my count.
One, two, three.

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,542
Thank you, gentlemen.

91
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,674
Let's get her on monitors
and hang a new bag.

92
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,850
Okay, let's set up
a CBC, BMP,

93
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:20,635
and send the blood
for a full tox.

94
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:21,853
Let's open up a minor tray.

95
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,290
You got it.
Okay.

96
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,596
Relax for me, relax for me.
Thank you.

97
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,512
Okay, Astrid, let's see
what we're dealing with here.

98
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,385
It's definitely
the radial artery.

99
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:32,864
Ow!
Let's inflate this cuff.

100
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,563
All right, here you go,
sweetie. Yes.

101
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,956
There you go.
Two hemostats.

102
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,525
Please!
Please, just make them stop.

103
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,353
Hold on, sweetie.
Hold on, hold on.

104
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:45,050
Just hang in there.

105
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:46,530
Okay, bleeding's under control.

106
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,967
Let's get this tied up.
Get me 2-0 silk ties.

107
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:50,447
I'll get you
an extra set of hands.

108
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:51,492
Okay.

109
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,714
Erika, can you go help
Dr. Taylor, please? Thank you.

110
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,545
Why is everyone
standing around?

111
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:02,851
Excuse me.

112
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,856
Hey, Mags.
Long time no see.

113
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,250
Dr. Choi.

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,309
.

115
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,093
All right, everybody
get back to work, yeah.

116
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:29,443
Hey, listen.

117
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,401
Whenever you find time,
first round's on you.

118
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,753
Hey.
Great to have you back, man.

119
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:38,016
Thanks, man. You too.

120
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,063
Gotta say, bud, the cane?
Nice touch.

121
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:43,021
Ah, it's just
a temporary thing.

122
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,850
So look,
us gunshot survivors,

123
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,243
we got to stick together.

124
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,419
You know what I'm saying?
So, I'm around.

125
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,378
I appreciate it.

126
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:53,162
Great to have you back.
Thanks.

127
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:54,250
Thank you.

128
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,732
Hey.

129
00:04:57,775 --> 00:05:01,170
So, I take it your
physical therapy's gone well?

130
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,172
I'm feeling stronger
every day.

131
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:06,349
Just--just trying my best to
stay out from under the knife.

132
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:07,829
Glad to hear it.

133
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,005
And Dr. Archer tells me
you're feeling

134
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,485
like you're ready to come back.

135
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,443
Yes, ma'am.
We'd be happy to have him.

136
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:17,055
Hospital policy is you have
to undergo evaluation

137
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,014
before coming back
from an injury.

138
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,842
I've been staying up-to-date
with the journals

139
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,365
and the latest COVID protocols.

140
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:25,194
Good. Well,
if you two will excuse me.

141
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:28,763
It's good to have you back,
Dr. Choi.

142
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:29,938
Thank you, ma'am.

143
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:35,944
Okay, let's hit the sim lab
and see if we can help you get

144
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:37,467
your sea legs back again, eh?

145
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,991
Dean, I never got the chance
to thank you in person.

146
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:42,167
Trying to sweet talk your way
out of this eval?

147
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:43,386
I'm serious, man.

148
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,040
You pushed
for my spinal reconstruction.

149
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,998
Without you, I probably
wouldn't be standing here.

150
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,307
Well, you might not have
gotten shot

151
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,874
if it weren't for me.

152
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,789
Don't think that hasn't been
keeping me up at night.

153
00:05:57,052 --> 00:06:01,099
Hey, uh, you know,
we're already past that.

154
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:03,058
No need to look back, right?

155
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:06,888
And can't say I wouldn't
take a bullet for you.

156
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:09,107
Okay, liver function's
looking good.

157
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,503
Incision's healing nicely.
No sign of infection.

158
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:16,550
Did a pretty good job,
if I say so myself.

159
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:19,204
That's good. Would've been
awkward if I had to sue you.

160
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:22,077
Oh, right?

161
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,948
Thanks.
You okay?

162
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:28,997
So, unless you notice
any changes, we'll see you

163
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,086
in a couple of weeks
for a final checkup.

164
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,609
A couple weeks?
Yeah.

165
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,525
I'll have to find an excuse
to see you before that.

166
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,440
How about drinks?

167
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:40,312
Oh, Avery,

168
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,924
I don't think it's appropriate
for me to date a patient.

169
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:47,319
I was just saying drinks
but I mean, yeah, a date works.

170
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:53,238
Well, I should let you
get back to my mother.

171
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:55,197
Still trying out for the team?

172
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,982
Yeah.

173
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:01,072
Been shadowing
the past few weeks.

174
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:04,554
Observed a pancreatic
transplant the other day.

175
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:07,949
Your mother's
a very talented surgeon.

176
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:11,169
And she grants you
the privilege of observing.

177
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:14,346
I didn't peg you as the type
to sit on the sidelines.

178
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,874
But hey, you decide
you're ready to play,

179
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:22,267
you know how to reach me.

180
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,532
A full bar the whole day.

181
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:28,143
They have--if you're hungry
and there's food, whatever,

182
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,101
there's things like lobster
and crab legs.

183
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:32,234
There's all kind of canapés.

184
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:36,630
Inconclusive.
Neither Cooper nor the Vas-COM

185
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,501
were deemed responsible
for Eleanor Holt's death.

186
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,590
Now, they're aware
that Cooper inserted

187
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:42,331
that monitor twice, right?

188
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,855
Even after you raised questions
about its safety?

189
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,641
I mean, were his clinical
decisions questionable? Yes.

190
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,034
But no one seemed comfortable
saying he was negligent.

191
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:52,646
A patient died on our watch,
Dr. Halstead.

192
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,648
Someone needs
to be held responsible.

193
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,476
I'm going to that critical
care conference

194
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,912
with Matt today.

195
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,522
Maybe he'll open up
in a more social environment.

196
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,524
Yeah. Maybe.

197
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,921
So, these snakes
that you saw earlier today,

198
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:08,879
when you punched
through the window,

199
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,534
were you trying to--to
get away from them?

200
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:13,493
Were you trying to escape?

201
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,016
I'm tired.

202
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,496
I don't really feel
like talking.

203
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,193
All right, well then,
why don't you get

204
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:21,675
a little rest, and then maybe
we talk some more later?

205
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:25,026
Yeah.
All right.

206
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,941
Nice to meet you, Astrid.

207
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,989
I thought the hallucinations
were drug-induced,

208
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,251
but the tox screen
came back negative

209
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:34,557
for controlled substances.

210
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,473
Okay, so we can cross
those off our list.

211
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,606
You think this might be
some kind of psychotic break?

212
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:40,694
Maybe.

213
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:42,217
You know,
could be schizophrenia.

214
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,566
I mean, she's the age

215
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,394
when these things
start to present themselves.

216
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,700
She was saying
that her hallucinations

217
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,266
were more visual
in nature, correct?

218
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,965
Snakes, yeah.
Isn't schizophrenia mostly

219
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,576
associated with hallucinations
in the audio modality?

220
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,709
I--I was reading
about this study in 2014

221
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,319
with the Oxford University
Press.

222
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,234
They cited a close to
two to one prevalence.

223
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:01,410
Two to one--for me,
that's still unsettled science.

224
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:05,022
Dr. Charles, Dr. Taylor,
these are Astrid's parents.

225
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,937
Becky and Tom Meadows.

226
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,679
My baby?
Yeah.

227
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:12,029
I understand
you're a psychiatrist?

228
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:14,075
I wanted to talk to you
about the possibility

229
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:16,425
of keeping Astrid here
on a psych hold.

230
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,253
You know, Mr. Meadows,
I--I haven't been able

231
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:20,255
to properly evaluate
your daughter yet.

232
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:22,649
This all started
about six months ago.

233
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,303
Overnight it seemed, bam,
the hallucinations,

234
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:26,478
the erratic behavior.

235
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,393
We--we can't
protect her anymore.

236
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,091
Did you talk to him
about having her committed?

237
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,745
You know, I would really love
to hear more about

238
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,442
your daughter's history.

239
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,270
Maybe we can find someplace
more private and talk a bit?

240
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,228
Sure.
Great. Thank you.

241
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:43,147
Baghdad!

242
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,235
Nathan Daniels.

243
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,411
40-year-old male,
high speed MVC.

244
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:49,763
Significant c-spine deformity.
GCS 3.

245
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:52,635
Heart rate 105. BP 120/66.

246
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,116
His son's in the ambo
behind us.

247
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:01,601
Okay, on my count, gently.
One, two, three.

248
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,131
Pupils are reactive.

249
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,439
Feeling a bony step-off
on the c-spine.

250
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,620
Diminished breath sounds,
left side. We need an X-ray.

251
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:21,664
Yep.

252
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,149
Non-reactive to pain
in the lower extremities.

253
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,108
X-ray.
Clear.

254
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,285
White out in the left lung.
Hemothorax.

255
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,071
Heart rate's 130,
BP's down 90/55.

256
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,420
Give me a chest tube kit.

257
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,522
I'm in.

258
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:58,483
C-spine's clear.

259
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,311
Where--where's my Dad?
Is he okay?

260
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:01,443
Yeah.
My friend Dr. Hammer's

261
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:02,749
taking care
of him right over there.

262
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,664
I--I need to see him.
Hey, EJ, EJ.

263
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,491
Look, look,
I know you're worried,

264
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,232
but right now
let's just stay focused on you

265
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:11,627
for a bit longer, okay?
Gotta check out that arm.

266
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,110
Clear.

267
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:22,507
Mid-shaft radial fracture
with mild angulation.

268
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,553
EJ, you might need surgery,
but, in the meantime,

269
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:25,728
is there anyone we can call?

270
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,556
Like your mom
or maybe a grandparent?

271
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,733
No, he--my dad's
all I have left.

272
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,735
Please, you can't let him die.

273
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:35,738
Please, you--you have to
let me see him. Please.

274
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,828
All right. Look, I'm gonna go
check on him right now.

275
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:41,744
All right? But Nancy here has
to take you for a CT scan.

276
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,354
We have to see
if you have a concussion.

277
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:46,836
I know. It'll be all right.

278
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,186
Okay?
Okay.

279
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:57,194
How's the dad?

280
00:11:57,238 --> 00:11:59,414
Not good.
Not moving his extremities.

281
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,851
Sending him for a panscan
and a neck CTA.

282
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,462
Stat paged neurosurgery.

283
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,725
Dad?
Wait!

284
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,291
Dad?
Hold on, hold on.

285
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:08,771
Dad? Dad--
Whoa. Hold up. Hold up, EJ.

286
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,120
wait, wait, no. Hold up.

287
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,127
Is he gonna be okay?
Come on.

288
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,521
What's wrong with him?
Come on, come on.

289
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:22,306
You don't need to see this.
Come on.

290
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:32,708
.

291
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,188
Hey, Dr. Blake.

292
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:36,016
I saw we found a liver
for our patient, Sheldon West.

293
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,801
Take a look.

294
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:41,456
Oh, yeah.
Labs look good.

295
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,588
No abnormalities. Very nice.

296
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:46,461
Note the measurements.

297
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,158
The donor liver's too large
for Sheldon's abdomen.

298
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,899
So what?
You're not going to accept?

299
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,335
Well, as a rule,

300
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,425
I don't like forcing
square pegs into round holes.

301
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,427
Yeah, but Sheldon's got
a MELD score of 38.

302
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,820
He's running out of time.

303
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,474
He'll tolerate another
round of liver dialysis

304
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,519
while we wait
for a better match.

305
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,829
Uh, Dr. Blake.

306
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,962
Sorry, if you'd indulge me,

307
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,834
what about a hepatectomy?
Trim the liver to size?

308
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,531
That adds time
to the procedure

309
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:14,794
that Sheldon won't have.

310
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,839
Well, I've done dozens
out of the ED.

311
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,536
If you'll allow me to assist,

312
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,191
I'm confident
I can pull it off.

313
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,768
Wait, wait, stop.

314
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,857
Is my Dad gonna walk again?

315
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:37,164
EJ, right?

316
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,472
It's too early to say.

317
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:44,606
But he's in good hands
with Dr. Abrams.

318
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,782
Are you off to surgery
for your arm?

319
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,697
You think it can wait?

320
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,960
I--I don't want anything to
happen to my Dad while I'm out.

321
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,832
How about I make you a deal?

322
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,964
You stick to your surgery,
and I'll keep you looped in

323
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,923
before anything happens.

324
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:59,969
Sound good?

325
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:02,537
Okay.
Okay.

326
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,669
Thanks.
Yeah.

327
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:07,977
Thank you.

328
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,631
So what's the word?

329
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:14,027
Mr. Daniels is an ASIA A
at C5. Complete injury.

330
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,203
No motor or sensory functions
below the neck.

331
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:18,640
That's catastrophic.
He's tetraplegic.

332
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,642
That would be my assessment.

333
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,992
I assume you ordered
a CT scan?

334
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,820
The results just came in.

335
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,866
Bilateral jumped facets
at C5 and 6.

336
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,129
Well, there's no chance
his cord is getting perfused

337
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,652
when his spine's that maligned.

338
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,262
We need to get him
in traction now.

339
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,134
I'll grab the traction cart.

340
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,704
Okay, sat's at 75.
Almost got it.

341
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,186
70.
You've run out of time, Ethan.

342
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,753
Come on. Come on.

343
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:46,668
68. He's bradying down.

344
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,104
I'm in. I'm in.

345
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,933
Nah, that's it. That's it.
Your patient's coding.

346
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,243
I guess I'm a little rustier
than I thought.

347
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,898
Are you gonna stand there
while he arrests or what?

348
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:03,946
Aye, Chief.

349
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,121
Starting compressions.

350
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,869
Dr. Taylor.

351
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,221
Dr. Charles,
Uh...I didn't see you there.

352
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,136
My allergies were acting up.

353
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:24,706
So, I heard that you sent
Astrid Meadows for an MRI?

354
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,969
I did. Yeah, but not--
but not without cause.

355
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,318
When you were with her parents,

356
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,146
I took the opportunity
to re-examine her,

357
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,191
and I noticed increased tone
in her injured arm,

358
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,714
which is to be expected.

359
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,672
But then I also realized
that it was in her other arm.

360
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,718
Slow down a little bit.
Right. Of course. Yes.

361
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:39,112
So I decided to take note
of the reflexes

362
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:40,852
that are affected
on both sides of her body.

363
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,724
And then that's when I realized
that something else

364
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,204
might be going on here,
an underlying condition.

365
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,684
Maybe something neurological
or musculoskeletal or--

366
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,208
Well, you know,
I did give her some Haldol.

367
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:51,037
Which, you know, could explain
the diminished reflexes.

368
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,737
Perhaps. Nonetheless, I felt
it prudent to order an MRI.

369
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,782
And honestly,
the results were interesting.

370
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:59,088
You want to take a look?

371
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,264
You know, if you look here
and here, you can see

372
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,049
the T2 white matter changes.

373
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,398
I mean,
that could be MS, right?

374
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,748
And that could explain
the rigidity in her arms,

375
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,054
or maybe even
the hallucinations.

376
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,272
You know what?

377
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:11,057
Interpreting MRIs can be
tricky, all right?

378
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,406
For instance, I mean,
these white matter changes,

379
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,364
they could also
just be normal aging.

380
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,758
I-I think we want to careful
about getting too far ahead

381
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,803
of ourselves here. You know?

382
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,936
Dr. Taylor?
You got an intake in T3.

383
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,025
I'll be right there.

384
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:24,679
I just wanted to be diligent.

385
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,029
That's great.

386
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,821
Will Halstead?
We're over here.

387
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,258
Hi, Jessa.

388
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,912
Listen, I heard about what
happened to Eleanor Holt,

389
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:43,045
and I just wanted
to extend my condolences.

390
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,134
Yeah, thank you.

391
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,136
There was an
M&M this morning.

392
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,920
What'd they determine?

393
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:51,967
That's confidential, Jessa.
I really can't get into it.

394
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,752
Oh, my gosh, of course.

395
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:58,408
It's just--I'm just
at the beginning of my career,

396
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,280
and I really don't want
to be associated

397
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:02,195
with a potentially
defective product.

398
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:05,067
So I guess what I'm wondering

399
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:08,201
is do you think
it was the Vas-COM itself,

400
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:11,682
or was Dr. Cooper
possibly at fault?

401
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,728
Hey guys, how's it going?
Matt.

402
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,251
Hello, Matt!

403
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:18,080
Um, I was just telling Will
over here how excited I am

404
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:21,127
to have you both
at the hospitality suite later.

405
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,216
Room 1202.
It's gonna be a blast.

406
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:28,177
There's canapés and crab legs.
It sounds fantastic.

407
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:31,311
I think I'm gonna walk
the floor though first.

408
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:33,269
Halstead, let's do this.
Ride shotgun with me.

409
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:35,880
Yes, sir.
See you later, Jessa.

410
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,144
Yeah.

411
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:40,711
So, Jessa's questioning
my decision-making

412
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,800
in regards to Eleanor's care?

413
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,715
I wouldn't take it
personally.

414
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,891
I'm sure she's just
protecting her employer.

415
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,198
That's okay. I, um...

416
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:54,464
I've been second-guessing
my decisions myself.

417
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,162
Oh, yeah?

418
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:57,511
If you were a bottle
of tequila,

419
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:59,991
where would you be
hiding right now?

420
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:04,170
Great.

421
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,302
Thank you
for responding so quickly.

422
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,130
I promise to be brief.

423
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,872
Over the past few weeks,
we've seen an uptick

424
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:13,179
in patient complications
in regards

425
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,398
to the Vas-COM cardiac monitor,

426
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:19,010
including
a recent tragic death.

427
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,490
So, starting immediately,

428
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:24,190
the hospital will discontinue
the use of the Vas-COM

429
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:27,497
until it can be proven
to be totally safe.

430
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,282
About damn time.

431
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:31,762
Are we sure about the math
on this one?

432
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,373
Maybe we're seeing
more problems with the Vas-COM

433
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,070
but that might be

434
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,811
because there's a lot more
being used than ever before.

435
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:38,160
Exactly.

436
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:41,076
I have 11 in use right now
in cardiac recovery.

437
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,557
Like, what am I supposed to do?
Swap them out?

438
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,170
Yes. Return to the methods
and devices before Vas-COM.

439
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,085
That'd be going backward.

440
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,087
You can't tie our hands
like that clinically.

441
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,221
I'm confident you'll make do.

442
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:58,137
Thank you all in advance
for your compliance.

443
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,271
Yep.

444
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,361
Adding another two pounds.
Take it slow.

445
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,146
We don't want to damage
the ligaments

446
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,844
any more than they already are.

447
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:11,802
All right.
Let's get another image.

448
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,115
Clear.

449
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,334
Okay, alignment looks better.

450
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:22,987
Should reduce pressure
from the cord.

451
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,469
Oh, good,
you didn't kill him.

452
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:28,254
The hospital has been
unable to find

453
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,038
any next of kin of legal age

454
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:31,866
to make decisions
on Mr. Daniels' behalf,

455
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:36,479
so the law says it's now
our call on how to proceed.

456
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:38,046
So, what are our options?

457
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,830
Well, given the injury's
to his c-spine,

458
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:43,051
our only option is an anterior
cervical discectomy and fusion.

459
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:45,314
Stabilization is the quickest
road to recovery for Nathan.

460
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,925
Oh, good.
I'm glad I have your approval.

461
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,537
I've got an OR opening up
in a few hours.

462
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,278
I'll have my team
transfer him up there then.

463
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,323
Wait,
what about the cord swelling?

464
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,586
You could decompress
it posteriorly, improve flow.

465
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,371
No, the injury's complete.

466
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,329
Decompression won't restore
function that isn't there.

467
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:03,289
But we both know swelling
can mask an incomplete injury.

468
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,594
A more aggressive approach
could restore

469
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:07,031
his motor function.
Nathan could walk again.

470
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,598
Not according
to his ASIA results.

471
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,600
The man's got virtually
no function left to restore.

472
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,254
But still,
we should get EJ's input

473
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,256
and see if this is what
either of them would want.

474
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,823
Kid's 15 years old.

475
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,999
So, you're welcome to inform
him as to what we're doing,

476
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:22,003
but we're not conducting
a straw poll here, Dr. Hammer.

477
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:24,048
The decision's been made.

478
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:32,448
.

479
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:34,711
All set for you, Dr. Marcel.
Okay.

480
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,286
I can't get it
to lay posteriorly.

481
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,332
Maybe I can push the stomach
to the left more.

482
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,855
Liver's still too large.

483
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,336
Well, I--I've got more room
to resect more tissue.

484
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,033
Not much,
from the looks of it.

485
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,643
I can make it work.

486
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:54,905
Let's hope so.

487
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:06,439
Dr. Taylor, did I hear that
you gave Astrid a spinal tap?

488
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,745
I just wanted to make sure
we weren't looking at MS.

489
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,704
I thought that we covered
that earlier.

490
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,314
Oh,
and all the labs are back.

491
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,403
They're negative
across the board.

492
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:17,580
Okay, so it's official.
No MS?

493
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:20,844
It still doesn't rule out
something neurological.

494
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:22,411
Maggie, I want to order
another MRI,

495
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:23,673
but this time with contrast.

496
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,545
Okay, wait.
Look, Vanessa.

497
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:27,677
This young lady, she's been
through a traumatic event.

498
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,592
Right?
She's in a vulnerable place.

499
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:32,421
And now we've spent the last
couple of hours sliding her

500
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,031
in and out of metal tubes,

501
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,685
sticking big needles
in her back.

502
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,818
Her parents are talking
about having her committed.

503
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:40,342
I just want to make sure
that this diagnosis is correct.

504
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,691
And I applaud your drive

505
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,302
in trying to figure out
what's going on here.

506
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,913
But I also would encourage you
to think of her as,

507
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,784
I don't know,
more as a human being

508
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:51,353
and less maybe as a test
you're gonna get graded on.

509
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:52,659
I mean, I think
it's--it's just important

510
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:55,052
to strike a balance there.
Okay?

511
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:58,708
Yeah.
Great. Thank you.

512
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:02,016
Mags, page me once
she becomes lucid. Thank you.

513
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:08,022
You mean,
he's going to be paralyzed?

514
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,764
Like totally paralyzed?

515
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:13,984
Look, EJ,
I know this is difficult.

516
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:17,379
But the important thing
is that cognitively,

517
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,338
your father should make
a full recovery.

518
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:23,777
He won't be able to--to walk,
or--or ride his bike,

519
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,867
or even eat on his own.

520
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,826
He wouldn't want
to live like that.

521
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,527
There's got to be another way.

522
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,530
Actually,
there is another option.

523
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:41,621
If we fuse your father's spine

524
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,927
and then decompress
the spinal cord

525
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:46,930
with a procedure
called a laminectomy,

526
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,845
there's a chance
that he could regain some

527
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:50,804
or all of his motor function.

528
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:52,980
But it is
extremely high risk

529
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:55,461
with very little chance
of success.

530
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:56,853
It doubles the length
of the surgery,

531
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:58,420
and there's a very good chance

532
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,161
that it could make
his injury worse.

533
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:04,165
Or kill him.

534
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,689
I know my dad.

535
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:09,431
That's a risk
he'd be willing to take.

536
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:14,175
I'll speak with Dr. Abrams.

537
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,525
Dr. Hammer,
can I speak with you outside?

538
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:21,443
What are you doing?

539
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:22,879
EJ has a right
to know his options.

540
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:24,185
You made him think
he has a choice.

541
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,622
It's his father.
His life, his future.

542
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,972
The future you're promising
him, you can't deliver.

543
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:31,105
But EJ said this is
what his father would want.

544
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:34,848
Yeah, he's 15
and recovering from a trauma.

545
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:36,458
He's just a kid.

546
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,721
Yeah, and I'm gonna
do everything in my power

547
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,462
to help him stay that way.

548
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:46,686
Damn it.
It still doesn't fit. Suction.

549
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,209
I mean,
I can't remove any more tissue

550
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:51,691
and keep the liver viable.
How's our patient, Marty?

551
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,476
Temp is down
and he's coagulopathic.

552
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,175
Well, if we can't make
our square peg any smaller,

553
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,526
maybe we can make
the round hole larger.

554
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:01,701
What are you suggesting?

555
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:03,093
That we expand
the abdominal cavity?

556
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:06,053
There's not enough
posterior space, right?

557
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:09,012
So, can we make
the diaphragm larger?

558
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:13,060
Oh I see, that'll create
some space for us to maneuver

559
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,018
the liver into position, yeah.

560
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:19,066
Okay.
Get Dr. Marcel a scalpel.

561
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:20,720
Okay.
Let's go.

562
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:31,774
Sharon, hey.
Sorry for the intrusion.

563
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:34,560
You remember Roger Flanagan,
from the Board?

564
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,039
Yes.

565
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:41,131
I just saw your son-in-law,
Dr. Cooper, at the M&M.

566
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:43,220
Sad business.

567
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,658
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

568
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,529
First of all,
I want to salute you

569
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:50,619
on the stand you took
with the department heads.

570
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:52,491
What happened with that patient
is a tragedy,

571
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,928
and we need to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

572
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:56,712
I appreciate that.

573
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:59,106
That said,
we want to make sure

574
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,238
we're in the clear legally.

575
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:02,544
Peter, you identified a couple

576
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:04,111
of potential soft spots,
didn't you?

577
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:06,766
You know, Vasik could say
we're in breach of contract.

578
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,855
Or worse,
pursue a defamation claim.

579
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:10,639
And that gets in front
of the wrong judge,

580
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:12,946
we could be looking
at a pretty hefty payout.

581
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:15,601
That's why the Board's
decided to hold off

582
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:18,038
on banning the Vas-COM
just yet.

583
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:21,911
Instead, we'd like to form
a committee to investigate

584
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:23,217
any claims of malfunction.

585
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,653
And when we get
all the data in,

586
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,568
we can make a studied decision.

587
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,744
I see.

588
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:32,226
Always good to see you,
Sharon.

589
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,010
Indeed.

590
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:45,195
♪

591
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:49,243
I thought you were looking at
breaking into the big leagues.

592
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:51,550
I don't follow.

593
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,902
Device reps don't like doing
business if the doctors

594
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:58,774
don't have a good time.
Well, well.

595
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,039
Why is that?

596
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,651
Sober doctors
aren't as corruptible.

597
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:08,262
Look, companies like Vasik,
they want to make sure

598
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:09,655
that when push comes to shove,

599
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,178
you won't suddenly get
a bad case of ethics.

600
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,658
Oh, well...

601
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,748
Excuse me, I just go to--

602
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,793
Oh, I tell you,
once you get used to the taste,

603
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:19,578
it goes down smooth.

604
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:24,713
So, do you feel like you've
been morally compromised,

605
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:26,323
promoting the Vas-COM?

606
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:29,675
How else are you supposed
to get the crab legs?

607
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:36,377
I mean,
Vas--Vasik's giving you

608
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,597
more than crab legs, right?

609
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:42,601
How much we talking about?

610
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:49,129
Look at you,
you greedy little bastard.

611
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:51,131
No wonder Vasik's trying
to get their hooks in you.

612
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:53,829
Come on,
let's just--what you say we--

613
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:57,137
what you say
we take this party up a notch?

614
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,921
Just a little?

615
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,098
Mm-hmm!

616
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:09,149
.

617
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,194
Come on, come on.
Sats down to 65.

618
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:12,674
I'm calling it.
I'm almost in.

619
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,241
No, come on, your
patient's hypoxic. It's over.

620
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:16,330
Come on, man.
No one goes down that fast.

621
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:18,027
Listen, Ethan, we both know

622
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,942
how quickly a situation
like this can go south.

623
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:21,683
This is why you need
to be prepared

624
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:22,989
if you're going to return
to the ED.

625
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:25,252
You don't think I know that?

626
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:32,302
Come on, man, let me go again.

627
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:34,217
Let's go again.

628
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,484
Why exactly are
we doing this?

629
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:43,096
An EEG can determine
Astrid's brain activity

630
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,967
that might be useful
in--in realizing

631
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,883
diagnoses such as epilepsy
or a tumor.

632
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:49,232
I thought we determined
she was suffering

633
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:50,973
from some kind
of psychiatric disorder?

634
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:52,888
Just want to make sure
there's no underlying causes.

635
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:54,803
Dr. Taylor?
Can I get a moment?

636
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:01,331
I thought we decided
to put a pause

637
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,724
on the battery of tests.

638
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:04,987
I know, but I needed to--
to rule out epilepsy

639
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,162
as an underlying cause.

640
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:07,337
You know, I gotta be honest
with you,

641
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:08,774
I'm a little concerned.

642
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:09,992
I think you're pushing
way too hard here.

643
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:11,515
No.
Yeah.

644
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,821
And I think that maybe
you should take a little break.

645
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:13,996
I think you should go home...

646
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,781
Go home?
And get some rest. Yeah.

647
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:17,173
Dr. Charles, I know that
you think I don't belong here

648
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:18,871
but I assure you--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

649
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:21,787
I didn't say that.
Why would I think that?

650
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,006
Maggie told me you that know
about me and her,

651
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,139
that she's my birth mother.

652
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,364
BP spiked, 160 over 100.

653
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,279
Super tachy, heart rate's
in the 150s.

654
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:37,759
Is she having a seizure?

655
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,195
The EEG says
that's not what's happening.

656
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:41,197
Then what is happening?
Push 10 of labetalol.

657
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,416
And get her on oxygen.

658
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:45,158
Astrid, can you hear me?
Astrid?

659
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:47,160
Why is this happening?
You know, I don't know.

660
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:49,945
It's usually caused
by traumatic brain injury.

661
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,468
Vitals are stabilizing.

662
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:54,341
BP's back to normal.
Heart rate 78.

663
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,386
Astrid? You with me?

664
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,824
Why is her arm
still doing that?

665
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,826
Can you relax your arm
for me, Astrid?

666
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:07,049
Okay. Let's get another MRI,
this time with contrast.

667
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:09,965
And I want a full metabolic
genetic panel.

668
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,228
It's okay. We got you.

669
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:15,449
Can I get one more?
Mm-hmm.

670
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,016
Okay, patch is in.

671
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,801
The cut diaphragm should
accommodate the liver now.

672
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:22,369
Should's not gonna cut it.
This is our last chance.

673
00:29:26,068 --> 00:29:27,417
Okay, liver's in.

674
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,202
Not out of the woods yet.

675
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:30,899
Still need to attach
the vessels.

676
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:32,814
Let's get started
with the hepatic vein.

677
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,294
Okay.

678
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,081
You wanna hit
some of this, buddy?

679
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,431
Nah, I'm okay.
Good for you, Will.

680
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:42,911
That's good. That's good.

681
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,913
You--you--you keep
making the good choices.

682
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:47,829
You leave the bad choices
to moi.

683
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:58,971
Matt, do you think putting
another Vas-COM on Eleanor

684
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:01,625
was a bad choice?

685
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:03,279
What do you think?

686
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:05,455
We knew there might
be contraindications.

687
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,983
Why'd you do it?

688
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,506
You still haven't figured
that out yet?

689
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:15,944
God. That's weird.
You all right?

690
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:19,252
Yeah.
My arm's--my arm's tight.

691
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:22,342
Let me check.
I'm good, I'm good.

692
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,042
I don't feel so good.

693
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:28,914
Let's get you some fresh air.
Yeah.

694
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,089
No, no, no,
let's get you out--

695
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:32,091
let's get you out of here.
Okay.

696
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:34,310
Just take it easy.
Deep breaths.

697
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:36,486
There you go, you got it.
I'm good. I'm good.

698
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,011
All right. Yeah, you're good.

699
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:41,317
Let's sit you down,
get you a glass of water.

700
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:44,494
You'll be good as new.

701
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:46,975
Oh, damn it.

702
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,629
Come on. Talk to me.

703
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:54,983
Oh, my God, what's happening?
Call 911.

704
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:00,032
Come on.

705
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:08,170
Stevie, what's going on?

706
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:09,911
I'm doing a second ASIA exam.

707
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:11,957
Abrams already made the call.

708
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,481
That was before
Nathan's spine was in traction.

709
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,135
And you think
the stabilized alignment

710
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:18,006
will improve Nathan's score?

711
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,269
It's the only way to change
Abrams' mind,

712
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,402
get him to go for
the decompressive laminectomy.

713
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,756
Did you see that?
Yeah.

714
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,540
Reflexive muscle contraction.
Way beneath the zone of injury.

715
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,194
He's still got
motor function.

716
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,501
He might not be
completely paralyzed.

717
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:36,242
Dr. Abrams,
I need to show you something.

718
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:44,119
Am I missing something?

719
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:47,340
His pelvis just flinched
a second ago.

720
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:48,950
It was a subtle finding.

721
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:51,213
Glad to see you two sat
for your neurosurgery boards

722
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:54,129
while I was away.
I know what I saw.

723
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:57,045
I think that Mr. Daniels has
a Grade B incomplete injury.

724
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,220
He has motor function
to salvage

725
00:31:58,264 --> 00:31:59,700
if we decompress the cord.

726
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:02,268
He could get his legs back.

727
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,401
Well, that would
change the calculus.

728
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:07,969
But you better be certain
you saw what you saw.

729
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:11,233
Because if you're not,
and this man dies on my table,

730
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:13,627
you'll be the ones
to explain why to his son.

731
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,720
We're sure.

732
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,726
Okay.

733
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:27,249
Let's do it.

734
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,128
Talk to me.
Cocaine-induced MI.

735
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,477
Shocked three times
in the field.

736
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,608
Intermittent ROSC.

737
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,175
Ethan, need an extra
set of hands.

738
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,655
That Matt Cooper?
Yeah.

739
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:45,659
All right, on my count.

740
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:48,053
One, two, three.

741
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,490
Get him up on the monitors.
Milligram of epi.

742
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,448
You got a pulse?
Still in V-fib.

743
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,189
Let's run the code.
Doris, compressions.

744
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:56,104
You got it.
Where's the defibrillator?

745
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:58,802
T4.

746
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:01,501
Ethan, intubate
while I grab the paddles.

747
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:08,595
.

748
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:10,901
Hold compressions.
Clear.

749
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:15,819
Sats are dropping 78.
Hang on.

750
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:18,387
Sats down to 74.

751
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,999
Dr. Choi?
Doris...

752
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,218
I'm in.

753
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:25,046
How we looking?

754
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,787
Sats are coming back up.

755
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,528
Still in V-fib.
Another milligram of epi.

756
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:31,052
Charge to 200.

757
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:33,533
Okay, clear.
Clear.

758
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,015
Got a pulse.

759
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:40,670
Sinus tach.
Just like riding a bike, right?

760
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:45,501
12-lead EKG, chest x-ray,
and page cardiology.

761
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:49,549
So, Astrid the good news
is that your hallucinations

762
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:50,724
are not being caused

763
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,726
by any kind of
underlying mental illness.

764
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,033
So I'm not going crazy?

765
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,426
Well, no.

766
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,473
But a genetic panel
has revealed that you have

767
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:03,563
a disorder called
metachromatic leukodystrophy

768
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:05,565
or MLD.

769
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,003
MLD causes the brain
and nervous system

770
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,918
to progressively
lose its function.

771
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:13,790
The first symptoms
are often psychotic episodes,

772
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:15,357
followed by a host of others

773
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,316
such as poor muscle function
like we witnessed.

774
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,839
So this is going
to get worse?

775
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:21,407
Hopefully we can mitigate
its progression with meds.

776
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,930
And the fact that you haven't
shown any symptoms

777
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:25,715
until recently is a really,
really good sign.

778
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:27,413
It means we caught it early

779
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,764
and should point to a better
outcome going forward.

780
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:33,854
At least I know
what's going on with me.

781
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:35,551
Such a huge relief.

782
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:39,077
Thank you.

783
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:42,863
Thank you.

784
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,698
Dr. Blake?

785
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:55,441
Oh.
Fundraiser for the program.

786
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:58,444
12 hours in the OR, and they
still expect me to wear heels.

787
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:01,403
Right. Ha.
What do you need?

788
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,101
Look, I just wanted to say
that I realize

789
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,972
I might have painted you
into a corner,

790
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:08,584
you know, you and the team,
pushing for that surgery.

791
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:10,978
And I--I wanted to apologize.

792
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:13,415
Why?

793
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,982
I've been waiting two weeks
for the Crockett

794
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:18,986
who threw me off my daughter's
case to show up in my OR.

795
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,509
Nice he could finally make it.

796
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:30,693
Self-doubt's not
a good look on you.

797
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:33,392
Have a good night, Dr. Marcel.

798
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:38,614
Nathan, this is Dr. Abrams.

799
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:41,139
Can you move
your left foot for me?

800
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,665
Can you wiggle your toes?

801
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:49,059
Nathan, can you wiggle
your toes for me?

802
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:02,856
Come on, Dad. Please.

803
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,610
Thank you. Thank you.

804
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,918
Happy we could help.

805
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:25,922
Excuse me.

806
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,107
Hell of a call today.

807
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:42,678
Hey, what's wrong?

808
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,943
I'm just so relieved.

809
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:49,207
I wasn't sure I was making
the right call.

810
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,121
But you did.

811
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:52,514
It all worked out.

812
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,734
You fought for a 15-year-old,
and you won.

813
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:57,127
I don't know.

814
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:58,781
I feel like maybe

815
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:01,175
the 15-year-old I was fighting
for today was me.

816
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,005
I was EJ's age when I had
to start taking care of my mom.

817
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:08,051
It took so much out of me.

818
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:09,923
It still does.

819
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:13,796
Want to talk about it?
Grab a beer?

820
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,582
I wish. I can't tonight.

821
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:19,454
I got to get home to my mom.

822
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,719
It's all good.
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

823
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,199
I'll see you tomorrow.

824
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,942
Thank you for today.
Yeah.

825
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:32,598
Dr. Charles?
You have a minute?

826
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:35,165
Yeah. Come on in.

827
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:36,950
I just wanted to
come up and apologize.

828
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:38,517
What for?

829
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,779
I accused you of thinking
that I didn't belong here

830
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:41,694
and that wasn't right.

831
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:44,523
I'm realize that I was
projecting my own insecurities

832
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,829
onto you.
No apology necessary.

833
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:48,266
Matter of fact,
I'm glad you stopped by

834
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,268
because I wanted to commend you

835
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,531
on your stick-to-itiveness
today, really.

836
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:55,273
Thank you. Thank you.
That means a lot.

837
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,884
But you know
what really sucks?

838
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:00,626
What really sucks is when
capable people like yourself

839
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:02,497
feel like they need,

840
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:05,152
I don't know, a little, um...

841
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:08,590
a little extra help to keep up.

842
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:10,157
What do you mean?

843
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,116
What I mean is, I don't know,
like what, caffeine pills

844
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,772
or too many energy drinks,
or I mean, God forbid,

845
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,296
straight up pharmaceuticals,
you know?

846
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,298
If you're talking about
the pill I took this morning,

847
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,517
I--I told you
that it was for my allergies.

848
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,171
I'm not on anything.

849
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:25,738
Look, Vanessa, all I'm saying
is that I really understand

850
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,000
the kind of pressure
you're under--

851
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:28,610
I should get back
to the floor.

852
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,873
But thank you so much,
Dr. Charles. I appreciate it.

853
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:37,837
Hey.

854
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,971
I heard what happened.
How's he doing?

855
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:46,933
Seems he dodged a bullet.
But it's too soon to tell.

856
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:50,153
I was so close
to getting him to confess.

857
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:55,202
Well, an experience like this
has been known to change a man.

858
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:58,553
Guess we'll have to wait to see
what effect it has on him.

859
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:14,961
You cleaned.

860
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:17,006
The landlord was
on my ass about it.

861
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,099
Looks good.

862
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,628
Hey, Mom,

863
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:31,978
you know I always do my best
to take care of you.

864
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,893
I know, hon.

865
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:37,026
That avocado toast this morning
was actually pretty good.

866
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,898
Ha ha. Good.

867
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:50,866
Well, I more meant...
if I push you or overstep,

868
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,129
it's only 'cause I love you.

869
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:57,656
What's this about?

870
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:04,271
You were so adamant about
not staying in the hospital.

871
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:06,273
And I was afraid that you
wouldn't take care of yourself

872
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:10,408
after you left, so...

873
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,671
I had your van towed.

874
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:16,414
What?

875
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:17,763
I thought that if you just
stayed with me for a few weeks,

876
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:18,938
that I could take care of you

877
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,940
while you took
your antibiotics.

878
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:23,638
My home.
You took my home from me.

879
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:25,205
I know I was wrong.
I am sorry.

880
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:27,250
I did it to protect you.
I didn't know what else to--

881
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:31,472
My whole life. How could you?

882
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:32,952
Stop, stop! Mom, please.

883
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,388
Please, let's just talk
about this.

884
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,000
You lied to me!
Come on. No, Mom, please.

885
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,175
Stop it, Mom.

886
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:40,655
God--

887
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:51,361
I'm--I'm sorry.
No. I'm okay. I'm okay.

888
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:54,408
Mom, I'm okay.
What are you doing?

889
00:40:56,149 --> 00:40:58,978
Mom, what are you doing?

890
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:00,458
I gotta go.

891
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,808
No, no.
Come on, Mom, please, Mom.

892
00:41:02,851 --> 00:41:04,331
Mom, stop. Mom!

893
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:46,808
.
