00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,118
against the gearshift.

177
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,207
Hey, Mr. Clemens,
I'm Dr. Marcel.

178
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,470
You were in a car accident.
You're at Chicago Med now.

179
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,863
I'm gonna take
good care of you.

180
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,342
All right guys, here we go.

181
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,867
Whoa, no, no, no, no.
Kayla, cover Dr. Choi for me.

182
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,955
Come on.

183
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,870
Not yet, brother.
Welcome back.

184
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:17,262
Here we go. On my count.

185
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:19,177
One, two, three.

186
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:23,486
Nice and easy.
Ultrasound, please.

187
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,836
All right.

188
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,493
Diminished breath sounds
on the left.

189
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:33,191
Okay. FAST is negative.
All right. Let's clear.

190
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,498
Mr. Clemens, I need you
to be still for me. Okay?

191
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,850
X-ray's up.
Yep.

192
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,243
Left pneumothorax.

193
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:42,723
I'll put in a chest tube.
Go ahead and prep.

194
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,116
I'm gonna see if I can reduce
that hernia manually.

195
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,514
Okay, bear with me,
Mr. Clemens.

196
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,124
Might wanna try
the Trendelenburg position.

197
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,822
That's not gonna make
a difference.

198
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:55,953
Some Brucet to relax him?

199
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,564
No, this thing isn't budging.

200
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,304
I'm concerned it's starting
to strangulate.

201
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:02,090
Might be the angle.
Give me an abdominal CT.

202
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,526
Let's see what else
is going on.

203
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,834
Mr. Clemens,
you feel this right here?

204
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,273
All right, everyone,

205
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,014
let's simmer down
and let's gather.

206
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,104
Yes. Good morning, everybody.

207
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,280
It's that time of year again.

208
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:21,283
Wyatt Labs is on site
to do our random drug testing.

209
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,372
Maggie will facilitate,

210
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,592
assigning
each of you a time slot.

211
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:28,203
And I know y'all are slammed,
but no exceptions.

212
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:32,468
Everyone must give a sample
before clocking out today.

213
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,950
Uh, Doris,
you're lucky numero uno.

214
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:37,429
Thank you.
Thank you, y'all.

215
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,914
Okay, well, you have
my number if she turns up.

216
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,960
Yeah. Thanks.

217
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:50,225
Oh, hey. I was just,
uh...

218
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,492
My mom and I got into a fight
last night and she took off.

219
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,364
I've been up all night calling
shelters, trying to find her.

220
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,324
I'm sorry to hear that,
Stevie.

221
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,414
Yeah, well,
wishful thinking on my part

222
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:07,503
that she'd turn up
in a shelter.

223
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,592
Any idea where
she might have gone?

224
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,900
Uh, yeah.

225
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,598
In the past when things
have gotten chaotic,

226
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,339
she's turned to drugs.

227
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,559
Anything to numb herself.

228
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,387
So you think she might be
trying to score?

229
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,519
I don't know. I'm gonna see

230
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,434
if I can track down
her friend Misty.

231
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:28,350
Um, see where people
from the encampment are buying.

232
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,308
Why don't I come with you?

233
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,528
Got a five-hour pharmacy
and therapeutics Zoom

234
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,312
this morning
I'm sure I won't be missed at.

235
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:37,054
I appreciate the offer, Will,
but it's okay--I'll be fine.

236
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,143
Oh, I don't doubt that.

237
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:41,363
But everyone can use
a little backup, right?

238
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,584
Even the Hammer.

239
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:50,415
You call me that again,
I leave you on the curb.

240
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,202
Copy. Let me get dressed.
I'll meet you out front.

241
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,246
Okay.

242
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,035
How you doing?
I'm Dr. Charles.

243
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,341
You must be Uncle Joe.
Yeah.

244
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:07,955
Well, Dylan here says that
you're a master of your craft.

245
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,304
So that's a ringing
endorsement.

246
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:11,219
You know, he's enthusiastic,

247
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,177
so we try and look
past his faults.

248
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:14,352
All right.

249
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,180
I'll let you two comedians
get at it.

250
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:20,576
What's, um--
what's been going on?

251
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,143
Well, didn't Dylan
tell you already?

252
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,579
You know,
just the broad strokes.

253
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,234
He said that you were having
a rough time at work.

254
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:27,975
Honestly, Doc,
I was hoping you might

255
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:29,629
recommend some sort of meds.

256
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:32,240
Oh, okay.
My wife Marsha--

257
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,590
well, I don't know if she
calls herself that anymore.

258
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,984
She had me move out
when things hit the fan.

259
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,986
Oh, boy.
I'm sorry to hear that.

260
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,422
Anyways, she always thought
that I should be on

261
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,598
some sort of pill, you know?

262
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,600
Help even me out a bit.
Right.

263
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,036
Guess cops are allowed
to take them now

264
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,082
with a doctor's note.
I don't know.

265
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,084
Maybe if she heard
that I was finally listening

266
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:52,347
to her advice for once,
she might let me move back in.

267
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,307
Okay. Look, we can absolutely
talk about medication.

268
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:58,483
But I guess I just--I want
to hear a little bit more

269
00:10:58,527 --> 00:10:59,789
about what's going on.

270
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,661
For instance, you say
that your wife thinks

271
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,489
that maybe medication
might even you out.

272
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,100
What do you think
she means by that?

273
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:08,058
No, no, no, no.
Look, it's not like

274
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:09,625
I'm some sort of loose cannon.
All right?

275
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,454
It's just what happened
with the rookie,

276
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,021
I know I crossed the line.

277
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:15,718
I should never have
put hands on him.

278
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,633
I think you're--
you're probably right

279
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,417
about that last part,
but I mean, look, I get it.

280
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,419
I've been doing this
for over 30 years.

281
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,205
I wouldn't want some first year
resident mouthing off of me.

282
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:26,511
Exactly. These kids
these days, no respect.

283
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,470
Punk got off easy.

284
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:29,689
Hmm.

285
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,999
Hey.

286
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,047
Is everything okay?

287
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,310
All good.

288
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:44,225
Vanessa?

289
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,098
Are you all right?

290
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:52,581
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Food poisoning, I think.

291
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:54,496
I stopped
by a sketchy food truck

292
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:57,629
last night after work.
My mistake.

293
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:00,415
Oh, no. Do you feel
well enough to work?

294
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,592
Actually,
maybe I should go home.

295
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,376
Oh. Sure.

296
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,770
Let me just check
the testing schedule.

297
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,164
You know,
can I just reschedule that

298
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:12,340
for another day or something?
Unfortunately, no.

299
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,342
They take a real hard line
on these things.

300
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:16,561
Anyone who misses
is automatically subject

301
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,041
to investigation.

302
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:20,522
But no worries, I could just
move up your time slot,

303
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,437
and you can go home
right after.

304
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,700
You know what, I, uh,
I think I'll stay.

305
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,571
You sure?
Yeah. Yeah.

306
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,834
I think I probably
actually got the--

307
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,792
the worst out of my system.

308
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:32,273
Okay, well, try to take it
easy and rest between patients.

309
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,231
Oh, and don't forget
to hydrate.

310
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:35,624
I got it, Maggie.
Thank you.

311
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,060
Okay.

312
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,724
Hey, morning, Dr. Blake.

313
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,595
Apologies I couldn't scrub
in last night.

314
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,120
You missed
a once-in-a-year case.

315
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,775
Oh, well.
My rule of thumb--

316
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,646
if I wouldn't drive,
I shouldn't operate, right?

317
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,826
Maybe I made
a miscalculation.

318
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,785
I beg your pardon?

319
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,570
I thought you were committed,
serious about the opportunity.

320
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,572
I am very much so.

321
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:14,532
Just not enough to prioritize
it above drinking and partying?

322
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,491
With all due respect,
Dr. Blake,

323
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,275
I wasn't on call last night.

324
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,321
Okay.
If you want to shadow me,

325
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:22,802
when opportunity knocks,
consider yourself on call.

326
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,282
Doesn't matter the hour.

327
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,590
And if that doesn't work
for you, you just let me know.

328
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,113
Sooner rather than later.

329
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:31,898
I don't like having
my time wasted.

330
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:39,906
.

331
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:43,170
Hey, Crockett, I just got
Marcus Clemens' CT back.

332
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,128
No solid organ injury
and no free fluid,

333
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:48,088
but a clear abdominal wall
hernia with incarcerated bowel.

334
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:52,005
Yeah. Looks like he needs
an emergent laparotomy.

335
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,702
All right,
I'll call the OR now.

336
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:56,618
Right now?
You think that's a good idea?

337
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,925
He's got a pulmonary contusion.
His sats aren't great.

338
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,143
Well, it's not opportune.

339
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:01,884
But if we wait,
we risk the bowel dying.

340
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,886
Yeah. This is Dr. Marcel.
Give me scheduling.

341
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,932
What about giving
manual reduction another shot?

342
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:08,238
I had this old-school surgeon
on my first deployment.

343
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,023
She taught me this method
she swears by.

344
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,634
Hold on for me.
Heat followed by ice

345
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:14,592
and you kind of corkscrew
the bowel back into place.

346
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,725
I'm telling you, Ethan,
the sucker's stuck.

347
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:19,815
It's not budging, and the more
we piss off that bowel,

348
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,382
the greater the risk of
strangulation and perforation.

349
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,906
You know that.
Let me give it a shot.

350
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,300
I'm not trying to undermine
your efforts in any way, man.

351
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:29,303
I just--I saw this work
on the ship dozens of times

352
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,696
when surgery wasn't an option.

353
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,831
Yeah. Let me call you back.

354
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,180
You know manual reduction

355
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,921
is a physically
involved procedure.

356
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,270
Yeah, I know.
I'll be careful.

357
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,011
I understand that.

358
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:46,102
But with your injury, I mean--
Hey, let me worry about that.

359
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,935
I'm sorry, Ethan,
but when it has the potential

360
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,763
to negatively impact
the patient's outcome,

361
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:57,287
I can't do that.

362
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,160
I'm gonna book the OR.

363
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:03,946
Yeah, give me scheduling.

364
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:07,689
Yeah, laparotomy 2.

365
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,344
Didn't sound to me
like this Sergeant Kerry

366
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,259
has too many fans on the force.

367
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:14,000
I mean, is he giving
everybody a hard time?

368
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:16,176
No. No, no.
This guy's had it out for me

369
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:17,960
ever since he got his stripes.

370
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,875
Listen, get this, every year,

371
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,964
we all get uniform allowance,
right? 1,800 bucks.

372
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,140
This year, mine doesn't
even hit my bank account.

373
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:26,099
Not a clerical
oversight, huh?

374
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:29,319
Oh, no. Kerry keeps track
of every penny, where it goes.

375
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,452
He did this on purpose
just to snub me.

376
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,888
I mean,
you should see this prick

377
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,195
sitting up there at his castle
at Mount Greenwood.

378
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:37,110
Then they're at Mastro's
every Friday night,

379
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,807
dining off the company dime.

380
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,984
Every Friday?
Like clockwork.

381
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:44,117
And in the meantime,
this jerk's cut me

382
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,988
out of overtime
by taking me off-a patrol.

383
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,294
But I mean, Joe, that's--

384
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,078
that's a decision
you can appeal, right?

385
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:51,211
And give him the pleasure
of shooting me down, huh?

386
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:53,169
Humiliating me again?
Forget it.

387
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,823
But I'm gonna tell you what,

388
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,825
if he doesn't put me back
on patrol soon,

389
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:59,349
I can't say
what's gonna happen.

390
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,351
What--
what do you mean by that?

391
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,485
Joe, what do you--
what do you mean by that?

392
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,139
Listen, Doc, are we going
to do these meds, huh?

393
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,749
I gotta get going here.

394
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,015
Misty saw my mom last night.

395
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,321
Said she was headed
to a pawn shop.

396
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,323
She's trying to hawk
a gold bracelet,

397
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:19,239
which confirms
she's looking for fast cash.

398
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,849
Where do you think she got
a gold bracelet?

399
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:23,112
It's mine. Um, she must have
taken it with her.

400
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:24,461
She's not a thief.

401
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,724
She acts out
when she's desperate.

402
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,161
Anyway,
Misty gave me some addresses.

403
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,032
places where people are buying,
shooting galleries.

404
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,469
I thought we could start there.
Hey, if you want,

405
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:35,298
I can call my brother Jay,
get help locating her.

406
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:37,083
Will, if the cops find her
with drugs in her possession,

407
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,085
they'll lock her up.

408
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,174
Look, I don't want this
to sound harsh,

409
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:44,307
but maybe that's the wakeup
call she needs.

410
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,048
She's already done time.

411
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:49,269
Served a one year sentence
back in 2003.

412
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:51,923
I can't put her
through that again.

413
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,106
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, Joe, where are you going?

414
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,021
I thought we were gonna talk
a little bit more.

415
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,979
Buddy, again,
medication is absolutely--

416
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,154
Hey. I'm good. Okay?

417
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,416
Thanks for the help, Doc.
I gotta split.

418
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,331
Hey, let's at least
try and find Dylan.

419
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,029
I--I know that he wanted
to say goodbye to you.

420
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,291
I hassled the kid
enough last night.

421
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,206
I won't bother him
while he's saving lives.

422
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,946
Take care, Doc.

423
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,387
Hey, Marcus.

424
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,258
Techs will be by shortly
to transport you upstairs,

425
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,521
and Dr. Marcel
will meet you in the OR.

426
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:27,350
Oh, already? Okay.

427
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:29,396
Were you able to get
in touch with your wife?

428
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:30,875
Yeah.

429
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,877
She was hoping she could
get here before the surgery,

430
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:35,097
but I told her not to come.

431
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,099
Elaine's eight months along
with our first

432
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:42,104
and she's got preeclampsia,
so it's...too risky.

433
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,193
Ah, that's tough.

434
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,415
She could go into labor
at any moment,

435
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,895
and if I'm not there,
she just might not--

436
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:54,464
Anyways, uh--

437
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:57,424
not like I got
any other options, right?

438
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,904
Guess surgery is it.

439
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:03,169
♪

440
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:06,346
And the patient was referred
by Dr. Scott.

441
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:09,305
Yeah.
Close family friend, okay?

442
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,959
Calls him uncle.

443
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:15,094
Mm, Understood.
You said he sounded paranoid?

444
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,835
I mean, maybe even
a little delusional.

445
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:21,187
Did he make any direct
threats against this sergeant?

446
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,145
Not explicitly. But, I mean,
he's smarter than that.

447
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:26,148
He did, however,
describe in surprising detail

448
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,281
the habits of the sergeant
and his wife.

449
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:30,239
I mean, I'm pretty sure
he's stalking him.

450
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:34,156
Yeah. But without
an explicit, eminent threat,

451
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,853
you can't commit him.

452
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,986
A judge won't allow it.

453
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,205
And that's a conundrum,
right?

454
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:40,771
I have no way to force him
into treatment,

455
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:44,340
which leaves one option,
which is to alert the sergeant.

456
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,952
I mean, surely, I have
an ethical responsibility

457
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:51,391
to notify potential victims
of--of threats.

458
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:53,610
A duty to warn.
Yeah.

459
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,177
And yet I hate going that way.

460
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:58,006
There's already so much stigma
around first responders

461
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,877
seeking mental health support.

462
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,575
This is precisely
the kind of situation

463
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,011
makes it that much worse.

464
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:04,360
I mean,
you think Dylan is ever

465
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,449
gonna send me
a cop in trouble again?

466
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:08,190
He'll never forgive me.

467
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,975
But if this guy ends up
attacking someone--

468
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,369
Never forgive myself.

469
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:15,545
Whew, this is a tough one,
Daniel.

470
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,374
I don't envy the position
that you're in.

471
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:19,941
But just know,

472
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:23,553
whatever decision you make,
I've got your back.

473
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:34,260
Vanessa.

474
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:35,609
Dr. Rush is looking for you.

475
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:38,133
Sorry.
Um, I just need a moment.

476
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,223
Wait, have you been crying?
No, no, no. I'm fine.

477
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,442
Vanessa.
No, I'm fine, I just need

478
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,573
to go back to work.
Please, just--

479
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,053
Vanessa!

480
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:47,011
Oh, my God. Okay.
Sit down.

481
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,622
Sit down. Okay.

482
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,145
I just need
to go back to work.

483
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,234
Okay, you're having
a panic attack.

484
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,237
Slow down your breathing.
With me.

485
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,587
In.

486
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,633
Out.

487
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:03,985
What's going on?

488
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,294
I'm so screwed.

489
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:13,647
I've been taking Adderall
for the past couple of weeks

490
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,258
to stay on top of work.
And now with this drug test--

491
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:18,739
If you have a prescription,
he can't penalize you.

492
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:20,958
No, I--I know. I--

493
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,134
I don't have a prescription.

494
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:25,267
I know! I know.

495
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,573
It's just because
I've been so tired

496
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:29,097
and overwhelmed with work
and--and med school.

497
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,534
I know it's no excuse.
But everyone does it, Maggie.

498
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,101
I took a pill this morning,

499
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,494
and as soon as I found out
about the drug test,

500
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:36,626
I--I threw it up right away.
But--

501
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,367
If you threw it up
immediately,

502
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:41,588
it wouldn't have metabolized.
So you're fine for the test.

503
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,416
I took one last night.

504
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,983
And the half-life
of an Adderall is ten hours.

505
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:49,030
It takes a day to...

506
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,553
to clear your system.

507
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:53,252
I'm not gonna pass this test.
I'm not gonna pass it.

508
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,297
Everything,
everything that I worked for,

509
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,299
I'm just gonna lose.

510
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,258
I'm not gonna pass this test.

511
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,434
I'm not gonna pass
this test, Maggie.

512
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:02,652
Okay, okay.

513
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:04,045
Maggie, I'm not gonna
pass this test.

514
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,308
Okay. Look at me.
We're gonna figure this out.

515
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,396
No, no, no. This is on me.

516
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,615
I'm gonna face
