1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:04,047
.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:07,311
- I have no idea how you
kept your cool like that.

3
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:09,444
- What good would I be to you
with a busted hand?

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:12,621
- They are your
second-best attributes.

5
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,971
- I think our girl Milena
might be a drug dealer.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,407
- Lieutenant Regina Jeffords.

7
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:18,018
- What the hell
is going on here?

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,410
- She's needed
on the street today.

9
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,586
- This was taken at your
Police Academy graduation.

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,414
- Guess it takes one
to know one, huh?

11
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,286
- Dr. Shentu, I was wondering

12
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,331
if you'd like to go
to a concert with me tonight.

13
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,507
- Yes. I would love to go.

14
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,553
- Vasik settled with the feds.

15
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:33,642
- As whistleblowers,
you are entitled

16
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:35,513
to a percentage
of the settlement.

17
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:39,039
- Donated some, but, uh,
I decided to keep the money.

18
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:45,697
- So word is you and Randall
got together on your day off.

19
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,351
Spill it.

20
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:48,787
- We had brunch, it was fun.

21
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:51,051
But it's been a minute
since I've heard from him.

22
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,530
- Maybe he's just busy?

23
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:53,923
- I have a three-day limit
when it comes to ghosting.

24
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,098
Gotta stick to it.

25
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,404
- I get it--
don't want to get invested

26
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:57,709
if there's nothing there.

27
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:59,146
- I don't hear from him today,
moving on.

28
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:00,321
- Too bad.

29
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:02,888
But I guess I would too.

30
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:04,716
- Patient's Kayla Miller,
ten-day-old newborn.

31
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,718
Fussy, not eating,
copious vomiting,

32
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:07,980
fever, distended abdomen.

33
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:09,330
- Labs?
- What you'd expect.

34
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,896
White count's high,
sodium's low,

35
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,159
electrolytes all out of whack.

36
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:14,117
- How's the ultrasound look?
- Not good.

37
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,640
Was hoping a fresh set of eyes
will help.

38
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:17,164
- And, uh,
how are the parents doing?

39
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,122
- Young and scared.

40
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,559
Kayla's their first, but they
know something's very wrong.

41
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,474
- Right.

42
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:25,607
- It's okay, Kayla.

43
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,738
Mommy's here.

44
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:29,089
- Kendrick, Lucy,
this is Dr. Marcel.

45
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:30,307
- Hi, how are you?

46
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,787
- You'll help our baby?

47
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,399
- I'll do my very best, yeah.
She been crying a lot?

48
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:37,575
- Yeah,
it's been a couple days.

49
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,707
- Yeah.

50
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,057
Okay, let's figure out
what's going on.

51
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,754
May I?
- Yeah.

52
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:44,016
- Thank you--hey.

53
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,496
Hi, Kayla.

54
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,108
Hi, sweetheart.

55
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,761
- I know, Kayla,
you're uncomfortable.

56
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:52,286
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,548
- This is my fault.

58
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,158
I'm breastfeeding her wrong

59
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:57,291
or messing something else up.
- No.

60
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,336
- Lucy and I,
we don't know what we're doing.

61
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,685
That's why Kayla's sick.

62
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,471
- No, no, no.
She has an infection.

63
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:06,300
This has nothing to do
with either one of you.

64
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,780
- Hey, Dr. Scott.

65
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,043
Think I'm seeing
the same thing you did.

66
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:12,610
Pneumatosis.

67
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,221
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:16,397
- So Kayla's bowel is dilated,

69
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,616
and there's air in the wall
of her small intestine.

70
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,923
I suspect there's a problem
with the blood supply.

71
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,707
- Why?
- I don't know.

72
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:26,146
But to find out, I'll have
to operate and take a look.

73
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,148
- Surgery?
- Yeah.

74
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,888
- Oh, my God, no.

75
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:32,282
- She's only ten days old.

76
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:34,458
- Unfortunately,
surgery's the only way

77
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:35,981
to figure out what's going on.

78
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:41,161
- Okay.

79
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:43,206
- Is there anyone
we can call for you?

80
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,077
Family?

81
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,688
- We don't have any.

82
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,603
- It's--it's just
the three of us.

83
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,873
- No, no, I hear you,
and it sounds interesting.

84
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,180
But, uh, I gotta pass.

85
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,572
It's not for me.

86
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,400
No, Kevin, it--

87
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:04,880
Okay, hang up on me.

88
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:06,098
- Let me guess.

89
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,578
Your reward money
is burning a hole

90
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,058
in other people's pockets?

91
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,668
- Yeah, my cousin.

92
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:14,237
He's asking for a loan so he
can open a cannabis dispensary.

93
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,586
- Huh.

94
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,327
- Yeah, third one
to hit me up too.

95
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:18,807
Mind you, not a peep
from any of them

96
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,418
when I was living
on Jay's couch, though.

97
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,246
- Well, you've said no.

98
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,552
Maybe word will travel.

99
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,641
- No, no, don't get me wrong,
I wanna help.

100
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:29,513
It's just after taxes,
med school bills,

101
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,298
malpractice insurance,

102
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,648
1.2 million isn't nearly
as much as you'd think.

103
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:37,521
- Still, that's a nice chunk
of change to play with.

104
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:39,044
- No playing for me.

105
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:40,481
I'm getting out of debt,

106
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:42,396
locking the rest in savings,
and keeping it there.

107
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:51,883

- Yeah.

109
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,364
A lot of purple.

110
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:55,887
Intestines are dead.

111
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,715

I noticed

117
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,607
she was walking slower.

118
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,999
This morning, she stumbled
going up the stairs.

119
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,914
It was like her legs
just gave out.

120
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,090
- Varsha, I told you,
I just lost my balance.

121
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,918
I should
have used the handrail.

122

I'm sure there are other people
here in far worse shape.

- Indian mothers.

125
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,447
House could be on fire
and she'd still say

126
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,926
everything's fine.

127
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,319
- I think that's most mothers.

128

- Oh, yeah.

129
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:40,671
Okay.

Can you press against my hand?

131
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,241
Okay, well,
your muscle tone feels normal,

132
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,938
but clearly, there's a loss
of motor function.

133
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,026
And it just started this week?

134
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,767
- Yes.
- Actually, my legs

135
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,726
have been feeling heavy
this past month.

136
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,031
- What?

137
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,295
Are you serious?
- I'm an old lady.

138
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,470
This is what happens.

139
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:57,732
You get weaker.

140
00:04:57,775 --> 00:05:00,561
- Kiran, can you close
your eyes for me?

00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,606

- What do you think's going on?

- Not sure yet.

145
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,398
Could be a lumbar
or thoracic spine issue.

146
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,269
Or it could be autoimmune.

147
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,793
I'm just speculating,
but Guillain-Barrè Syndrome

148
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,534
and MS do come to mind.

149
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,319

151
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:22,844
- I have a cousin with MS.

Apparently, I don't know
anything about you.

What's next here?

155
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:31,983
- A scan of your spine
and a neuro consult.

156
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:34,421
- I'm sorry to take up
so much of your time, Doctor.

157
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,901
- Please, Ms. Patel, you have
nothing to be sorry about.

158
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:42,472
- So Kayla has what's called
a necrotizing enterocolitis.

159
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,909
The condition inflames
the intestinal tissue

160
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:46,694
and causes it to die.

161
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,173
- In Kayla's case,
we suspect

162
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:50,175
it's the result of
a birth defect

163
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,960
that prevented her intestines
from developing

164
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,440
the way they should have
during pregnancy.

165
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,572
- I've removed most
of her small intestine,

166
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:59,446
but she's very sick.

167
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:03,188
- These machines and tubes,

168
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,668
they'll fix her?

169
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,370
- No.

They're temporary,
not a solution.

171
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,986
- What is?

172
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,945
- A transplant.

173
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,470
Kayla cannot survive
without new intestines.

174
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:26,037
Unfortunately,
infant organs need to come

a little while ago.

277
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,144
We just hung out.

278
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,841
But I'm not sure
it's gonna go anywhere.

279
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:27,496
Busy schedules like ours,
I know how that plays out.

280
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,672
Never ends well,
but it is what it is.

281
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,501

always new faces on the apps.

00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,679
- Millennial romance.

283
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,246
Complicated world.

284
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:41,075
All those dating sites,
it's like a tyranny of choice.

285
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:44,513
- Mm, you have no idea.

286
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:46,820
- Dr. Taylor.

287
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,648
Your patient, Kiran Patel,

288
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,911
there's nothing neurologically
wrong with her.

289
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,826
- Really?

290
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,566
- Residents.

291
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,612
I reviewed her scan.

292
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,179
Normal CT, normal MRI.

293
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:00,790
No thoracic
or lumbar abnormalities.

294
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,096
No autoimmune issues.

295
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:03,706
So yeah, really.

296
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,056
- But she can't move her legs,
doesn't feel any sensation?

297
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,449
- Nevertheless,
it's not mechanical.

298
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:08,493
I'd go back through her chart,

299
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:09,799
look for zebras.
- I already did.

300
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,322
There's no medical explanation

301
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:12,759
to explain her symptoms,
either.

302
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:14,325
- Well, she doesn't need me

303
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,937
and she doesn't need you...

304
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,678
have at it, Dan.

305
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,164
- This is Jack Baker, he was
in a car crash this morning.

306
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,252
I was able
to take out his spleen

307
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:29,645
and control the bleeding,

308
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,779
but the post-surgery
head CT was bleak.

309
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:34,694
Head injuries are extensive.

310
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:35,738
- CT Angio?

311
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:37,000
- Mm, no flow.

312
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,046
He's also fixed and dilated.

313
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,830
Neuro's gonna
give him an apnea test

314
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,658
soon as he lands in the ICU,
but I'm pretty certain

315
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,355
it's gonna confirm
he's brain dead.

316
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,662
- You called me,
I assume he's an organ donor?

317
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,707
- Yeah, card carrying.

318
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,839
Make sure he saves
a lot of people.

319
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,103
- Hey.
- There you are.

320
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:54,191
I texted you.

321
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,019
- Yeah, sorry, I was upstairs.

322
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,194
Peds patient.

323
00:11:57,238 --> 00:11:58,848

324
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,067

325
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,546

326
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,939
- Crockett!
- Yes.

327
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,985
- Hey, come on, I need you
right now at Baghdad.

328
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:06,726
- Go, trauma comes first.

329
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,031
- Okay.

330
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,424
- This is Jack's wife?

331
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,208
- Yeah, Rose Banks, 31,

332
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,993
passenger, high speed MVC.

GCS 3, BP 130/80,
heart rate 110.

334
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,519
- All right.
- CPR in the field

335
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,260
but got ROSC,
we intubated without drugs.

336
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:20,696
- All right,
transfer on my count.

337
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,178
One, two, three.

338
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:25,919
All right, how long
was she down?

339
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,094
- Don't know.

340
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,530
Took the truck company
22 minutes

341
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:29,661
to clear enough space
to squeeze into the vehicle.

342
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,098
Bagged her as soon
as we reached her.

343
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,229
She came back
with one round of Epi.

344
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:33,709
- Hey, Rose?

345
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,971
Rose, can you hear me?

346
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,886
No response to painful
and verbal stimuli.

347
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,411
Feeling a step off in her neck.

348
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,239
- No obvious leg fractures.

349
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,284
Let's cut these clothes off.

350
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,112
- Pupils are fixed and dilated.

351
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:47,331
- No, no, no, no, no, give me
the shears, give me the shears.

352
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,335
Oh, my God, she's pregnant.

353
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,554
All right, ultrasound.

354
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:59,256
No free fluid.

355
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,171
All right.

356
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,999
Placenta appears intact.

357
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,566
- Based on femur length,

358
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,874
fetus is approximately
32 weeks.

359
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,919
- Volume all the way up.

360
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,879
Hush, shh!

361
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:15,011
- Fetal heart tones are steady.

362
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,404
143.

363
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:17,753
- All right, baby's holding.

364
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,146
All right,
let's go back to mom.

365
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,061
Run to CT, I want a panscan.

366
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,976
Let's go.

367
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,370
♪

368
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:31,811
.

369
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,464
- So?

370
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,815
- Yeah, Ms. Patel is pretty
resistant to the idea

371
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,165
that her paralysis is in
any way psychological.

372
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,690
Kind of repeatedly downplayed
her condition in general.

373
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,953
You know, I'm gonna leave her
alone and see if

374
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,650
maybe after a little rest,
she opens up.

375
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,217
- Her daughter Varsha's
in the waiting room.

376
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,392
I'll let her know.

377
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:49,393
Oh, wait, there she is.

378
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:50,830
Varsha, this is Dr. Charles.

379
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:54,485
- I'm sorry, I was speaking
with Arjun, my fiancé.

380
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,313
Told him about my mom.

381
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,793
He wants to come visit.

382
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,316
- Sure, that's okay.

383
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,622
- No, you don't understand.

384
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:03,843
I've never met him before.

385
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,584
This would be the first time.

386
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,673
- You're kidding,
the first time?

387
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,240
- It's an arranged marriage.

388
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,765
It's sweet of him
to want to come, but...

389
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:17,682
I don't know if it's best
to meet him like this.

390
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:19,771
I better talk with my mom.

391
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,340
- Wow.

392
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,559
Arranged marriage.

393
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,735
- Yeah, I guess so.

394
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,128
- I mean,
letting your parents decide

395
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,477
who you end up with
for the rest of your life?

396
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,522
That's--wow.

397
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,263
- Well, I mean,
it is a tradition

398
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,440
that's survived
for thousands of years, right?

399
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:37,833
Across numerous cultures,

400
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,748
so there's gotta be
something to it.

401
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,012
- Yeah, but I mean,
this culture is Chicago, 2022.

402
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,623
I've been on a few blind dates,
and they're terrifying.

403
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,668
And that was just for coffee.

404
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,452
I can't imagine the anxiety

405
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,497
that Varsha's feeling
right now.

406
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,194
- You know what?

407
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:52,761
I don't know a whole lot
about arranged marriage,

408
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,067
but I'm betting you're right.

409
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,156
It should be Varsha
who's feeling

410
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,288
all the pressure,
all the stress, right?

411
00:14:58,332 --> 00:14:59,855
And yet...

412
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,552
- It's her mother who's
in the hospital bed

413
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,946
with symptoms we can't explain.

414
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,816
- Yeah.

415
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,557
- Your girl did this?

416
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:08,385
- Stabbed me with scissors.

417
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,952
That's my fault, really.

418
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:12,215
Things got
a little more passionate

419
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,739
than we had anticipated.

420
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,872
- All right, vitals are stable.

421
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,526
Let's get ready for an X-ray.

422
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,745
Taking you down.

423
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,617
Kathleen.
- Yep.

424
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,098
- Clear.

425
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,579
- Okay, looks good.

426
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:29,885
Nothing metallic retained.

427
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,669
- Cool, so only a flesh wound?

428
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,671
- Maybe.
Maggie, let's get a DPL kit.

429
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,412
- You got it.

430
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:36,761
- Just sew me up
and I'll go.

431
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:37,980
- Yeah, sorry.

432
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,155
We gotta see what we're
working with

433
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,157
before we let you
roll out of here, man.

434
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,768
Man, I hate hospitals.

435
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,379
- Better dial down the passion,
then, lover boy.

436
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,815
- Mm.

437
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,086
- Rose's scans revealed
a C-3 on 4 subluxation.

438
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,960
Her spinal injuries
caused her to stop breathing.

439
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,397
And the lack
of oxygen and blood flow

440
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,400
led to a catastrophic stroke.

441
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:07,792
There's no brain activity.

442
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:11,274
- So Rose is gone?

443
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:12,754
- I'm very sorry.

444
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,237
- What--what--what about
the baby?

445
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,804
- Well, there's, uh,

446
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,545
there's no way
to know if the fetus

447
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,765
was injured until it's born.

448
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:26,681
Right now,
the heart tones are steady.

449
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:29,771
However,
the situation is fluid.

450
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:31,120
- So--so what do we do?

451
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:33,383
- Well, there are two options.

452
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:37,083
Steroids to help mature
the baby's lungs

453
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,607
followed by
a C-section to deliver.

454
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,130
Or we wait.

455
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,654
- Wh--what's better?

456
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:44,960
- It's hard to say.

457
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,179
Delivery would put us
out in front

458
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,833
of any
potential future problems.

459
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:51,749
But at only 32 weeks,
the baby would be facing

460
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,447
the challenges
of a premature birth.

461
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,493
- Yeah, waiting
gives more time in utero.

462
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:59,061
But Rose's trauma was severe.

463
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:03,109
So if she decompensates,
so will the baby.

464
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:06,764
- If we--we deliver,
what happens to Rose?

465
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:08,462
- Rose is
a registered organ donor.

466
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:13,162
Her organs would be given
to those patients in need,

467
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:14,990
and then she would be
taken off life support.

468
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,515
David, you decide.

469
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:24,695
- I--I guess deliver.

470
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,175
That a good decision?

471
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:27,698
- Yes.

472
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,874
Dr. Archer and I support it.

473
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:31,963
- Okay.
- Okay.

474
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,704
We'll give you some privacy
with your daughter.

475
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,013
- Hey, Rudy.

476
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,363
You remember Dr. Cook?

477
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,148
- You just couldn't stay away,
could you?

478
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,063
- Believe me, Dr. Cook,
I tried.

479
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,326
- Who's that little guy?

480
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,457
- My nephew Harley.

481
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,938
Still haven't met him
in person yet.

482
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:52,288
So what's the damage?

483
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:53,898
Literally?

484
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:56,031
- Fungal pneumonia.

485
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,728
- So going to admit me?

486
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:59,817
- Yes, Dr. Cook will take over.

487
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:00,862
Short term,
we're gonna start you

488
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:02,603
on antibiotics
and anti-fungals,

489
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:05,127
get a CT to help better
define the infection.

490
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:06,172
- A CT?

491
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,869
You already know
I have pneumonia.

492
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:09,784
- Yeah, I know, CTs aren't fun.

493
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,742
- That's putting it mildly.

494
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:13,004
I've had a bunch.

495
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,528
And I'm claustrophobic.

496
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,400
Worst part, the CTs never seem
to show anything new.

497
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:21,274
- Well, Rudy,
then maybe we can skip it.

498
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,232
There's no red flags
with his labs.

499
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,191
And check out
this chest X-ray from today

500
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:28,368
compared to the one taken
from the last time I saw him.

501
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:31,632
- Yeah, lung scarring
is unchanged.

502
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:34,113
- I think we can get by today
without the CT.

503
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,463
- Dr. Halstead?

504
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:39,466
- Well, if Dr. Cook is okay
with it, I guess I am too.

505
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:40,641
It was nice meeting you.

506
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:41,772
Take care.

507
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,948
- You too.
- Thanks.

508
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:46,647
Ms. Patel, how we feeling?

509
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,128
You again.

510
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,956
- I understand that, uh,
congratulations are in order.

511
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,262
Your daughter's
getting married.

512
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,960
- Yes, she's actually
talking to her fiancé

513
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,223
on the phone right now.

514
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,746
- Huh.

515
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,922
Look, I just had
a couple more questions.

516
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,184
I promise to be very quick.

517
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,447
- All right.
- Okay.

518
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:08,277
So I've been looking at
your chart, and apparently,

519
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:11,976
your legs started to feel
heavy, what, about a month ago?

520
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,326
Now, were there
any other symptoms

521
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,197
that--that you can
describe to me?

522
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:18,069
Or has it just been the legs?

523
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:21,725
- A while ago, I noticed that
my foot was tingly.

524
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,597
But it would come and go,
I managed.

525
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,859
- Okay.

526
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:27,905
And this tingling,
when did that start?

527
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:30,299
- I'm not sure.

528
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:31,648
Maybe a year?

529
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:36,218
- And what was happening
in your life back then?

530
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:40,091
Any big events jump out at you
that you can remember?

531
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,136
- Not really.

532
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,617
I had cut back on working.

533
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,577
I was volunteering
at the temple's soup kitchen.

534
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:52,191
I just started reviewing
husband profiles for Varsha.

535
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:55,846
Reading bios,
comparing astrological charts.

536
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,371
- So choosing Arjun,

537
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,503
that was then pretty much
down to you and your husband.

538
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:03,985
- He's deceased.

539
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,987
- Oh.

540
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,032
Okay.
- It was...

541
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,774
my decision.

542
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:12,167
As her mother...

543
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,824
That's what I'm supposed to do.

544
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,217
- Right.

545
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,479

that's a really big decision

546
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:20,958
for one person to make,
isn't it?

547
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,224
- Ms--Ms. Patel,
are you all right?

548
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:29,140
They can't get married.

549

They can't get married.

550

the doctors just gave you?

578

- Tyler just needs
more time to develop.

No.

00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:12,722

592
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:41,447

601
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,043
- Atwater bought a small
apartment building.

602
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,959
So Jay thinks I should
get into real estate too.

603
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,744
He found this place
in Canaryville,

604
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:18,875
you know, the old neighborhood.

605
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,747
Wants me to check it out
before it sells.

606
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,053
- Well, real estate's hot,
I'll give him that.

607

And it seems more your speed
than a cannabis club.

608
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,536
- Yeah.

609
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,104
Your patient was just admitted.

610

So we're good?

616

Not gonna die, am I?

617
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:46,337
- You're not gonna die,
but we do need to talk

618
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:47,556
about your DPL results.

619
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,992
All right, they're scaled,

620
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,820
the magic number being 100,000.

621
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,474
Under 100,000, you can go home.

622
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,607
And over it, you need surgery.

623
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,347
- Okay, so, give it to me.
How'd I do?

624
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:58,437
- 96,000.

625
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,916
- Where do I sign so I can go?

626
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,875
- Wh--here's the thing.

627
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:04,486
96,000 is
beneath the threshold,

628
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,227
but I'd feel a lot
more comfortable

629
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,490

at the wound from the inside.

630
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,013
Do me a favor, all right?

631

He undercover with you?

643
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:48,791
A CI?

644
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:49,923
Okay, you want me to help you,

645
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,099
but you're gonna leave me
in the dark?

646
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:54,623

You know the rules.

647
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:57,104
- Yeah, I got rules too.
Do no harm.

648
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:58,671
- All right, well,
he got stabbed with scissors.

649
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,368

dead man walking.

you're jamming me up.

I wish I didn't have to.

Honestly.

657

660
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,442
- I suspect that's she's
suffering from something

661
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,227
called Conversion Disorder,

662
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,882
which is a mental condition
that occurs when

663
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:39,320
unresolved or unconscious
mental conflict

664
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:41,757

physical symptoms.

665
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,977
- Mental condition?

666
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,370
Her weakness is real.
- It--it's very real.

667
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:48,938
What I'm saying is,
I don't think it's being caused

668
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:52,507
by some kind of
underlying neurologic disorder.

669
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,465
- By what, then?

670
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,076
- Very likely stress.

671
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,166
You know, I believe
that your mom is

672
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:01,255
bottling up emotions so tightly

673
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:02,691

attacking her.

674
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:04,345
It's attacking her body.

675

- Why?

676
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,870
- Varsha, I think that she's

677
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:10,743
very conflicted about
your upcoming marriage.

678
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,571

Family's flying in from India.

Why, all of a sudden,
is she against the marriage?

681

- I don't know.

682
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:23,886
But figuring that out is
crucial in treating your mom.

683
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:29,022

- Yeah, glad I could help.

891
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:33,669
- So Kiran
is wiggling her toes,

892
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,802
chatting with Varsha and Arjun.

893
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:36,933
Off to a good start.

894
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:38,500
- Glad to hear it.

895
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:39,936
- Well, listen to this.

896
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,329
I did a little Googling,

897
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:43,462
and I found a study that
said that the divorce rate

898
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,246
for arranged marriages
in this country?

899
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,030
Less than 4%.

900
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:51,426
Whereas marriages where people
chose each other?

901
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,037
40% ended in divorce.

902
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:55,474
How about that?

903
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,345
- I'm deleting my dating apps.

904
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:59,739
- No kidding.

905
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:03,525
Oh.

906
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,920
Uh-huh, so I guess
you decided to, uh,

907
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:09,009
hang out a little bit more.

908
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:10,358
Or--or it's a date.

909
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:13,405
- Not sure yet, but,
uh, I guess I'm gonna

910
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:15,276
give us a chance to find out.

911
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,712
- Okay.

912
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,681
- 20-something male,
GSW left lower chest.

913
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:30,204
Two holes, through and through.

914
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,989
GCS 8T, BP 94/72.

915
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:35,078
Heart rate 112, sats 100%.

916
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,384
Intubated in the field.

917
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:37,951
- Oh, man, Stefan.

918
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:40,388
He the only victim?
- Just him on site.

919
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:42,477
- Ah, I never
should've let him go.

920
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:45,088
- Who is this guy to you?

921
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:46,873
- No one, I just met him today.

922
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:57,753
- You were really dialed in
this afternoon.

923
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:01,627
You owned that OR.

924
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,977
- Yeah.

925
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,066
Case hit close to home.

926
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,023
- Oh?

927
00:38:09,243 --> 00:38:12,072
- I had a daughter.

928
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:14,509
Harper.

929
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:16,946
Lost her too soon.

930
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,123
Leukemia.

931
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,560
- I'm sorry.

932
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,042
- You know,
for a long time...

933
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:32,310
The memory of her was my--
my greatest weakness.

934
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,793
- Well, today, it seemed like
a source of real strength.

935
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:44,757
♪

936
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,116
- Hey, there, sorry I'm late.

937
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,903
I just had to make a detour

938
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:02,165
to the gift shop.

939
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,254
- Look at you.

940
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:08,215
- My dad, you know, he was
a very old-fashioned guy.

941
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,825
He always used to say,

942
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:12,393
"A box of chocolates, son,
it's the way to go."

943
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,874
I'm like, "That's so corny."

944
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,920
But I don't know,
now I'm thinking

945
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:21,489
maybe some traditions are
worth hanging onto, you know?

946
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,099
- I hope there's some
caramels in there.

947
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:24,971
- Should be at least
a couple left, yeah.

948
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,888
- For the record, I'm still
on the fence about her.

949
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:30,193
- Well, I'm not.

950
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:33,632
She just completed an ED
fellowship at LA County.

951
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,590
High volume, high risk cases.

952
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,940
Just like Med.

953
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,986
- I'm sure that
looks good on paper.

954
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:43,729
- We're implementing
an emergency OB/GYN service

955
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:47,385
into the ED, and we need
an experienced attending

956
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,908
to get it off the ground.

957
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:51,040
She's the one.

958
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:52,694
Oh, here she is.

959
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,528
- Ms. Goodwin.

960
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:01,834
It's nice to see you again.

961
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:03,662
- It's good to see you too.

962
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:05,490
You look well, Dr. Asher.

963
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,230
- That post rehab glow.

964
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:10,451
I appreciate you always
checking in with me

965
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:12,192
while I was away,
it was very kind.

966
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:15,717
- I always wanted you to know
you weren't alone.

967
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:18,720
And this is Dr. Archer,
he's the chief of our ED.

968
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:20,940
- Pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Asher.

969
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:22,158
Please.

970
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:28,469
- Thank you both.

971
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:31,646
I'm looking forward to coming
back and for this opportunity.

972
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,606
- Well, I don't mean to be
insensitive, Dr. Asher,

973
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:37,173
but I do have to ask.

974
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:40,089
Are you sure Med
is the best place for you?

975
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,613
Given your history.

976
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:43,049
- You mean my addiction?

977
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:46,835
It's a fair question.

978
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:49,098
I am almost two years sober

979
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:52,841
and committed to doing whatever
it takes to stay that way.

980
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:55,975
I'm ready for this, both
personally and professionally.

981
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,197
- Welcome back, Dr. Asher.
