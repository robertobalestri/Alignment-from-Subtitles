1
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:04,569
.

2
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:07,181
- Tell me it's not a game.

3
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:08,530
- Hey, take it easy.

4
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,401
- You've got more lies.

5
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,012
- Hey, over here.
Over here.

6
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:21,195
- I'd like to name you
interim chief.

7
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:22,413
- I'd be honored.

8
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:27,114
- When I was 16,
I got pregnant.

9
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:28,463
- It wasn't difficult for me
to find out

10
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:29,681
you're my birth mother.

11
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,683
I don't want anyone
to know about us.

12
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:34,077
- They won't.

13
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:38,168
- My mom was so sick, I stole
meds from Will's trial.

14
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:39,517
- I have a lot of history
with Natalie.

15
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,258
I won't apologize for it.

16
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:44,522
- Did you tell her
you took them?

17
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,656
- You're fired, Dr. Halstead.

18
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:50,267
- I had to.

19
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:54,054
- I was the one who sold
the trial meds for my mom.

20
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:10,461
â™ª

21
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:18,295
- I guess that's everything.

22
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,734
I'm going to be okay.

23
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:26,086
- I know.
- You?

24
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,870
- Yeah.

25
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,744
- You need to go back.

26
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:34,833
Please, call her.

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,488
- Yeah.

28
00:01:51,937 --> 00:01:56,420
Hey, you better keep in touch.
All right, I'll come find you.

29
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:58,422
- Take care of yourself.

30
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,816
- Yeah, you too.

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,472
Bye, Natalie.

32
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:26,581
- I look at that spot
every day, too.

33
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:30,759
So I understand Ethan's
physical therapy is going well.

34
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:32,195
- That's what he says, yeah.

35
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,676
- Oh, you're in contact,
that's good.

36
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,895
Glad he didn't
hold a grudge.

37
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:38,636
- A grudge?

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,160
- Well, come on,
you're telling me

39
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,857
that you don't think
about that?

40
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,208
The shooter? Neil?
What's his name?

41
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,470
If he'd been
put on psych hold...

42
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:48,951
- What?
Ethan wouldn't have been shot?

43
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,214
No. You know what?
I never think about that.

44
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,825
Not even for a second.
What I do wonder about, though,

45
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:55,523
is if any of this
would have happened

46
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,742
if you hadn't taken the guy's
appendix out against his will.

47
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,440
That's what I wonder about.

48
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,616
I mean, come on,
he was aiming at you, right?

49
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:12,670
- Sinus tachycardia at 120.
Sats at 90. Let's go!

50
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:14,890
- Okay, let's get her to CT.

51
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,198
- Dr. Cooper.
- Hello.

52
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,764
- What happened
with your patient?

53
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,331
- It looks like
pulmonary embolism.

54
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,333
- But no DVT?
- No.

55
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,682
- So is this due

56
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:27,555
to the insertion
of the cardiac output monitor?

57
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,297
- I wouldn't think so.
The Vas-COM is a good device.

58
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,342
Rarely have any problems.

59
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,476
Excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

60
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:43,266
Dr. Halstead.

61
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,876
- Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,531
- We've got an open
radial fracture.

63
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:49,707
I need you in five right now.
- Yeah.

64
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,536
- I can't get a straight story
out of him.

65
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,711
- We'll figure it out.

66
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,931
I want you to go get
something to eat.

67
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:58,716
All right, now,
your dad's out of the room.

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,414
You gonna tell me
what really happened?

69
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,810
Those there
are puncture wounds.

70
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,508
That's a snakebite.
And I gotta know

71
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:10,554
what kind of snake
so I can take care of you.

72
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,426
- I'm gonna be sick.

73
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:16,517
- You're gonna be a lot sicker

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,258
unless you tell me
what kind of snake.

75
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,653
- Rattlesnake.

76
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:25,874
- Mix 5 vials of antivenom
with 250 ml of NS.

77
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,354
- Right.

78
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,878
- So how'd you meet up
with this rattlesnake?

79
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,751
- I stuck my hand in a box.

80
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,580
- I'm guessing the snake
was in that box?

81
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:38,060
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

82
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,497
So why the Wild, Wild West?

83
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,890
- Huh?

84
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,719
- Ambo picked you up
on Chicago and Pulaski.

85
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,634
You don't live over there.

86
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,767
Your shoelaces tipped
in yellow and black.

87
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,987
Those are gang colors.
The 66 boys.

88
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,597
- What are you, a cop?

89
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:57,340
- I used to be.
But now I'm a doc. So come on.

90
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,083
- I was with some dudes.
- Uh-huh.

91
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,607
Dudes your daddy
don't approve of?

92
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,174
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

93
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:07,698
All right, so sticking your
hand in a box with a snake,

94
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:10,658
was that some kind of
gang initiation or something,

95
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,703
to see if shorty's
got what it takes?

96
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,708
Yeah.
Hey, who's got that snake?

97
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:23,975
Hook him up.
I'll be right there.

98
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,500
Maggie, could you
do me a favor?

99
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:29,677
Call CPD, 23rd District.
Ask for Lieutenant Scott.

100
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,374
- Scott?
- Yeah, my dad.

101
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,376
Tell him I need him to send one
of his guys and animal control

102
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,943
to pick up a rattlesnake.

103
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:37,075
Yeah, a rattlesnake.
I'll text you the address.

104
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:44,692
- I want to come back to Med.
It's where I belong.

105
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:47,825
You know I didn't steal
the trial meds--

106
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:51,786
- Skip it. Are you familiar
with the Vas-COM?

107
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,091
- The Vas-COM?

108
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:57,400
- Cardiac output monitor
made by Vasik Labs.

109
00:05:57,444 --> 00:06:00,011
- Yeah, no, I know it.
It's pricey.

110
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,666
Other monitors
are just as good.

111
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,972
What about it?

112
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:07,802
- We're billing Medicare
for its use 60% more

113
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,848
than any other hospital
in the area.

114
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,023
- Okay?

115
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,678
- Well, if it's being
used unnecessarily

116
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:17,159
and Medicare's being billed,
that's fraud.

117
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:20,467
And it's an invasive procedure.

118
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,687
So it's also
putting people at risk.

119
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:25,907
- Ms. Goodwin, I-I just came
to ask for my job back--

120
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,518
- And I heard you.

121
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:31,913
Dr. Cooper, Matt Cooper,

122
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:34,481
you have a relationship
with him.

123
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:35,830
- Barely.

124
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:38,789
I mean, he dated my cousin
Moira back in the day.

125
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,618
- Well, Dr. Cooper is our
biggest booster of the Vas-COM.

126
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:45,187
And I suspect it's because
he's getting kickbacks.

127
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,102
Now, I could go to the board,

128
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:49,060
but his father-in-law
sits on it.

129
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,934
So I need something solid,
an admission of wrongdoing,

130
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,631
preferably on tape.

131
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,590
And you're going
to get it for me.

132
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,593
- Hold on. Wait.

133
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:02,422
You're saying you want me
to be your spy?

134
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,075
- If that's what
you want to call it.

135
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:07,209
But if you want to come back
here and practice medicine,

136
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:08,732
that's what you're
going to have to do.

137
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,168
- I don't believe this.
You're serious?

138
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,866
- As a heart attack.

139
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:14,477
Look, I have a doctor
in my hospital

140
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:18,916
who's scamming the system
and putting patients at risk.

141
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,092
I'll do whatever it takes
to stop him.

142
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:23,878
Now, are you in or out?

143
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,373
I know he's been missed.

144
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,201
- Yay, Dr. Halstead!
- Yeah!

145
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,986
- Whoo-hoo!

146
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:48,511
- And there are a couple
of folks that you haven't met.

147
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:52,384
Dr. Dylan Scott,
and Dr. Stevie Hammer.

148
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:53,995
- I know Dr. Hammer.

149
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,258
- We were in med school
together.

150
00:07:56,301 --> 00:08:01,306
- Oh, okay. Nice.
All right, thank you, everyone.

151
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,484
- All right, everyone,
we've got patients to see.

152
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:09,227
- Hey, don't get me wrong,
I'm thrilled to see Will again,

153
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:12,274
but I thought that
you weren't inviting him back.

154
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:14,581
- I'll tell you about it later.

155
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,324
- So I heard your clinical
trial was a rousing success.

156
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:22,327
- I'm touched. You still care
enough to track my failures.

157
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,505
What brought you back
to Chicago?

158
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,029
- Home sweet home.
What made you stay?

159
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:29,421
- Same.

160
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:30,553
Look forward
to working with you.

161
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,468
- Likewise.

162
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,167
- What's up with you and her?

163
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,300
- The Hammer?
- Uh-huh.

164
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:41,085
- God. Never lets you forget
she was first in our class.

165
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:46,003
- Ah, and you were second? No.

166
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:49,224
I'm glad you're back.
Natalie would be happy.

167
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:53,141
- Natalie and April gone.
Ethan in rehab.

168
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:56,144
- Get back to work.
Treatment six.

169
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,928
Twisted ankle.

170
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,583
It's good to have you back.
- Good to be back.

171
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,585
- What do we got?

172
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:05,457
- Lois Durant. 65, fatigued
and short of breath.

173
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,676
- Hey, Lois. I'm Dr. Marcel.

174
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,548
I'm going to be
taking care of you, okay?

175
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:11,333
- BP 95/100. Heart Rate 115.

176
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:14,597
- Been here before.
Lots of times.

177
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,730
- Okay. Maggie, can we get
Ms. Durant's chart, please?

178
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,166
- You got it.

179
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,213
- Okay, folks,
we know what this is.

180
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,432
Nice and easy.

181
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:27,218
On my count, all right?
One, two, three.

182
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,657
- Where's my doctor?

183
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,050
- Lois, I'm your doctor, okay?

184
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:35,618
Can you come forward
for me a little bit?

185
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,316
There you go. Nice and easy.

186
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,493
Yeah, lungs are wet.

187
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,365
All right, there you go now.

188
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:49,197
And I'm hearing
a systolic murmur.

189
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,460
Have you had
that problem before?

190
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,418
It's okay.

191
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,988
Yeah, you're retaining fluids.

192
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,034
Let's set up
for a bedside echo.

193
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,165
- Okay.

194
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,732
- Call my doctor.

195
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,735
- Okay. Well, let's have a look
at your chart, all right?

196
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,610
What?

197
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,396
Hey, Maggie.

198
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,180
- Yeah.

199
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,834
- Hey, where's Ms. Durant's
chart?

200
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:21,011
- We don't have it. She's one
of the Kender trial patients.

201
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,491
- So?

202
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,101
- Well, when Kender
pulled the trial,

203
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:26,321
thanks to Dr. Halstead,
they took all the records.

204
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:28,540
- And now they won't
release them.

205
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,673
- Okay. Well, it looks like
she's in heart failure.

206
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,370
So I'll need her history.

207
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:33,676
- Well, you're in luck.

208
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,547
The aforementioned
Dr. Halstead is in the house.

209
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:38,681
I'm sure he'd be happy to share
his knowledge of the patient.

210
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,553
-  Perfect.
- Yeah.

211
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:44,687
- Halstead, I could use
your help in three.

212
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:51,259
Hey, Lois, you remember
Dr. Halstead?

213
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,653
- There's my doctor.

214
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,090
- Lois, what happened?

215
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,222
You were doing so good
a few months ago.

216
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,354
- Don't...know.

217
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:02,139
- Lois, can you lay back
for me?

218
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,359
There you go.

219
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,839
- How's your son?
Terence, right?

220
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,449
Did he finish law school?

221
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:11,453
- You remember.
- Sure.

222
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:15,675
- Yeah, I'm seeing severe
mitral valve regurgitation.

223
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,373
- Yeah, Ventricular pressure's
really low.

224
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:22,725
- Yeah. Let's give Lois
morphine 5mg IV.

225
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,422
That'll help dilate
your blood vessels,

226
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,468
make it easier
for your heart to pump.

227
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:30,167
And 40 of Lasix IV, please.

228
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,343
It'll get rid
of some of the fluid.

229
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:34,824
- We'll check back,
see how you're doing.

230
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:38,698
- This makes no sense.

231
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,439
Lois only had mild
regurgitation six months ago,

232
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,442
and she was doing better
on the trial meds.

233
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:47,184
Oh, man, I think we're looking
at hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

234
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,534
- Well, can't really tell
from the echo windows.

235
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,319
But morphine should work.

236
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:57,717
- Well, I hope you were able
to assist Dr. Marcel.

237
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,327
- I remember the patient.
- Yeah.

238
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,677
Got to tell you, it wasn't
my idea to bring you back.

239
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,375
- Thanks, Dean.

240
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,595
And, hey, congratulations
on being made Chief.

241
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:10,512
I mean, it's what you
wanted all along, wasn't it?

242
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,514
- Dr. Archer.

243
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:16,213
- Thank you. Looking forward
to your next train wreck.

244
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:20,174
- Ow!
- Hey, Ms. Brooks.

245
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,436
I'm Dr. Archer.
- Hey.

246
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,916
- I'm Emma. Gemma's sister.

247
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,788
- Gemma and Emma.

248
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:28,356
Dr. Taylor,
why isn't Gemma gowned?

249
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,575
- She refused unless her sister
was also gowned.

250
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,447
- We always dress alike.

251
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,319
- Uh-huh. May I?
- Mm-hmm. Ow! Ow! Ow!

252
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,799
- Okay.
So I understand

253
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,801
that you're suffering from
abdominal pain and bloating?

254
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,629
- Really bad.
- Okay.

255
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:44,807
Well, I can help with that.
Start an IV hydromorphone .5mg.

256
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,288
- Can you put a needle
in my arm, too?

257
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,203
- I'm sorry, you said what?

258
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,379
- Oh, we'd like a needle
in my arm, too.

259
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:58,516
- I'm sorry, no,
I can't do that.

260
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,302
- Both sisters were born
with only one ovary.

261
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,783
And Gemma has a history
of ovarian cysts.

262
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,610
- Which is not
necessarily problematic.

263
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:09,484
I do need to check
your belly with ultrasound.

264
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,878
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

265
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:15,490
- Okay, I'm going to
raise your blouse.

266
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,927
If you could lower
your jeans for me.

267
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,322
- It's going to be
a little cold.

268
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:22,845
Okay, here we go.

269
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,633
- Okay. Yeah.
I see free fluid,

270
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:31,767
which indicates an ovarian
cyst has likely burst.

271
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,856
I'm going to do more
imaging to confirm.

272
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,380
And I'm going to track
your hemoglobin.

273
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:39,862
Now, if your blood count drops,
you will need surgery,

274
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,256
and we may have to
remove your ovary.

275
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,997
- Then you'll have to
take mine out, too.

276
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,346
- I'm sorry?

277
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:46,913
- We're identical.
- In every way.

278
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:48,871
- Well, we just want
to make sure we know

279
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,830
what we're dealing with here.

280
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,832
Dr. Taylor,
what would you recommend?

281
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,746
- A CBC, BMP,

282
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,358
transvaginal ultrasound,
and a pregnancy test.

283
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,839
- Okay. Good. Good.
- She's not pregnant.

284
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:03,712
- Well, just standard fare.
We'll get back to you.

285
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:09,718
Page Dr. Charles.
- Got it.

286
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,027
.

287
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,725
- We're the last people
who need a psychiatrist.

288
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:18,118
- We're very happy.
- I'm really glad to hear that.

289
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,902
- I'm feeling much better.

290
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:21,773
- It's probably
the hydromorphone,

291
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,211
the pain medication
we gave you.

292
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:27,910
Look, the tests have showed
that a cyst has ruptured,

293
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,825
and there's bleeding.

294
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,871
Well, Gemma,
you need an operation,

295
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,177
and if we can't
save your ovary,

296
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:35,787
we do have to remove it.

297
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:39,052
- Just as long
as they take mine, too.

298
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,793
- Why is that?
- So we have the same scar.

299
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,404
- But not just that.

300
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,536
We always planned to get
pregnant at the same time.

301
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,931
And If she can't,
I can't either.

302
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,238
- Oh, okay. All right.

303
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:55,503
So have you guys
always dressed exactly alike?

304
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:57,026
- No.
- No.

305
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,072
When we were kids,
our mother wouldn't let us.

306
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,030
- We hated that.

307
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,424
- As soon as we could,
we moved out.

308
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,513
Remember the first time
we bought matching dresses?

309
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:08,951
- It was heaven.
Now we do everything together.

310
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:11,519
- Hmm? Everything?

311
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,303
- Eat, sleep, take showers.

312
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,392
- Go to the bathroom.
- Wow.

313
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,438
- COVID was actually
really good for us.

314
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:18,918
- How's that?

315
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,442
- Lockdown, we were with one
another and no one else

316
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,226
for a year and a half.

317
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,446
- Brought us even closer.

318
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:28,318
- Kind of hard to--to tell
where one of you begins,

319
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,885
and the other one ends.

320
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,279
- Exactly.
both: We're one person.

321
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,330
- So look, it's not unusual
for monozygotic twins

322
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:42,463
to have a very strong bond.

323
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,030
- So that's normal?
- No. Not at all.

324
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:45,596
Not to this extent.

325
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,903
We're looking at an extreme
lack of individuation here.

326
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,122
- What does that mean?

327
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,080
- Well, normally,
when children develop,

328
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,342
even identical twins,

329
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,040
they start
to form a sense of self,

330
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,824
you know,
an individual identity.

331
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,000
Somehow, with these two, that
just--it just never happened.

332
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:00,133
- All right.
Okay, so they're--well,

333
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,482
what's the word
I'm supposed to use?

334
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,484
Delusional?
And now he's going to tell us

335
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,007
that they have
decisional capacity

336
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,400
and that we
can't force treatment.

337
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,054
- That's correct.
- See?

338
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,838
- I've been over it with them
a couple of times,

339
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,971
and they fully understand
the potential consequences.

340
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,885
- So what do we do?

341
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:16,497
- Well, we certainly can't
operate on the healthy twin.

342
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,152
- Are you seriously thinking
that I was considering that?

343
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,849
- You know, with your history,

344
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:22,546
I mean,
I guess you just never know.

345
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,896
- Is there any chance that this
will resolve without surgery?

346
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,159
- Yeah, a small one.

347
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,943
I mean, we can keep an eye
on her hemoglobin,

348
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,337
but if it drops lower
or she becomes unstable,

349
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,252
then we have to take her
to the OR.

350
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:35,081
- With their consent.
- Okay.

351
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,912
- Hey, Will,
I wanted to tell you,

352
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:43,350
I know your brother, Jay.
- Really? How's that?

353
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,178
- Used to be
in the same line of work.

354
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,006
- No kidding?

355
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,052
- Dr. Scott, we need
a peds consult over in Baghdad.

356
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:51,619
Ten-year-old girl.
Extremely lethargic.

357
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:54,056
- Catch you later.
- Yeah.

358
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:57,538
- It's not a diabetic issue.
Blood glucose is normal.

359
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,235
- Heat exhaustion?
- No. We hung fluids.

360
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,454
She hasn't responded.

361
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,891
- Hey, Jasmine.
Can you hear me?

362
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,371
- She's never like this.

363
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:09,071
- Jasmine? Hey.

364
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,377
- I wanna go home.

365
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,074
- That's better.

366
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,598
Now, can you squeeze
my fingers?

367
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,298
Good. Other side.

368
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,130
- Honey, do what
the doctor says.

369
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:25,522
- Jasmine, come one.

370
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,134
There you go. Thank you.

371
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,484
Motor and speech intact.

372
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:33,226
- Does Jasmine have any
pre-existing conditions

373
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,227
that we should know about?

374
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,229
- Well, when she was born,

375
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,708
they told me
that she had sickle cell.

376
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,320
But it doesn't seem to
bother her

377
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,452
other than getting some pain
once in a while.

378
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:43,975
- Head CT?

379
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:45,107
- Yeah, but I doubt
it'll tell us anything

380
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,543
we don't already know.
Maggie?

381
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,371
- Right here.

382
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,112
- You need to send Jasmine in
for a head CT.

383
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,983
- All right.
I'll let Radiology know.

384
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,987
- Ooh!
- Are you all right?

385
00:17:56,031 --> 00:18:00,122
- Yeah. Fine.
Just a little stiff.

386
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,472
- We also need to set up
for an exchange transfusion.

387
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:03,604
- Okay.

388
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,562
- A transfusion? Blood?

389
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,521
- Yeah. We believe
your daughter's condition

390
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,305
is because of her sickle cell.

391
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:12,221
- Blood with normal cells
will help her feel better.

392
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:14,658
- I'll make sure
they red cell phenotype.

393
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:18,227
Aleesha, you'll give us
the best match.

394
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:21,622
- We'll talk with you after
Jasmine has had her scan, okay?

395
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,189
All right.

396
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:30,587
- So do you think a guy
who orders

397
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,981
the same thing every day
is dependable or boring?

398
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:34,722
- Depends on the man.

399
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:37,638
- Hey, Matt.
- Will.

400
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:40,162
Hey, I thought
they gave you the boot.

401
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,164
- Turns out they can't live
without me.

402
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,297
If this guy's done
bothering you,

403
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,429
I'll take a chicken Caesar.

404
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:48,083
- Thanks, Skyler.

405
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,175
- It's been a while, huh?
- How's Moira?

406
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,482
- Good. And married.

407
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:59,573
- Wow, I blew that one.

408
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,488
- I'm sure you're doing fine.

409
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:06,145
- I'm married now.
Trying to be a good boy.

410
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:11,454
- You're not busy.
We should get a drink.

411
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:13,326
Catch up.

412
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,197
- Yeah, sure.

413
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,025
- Chicken Caesar.

414
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,332
- Hey, good to see you, man.

415
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,595
- Yeah. Take care.

416
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:26,513
- Dr. Archer, Dr. Taylor.

417
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:30,343
- Ow--ow!

418
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,692
- Help her!

419
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:34,085
- Another milligram
of hydromorphone.

420
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:36,697
- She's tachycardic
and hypotensive. Temp's 101.

421
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,612
- All right.
Only one unit of blood.

422
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,091
And a unit of FFP.

423
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,223
- Got it.

424
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,616
- All right, Gemma,
you are bleeding.

425
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,444
We need to get you up
to surgery right now.

426
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:47,142
- Take us both.
- I cannot do that.

427
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,230
- Then no surgery.

428
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,753
- All right,
listen to me, okay?

429
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:52,234
You could bleed to death.
You understand? You could die.

430
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,671
- You have to save her.
Take me to surgery.

431
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:01,330
- Anything? Hmm? Any ideas?

432
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:02,636
- Okay, let's get you
on your back.

433
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:03,811
Let's get you on your back.
One, two, three.

434
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,641
.

435
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:10,339
Her pain's lessened.
Fever's down.

436
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:12,428
The antibiotics are working,
but for how long?

437
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:15,214
- Yeah. Okay, thanks.

438
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,357
- We don't have anything
more to say.

439
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:29,576
- If you really want
to save Gemma,

440
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,360
you have to operate
on me first.

441
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:33,362
- You know, I've been thinking
about our first conversation.

442
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:35,582
And you mentioned that you--you

443
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,627
both wanted to get pregnant
at the same time.

444
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,586
And I-I absolutely appreciate.

445
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:41,588
how much joy that
that would bring you.

446
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,329
- We'll be okay.

447
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:44,982
- I'm sure you will.

448
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:48,638
But you also said
that sometimes you like

449
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,075
to think of yourself
as one person.

450
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,599
- We are one person.
- Okay.

451
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:56,472
Well, genetically, anyway,
you absolutely are, right?

452
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,257
You were born
from a single egg.

453
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,997
You share the same genes.

454
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,390
- Yeah, we know that. So?

455
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:04,654
- So if one of you were to
have a baby, say, Emma,

456
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:07,440
with her one ovary,
were to get pregnant,

457
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:11,357
well, it might as well be
Gemma's child too.

458
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,707
- That's true.
- So, in a sense,

459
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,625
you would be bringing a child
into the world together, right?

460
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:21,671
And I just still think
that that would be

461
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:24,631
a tremendously satisfying,
joyful experience

462
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:28,199
for the both of you,
I mean, wouldn't it?

463
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:34,075
- That sounds kind of
nice, Emmie.

464
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,514
- We'll think about it.

465
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,735
- Okay.

466
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:49,438
- Your daughter's scans confirm
what we had suspected.

467
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:50,744
Jasmine suffered a stroke.

468
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:55,401
- What? Stroke?
She's a little girl.

469
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,794
- The abnormal shape
of the red blood cells

470
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:00,014
can cause the blood
to become thicker,

471
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,711
which can cause clotting
and lead to stroke.

472
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,234
- When Jasmine was diagnosed,

473
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,671
didn't your doctor
tell you about that?

474
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,673
- No.

475
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:09,197
- Kids with sickle cell
should have a type of scan,

476
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,330
a Transcranial Doppler,
once a year,

477
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,070
to see if
they're prone to stroke.

478
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,464
I'm guessing nobody told you
about that either.

479
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:17,205
- No.
- And they should be

480
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,381
on a medicine
called Hydroxyurea.

481
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,904
- What is that?

482
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:23,385
- It helps the red blood cells
maintain a normal shape.

483
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,693
- Are you saying this
shouldn't have happened?

484
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:30,784
Jasmine, she shouldn't
be sick like this?

485
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:33,264
- I'm sorry, Ms. Russell.

486
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:38,095
- Oh my God.

487
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,837
I let this happen.
- No.

488
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,317
- My baby.

489
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,580
- No, this--this was
not your fault.

490
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,234
- I'm her mother.

491
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:49,324
I'm her mother.
I'm supposed to protect her.

492
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,719
- This is your doctors' fault.
They should've told you.

493
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,851
- It doesn't appear
that Jasmine's stroke

494
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:57,593
was very severe.
She'll recover,

495
00:22:57,637 --> 00:23:00,553
and we can make sure
that this never happens again.

496
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,511
- She's getting a transfusion,

497
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,383
and she should get better
right away.

498
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:08,125
- I just wanna be with her.

499
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:21,269
- Why didn't anyone tell her?

500
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,880
- Where were you
working before here?

501
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,883
- Grosse Pointe.
Beaumont Hospital.

502
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:31,497
- Ah. Well, this happens a lot
to kids who have sickle cell.

503
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,499
Less than 50% get screened.

504
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,240
On the other hand,
kids with cystic fibrosis.

505
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:39,722
Well, they get a case manager,
regular check-ups.

506
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,332
- 'Cause most CF patients
are white.

507
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:42,856
- Mm-hmm.

508
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,771
- Yeah, I get it.

509
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:55,477
- So the twins have agreed
to Gemma's surgery?

510
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,740
- Yeah, that's what I hear.
Good news, right?

511
00:23:57,784 --> 00:24:02,136
- Yeah. Sounds like you played
into their fantasy.

512
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,442
- Yeah, maybe a bit.

513
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,879
But can't really address
their psychiatric issues

514
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,837
if one of them is dead.

515
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:11,754
Whatever you say.

516
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:14,757
- Cesar, what have we got?
- 60-year-old female.

517
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:17,281
Hour prior to arrival, she had
an ataxic gait, garbled speech.

518
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:19,893
Lost consciousness
in the ambo, and we intubated.

519
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,634
No corneal reflexes. No gag.

520
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,374
- Nancy, Dr. Taylor, with me.

521
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,465
- Help her, please.
- Sir--sir, we're going to

522
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,771
take care of her.
Angel.

523
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,253
- How are things
with you and Dr. Taylor?

524
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:38,172
- Ugh! She keeps her distance.
And I try to keep mine.

525
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,696
- Well, it's not so easy.

526
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,395
Not easy for most mothers,
but you'll keep trying.

527
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,788
- Right.

528
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:49,531
- Ooh, Dr. Halstead.
- Yeah.

529
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:52,665
- So?
- Yeah, I said we should

530
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:55,581
go out for drinks, catch up.
- Good.

531
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:57,974
- Matt didn't seem
that enthusiastic.

532
00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,846
I don't know if it'll happen.

533
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:02,283
- Well, you'll make it happen.

534
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:05,547
- Dr. Halstead.

535
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:06,896
- Excuse me.

536
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,381
- BP's even lower.

537
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,209
- Yeah. I was afraid
the morphine wouldn't work.

538
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:16,819
- I need to take her
to surgery.

539
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,342
- And do what exactly?

540
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:20,519
- Replace the valve.
Unhook her. Let's go.

541
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,259
- Well, the primary problem
isn't the valve.

542
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:23,783
It's the outflow track.
It's obstructed.

543
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:25,262
She needs a completely
different procedure

544
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:26,786
from what you're suggesting.

545
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,875
- What I see is severe
mitral valve regurgitation

546
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:30,572
and an enlarged heart.
Let's go. Okay, guys, come on.

547
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:32,313
- Crockett, you asked me
to consult

548
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,228
because you know
I know this patient.

549
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:35,751
- I understand.
But I don't have

550
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,100
precise measurements, and
we don't have a cardiac cath.

551
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:38,624
- So, do a cardiac cath.
You'll see I'm right.

552
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,364
- I don't have time
to screw around, Will.

553
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:42,410
With her condition this bad,
I need to operate now.

554
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:43,759
- Yeah, and the bigger
the procedure

555
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,369
the bigger the fee, right?

556
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:46,893
But, hey, Medicare's
paying for it.

557
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:49,286
- Keep going.
What was that?

558
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,766
You think
that's what I'm about?

559
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,942
Padding my bill?

560
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:56,380
- No. No, I don't.
Forget it, man.

561
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:00,428
- That's my patient.
I'm taking her to surgery.

562
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,042
We all set with
the valve sizers?

563
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:07,957
- Yeah.
We've got both mechanical

564
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,698
and biosynthetic valves.

565
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:12,658
- Good.
- Hey, Will.

566
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,790
My scrub nurse
told me you were up here.

567
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:18,620
- Yeah. Patient
from the clinical trial.

568
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,840
- Oh, so already a history
of heart failure?

569
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,493
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

570
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:27,368
Not using a Vas-COM
to monitor cardiac output.

571
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,631
- I guess not.

572
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,633
- Vas-COM's really
a lot more accurate.

573
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,026
- Oh, yeah?
- I don't want to

574
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,636
step on any toes here,

575
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,378
but you might
want to suggest it.

576
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:39,772
- Yeah, sure.
Crockett.

577
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,512
- Yeah.
- Dr. Cooper thinks

578
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:42,862
you should use a Vas-COM.

579
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:45,952
- Oh? Hey, Matt.

580
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,867
Well, I've got this
handled, bud.

581
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,564
Old set-up's just fine,
all right?

582
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,087
- Yeah.

583
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,655
Sorry, your patient.
Didn't mean to intrude.

584
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:56,092
- Yeah. Okay, then.

585
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:59,835
- Vas-COM really should be
standard of care.

586
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,751
Well, he'll come around.

587
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,885
- Okay, let's replace
the valve.

588
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:07,800
- Hold on.
- What?

589
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:10,672
- This doesn't look valvular.

590
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:14,371
TEE indicates a sub-aortic
outflow obstruction.

591
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,595
- Can you calculate
a gradient for me?

592
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,555
- Gradient is 70MM of mercury.

593
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,514
- Consistent with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

594
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:27,646
- Yeah.

595
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,691
- All right, folks,
change of plans.

596
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,519
We are not gonna
replace the valve.

597
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:33,739
We're gonna move to a myectomy.

598
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:39,483
â™ª

599
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:44,358
.

600
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,229
- How's Ms. Jasmine doing?

601
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:47,666
- She's sleeping.

602
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:53,672
- Good. Why don't you step out?
Hmm?

603
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:59,286
There's some coffee over
at the Nurses' Station.

604
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,289
- Could use some.

605
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:07,947
Oh--ooh!

606
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,036
Oh God.
- Let me help you. Okay.

607
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,734
- Here, I got you.
- No. Please, I'm okay.

608
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,736
- No, let's just get you
where you can lie down.

609
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,998
- I'm going to get you
two ready, okay?

610
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,304
- All right.

611
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:19,610
- Come on. Just take it easy.

612
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,351
- Come right here.

613
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:23,658
- Okay.
- Nice and slow.

614
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,056
- I don't need anything.

615
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,362
- Your knees are giving you
a lot of trouble.

616
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:35,583
- Aleesha, let the doctors
take a look, okay?

617
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:36,932
- Did you injure yourself?

618
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,629
- No.

619
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:41,458
- Burning sensation?

620
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:44,331
- Let's get an x-ray.
- Okay.

621
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,865
- Clear.

622
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:02,871
- Your knees
are severely arthritic.

623
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:04,655
How long have
they been like this?

624
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:06,962
- I don't know. Few months.

625
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:10,052
- Have you seen a doctor?

626
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,576
- Told me to take some aspirin.

627
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,665
- We're going to give you
something

628
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:18,931
a little more effective.
Toradol, 30 mg, IM.

629
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,803
Your hips seem to be giving you
a lot of pain as well.

630
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,632
Aleesha?

631
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:26,721
- Yeah.

632
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:29,898
- There you go.

633
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:32,727
- I have to ask...

634
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,600
are you living in your car?

635
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:44,870
- No. Why'd you ask me that?

636
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:49,396
- You're very young to have
such advanced arthritis.

637
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:52,616
And you're not overweight.
I'm sorry.

638
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:56,359
I don't mean to embarrass you,

639
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:58,971
but I've seen arthritis
like this in people

640
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:01,495
who sleep sitting up
in the confines of a car.

641
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:11,940
I'm only asking
so that we can help you.

642
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:15,117
Aleesha?

643
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:20,819
It's okay. It's okay.

644
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:25,040
We're going to get you
some meds to manage the pain,

645
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:26,868
maybe a brace.

646
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:29,740
Get you in
a physical therapy program.

647
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:31,177
The important thing
is exercise.

648
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,875
Gotta get you moving.

649
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:38,184
It's going to be okay.

650
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:45,582
â™ª

651
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:47,149
- Okay.

652
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:50,065
- That was an impressive call.

653
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:52,024
How'd you guess they were
sleeping in their car?

654
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,590
- Oh, you mean,
the Grosse Pointe thing?

655
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:56,767
Actually, I was surprised
you didn't catch it.

656
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,160
I mean, don't cops

657
00:30:58,204 --> 00:30:59,901
have a lot of experience
with homeless folks?

658
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:01,163
- Oh, you mean like,

659
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,513
"Move along,
you can't sleep here"?

660
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:05,776
- Yeah, just like that.
- Yeah.

661
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,867
- Yeah.

662
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:13,567
- I need a doctor.

663
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,011
- You better go in.

664
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:38,722
- You need to call it.

665
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:59,569
- Time of death, 1605.

666
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,270
I am so sorry.
The stroke was too massive.

667
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:07,142
There was nothing
that we could do.

668
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,080
- I know that was hard.

669
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,131
I'm sorry.

670
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:53,014
- Dr. Halstead.

671
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,929
- Ms. Goodwin, I can't do this.

672
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,887
I am not the guy
for what you need.

673
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:58,193
I'm uncomfortable.

674
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:01,675
I don't like being suspicious
of people, lying.

675
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:03,764
So if my staying here
is dependent

676
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:05,244
on doing this for you,

677
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:06,854
I'd just as soon work
somewhere else.

678
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:09,770
- Hold on. I was expecting
this conversation.

679
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:12,033
I've got something
I want you to see.

680
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,864
- What's this?
- A recent case.

681
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:19,127
Young man, 23 years old.

682
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:21,347
After insertion of a Vas-COM
catheter,

683
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,350
he developed infection,
gangrene.

684
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:27,875
Spent two weeks in the ICU,
and lost his leg.

685
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:31,618
If the Vas-COM was indeed
an unnecessary procedure,

686
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:35,622
then this was a tragedy
that never should've happened.

687
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:45,327
- Okay.

688
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:48,243
So it's not a big procedure.

689
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,376
Probably won't take more
than an hour. You ready?

690
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,291
Okay, Camila?

691
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:55,642
- Gemma, I'm going to put you
to sleep now.

692
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:58,384
Can you count back from ten?

693
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:02,170
- Ten, nine...

694
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:10,700
- How are you doing?

695
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:20,319
Emma, I know what a difficult
decision this was for you

696
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:22,930
and your sister. I do.

697
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:25,106
- We always wanted
to have babies.

698
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,328
- You can.
And, trust me,

699
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:32,896
I know that you would come to
think of them as both of yours.

700
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:38,076
What?

701
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,296
- I'm sorry.

702
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,386
- For what?
You're sorry for what, Emma?

703
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:49,043
- I didn't want her to do it.
She wouldn't listen.

704
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,305
- Do what?

705
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:56,398
No. No.

706
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:02,143
Stop the surgery!
- What the hell, Dan?

707
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:05,146
- They switched places.
That's not Gemma.

708
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,843
It's not her.

709
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:21,119
.

710
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,685
- While your dad's
getting the car,

711
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:23,730
we got a minute to talk.

712
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,993
- Oh, man.

713
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,038
- Your little
knucklehead friends?

714
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:30,954
You're done with them.
I mean it.

715
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:33,783
You see that cop over there?
He works the West Side.

716
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:35,611
He sees you over there,
he's going to tell me,

717
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:40,225
and I'm going to tell your dad.
Ah, there he is now.

718
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,227
- Thanks, Doc.

719
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,752
- Yeah. He's a fine young man.
Keep an eye on him.

720
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,057
I don't want to
see him here again

721
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,842
- You can count on that.

722
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:50,887
I still don't see
how he got bit by a snake.

723
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:53,629
- Yeah, we have to
ask him that.

724
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:54,935
- Seems like we need

725
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:58,156
to have a discussion
when we get back home.

726
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:07,121
- Hey, stay safe, all right?

727
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,950
People care about you.

728
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,834
- They have matching scars now.

729
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:27,010
Maybe that'll be enough
to satisfy them.

730
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,709
- You know, I've been doing
this almost 40 years.

731
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,798
Never have I ever...

732
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,148
- I mean, not even close.

733
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,803
- Yeah, they really did
hoodwink us, didn't they?

734
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:39,414
But at least you caught it
before I took her ovary out.

735
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,068
I'd say that's a win.

736
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,204
What? You're wondering
if I'm being genuine, huh?

737
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:49,207
See, that's the curse
of being a shrink.

738
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,905
- Hmm.

739
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:59,260
- Hey, so you were right.
You did know your patient.

740
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,223
- You know,
Natalie's mom is doing well.

741
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:10,010
In large part thanks to you.

742
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:11,881
- That's nice to hear.

743
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:15,711
You miss her?

744
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,937
- Yeah.

745
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:30,378
- Yeah, me too.

746
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:33,468
I'll see you tomorrow.

747
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:37,733
- Yeah. See you tomorrow.

748
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,484
- You're admitting this patient
with sickle cell?

749
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:52,400
- Yeah.
Just waiting on a bed upstairs.

750
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,925
- Good work today.

751
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:01,975
- They'll bring in
a cot for Aleesha.

752
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:05,195
Kid has to have a stroke
for her mom to get a bed.

753
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:08,329
- Med's running a gene
therapy trial for sickle cell.

754
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:11,245
Possible cure.
If I can enroll Jasmine,

755
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,291
Aleesha will have a bed
for more than just a night.

756
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:50,328
- Mom? It's me, Mom.

757
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,993
- Can I come inside?

758
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,258
- Step over that.

759
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,969
- It's taken me a while
to find you.

760
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:24,318
What happened to the van?

761
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,886
- Broke down.

762
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:29,454
- You been taking your meds?

763
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:31,412
- I thought you moved.

764
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:34,241
- I'm back now.

765
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:39,289
Here, let me have a listen.

766
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:49,212
- I ran out.
- I'll get you more pills.

767
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:53,391
Deep breath.

768
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,612
You sound a little congested.

769
00:39:57,656 --> 00:40:00,354
- Yeah. Well, just so you know,
I got vaccinated.

770
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,008
I'm not stupid.

771
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,271
- Okay.

772
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:07,535
But Mom, please, we've got
to get you off the streets.

773
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:13,193
- I can take care of myself.
- No. You're not doing that.

774
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:17,502
No. I'm not going to
let you live like this.

775
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:20,026
Hear me?

776
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:29,078
