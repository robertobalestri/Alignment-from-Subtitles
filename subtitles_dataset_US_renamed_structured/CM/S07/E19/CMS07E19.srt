that the baby might

176
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,475
be born with spinal
muscular atrophy.

177
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:58,434
- SMA, that's
a serious condition.

178
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,305
I'm surprised you didn't
mention this earlier.

179
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:03,091
- I guess I was trying
not to think about it too much.

180
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:04,875
Could that be the cause
of the swelling?

181
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,703
- Perhaps,
but it's hard to tell.

182
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,836
Let's see what the lab has
to say about the blood test.

183
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,272
- Okay.

184
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,622
- You're gonna have
one more pinch.

185
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,929
Here we go...

186
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,452
- Hey, buddy.

187
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,410
Got a patient
asking for you by name,

188
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:22,110
a Gerald Simmons, a navy vet.
Ring a bell?

189
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,590
- Can't say it does.
What's he in for?

190
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,635
- Severe headaches,
chest palpitations.

191
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,289
BP's jumping out of the gym.

192
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:30,248
I'm setting him up
for an EKG as we speak.

193
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:33,469
CPO Simmons,
allow me to present

194
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,558
Lieutenant Commander
Ethan Choi.

195
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:39,431
- At your service, chief.
I'll take over, Trish.

196
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,303
I apologize,
but it's getting so I

197
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,000
can't remember all
the patients I've seen.

198
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,393
Have we met before?

199
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:48,136
- No, but I got
a recommendation

200
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:50,312
from the VA that
you were a good doctor.

201
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,661
- They didn't say anything
about me?

202
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,794
My feelings are hurt.

203
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:56,231
- Gerald,
I see your BP's 170/110.

204
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:57,580
It's good you came in.

205
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,756
- Yeah, start him
on a nicardipine drip for that.

206
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,149
- On it.

207
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:03,064
- You got some
serious-looking scars here.

208
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,196
Can I ask
where you got this one?

209
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,070
- I had a valve replaced
almost ten years ago now.

210
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,550
- And this other one?

211
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,552
- Appendectomy when
I was a kid.

212
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,249
- You know, when you're
done taking inventory,

213
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,642
you should check out his ink.

214
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,339
It's pretty cool.

215
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:27,262
- I'm sorry,
I don't know why I did that.

216
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,873
- That's okay.

217
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,658
- Oh...

218
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,094
- What is it?

219
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:34,617
- It feels like something's
sitting on my chest...

220
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,184
- It's his heart,
start bagging him.

221
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,231
I'll start compressions.

222
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:42,582
- Yeah, no pulse,
all right, he's in V-fib.

223
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,196
♪

224
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,981
Charge to 200.

225
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,244
Clear.

226
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,031
- Got a pulse.

227
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,250
- All right,
sinus tach, hold CPR.

228
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,557
- Keep bagging,
let's get him intubated.

229
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,086
- Hello, I'm Dr. Scott.

230
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,697
This is our charge nurse,
Maggie Lockwood.

231
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,829
- I'm Caitlin.
This is my husband, Theo.

232
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,702
- Okay, and you must be Zoe.
So what's going on?

233
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,052
- We were leaving a restaurant
just outside the city.

234
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,227
- We're on a road trip,

235
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,881
we're visiting my sister
in Cleveland.

236
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,405
- And Zoe couldn't walk from
the restaurant back to the car.

237
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,668
- Some idiot janitor
mopped the bathroom floor

238
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:26,800
but didn't put a sign up.

239
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,236
- So you fell
on the slippery floor?

240
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,716
- Well, we didn't
see that happen.

241
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,544
- You don't believe me?
- We don't believe you, no.

242
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,416
- I'm sorry,
am I missing something?

243
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,374
- Zoe's had a history
of alcohol issues.

244
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:37,332
We think
that's why she can't walk--

245
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,899
- Are you serious right now?

246
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:41,075
I fell and hurt myself, but you
think I've been drinking?

247
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,643
- We can smell it on you, Zoe.
How dumb do you think we are?

248
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,688
- Pretty dumb, actually,
because I haven't had

249
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,951
one sip of alcohol in months.
- Calm down.

250
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:50,780
- How embarrassing this is.

251
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,260
- You all right, Zoe?

252
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,745
- Here.

253
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:03,097
- Okay, CBC, CMP,
blood and urine tox,

254
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,620
and blood alcohol.

255
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,797
Plus a chest X-ray and CT
abdomen and pelvis

256
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,016
to see about that fall.

257
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:10,452
All right, that should give us

258
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,672
a clear idea of what's
going on here, yeah?

259
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:18,590
- Well, that was strange, huh?

260
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,375
- Yeah, weird timing on the MI,
for sure.

261
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,072
- I'm talking about
him touching you that way.

262
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,291
You think he mistook you
for someone else?

263
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,771
- No, I think he
was more confused

264
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,555
than anything else,
given his condition.

265
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,949
Except, you know that
tattoo he had on his arm?

266
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,602
- Nautical star?

267
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:33,736
- Yeah, my father had one just
like it, in the same location.

268
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,390
- Well, perhaps
they served together.

269
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,783
I'm guessing they're
probably the same age.

270
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,523
Hey, Trish,
please start a normal

271
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,047
cardiac work up, would ya?

272
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:45,313
Chest X-ray and a blood gas,
trops, CBC, CMP, and an EKG.

273
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,014
- Well, this is
a nice surprise.

274
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,930
- Hey, Felicia, uh,
you're not at work, are you?

275
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:56,106
- Uh, no, not today.

276
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,066
I'm actually heading
to your Dad's to pack up

277
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,328
the last of his stuff.

278
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,504
- Perfect, um,
you think I could ask you

279
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,462
to do me a big favor?

280
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:11,208
- Do we have a lunch date
I forgot about?

281
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,123
- No, Daniel,
I'm here for a patient.

282
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,342
- Oh.

283
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,778
- I've been following
the news on Luis.

284
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:17,998
I read that he was brought
over here this morning.

285
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,390
- Luis Pena's your patient?

286
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,784
- Yes, for many years,
but we haven't had

287
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:25,309
a session for a long time, so.
- Oh.

288
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,442
- Oh, God, Luis.
- Yeah.

289
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:29,400
- Have you
gotten him to eat yet?

290
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,620
- No, he's very serious
about this.

291
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,230
You should definitely
have a chat with him.

292
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,884
- I will. Want to come in?

293
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:35,972
- Yeah.

294
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,542
- Labs are back on that
PUBS test you requested.

295
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,239
- Oh, great, thanks, Trini.
- Yeah.

296
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:46,722
- Looks like the baby's anemic.

297
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,376
We need to transfuse him,
try to buy him a little

298
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,681
more time in utero.

299
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,206
- That's weird,
it says the baby's

300
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:53,729
blood type is O-positive.

301
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,209
- Yeah, so?

302
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:58,647
- Yeah, that's what I thought--
Ingrid's is AB-negative.

303
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,518
- That's not
medically possible.

304
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,825
- Ingrid can't be
this baby's mother.

305
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:08,613
♪

306
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:13,009
.

307
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:17,361
- I mean, technically, I'm not
the baby's biological mother.

308
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:20,495
I'm a surrogate.
I mean, I was a surrogate.

309
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:22,149
- Was?

310
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,891
- You remember that
genetic panel I told you about?

311
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:27,545
The one
that said the baby had SMA?

312
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:28,938
When the couple found out,

313
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,898
they decided
to terminate the pregnancy.

314
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,074
- But you didn't.

315
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,815
- I just--I just couldn't.

316
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,381
- Were the parents
made aware of that?

317
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,035
- What does that matter?

318
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:41,385
They--they didn't
want the baby anyway.

319
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,560
- Okay, you know what,
this is something that

320
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:43,910
we can discuss later.

321
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,825
What's important now
is the health of the baby.

322
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,217
So we're gonna start
by transfusing him

323
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,698
with some blood, see if that
helps cure the anemia.

324
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,265
- Okay, thank you.

325
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:53,093
- Dr. Asher?

326
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:59,273
So we have to confirm this
with the biological parents.

327
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,971
- I'm not sure that
that's our responsibility,

328
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,886
especially if the parents
gave up the baby.

329
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,062
- Well, we don't know
if that's true.

330
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:07,498
Look how long it took her
to tell us about

331
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,675
the genetic defects.
- Why would she be lying?

332
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,982
- Bottom line, she can't
ghost the parents like that.

333
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,984
They have every right
to know what's going on.

334
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:17,900
We have to notify legal
so they can contact them.

335
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,293
- You're right, okay.

336
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:27,518
- What I'm seeing here
worries me--worries us.

337
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:29,869
You are risking your life now.

338
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,392
- I'm doing
what needs to be done.

339
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,916
- But haven't
you made your point?

340
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,483
- Last I checked,
nothing's changed.

341
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:38,007
They're still relocating
the metal shredder.

342
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:40,923
- Then I don't think
I have made my point.

343
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,144
- Mindy, I'd like to have
a moment alone with Luis.

344
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,015
- No, he wants me here.

345
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:50,628
- Okay, I have to tell you,
she doesn't have

346
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:51,847
your best interests at heart.

347
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,284
Her priority is her story.

348
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:58,723
- I called Mindy.
I initiated the contact.

349
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:02,858
- Considering what you and I
have dealt with in the past,

350
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,470
I think you
can understand my concern.

351
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,951
- You see the old me.

352
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,779
You don't see that
this is important.

353
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:17,917
- Um, Dr. Richardson,
quick word, please?

354
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:24,967
♪

355
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,100
I just feel like
I'm missing something.

356
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,579
Can I get
a little more history?

357
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:31,060
- Luis tried to take
his life three years ago.

358
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:33,410
He's been struggling
with depression his whole life.

359
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,934
- Okay.

360
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,326
- I mean, what if this is
just another suicide attempt?

361
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,198
We should
have him on a psych hold.

362
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,764
- But even if you're right,
you know, a psych hold's not

363
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:42,158
gonna solve the problem
of getting him to eat.

364
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:44,900
We can't force feed him,
he has capacity.

365
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,338
- I am terrified that he's
going to take his own life.

366
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,166
- I get that,
but unfortunately,

367
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,213
we just--we don't have
the legal grounds to stop him.

368
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,304
- So your
CT scans are negative.

369
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,175
I'm not seeing any injury
from a fall.

370
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:02,309
But your blood-alcohol content
is very high

371
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:05,181
at .240 grams per deciliter.

372
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,183
- You're drunk, we knew it.

373
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,751
I'm not! It's a mistake.

374
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,927
- We've got to get you
into some kind of program.

375
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,016
Can you help us with that?

376
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,149
- Of course.
- I didn't drink anything.

377
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,455
- All right, stop lying, Zoe,
okay, that's enough.

378
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,762
- I'm not lying.
- Just stop, it's insulting.

379
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,024
You're slurring your words.

380
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:24,070
- It's insulting,
you're slurring your words.

381
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:26,376
- Uh, get a line,
hang a liter of saline.

382
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,464
- You got it.

383
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:28,944
- We're going to
hydrate Zoe, okay?

384
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,641
She should
sober up pretty soon.

385
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:35,255
- How's our squid?

386
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:38,040
- Not sure,
tachycardia's still persistent.

387
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,650
Doesn't appear to have
damaged any heart muscle,

388
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:42,436
but cardiology wants
to cath him to make sure.

389
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,655
- And his BP?
- Still elevated.

390
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,093
- Even after the nicardipine?
- Yeah.

391
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,572
- That's odd.

392
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,705
All right, let's add
an esmolol drip on top.

393
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:53,099
See if we can't get
that back under control.

394
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,891
- Hey, Ethan!
- Hey.

395
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,414
- Hey.

396
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,460
Hope this was what
you were looking for.

397
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:08,505
- Thank you, I know
it's a huge inconvenience.

398
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:11,552
- Ah, it's not that big a deal.
I like coming into Chicago.

399
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,336
Actually, wondering if
maybe you

400
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,599
want to grab a bite after work?

401
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:16,948
- Yeah, I'd like that.

402
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,950
- Great.

403
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:21,170
So what are you hoping to find?

404
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:24,130
- I think my patient
knew my father.

405
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:31,093
Uh, you wanna take a look?
- Yeah.

406
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:34,227
- Here they are,
doctors Asher and Halstead.

407
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,924
This is
Meg and Jonathan Harris,

408
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,317
they just got in from Indiana.

409
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,448
- Ingrid was our surrogate.

410
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,102
- I can't believe
this is happening.

411
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:42,104
- I'm sorry.
- How is she?

412
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,411
We heard the baby's
having some swelling?

413
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:45,934
- That's because
of the Type 1 SMA.

414
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,979
- Actually, we're not sure
those things are related.

415
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:49,807
- How could they not be?

416
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:53,333
Weak muscles, inability
to swallow, collapsed lungs.

417
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:55,204
Median survival rate
of less than a year.

418
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:56,423
That's what this baby
has to look forward to.

419
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:59,295
- We didn't want this,
for him to suffer.

420
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:01,819
When we made
the decision to terminate,

421
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:04,126
Ingrid and I
sat together and cried.

422
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,346
- I understand.
- What do we do now?

423
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,913
- Well, from this hospital's
perspective, Mr. Harris,

424
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:11,612
right now, our top priority
is the health of the mother

425
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,788
and the baby.
- Ingrid is not the mother.

426
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,485
My wife is the mother.

427
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,922
Ingrid had a contract with us,
and what she's doing is wrong.

428
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,098
- I don't understand.

429
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,578
Why--why she did this?

430
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:22,927
Our poor baby.

431
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:25,278
- Dr. Asher, it's Ingrid.
The baby's heart rate.

432
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,583
- Great, thank you--excuse me.

433
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:28,019
- Ingrid's here
in the emergency room?

434
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:30,021
- Mr. and Mrs. Harris, please!

435
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:34,156
- What--what's going on?

436
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,592
- Fetal heart rate decels.

437
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:37,246
- The baby didn't
tolerate the procedure.

438
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,161
- What have you done, Ingrid?

439
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,815
- What are they doing here?

440
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,513
- How could you do this to us,
to our baby?

441
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,689
- Mr. and Mrs. Harris,
you have to leave, please.

442
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,996
- Let's open the Hybrid O.R.
for an emergency C-section.

443
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,085
This baby
needs to be delivered now.

444
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,264

445
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:56,744
- Wow.

446

I haven't looked
through this in years.

447
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,923
- Patrick looked so handsome
in his uniform.

448
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,838
Bet it runs in the family.

449
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,624
So what exactly
are you looking for?

450
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:11,628
- This guy says we've never
met before, but I don't know,

451
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,630
there something about him
that seemed familiar.

452
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,766
There, that's it.

453
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:19,984
That's the picture
I was thinking of.

454
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,595
- Could that be your patient?

455
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:24,075
- Gerald, yeah.
Certainly looks like him.

456
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,078
And, see, they both
have the same tattoo.

457
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:28,602
- So I guess they
did serve together.

458
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,560
That's pretty remarkable.

459
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:35,565
Wow, your father's
so young in this photo.

It's funny.

461
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,830
He got older, but he didn't
really change much.

462
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:43,138
- Yeah, change--
the scar, that's it,

463
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,400
that would explain it.
- Explain what?

464
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,706

469

Look at the coloring,
then look at this.

470
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,635

50 years ago?

I mean, come on,
photos age, right?

See how the pigmentation
has changed?

- Yeah, I don't know, maybe.

475
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:13,342
- I think he has
a pheochromocytoma.

476
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:14,691
- An adrenal gland tumor?

477
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,432

your approval to get this scan.
