2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,831
- You're on my team,
that's all.

3
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,007
It's better this way.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,357
- Not the way I see it.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,489
- She's been you therapist
for years, what happened?

6
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:14,492
- I thought what I missed
was the work.

7
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:18,235
Maybe what
I really miss is you.

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,499
- Exposing the abuse
of the Vas-COM was brave.

9
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,762
- The Vas-COM business,
playing nice with the enemy,

10
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:26,243
it sucked, but I needed
to protect patients.

11
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:29,246
- Turns out whistleblowers
are entitled to a reward.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,552
How about that?

13
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,688
- Wait, so Vasik settled
with the Feds?

14
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,342
- Well, there's still
some state and criminal cases

15
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:40,866
going forward,
but from our position--

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,043
- It's over, Will.

17
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,348
- But as whistleblowers,

18
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,307
you and Ms. Goodwin
are entitled

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,614
to a percentage
of the settlement.

20
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:52,095
- What are we--
what are we talking about?

21
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:56,882
- You've each been awarded
$1.2 million.

22
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:58,275
- 1.2?

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,149
Oh...

24
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:06,153
What does that even mean?

25
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:07,632
- I know it's a lot to take in,

26
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,808
but news like this
is a great opportunity

27
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:13,638
for you and the hospital.

28
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:16,728
- Sharon Goodwin's volunteered
to gift her entire settlement

29
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:19,079
to Gaffney's
charitable foundation.

30
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:21,342
- Insisted, really.

31
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:24,214
Now, there's no pressure,
but I'm putting together

32
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:26,129
a little press event
for the end of the day

33
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:28,131
to officially announce
the donation,

34
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:33,745
and it'd be even more impactful
if you were a part of it.

35
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:38,228
As Mrs. Goodwin said,
she didn't do it for the money.

36
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:40,404
I'm sure the same
is true for you.

37
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:42,537
- I-I didn't even know
there'd be money.

38
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,886
- You know,
you'd really be sending

39
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,368
a very strong message
to your colleagues, Will.

40
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:50,675
- Right.
- So what do you say?

41
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:57,334
Can we take that as a "yes"?

42
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:58,683
It's feeling like a "yes".

00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,887
I'll be walking down
the aisle with her son

177
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:20,500
with an ostomy bag
under my dress.

178
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,240
- Dr. Archer's
recommending surgery?

179
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:25,330
- He said
it's the only option I had.

180
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:36,037
- So you just signed it over?

181
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,299
The whole enchilada?

182
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:38,779
What are doing--
trying to fast-track

183
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,302
your application to sainthood?

184
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,564
You're crazy.

185
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,087
- Please, people are
making too much of it.

186
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:46,308
I want to hear about you.
What's going on with Lonnie?

187
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:49,267
- Well, as you know,
the State Psychiatry Board

188
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:52,444
frowns on therapists having
any kind of romantic relations

189
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:54,098
with their patients,
and vice versa,

190
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,144
for at least a year
after their last session,

191
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:58,407
and it's only been ten months,
so, not a whole lot.

192
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:03,107
That's soon enough.
What happens now?

193
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:05,109
- It's actually kinda weird,
right?

194
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,676
It's awkward, I--
last time I saw her,

195
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,025
I put something out there,

196
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,506
and I haven't heard
anything back.

197
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,986
It'd been like a week.

198
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,814
- Well, keep me in the loop
'cause you know

199
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,990
I live vicariously through you.

200
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,557
- You know I will.
- Okay.

201
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,518
- So patient in six,
you're thinking

202
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,041
delusional parasitosis?

203
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:26,174
- I found no evidence
of parasites.

204
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,784
Tox screen and sed rate
were negative.

205
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:30,265
All of her injuries appear
to be self-inflicted.

206
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,920
The lab did an analysis of the
mite larvae she brought in.

207
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:35,009
It was a dried pea.
- Hmm.

208
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,924
So CT, MRI,

209
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,362
no signs of striatal lesions
or--or tumors.

210
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:42,016
Any history of mental illness?

211
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,539
- No, not in
her medical records,

212
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,716
but she's certainly presenting
as delusional now.

213
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,718
Look, I know it's not
my area of expertise,

214
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,633
but I'm just not sure
what else it could be.

215
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:51,895
- Could very well be right,

216
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,246
but if she is
in fact delusional,

217
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,031
probably gonna be hostile
to the idea of even

218
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,773
seeing a psychiatrist, so.

219
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,905
We've gotta tread carefully,

220
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,298
and might even need
to improvise.

221
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,085
- They're impossible
to get rid of.

222
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,696
I've had to reupholster my car.

223
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,480
Twice.

224
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,395
I don't even bother
doing laundry anymore.

225
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:16,050
I just wear things once,
then throw them away.

226
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,617
Except for my suit, of course.

227
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,010
- It sounds
completely exhausting.

228
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,360
- There's not even
a word for it.

229
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,101
- And you haven't
been able to find

230
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:27,061
any medication that'll give you
any relief at all?

231
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,454
- My dermatologists
have tried them all.

232
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:32,762
Antihistamines,
corticosteroids.

233
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:35,417
Was your lab able to identify
what kind of mite it is?

234
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,811
- You know, I think we're still
working on that.

235
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:40,683
But you know, in the meantime,
I'd like to add another

236
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,946
more targeted drug to help you
with those bites.

237
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,166
Would that be all right?
- Okay.

238
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,646
- Okay, great.

239
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,822
Well, I will go find
a nurse to hang a dose,

240
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:51,520
and I'll be right back.

241
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,699
- Your supervisor
seems like a nice man.

242
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:59,136
- Dr. Charles, yeah, he is.

243
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,139
So Abby, it says here
that you first noticed

244
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,402
the infestation a little over
18 months ago.

245
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,013
- Yeah.

246
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:07,623
- Can you remember what else
was going on

247
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,277
in your life at the time?

248
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,279
- Like, uh--
like, what do you mean?

249
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:14,021
- Like, were you
having problems

250
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:17,067
in your relationships
or your career?

251
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:21,202
Had you recently moved
or relocated?

252
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:23,378
- Are you suggesting that
this is all in my head?

253
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:24,684
- No--

254
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,468
- You don't think I know
how to read the signs?

255
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:27,774
I've gone through
enough doctors to know

256
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:30,124
when they think I'm crazy--
I am not crazy!

257
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,302
How do I get myself discharged?

258
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,477
I want to go
to another hospital.

259
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,305
- What's going on?
Is there a problem?

260
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:38,959
- Yes, your underling
here is trying to convince me

261
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:39,960
that I'm crazy.

262
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:42,745
- Really, Dr. Taylor?

263
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:44,051
Could you wait
for me outside please?

264
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:50,318
♪

265
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:53,974
- Look, I'm not delusional.

266
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,192
- I'm so sorry about that.

267
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,325
Look, I'm going
to be supervising

268
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,413
your case going forward.

269
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:00,807
Will that be all right?

270
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,331
Good, now, let's see if
we can do something

271
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,073
about that fever,
what do you say?

272
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,727
- Okay.

273
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,036
- Thank you very much,
Dr. Taylor,

274
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,255
for playing along in there.

275
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:15,735
I have to say,
you were quite convincing.

276
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,040
- Thank you.

277
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:18,346
It's strange, though,
Abby wasn't always

278
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,913
so opposed to seeing
a psychiatrist.

279
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,218
- What do you mean?

280
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,524
- Well, I was digging
deeper into her file,

281
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,352
and it says here
she used to see one regularly

282
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:26,223
for years, you know,
till the pandemic started.

283
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,530
- Huh. Do we have their info?

284
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:31,925
- It's a Dr. Lavine
from The Fischer Group?

285
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,796
- The Fischer Group?
- You know them?

286
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,451
- Yeah, I am familiar
with that practice.

287
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,366
- It says
Dr. Lavine has retired,

288
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,803
so maybe I can call
someone else from the group

289
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,718
to see if they can
discuss Abby's history?

290
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,372
- You know what,
I actually have a colleague

291
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,026
over there, so why don't you
let me do that?

292
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:49,769
But--excellent work.
Really good work.

293
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,165
- Hey, Dean?
- Mm-hmm?

294
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,125
- You got a second?
- Yeah, sure.

295
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,779
I hear that's all it
took to sucker you

296
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,389
out of a million bucks.

297
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,825
- I guess word travels fast.

298
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,827
- Yeah, I gotta ask,
did they at least promise you

299
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,437
your own parking spot?

300
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,570
- I didn't blow the whistle
for money,

301
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,398
so donating
was the right thing to do.

302
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:13,270
- All right, if you say so.
So what do you need?

303
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,445
- Your patient,
Gretchen Cameron,

304
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:15,969
I saw you
scheduled her for surgery.

305
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:17,231
- Laparotomy is the plan.

306
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,972
- Yeah, I took a look
at her chart.

307
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,843
White count's 15
and trending down.

308
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,366
Antibiotics are working.

309
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,760
So it feels like we should
put a pause on the surgery,

310
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,502
try a nasogastric decompression
instead to reduce the dilation.

311
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:30,070
- You reviewed
my patient's chart?

312
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:31,419
- She was upset.

313
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:32,724
And with her wedding
next weekend,

314
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,248
I thought we could find
her an alternative.

315
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,772
- Generous with
your money and time.

316
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,687
- An NG decompression
with antibiotics

317
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,863
can bridge her
to a less invasive procedure.

318
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,604
We could safely delay it
until after her wedding,

319
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,998
and Gretchen wouldn't
need the ostomy bag.

320
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,391
- None of that is guaranteed
to correct any of her problems,

321
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,871
and any more delay

322
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,742
will increase her chances
of getting septic.

323
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,396
- Dean, I think you're
rushing the surgery--

324
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,790
- I don't need an E.D. doctor
second guessing my decisions.

325
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,444
- Surgeons and
your need to cut--

326
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,576
- Excuse me, excuse me.
What is going on here?

327
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,882
- We're finishing up here--

328
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,405
- Actually we're not
quite finished discussing

329
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,190
how to spare a patient
an aggressive surgery.

330
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,626
- My patient.

331
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:06,410
- And I'm just making sure
she doesn't feel

332
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:07,759
pressured into making
a decision

333
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:08,978
she's uncomfortable with.

334
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,762
- I see, but Dr. Halstead,

335
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:13,069
this is
Dr. Archer's department,

336
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:16,333
and, most importantly,
his patient.

337
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,118
I trust him
to make the right call,

338
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,772
and I expect you
to do the same.

339

♪

340
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:29,477
- Other than a small
pneumothorax in your chest,

341
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,479
all your scans
look pretty good.

342
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,654
You'll probably
have to keep your arm

343

in an immobilizer
for a bit, though.

I'll get you another X-ray

- Yeah, well,
I'd like it back please.

348
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,317
Ahh! Oh, God.

349
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,623
- Yeah, It's probably
gonna pinch for a bit.

350
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,495
You know what,
I can up your pain meds--

351
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:48,844
- No, I'm fine,
just get me the bag.

352
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:54,502
- Am I gonna
have to call my lawyer?

353
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,939
Because I know my rights.

354
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,985
The Fourth Amendment prohibits
the search or seizure

355
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,856
of a person or their property
without a warrant

356
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,858
or probable cause.
- All right, okay, all right.

357
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,295
Calm down, I'm not a cop.

358
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,734
- Well,
you could have fooled me.

359
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:17,438
- Hey, Maggie, could we get
Ms. Jovanovic her bag, please?

360
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,223
Thanks. Here you go.

361
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,708
- What?

362
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,405
You want some kind of reward?

363
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,192
- I'll check in
on you in a bit.

364
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:38,807
♪

365
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,766
Who was that?

366
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,072
- I don't know.

367
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,595
- He says he's her cousin.

368
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,904
- You see
that tattoo on his neck?

369
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,775
Pretty sure
that's Serbian mafia.

370
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:57,826
.

371
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,046
- Hey, big day, Andre.

372
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,265
New heart and liver are
on their way here as we speak.

373
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:03,310
How you feeling?

374
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:04,702
- Ready.
- Good.

375
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,748
- We're so excited.

376
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,967
- Got you a little something.

377
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,753
- You know I'm not 12 anymore.

378
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:13,407
- Tradition is tradition.

379
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,670
- So you guys
know each other then?

380
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:19,239
- Yes, Andre's familial
hypercholesteremia required

381
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,849
a liver transplant
fifteen years ago.

382
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:23,025
I was a resident.
- Oh.

383
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,462
- Back when
I thought these were cool.

384
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:28,639
- So the hope was that Andre's
transplant would reverse

385
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,728
his early onset
atherosclerosis,

386
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,556
but, as you know,
livers only last so long.

387
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,862
So as that went...

388
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,733
- Yeah, it put him
back in heart failure.

389
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,474
- We still chitchatting
in here?

390
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,041
Or are we ready
to get things started?

391
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,043
- Andre, Tanya,
this is Dr. Morris.

392
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,175
He's gonna be handling

393
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,264
the cardiac portion
of your surgery.

394
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:47,354
- Now, this heart I've got
for you, it's a real beauty.

395
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,399
There's not going to be
any problems before I hand

396
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,010
the reins off to these two.

397
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,228
It's gonna be a good day.

398
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:59,496
- Any questions for us?

399
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,368
- Let's do this thing.

400
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:04,066
- All right,
see you in there.

401
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:12,553
- So given Andre's
previous transplant,

402
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:14,381
I'm thinking we start
with proximal, right?

403
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,165
- Maybe, but we won't
be able to visualize

404
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,993
what shape the vessels
are in until we're open.

405
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,735
- Right.

406
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,477
- Care to comment, Justin?

407
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,739
- I just think it's cute

408
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,741
you've got
a pet general surgeon.

409
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,090
- Oh...

410
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:29,744
- You got something
to say to me?

411
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:31,398
- Not particularly.

412
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:33,095
You know I'm happy
to share the stage

413
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,141
with you, Pamela,
but this--this bogan?

414
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:37,491
I'm don't know what
he's doing in my O.R.

415
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:40,668
- Well, Dr. Marcel is
an integral part of my team.

416
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:41,973
- From your lips to God's ears.

417
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,803
Let's get this case moving.

418
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,462
- "Bogan"?
- No idea.

419
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,464
- Come on, let's scrub in.

420
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:03,691
- She's sleeping now,
and her fever has subsided.

421
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,127
- Oh, good.
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:06,781
- Daniel.

423
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,783
- Lonnie.

424
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:10,785
Dr. Richardson.

425
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,482
This is Dr. Taylor.

426
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:14,615
Dr. Richardson
is my colleague that I was

427
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,138
telling you about who works
at The Fischer Group.

428
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,966
- Oh, nice to meet you.

429
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,446
- Hello, doctor.

430
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:23,798
- So I'm gonna bring
Dr. Richardson up to speed,

431
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:27,976
and maybe you could just give
us a shout when Abby wakes up?

432
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:33,068
- Yeah.
- Great--great, okay.

433
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,983
Right this way, please.

434
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,597
- I distinctly remember you
being told to stay clear

435
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:43,078
of this case, and yet,
you told my patient to ask

436
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,080
for a
nasogastric decompression.

437
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,299
- She wanted
to know her options.

438
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:47,822
- So what, you just
sign your big check

439
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,171
over to the hospital, and that
gives you carte blanche

440
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,173
to do
whatever the hell you want?

441
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,740
- If she doesn't want
to have the operation,

442
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,263
you can't force her to have it.

443
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,613
- Well, no, but since it seems
you've made Ms. Cameron

444
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,006
your latest misguided crusade,

445
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,269
you can waste your time
with this procedure.

446
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,143
- It's pretty clear
what your preferred

447
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,492
course of action should be.

448
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,624
- Get Abby to take
an antipsychotic?

449
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:10,323
- You break the delusion,
you cure the symptoms.

450
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,325
- The trick is getting her
to take the medication.

451
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,501
If I even say the
word antipsychotic,

452
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,329
she's gonna kick me
out of the room.

453
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:19,027
- Unless you never
say the word.

454
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,509
- Lead her to believe it's
what, an anti-parasitic?

455
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:24,337
- Benevolent deception.

456
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,644
Ethically, it's justified
when four conditions are met.

457
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:30,821
One, Abby, due to her delusion,

458
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:33,215
cannot make
an informed decision.

459
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,651
- I think we
can both agree on that.

460
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:37,611
- Two, that harm would
likely come to her

461
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:40,222
if the antipsychotic
wasn't prescribed.

462
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,485
- You know, she was
this close to becoming septic.

463
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,487
- Three, she probably wouldn't
take medication

464
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,054
if presented as such.

465
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,447
- Well, I mean,
that's certainly my belief.

466
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,841
- And lastly, that committing
her involuntarily

467
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:55,542
to coerced treatment would lead
to even a worse result.

468
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,674
- That one I think might have
to be a judgement call.

469
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,639
- Nice to know I'm an
integral part of the team.

470
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:08,772
- Morris doesn't get to talk
to you like that.

471
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:09,817
That's my job.

472
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,254
Right.

473
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,565
It's just, after what
you said last week about us...

474
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:25,049
I appreciate knowing you're
still in my corner, I guess.

475
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,487
- Oh, well,
don't get sentimental on me.

476
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,403
Like I said, as long as
you keep your personal feelings

477
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,970
in check, you'll always have
a place in my O.R.

478
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,757
Always.

479
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,933
- Fair enough.

480
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:40,369
- Good.

481
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,720
- Dr. Scott?

482
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:46,419
Milena says she's leaving
against medical advice.

483
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:52,381
- I really have to recommend
that you not leave just yet.

484
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:55,558
- Thanks, Doc,
but I got things to do.

485
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,301
- Ok, well, uh, at least let me
get another X-ray,

486
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,695
just to make sure.
- She said she's leaving.

487
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,174
- Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

488
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:04,480
- Step out of the way.

489
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,177
That's my name.
- Save it.

490
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:07,918
They can't do anything
to stop us.

491
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,661
- You all right?

492
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,272
- Yeah.

493
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,973
- Hey--hey! Milena?

494
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,628
Whoa! Are you okay?

495
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:24,195
Hey, hey, Milena,
can you take a breath for me?

496
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,328
- It hurts--it hurts.

497
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:33,640
- I'm not hearing
good breath sounds.

498
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:36,425
Hey, can you help me
get her off the floor, man?

499
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,557
Doris!

500
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,648
Need to put her back on oxygen,

501
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:43,650
and I need
another chest X-ray, stat!

502
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,260
- Got it.

I know it feels weird.

- How long is this gonna take?

My fiancé
says he's on his way in.

I'd hate for him
to see me like this.

but I'll check back in shortly

you're feeling, okay?

00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:43,971
we spotted earlier
has become not so small.

521
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:46,147
The lung on your left side
is down 60%,

522
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,237
so gonna need to insert
a tube to re-expand it.

524

Just a few minutes.

But we will need to keep you
at the hospital for a few days.

- Why?

527
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:58,420
- Because the tube needs
to be attached to suction

528
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,249
so your lungs can re-expand,
so they don't collapse again.
