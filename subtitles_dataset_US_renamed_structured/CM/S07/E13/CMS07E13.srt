00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,793
- Please tell me the baby's
gonna be okay,

176
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,577
that I didn't hurt her.
- Honey, you didn't.

177
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:30,014
I googled it. This happens
more than you think.

178
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,538
- I'm not usually such a klutz.

179
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:33,278
You know, I've just been
in this fog lately,

180
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:34,932
and I got this cold
I can't shake.

181
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,891
- She is running a slight
fever, 100.5.

182
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,066
- Okay. On me.

183
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,937
One, two, three.

184
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:44,594
All right. Let's see.

185
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,204
Ooh.

186
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:48,293
Think I'm gonna have to agree
with Dr. Google on this one.

187
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:49,773
But I'll bring in
our resident burn expert

188
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,296
to take a look, okay?

189
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,689
Trini, can you see if Dr. Arch
is available, please?

190
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,038
- You got it.

191
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,433
- Okay.

192
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,609
Lean up a little bit
for me, okay?

193
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,177
- Careful.

194
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,181
Okay. Lungs are clear.

195
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,704
How long have you
had this cold?

196
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,271
- Couple of weeks, I think.
- Yeah, she woke up, like,

197
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,838
two weeks ago
with a sore throat.

198
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:15,190
- Hello, there. I'm Dr. Archer.
Let's see what we got.

199
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,888
Okay.

200
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,848
Okay, about 4% TBSA.

201
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:25,635
Superficial, partial thickness.
Wash and dress.

202
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,810
Okay.

203
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:29,421
All right,
you've got skin-level burns.

204
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:31,032
No associated
blunt force trauma.

205
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,512
Completely harmless
to the fetus.

206
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:33,774
- Oh, thank God.

207
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:36,167
- But your lymph nodes
are slightly swollen,

208
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:37,604
so I'd like to run some labs.

209
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,780
- Wait, you think this is
more than a cold?

210
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:42,043
- Oh, not necessarily,
but I'd like to do

211
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:43,653
a respiratory panel
and a strep test.

212
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:46,395
- Just covering our bases.
- Okay, sure.

213
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,049
- Whatever you need to do.

214
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,575
- First-time parents?
- I'm not sure.

215
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,534
- Hey, I'm not asking,
I'm telling you.

216
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,188
First-timers give off
a very distinct odor.

217
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:59,234
Fear.

218
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,282
- All right, I'll be back
in a bit, all right?

219
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,414
- Hey.
- Hey.

220
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:06,850
- So I reviewed
Pete's history.

221
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:07,982
- Okay.

222
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,374
- I think
his epilepsy diagnosis

223
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:12,029
was rushed at best,
negligent at worst.

224
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:13,553
He was never referred
to a specialist,

225
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,251
and no one ever confirmed it
with an MRI or an EEG.

226
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,818
- If he's not having
epileptic seizures,

227
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:19,515
then he shouldn't be
on anticonvulsants.

228
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,125
- No.

229
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,997
He needs to spend a few days
in a seizure monitoring unit.

230
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,912
Undergo far more extensive
testing.

231
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,217
- Yeah, I'll say.

232
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,784
Okay, I'll check in
with Med's SMU,

233
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:28,829
see if they have any room,

234
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:30,221
and we can flip
the idea to Pete?

235
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,222
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.

236
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,223
- Okay. Yeah. I'll see you.

237
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,964
- Yeah.
- All right.

238
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,400
- Hey, Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah.

239
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,533
- Can I borrow you
for a minute?

240
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,840
- Okay.

241
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,625
- So, uh,

242
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,236
you work closely
with Dr. Blake.

243
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,803
What's her deal?

244
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:50,807
- Her deal?
- Yeah. She seeing anyone?

245
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,159
- I think that's more
a question for her.

246
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:56,291
- Oh, come on.

247
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:58,554
It was Valentine's Day
last week.

248
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,382
She have any flowers
waiting in her office?

249
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,384
She mention having plans?

250
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,429
- What is this,
kind of hospital policy thing?

251
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,431
- No, it's--I guess
it's a vibe thing.

252
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:07,911
- A vibe thing?
- Yeah, I got a vibe.

253
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,260
- Okay.

254
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:11,175
- Maybe she's interested,
you know.

255
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,613
- I'm a little surprised,
because I always thought

256
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,702
you frowned
upon workplace relationships.

257
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,791
I mean, I clearly recall

258
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,054
you sending Dr. Manning
and I to HR.

259
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:22,752
- Yeah, I may have broadened
my thinking in the matter.

260
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:25,363
- Okay.

261
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,847
Oh, man. Shoot.
She-she did mention something.

262
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,370
- So she's seeing someone.
- I believe so.

263
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:33,545
- Okay.
- Yeah.

264
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:34,895
- All right, well,
never mind then.

265
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,070
All right.
- Okay.

266
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:37,375
- It's cool.
- Yeah, sorry.

267
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,160
- No. It's all right.
It's all good.

268
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:45,253
- Ah, look who decided
to show up today.

269
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,689
- I'm sorry I'm late.

270
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:50,127
- You know, the ED was
on the verge of collapse.

271
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,694
Oh, Maggie,
you actually look like

272
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:52,826
you're on the verge
of collapse.

273
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,175
What's wrong?

274
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:56,917
- I'm okay, and I tested
negative for COVID.

275
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,659
But I feel a little shaky.
Nauseated too.

276
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,486
Must have caught a 24-hour bug.

277
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,662
- Okay.
Well, let me check you out.

278
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,011
- No, no, no, no,
my shift is starting.

279
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,403
Good morning, Nancy.

280
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:06,709
- Nancy, mind staying on
as charge nurse for a bit?

281
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,712
- No problem.
- Looks like you're free.

282
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:12,628
Come on. Let's go.

283
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,370
- Dr. Halstead, CFD's here

284
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:17,372
with an elderly female
with Alzheimer's.

285
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:18,982
Suffered a fall
while home alone.

286
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,114
You're in Treatment 3.

287
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:21,811
- Show me the chart.
- Will do.

288
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:24,771
- Lorraine Hendrix, 75-year-old
female with Alzheimer's.

289
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,468
Fell down a short flight
of stairs.

290
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:27,774
Didn't report hitting her head,

291
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,601
and pain is confined
to the right wrist.

292
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,647
- Okay, who called 911?
- She did.

293
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,953
- Did I do something wrong?

294
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:34,737
My daughter was out
running an errand.

295
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,304
- No, you did the right thing,
Mrs. Hendrix.

296
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,697
It was good you called us.

297
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,307
Her chart says
she doesn't have children?

298
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,700
- Maybe she's confused.

299
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,527
She did give us the number
for her daughter.

300
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,921
- All right, we'll sort it out.

301
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,096
Okay, on my count.

302
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,403
Ready, one, two, three.

303
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,712
Thank you.

304
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,322
Okay, Mrs. Hendrix,
see if you can

305
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:55,671
follow the light
with just your eyes.

306
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,368
Try not to move
your head, okay?

307
00:11:57,412 --> 00:12:00,850
Good.
- Oh, thank God.

308
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,156
I'm her daughter, Cindy.

309
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:04,071
- You are?

310
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,769
Sorry, there was confusion
because her chart--

311
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,989
- It says Lorraine
doesn't have kids.

312
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:11,382
Technically she's my stepmom,
but she's been in my life

313
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,080
since I was 13 years old.

314
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,777
She lives with me now.

315
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,084
- Good to know.
We'll make note.

316
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:18,520
- I feel terrible.

317
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,913
I just went
to the corner store.

318
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,741
I couldn't have been gone
more than ten minutes.

319
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:24,004
I've got an overnight shift
at the hospital.

320
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:27,137
- Oh yeah? Where do you work?
- St. Luke's. I'm a nurse.

321
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,748
Try to avoid the night shift,

322
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,750
but I couldn't get out of it
this month.

323
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,230
Lorraine doesn't like it
when I'm not there for bedtime.

324
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,232
That's why I went
to the market, actually,

325
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,886
to get her favorite cookies.

326
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,279
- Okay.

327
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,150
- I like to have them
on hand for the caregiver.

328
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:43,284
- Negotiation tactic?
- Exactly.

329
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:46,287
- Well, listen, I'd like to get
an X-ray of her wrist

330
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,811
to be safe,
but she's gonna be fine.

331
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:52,554
- Fine.
- Let's get an X-ray.

332
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:54,599
- You're gonna want
to look at this.

333
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:57,341
Emily Torres, pregnant woman.
It's her test results.

334
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:00,083
- What am I looking--oh, man.

335
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,215
- Yeah, syphilis.

336
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:02,738
If mom has it,

337
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,567
high risk of congenital
infection if not addressed.

338
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,960
- Right, if we don't treat it,

339
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:08,962
baby could be born
with severe impairments.

340
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,442
- Yeah.

341
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:12,922
- All right. I'll go tell them.

342
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,881
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

343
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:18,362
If you tell the husband,
then you also out the wife.

344
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,755
Right, you can't tell him that

345
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,496
she's contracted an STI

346
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,715
- Yeah, but I mean, he has
every right to know

347
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,240

He's the father.

348

00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:34,639
Seizure Monitoring Unit

video EEG monitoring.

352

354
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:43,213

a stay as possible.

355
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,650
- Sure. A couple hours?

356
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:48,131
- Well, no,
that's not enough time.

357
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,480
- Besides, there's no way

358
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,308
my crap insurance
is gonna cover that.

359
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:52,832

360
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,485

of things.

361
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,444
- Look, I know you mean well.

362
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:57,880
But when I leave here,
it's not like--

363
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,708
you're not gonna be
coming over to help me fill out

364
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,841
the paperwork
and file the claims.

365
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,407
Okay, I've got three kids.

366
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,540
One of them, I just found out
this morning needs braces,

367
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,890
and my wife has MS,
she can't even work anymore.

368
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,500
Our roof is caving in,
and-and--

369
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,154
- I'm so sorry.

370
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,591
- Look, I'm not telling you
my sob story for pity, okay?

371
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,680
I'm just saying
so that you understand

372
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,248
that me missing a week--

373
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,815
- Hey, hey, hey! Pete, Pete!

374
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,644
2 of Ativan. Hey! Pete!

375
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:23,732
- Hold his legs.
- Pete!

376
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,908
- Put pressure on the joints.

377
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,214
- Pete!

378
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:33,655
.

379
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:35,483
- You know, in addition
to her privacy,

380
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:36,614
we also have to consider

381
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:39,530
Mrs. Torres' safety
and well-being.

382
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:42,925
Any red flag her husband might
become violent at the news?

383
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,274
- Not that I've witnessed.

384
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,363
And what about
Mr. Torres' well-being?

385
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,104
I mean, he needs
to be tested too.

386
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:53,066
- Well, syphilis diagnosis
requires reporting to IDPH,

387
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:56,330
and they will immediately
begin contact tracing,

388
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:58,506
and Mr. Torres
will be notified.

389
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,247
- Terrific. we're all
in agreement then, right?

390
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,206
Let's let the Health Department
inform Dad.

391
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,167
- No, listen, when you speak
to Mrs. Torres,

392
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,820
strongly encourage her

393
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:10,692
to share the information
with her husband.

394
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,259
Let's start there.

395
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,695
- Well, it strikes me it might
be wise to have somebody

396
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:16,785
from Senior Admin deliver
the news with Dr. Scott.

397
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:20,876
Uh, some member from Risk
Management should be present,

398
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,356
given the sensitivity,
don't you think?

399
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,795
- You know, someone like, uh,
the chief of the ED.

400
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,623
- I'm thinking higher,
you know,

401
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,973
Executive director
of patient services, maybe?

402
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,541
- Mm-hmm, and where will
you be, Dr. Archer?

403
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:36,457
- Well, three's really
kind of a crowd, yeah?

405

was moving back and forth

406

during the seizure,
and he was bicycling his legs?

407
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,252
- Yeah, and he didn't seem
to lose consciousness

at any point.
You thinking what I'm thinking?

409

- All suggestive of PNES.
- Yeah.

410
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,303
- Psychogenic
non-epileptic seizures

411
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,261
are commonly misdiagnosed
as epilepsy.

412
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,697
- Yeah, and stress
is a known factor,

413
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:02,222
and this poor guy's
got a lot going on.

414

to a seizure monitoring unit.

416
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,183

extensively.

417

It's really the only way
to get a definitive diagnosis.

Unless his finances magically
change, he's not gonna budge.

He can't budge.

421
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,887
- I'm gonna talk
to Social Services.

422
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,759
You know, maybe he could apply
for worker's comp,

423
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:18,978
since the injury took place

424
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,501
while using
workplace machinery?

425
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,677
I mean, at least it would
alleviate some of his concerns

about missing a paycheck.

427
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,770
- Yeah, sure.
it's a long shot, though.

428
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:30,946
- It's all we got.

429
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,252
I'll see you in a bit.

430
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,214
- Dr. Halstead.

431
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,521
I'm sorry to bother you.
I work in an ED myself.

432

I know how backed up
things can get.

But we're still

Hang tight,
and I will make sure

437
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,618
someone reads that X-ray
as soon as possible, okay?

438
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:52,098
- Fine.

439
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,448
- Hey, thank you
for your patience.

440
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:57,886
Dr. Charles.
Mind if I run something by you?

441
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,844
- What's up?

442
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,063
- I've got a patient who was

443
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,239
diagnosed a year ago
with Alzheimer's.

444
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:06,112
But she is now exhibiting
a surprising level of cognition

445
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:07,417
at this stage of the disease.

446
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,897
No problem
following directions.

447
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,118
She even had the wherewithal
to call 911 herself.

448
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:15,077
- You think maybe she was
diagnosed prematurely?

449
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:16,296
- So here's where
it gets strange.

450
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,906
I reviewed her scans
from a year ago.

451
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,909
MRI and PET scans show atrophy
to the hippocampus

452
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,302
as well as
abnormal accumulations

453
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,043
of amyloid plaques.

454
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,045
- Consistent with
Alzheimer's diagnosis.

455
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,655
- Exactly, but we both know

456
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:29,526
this isn't a disease
that gets better with time,

457
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,226

medical breakthrough, I mean--

Are you okay?

- Why didn't tell me ahead
of time what you were doing?

547
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,114
- Not everyone is on board
with noceboes.

548
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,203
- yeah, because noceboes
are completely unethical

549

- Predicated on a lie.

554

You gave Pete saline, told him
it was medication

555
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:27,781
to induce a seizure.

556
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:29,696
- Which it did.
- So that makes it okay?

557

I'd prefer to take.

559
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,831
- You got nowhere
with Social Services,

560
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,398
we had no options,
and now we can take Pete

561
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,095
off the anticonvulsants, right?
- Yeah?

562
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:39,749
Okay, by telling him what,
exactly?

563
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:41,272
- That no abnormal
brain activity

564
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,100
was recorded
during the seizure.

565
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:45,059
- The seizure you tricked him
into having.

566
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:46,930
- I think Pete will see
the bigger picture.

567
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,410
- Well, I guess we'll find out,

568
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:51,805
'cause if you don't
tell him the truth, I will.

569
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,810
- Hi there. I am Dr. Charles.

570
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:59,203
- Someone read my mom's X-ray?
- Yes.

571
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:02,293
And the good news
is that it's not broken.

572
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:05,427
So all we need to do
is get you a splint and--

573
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,820
- Ice and elevate. Yeah.

574
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:09,475
I know the drill.
Can I get her discharge papers?

575
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,128
- Of course.

576
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,782
I'll have the nurses bring them
in as soon as they're ready.

577

You know,
my favorite Neruda poem

580
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,922
is "The Book of Questions."

581
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,011
That last line,

582
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:26,448
"Is there anything
in the world sadder..."

583
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:29,277
- "Than a train standing
in the rain?"

584
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,844
- Yeah.

585
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:34,108
- I'm sorry, but who are you?
Did Dr. Halstead leave?

586
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:35,457
- No. No, he didn't.

587
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,939
- I'm Dr. Charles.
- Psychiatry.

588
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:43,204
Do you mind if we step outside
for a minute?

589
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:46,120
- Of course.
Nice to meet you, Lorraine.

590
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:47,991
- Nice to meet you too.

591
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,343

592

psychological testing.

593
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,564
- Of course.

594
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:57,610
- It just confuses
and upsets her.

595
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:01,178
- We wouldn't do that.
- Then what are you doing?

596
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:03,180
- Cynthia, hi.
Everything all right?

597
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:04,617
- I just, I don't know
why you handed

598

to get her home again.

in Lorraine

603
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:16,890

at this stage of the disease.

604
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:18,326
So with your permission,

605
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,893
I'd like to get new scans
of her brain.

606
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,200
- No.

607

She's--I'm not putting her
in an MRI machine again.

608

She's extremely claustrophobic.

609
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:30,077
- You know, sedation can
really help with that.

610
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,472
- She's having a good day.
That's all.

Psychogenic
non-epileptic seizures

to cause a seizure.

744

This isn't because
of something in my head.

745
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,186
- I actually gave you
saline, Pete.

- What?

747

you described earlier,

- No, I'm trying to say that
if you had known

753
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,550
it's unlikely it would have
provoked a stress response.

Lorraine was something
of an evil stepmother

off of Lorraine's terror

developing the disease, right?
