Without the transplant,
he could die.

And the positive publicity
from saving Wes Tucker's life

280
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,759
would not only encourage
future organ donation,

281
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:59,544
it would also help to build
back the hospital's good image.

but the rules are the rules.

529

is inadvisable,

530

to perform it instead.

a split liver transplant.

Ben.
He's a fourth grade teacher.

868
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,806
That's why he couldn't
be here tonight,

869
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,068
parent-teacher conference.

870
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:21,593
- Hmm.
I never liked those much.

871
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:23,769
Always got anxious.

872
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,335
But you know how it is,

873
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:27,903
you always do anything
for the kids.

874
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,082
- Yeah.

875
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:34,475
You do.

- Bea, you really outdid
yourself with this lasagna.

878
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:44,572
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

879
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:46,661
- Delicious.

880
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,446
And is that turkey
that I'm tasting?

881
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:49,534
- Yes, it is.

882
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:51,884
I find it's lighter
than sausage.

883
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:54,364
- You're right.

884
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:58,238
- Um, I could send you
the recipe if you'd like.

885
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,242
- That would be great.
