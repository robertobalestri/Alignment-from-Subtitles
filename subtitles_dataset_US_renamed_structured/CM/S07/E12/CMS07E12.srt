1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:04,047
.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,745
- I want another doctor.
You're done working on my son.

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:08,747
- Carmen and I started a thing,
then we broke up.

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,662
- Then he got her
on the rebound, right?

5
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:11,794
- There's more to it.

6
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:13,839
- Stay away from my family.

7
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:15,928
- We're getting hammered
by the press.

8
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:17,278
Donors are fleeing.

9
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:18,496
Doctors are getting poached
by other hospitals.

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,411
- Why are you here, Mr. Shentu?

11
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:22,022
- Reputational management.

12
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,197
- I'm not opposed to you

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,633
wearing your heart
on your sleeve.

14
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:26,722
But you and I are strongest
when we work together.

15
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,767
- I like you too.

16
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:29,942
- You okay?

17
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,509
- It's paperwork
for my divorce.

18
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:33,250
- Didn't know you were married.
- It's over.

19
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:35,078
He's just dragging it out.

20
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:36,427
- I need an MRI.

21
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,907
- It'll set him back months.

22
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,300
You should never
have allowed Ethan

23
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:40,605
to push himself like that.

24
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,347
If they can't say when,
you're supposed to.

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,967
♪

26
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:26,912
See you tomorrow.
- Ethan.

27
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:28,479
- Daniel.
What are you doing here?

28
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:30,873
- I know.
Me in a gym, crazy right?

29
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,788
Buddy, been meaning
to give you a call.

30
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:35,182
I heard the last surgery was
a big success.

31
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,574
- Yeah.

32
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:38,141
Doctor says I should be able
to return to work

33
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,403
in six to eight weeks.

34
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:40,709
- You wanna grab
some breakfast or something?

35
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,406
I--I got the day off.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,842
Let's do it.

37
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,931
Uh, one sec.

38
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:47,368
It's my dad.

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,936
Hello? Mm, okay.

40
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,199
Yeah.

41
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:54,766
All right.

42
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,205
- How's Pop?

43
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:02,339
- Uh, it wasn't him, actually.

44
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:05,821
I guess he got
an in-home nurse, Felicia.

45
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:08,476
She's concerned that...

46
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,608
I didn't even know he was sick.

47
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:11,957
- Huh.

48
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,482
- Yeah. I need to go see him.

49
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:17,267
- But you're not cleared
to drive yet though, are you?

50
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,486
- No, no.
I'll just order a car.

51
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:19,617
- Let me give you a ride.
- No, no, no.

52
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:21,141
You don't have to do that.
- Buddy.

53
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,490
You'd be doing me
a big favor, okay?

54
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,361
I was gonna be paying bills
all day.

55
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,798
Five minutes,
let me jump in the shower.

56
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,452
- Thanks.

57
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,628
- I thought
all this was finalized.

58
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,195
No, I don't want to speak
to my husband directly.

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,154
That's why I hired a lawyer.

60
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,459
Listen, I'm at work.

61
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:36,808
I'm gonna have
to call you back later, okay?

62
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:37,853
Okay.

63
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:43,685
- Guess that was, uh,
about your divorce?

64
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:45,339
- We already agreed that
Andrew would keep the house

65
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,557
in Grosse Point.

66
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:47,993
Now, suddenly,
he wants to sell it

67
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:49,386
and give me half the proceeds.

68
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,909
- That's a good thing, right?

69
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:52,781
- No, he's up to something.

70
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:56,132
He's trying to lure me in.
It's a control thing.

71
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,917
Sorry, this must be so boring.

72
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,485
- No, it's fascinating.
I'm riveted.

73
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:04,706
- Sure. What's in the bag?

74
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:06,273
- My suit.

75
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,754
Remember, we're going
to the gala tonight?

76
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,060
- Yes, of course.

77
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:12,627
- But, uh, if you've got
too much on your plate--

78
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,497
- No.

79
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,238
We're gonna do this.

80
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,631
- Excuse me, Dr. Hammer?

81
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:19,286
Treatment room five.
- Okay.

82
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,679
Let's firm all this up later,
okay?

83
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:22,898
- Yeah.

84
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:30,210
- Lisa Backman, 37 years old,
34 weeks pregnant.

85
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,559
Vitals all stable.

86
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:32,690
- Collapsed on the floor
and lost consciousness

87
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,083
for 30 seconds.
Husband called 911.

88
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:36,346
He was right behind us.
- Thanks.

89
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,130
- Hi, Lisa, I'm Dr. Hammer.

90
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:39,523
How you feeling?
- Fine.

91
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,046
I just got
a little lightheaded.

92
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,526
It's not a big deal.

93
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,224
- Let's take a quick look,
okay?

94
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,355
Let's get the ultrasound.

95
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,314
- Do we really need to do that?

96
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:48,402
- We just want to make sure

97
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,881
that everything looks okay
in there.

98
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,709
I mean,
you're here already, right?

99
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,407
- I just want to get out
as fast as possible.

100
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,799
- I understand.

101
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,714
- Hi, Lisa,
your husband's here.

102
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:57,846
- Is she okay?

103
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,282
- I told you already,
I'm fine, Jonah.

104
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,545
This is a complete
waste of time.

105
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,026
- Well,
the placenta appears normal,

106
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,462
which is a good sign.

107
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,116
But your baby's breech.

108
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,597
You might be having it
sooner than you think.

109
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,555
- See? I told you something
was going on.

110
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,470
- Has she told you yet
that she's anemic?

111
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,385
- No, but good to know.

112
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,561
Okay, let's get
a CBC, PTT, a KB,

113
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,302
and a fingerstick
for blood glucose.

114
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,435
- I--I don't need all of that.

115
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,654
- They're just lab tests
to make sure that you're okay.

116
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,352
- Yeah, if you give me
the name of your OB,

117
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,179
I can contact him
for you if you like.

118
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:29,051
- I'm no longer seeing my OB.

119
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:30,705
- Go ahead, tell them why.

120
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:32,837
- Okay, don't do this, Jonah.
- Fine. I'll tell them.

121
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:35,100
Because her OB had
the audacity to suggest

122
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,277
that Lisa get vaccinated,
but she didn't want to.

123
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,495
- Enough, okay?

124
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,845
That's my decision
as a mother to make.

125
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,325
No one else's.

126
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:43,326
And I don't appreciate you
trying to recruit

127
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,807
more soldiers to your cause.

128
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,330
I feel isolated enough already.

129
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,853
- This has been going on
for months.

130
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,942
- Okay, stop!
What is she doing?

131
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,422
- She's drawing some blood.
- No.

132
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,598
I--I just wanna go back home
and get ready

133
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,339
for the home birth
with my doula as planned.

134
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,429
- Hey, Lisa, you know, anemia
can greatly increase the risk

135
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,083
of adverse events
during delivery.

136
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,258
- I know that already.

137
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,999
We can manage.

138
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,044
- Damn it, Lisa, stop messing
around with our baby's health.

139
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,132
Listen to the doctors.

140
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:10,484
- It's really best to be sure.

141
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:14,357
- Fine.

142
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,098
Run your test.
- Oh, good.

143
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,882
You're finally listening
to medical advice.

144
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,928
- I've had it.
I want you out of here.

145
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:21,364
- This is my baby too.

146
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:22,844
- I said get out.

147
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:26,935
Do I need to have you
call security?

148
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:29,894
- Why don't you come with me?

149
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:31,156
There's a waiting area
right outside.

150
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:35,813
- Thank you.

151
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:42,037
♪

152
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:46,346
.

153
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,305
- Here's hoping we avoid
any hiccups with this surgery.

154
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,612
Dry cleaner closes at 6:00,
and they got my dress.

155
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:52,961
- Oh, I take it that means

156
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,310
you're going to
the fundraising gala tonight?

157
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,269
- Oh, I have received
many enthusiastic emails

158
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:59,750
from Dr. Shentu suggesting
that my attendance is--

159
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:01,099
thank you--mandatory.

160
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,449
- Well, it makes sense.

161
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,799
The hospital wants
to parade around its stars.

162
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:05,930
- I'm not complaining.

163
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,149
It's actually
kind of refreshing

164
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:09,151
to get out every now and again.
- Good.

165
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:11,066
Well, why don't you meet up
with me before hand?

166
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:12,676
Let me buy you a drink.

167
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:15,026
- Oh, um...

168
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:18,203
Can't imagine
I'll find the time.

169
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,167
Today's the day, Dorothy.

170
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,429
How you feeling?

171
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:30,346
- Ooh, ready to meet
my new liver.

172
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,175
Chad and I couldn't get here
fast enough when you called.

173
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:35,090
- Mom and I are pretty stoked.

174
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,874
- Yeah, well, after all
the time you've been waiting,

175
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,398
I believe it.

176
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,966
Your labs are showing
that your blood sugar's at 240.

177
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,882
- Mm, it's always a roller
coaster with my diabetes.

178
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:46,580
- Yes,
but your white blood cell count

179
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,452
is also elevated to 18,000.

180
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,280
Numbers like this usually
indicate that your body

181
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:52,803
is fighting
some sort of infection.

182
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,153
Have you been feeling
worse than normal?

183
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:58,026
- It's hard to know
what normal is anymore.

184
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:01,072
I been feeling so crummy
this last year.

185

- Dorothy,
you mind if I examine you?

186
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,162
- Sure.
- Okay.

187
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:07,035
You feeling cold?
- No more than usual.

188
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,428
- Do you mind
if I remove the jacket?

189
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,868
Ooh.

190
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,087
- I was trying to warm my feet
by the radiator

191
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:18,699
the other night,
and I guess I got too close.

192
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,222
- Uh-huh.

193
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,442
- Didn't even feel it
for some reason.

194
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,053
- That's the neuropathy
from the diabetes.

195
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,358
- Let's have a look.

196
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:29,449
- Yeah, burned yourself
pretty bad there.

197
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,103
It's definitely infected.

198
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,368
- Okay, we are gonna need
IV antibiotics for that.

199
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:38,849
So excuse us while we go
flag down a nurse.

200
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:41,330
- Yeah, let's leave this open
for air.

201
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:42,505
Keep it off, okay?

202
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,854
- Okay.

203
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,078
- What do you think?

204
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,383
- We can't give her steroids

205
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:52,733
or put her
on immunosuppressants

- Is this gonna be a problem?

211
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,701

your mother's infection

complications for her surgery.

213
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,792
So we're gonna have to postpone
it for a later date.

for this liver

Talk to me, Capp,
what are you thinking?

533
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:46,392
- Look, if there's sarin gas
in that room

534
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:47,915
and this is
some kind of terrorist attack,

535
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,831
opening that door will put
everyone out here at risk.

536
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:52,833
- Look, I get
the OR's positive pressurized,

537

there's risk involved
in opening that door,

538
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:55,705
but somebody's gotta go
in there and get them out, man.

539
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,272
- You guys have
any more of those suits?

540
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,057
- Come on, I mean, we're on
a ticking clock here, guys.

541

- We're talking to an engineer
about shutting down

543
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,061
Once that happens,
the halls are cleared,

00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,846
and we're suited up,
we'll go inside.

545
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:07,195
- That'll take too long.

546
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:08,849

Move, move, move, move.

Easy, buddy. Hold your breath.
