00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,436
- I have
polycystic kidney disease,

175
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,176
and I've been managing
with dialysis for years,

176
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,528
but about six months ago,
I developed eosinophilia,

177
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,051
and the doctor said
it was probably time

178
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:25,053
I needed a new kidney, so.

179
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,229
- And Julia,
you offered to get tested

180
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,492
to see if you're a match?
- Like I said,

181
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,712
I'm invested
in keeping him around.

182
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,716
- Please tell me
this is nothing.

183
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,978
- May very well be.

184
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:38,675
The discomfort
you described could be

185
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:41,025
an allergic reaction
to underwear or soap

186
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,027
or even physical activity
like cycling...

187
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,942
- Oh, I took a spin class
on Monday.

188
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,291
- Ah, there you go.

189
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,468
But I do wanna run
a urine analysis and culture

190
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:49,991
to rule out a UTI.

191
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,341
- An infection would delay
the transplant, wouldn't it?

192
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,561
- I'm afraid so.
- Babe, that's fine.

193
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:56,519
If that's what the doctor says
has to happen, we can wait.

194
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,086
- Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves just yet.

195
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,435
We'll see what the labs say,

196
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,524
and in the meantime,
I'm gonna have our OB-GYN,

197
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,134
Dr. Asher, come by.

198
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:05,354
If she think it's necessary,
she'll perform a pelvic exam.

199
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:07,748
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

200
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,532
- You got it.

201
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,229
- It's okay.

202
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:14,972
- Donna, are you sure you don't
want a family member with you?

203
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:16,365
- Your daughter, Erin,
is listed

204
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:17,932
as your emergency contact.

205
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:19,194
Would you like us to call her?

206
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:22,806
- Over a bump on the head?
Don't bother her.

207
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,113
My Erin works too hard.

208
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,072
- Donna, it's more than
just a bump on the head.

209
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,422
Do you remember
what I just told you?

210
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,599
You're in end-stage
liver failure,

211
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:35,166
and your kidneys are also
beginning to shut down.

212
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,213
whatever you gotta do.

213
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:42,173
- Donna, honey.

214
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,871
You don't have much time.

215
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:46,395
I'm sorry, but you're dying,

216
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:49,180
and we wanna make you
as comfortable as possible.

217
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:52,183

a fuss over me.

218
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:55,839
Put a Band-Aid on it
and send me on...

219
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:58,494
- All right, Donna.
You rest.

220
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,843
Okay, sweetie.

222
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,065

she has the capacity

223
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,414
to make end-of-life decisions,

224
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:07,459
but I'd really like
a second opinion.

225
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:08,983
- Well, I happen to know
that Dr. Charles

226
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,724
is in his office today.

227
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,160
It's his day off, though.

228
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:14,162
- Maybe he wouldn't mind
doing a quick capacity eval.

229
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:17,208
- Let's ask him.
- Yeah.

230
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:20,255
- Hey, Dean,
just a little reminder...

231
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:22,823
I got my dad's
military committal service.

232
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,608
- Oh, I was just gonna offer to
chauffeur since I'm going too.

233
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,436

guys he served with.

- I'm just saying,
you don't have to...

237

- No, I want to.
Your father was one of us.

238
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,360
- Appreciate that.

239
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,362
- Dr. Choi or Dr. Archer,

00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:43,583
I've got Zach Dayle-Kalmick
in Treatment 4...

241
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,542
16-year-old male, injured
his knee playing lacrosse.

242
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,630
- Ah.

243
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,678
- Do you know
the origins of lacrosse?

244
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,505
- Pops, stop.
- Truly, Peter, give it a rest.

245
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:56,726
- It was used to prepare
warriors for combat.

246
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,815
Does that sound like a game
16-year-olds should be playing?

247
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,861
Okay, this is Zach's
third injury this season.

248
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,210
- Agh.
- Sorry, buddy.

249

Pes anserinus.
- Pes what?

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,127
Can... can you spell that?
Is that one word or two?

251
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,259
- Okay, Peter.
We're going for a walk.

252
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,304
What are you talking about?
Zach needs us here.

253
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,871
- I don't.
- He doesn't,

254
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:14,396
and the doctors need you
out of their way, so come on.

255
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,876
- Page ortho.
I want a full work-up

256
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,833
on that knee.

257
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:24,449
- Pes ans... whatever.
Is that serious?

258
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,408
'Cause there's a scout from
Villanova coming in two weeks,

259
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:27,975
and he's gotta see me play.

260
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,021
- Pes anserinus is just
a fancy way of saying bursitis,

261
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,544
which is another
fancy way of saying

262
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,242
sac on the side of the knee.

263
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,853
It's definitely painful,
but not a big problem.

264

- You're gonna get an MRI...

265

see if there's
anything else going on.

266
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,430
- Hey, Dr. Halstead,
can I talk to you for a second?

267
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:53,609
Um, should Julia
maybe not donate?

268
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,133
- Well, we haven't gotten
her lab work back yet,

269
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:57,569
so it's too soon to decide
if the transplant

270
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,093
needs to be postponed.
- No, no,

271
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,442
I don't mean postponed.

272
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:03,140
I'm asking
if she shouldn't donate ever.

I've been wanting to break up
with Julia for a while.

276

- Well, at this point,
gotta say no.

301
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,661
She does not

when he was told
he needed a transplant.

311
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,293
But then immediately,
Julia offered to get tested.

312
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,556
- And obviously,
Owen didn't try to stop her.

313
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,515
- No, I mean, he was so touched
by her generosity,

314
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,300
he thought maybe he was
falling in love with her.

315
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:02,216
- It's gratitude, not love.

316
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,521
Julia told me
that they're planning

317
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,175
to get married someday,
so if he's not

318
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,611
serious about her,
she should know.

319
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:09,179
- Owen's had multiple
transfusions over the years,

320
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,398
and now his antibodies...
that makes him

321
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:11,703
extremely difficult to match.

322
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,314
What if Julia backs out
of the transplant?

323
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:17,231
It could be years before he
finds another donor, if ever.

324
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,407
- Well, she has
every right to back out.

325
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,148
How will she feel
if Owen gets her kidney

326
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:22,323
and then he just
breaks up with her?

327
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,541
- Hannah, you are willing
to jeopardize

328
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:24,804
a life-saving surgery

329
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,806
because this kid
can't promise eternal love?

330
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,025
- You're willing
to con Julia into this?

331
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:31,245
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- Well, I would,

332
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,856
and I'm not ready to medically
clear her for surgery tomorrow.

333
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,684
- Her urine culture
showed no bacteria.

334
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,817
- I still wanna run
a CBC to check her WBC.

335
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,644
- That's a stall.
She doesn't even have a fever.

336
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,864
- Hey, you asked me to consult.

337
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,084
I'm gonna run
whatever test I see fit.

338
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,654
Okay, there you go.

339
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,395
She's tachy and hypotensive.

340
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,049
- Type and cross 4 and 4

341
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,747
and give a half liter
of albumin 5% in the meantime.

342
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,447
- There's blood in here.

significant bleeding

357
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:34,438
from the vertebral artery,

358
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,832
which had an aberrant course
into the C5 bone.

of the bleed?

360

- Temporarily, yes,

361
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:43,447
but obviously,
we need a permanent solution.

362
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,796
- So...?
- Two options:

363
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,886
I can either ligate
and sac the vessel

364
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,453
or I can try to repair it.
- What's better?

365
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,281
- Ligating would be
the safest option.

366
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,630
It'll eliminate the risk
of your mother

367
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:53,980
bleeding to death
during surgery.

368
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,112
- Thank you for sharing
your expertise.

369
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,898
However, that does carry
a slight chance of stroke,

370
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,465
which could do further insult
to her fine motor skills.

371
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,945
- And reconstructing
the vessel?

372
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,642
- That's the best course
of action to restore

373
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:05,948
full function
in your mother's arm.

374
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,907
However, it does carry
a high risk

375
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,953
of severe acute
and post-operative bleeding

376
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:13,042
as well as
delayed pseudoaneurysm

377
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:14,261
and dissection formation.

378
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:15,479
- In other words,
reconstructing the vessel

379
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,003
is much more dangerous.

380

your mother would want?

383
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:26,186
- This decision,
it needs to be made now.

384
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,840
- If there's a chance she could
lose even a small amount

385
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:30,668
of function in her hands,
she'd be against it.

386
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,279
- Knowing your mother,
I'd agree.

387
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:34,759
- So the only option
is to reconstruct the vessel.

388
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,153
- No.

389
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,372
