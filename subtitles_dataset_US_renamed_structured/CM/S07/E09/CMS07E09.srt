I don't like having
my time wasted.

The hospital will
discontinue the Vas-COM

until it can be proven
to be safe.

7
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:19,802
Hold off on banning
the Vas-COM just yet.

What's this?

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,469
It'll make the last traces
of the drug undetectable.

You know,
with Dr. Cooper's situation,

the company is concerned that

58
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:12,801
they don't have anyone
advocating for the Vas-COM.

you can trust me.

Vasik can offer you
the same arrangement

68
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:41,743
they had with Dr. Cooper.

69
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:47,705
Arrangement?
I don't understand.

70
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,794
For every Vas-COM catheter
the hospital ordered,

71
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,970
Dr. Cooper
received a percentage.

72
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:55,017
Really? Wow.
Yeah.

73
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,542
I mean, these catheters are
used once, and then discarded.

74
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,283
If we got enough departments
behind them,

75
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,764
the hospital could go
through thousands.

76
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:05,549
What do you think?

77
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,899
That sounds great. But...

78
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:12,426
I mean, isn't this kind
of like kickbacks?

79
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,298
You don't have to worry
about that.

80
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,822
I mean, you're completely safe.

81
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,303
Okay, good.

82
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:22,914
I mean, but Medicare.
I mean, insurance companies?

83
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,439
They don't ever question
these charges?

84
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:26,831
You'd be surprised.

85
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,008
I mean, Vas-COM catheter
is a small ticket item.

86
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,401
They hardly notice.

87
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,925
And besides, even if someone
did question it,

88
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,711
then the doctor could always
justify it clinically.

89
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,365
I mean,
that's the beauty part.

90
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,802
Look, you don't have
to give me an answer tonight,

91
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,891
but let me just say I think

92
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:45,023
you and I would be
a good team.

93
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:49,724

00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,944
Yeah, there's no question
these are felonies.

96
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,468
Why didn't you tell me
about this sooner?

97
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:55,817
I didn't have enough.

98
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,993
And even when I tried
to get the Vas-COM pulled,

99
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,342
the board refused.

100
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,952

00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,610

in order to get that.

103
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,786
All right, look,
we can't blindside the board.

104
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,962
Before we go to the FBI,
I've got to brief them.

I'm not sure.
Two or three times a day. Why?

129
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,939
Less than six means

177
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,398
No, her labs show
she's low in potassium.

178
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,878
It's a mild
electrolyte imbalance.

179
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,053
We're not sure yet,

180
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,881
but it's most likely
a viral gastritis.

181
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,144
More commonly known
as a stomach flu.

182
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,190
That's all?
We hope so.

183
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,452
We're gonna keep Lily on fluids

184
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,062
and monitor
her condition, okay?

185
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,108
Best-case scenario,
it resolves on its own.

186
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,112
Thank you.
All right.

187
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,983
We'll keep you posted.
Thank you.

188
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,770
Oh, gosh.

189
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:30,901
Okay, I think that I have
every--

190
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:33,948
Mr. and Mrs. Bennett,
this is Dr. Hammer.

191
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,079
Hi.
Hi.

192
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,298
I feel okay.

193
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:37,778
I really--I don't think
I need to be here.

194
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,258
Honey, you had a seizure.

195
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,346
Mrs. Bennett
was getting ready

196
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,044
for work when it happened.

197
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,002
The seizure resolved on its own
before the paramedics arrived.

198
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:47,265
She's COVID-negative
but is running a fever of 102.

199
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:49,964
Okay, any history
of epilepsy, seizures?

200
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,270
No. First time.
But I didn't sleep well.

201
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:53,489
Could it just be that?

202
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,360
I don't know.
We're gonna take a look.

203
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:58,189
Dr. Taylor?
Yes.

204
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,495
Do you want me
to call your office,

205
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,105
let them know
you're not coming in?

206
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,238
No, no. I'll be fine.
I'll take care of it.

207
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,066
She's never missed
a day of work.

208
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,807
Stressful job?

209
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,808
A little.
Yeah.

210
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,287
They totally depend on her.

211
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,989
Okay. Lungs are clear.
Heart sounds good.

212
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,947
Pupils are equal
and reactive.

213
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,602
Ow. Ow.

214
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,299
Your liver
is slightly enlarged.

215
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,084
Dr. Taylor,
what do you recommend?

216
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,042
A CBC, BMP,
and a chest X-ray.

217
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,914
Is that all really necessary?

218
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,219
Yeah, I think so.

219
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,134
I'm sorry, but admissions
just informed me

with your insurance.

Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

223
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,488
She has great coverage
through her work.

224
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:39,535
I'll get it sorted out.

225
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,842

didn't tip him off?

318
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:05,262
He was having an auditory
hallucination.

319
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,699
Led him to believe he was

355
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:36,658
Okay, two months on the beach.

356

358
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,886

359

360
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,455
Wouldn't have to work so hard.

361

Right?

362
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,939
You know, given the degree
of portal hypertension,

363
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,899
we should use
a venovenous bypass

364
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,422
early in the hepatectomy.

365
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,337
Good catch.

366
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,165

No.

372

Uh,

375
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,664
yeah, the donated liver
is smaller in size,

376
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,840
so we should oversew.

377
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:30,451
Right.
Right.

378

He started talking funny,
not making any sense at all.

383
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,945
And then
he just stopped moving.

All right, GCS 7. Let's go.

Bag mask.

390
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,263
He needs a CT stat.

391
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:01,743
And let radiology know
we're coming up.

392
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:03,484
What's happened to him?
Not sure.

393
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,399
Hopefully we'll know
after the CT.

394
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,183
What about the transplant?

395
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:08,576
Believe me, we're gonna do
everything we can to make sure

396
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:09,707
he gets that surgery, okay?

397
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,318
Kate, would you
direct the family

398
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,581
to the waiting center, please?

399
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:16,279
Ready? Here we go, guys.

400

Come in.

401
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,330
So you informed the board?

402
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,679
I did.

403
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:27,029
They're very grateful
you and Dr. Halstead

404
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,336
uncovered this fraud.

405
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,467
Okay.

406
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,208
And they see a way,
going forward,

407
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:35,037
that will protect
the interests of the hospital.

408
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:36,778
What is that supposed
to mean?

409
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,867
Dr. Cooper will be fired
immediately, and Chicago Med

410
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,348
will discontinue use
of all Vasik equipment.

411
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:44,655
And that's it?
What about the FBI?

412
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,961
The board does not feel

413
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,702
that is in the hospital's
best interests.

414
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,269

415

Sharon, you and I both know
that these things are

00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,969
best dealt with quietly.

417
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,450
The board doesn't want
the negative publicity.

418
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:58,843
With good reason.
Look at the ramifications.

419
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,628
Loss of donors,
A-list physicians leaving.

420
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,890
It's devastating.

421
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,675
So I imagine
Dr. Cooper's father-in-law

422
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,460
had his hand in this.

423
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:09,376
Of course he did.
So Matt Cooper just walks?

424

And what about all those
other Vasik execs?

425
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,902

of the greater good.

528
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,707
Nobody's talking about that.
Nobody.

529
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,624
No new vitamins or supplements?

530
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,801
No, I take--I take, like,
Vitamin D, fish oil.

Well, those are both good.
Anything--anything else?

532

Oh, I started drinking this
tea like a month or two ago.

533
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,027
Hmm.

food store near me.

I drink one called
Mindful Energy.

537
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:35,990
It's supposed to help you
focus,

538
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:37,426
you know, keep you sharp.

Yeah, Happy Path.

I'm really glad to see
that you're feeling better.

00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,968
So what's the deal?

545
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:01,755
Can we turf Liddell
out of my ED or what?

546
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,757
You know, Dean, I gotta say,
hard not to notice

547
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,455
that you don't have
a whole lot of patience

549
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:09,980
You noticed that, have you?
Yeah.

550
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,373
Yeah.
You know Kyle, here,

551
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:16,726
and you know our patient
Krista, those twins, Neil.

552
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,773
Yeah, you just, you can't
let go of that, can you?

553
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:21,340
All right, let me give you
my perspective here.

554
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,167
Okay, when you're in combat
and you're dealing

555
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:26,997
with the wounded, they can say
some pretty crazy things.

556
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,087
You don't listen to them.
You just get them to safety.

557
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,394
And you do everything
you can to save their lives.

558
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:35,005
I completely get that. I do.

559
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,442
But, I mean,
just for the record,

560
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,183
trauma-induced mania, I mean,
it's temporary.

561
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:40,489
It's not a mental illness.

562
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,186
Look, you can split hairs
all you want.

563
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,492
What about Liddell?

564
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:45,102
You know, I still have
some digging to do,

565
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:50,369
but I have to say I am really
developing a--I don't know,

566
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,110
an admiration for his--
for this courage.

567
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:56,026

Yeah.

Yeah.
