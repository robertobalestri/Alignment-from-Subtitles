00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,456
- Would you like me to get her?

177
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,417
- No. No.

178
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,598
- Hi, Ms. Reed.
I'm Dr. Taylor.

179
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:49,947
- Hi, nice to meet you.

180
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:52,646
- Lydia choked
on some cereal this morning.

181
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,996
- I still feel like there's
something in there.

182
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,214
- I'm sorry.

183
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,216
Uh, has this happened
to you before?

184
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,436
- Uh, I thought I got a...

185
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,962
a doxycycline pill, uh,
stuck a few weeks ago.

186
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,095
I was taking it
for Lyme disease.

187
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,619
- Okay, um, how long ago
did you have that?

188
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,795
Turns out I didn't.

189
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,798
I also didn't have fibromyalgia

190
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:18,149
or MS or chronic fatigue.

191
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,980
You see enough specialists,
you get a pretty good list.

192
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,068
- Can I ask
what was going on

193
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,417
that made you see
all these doctors?

194
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:28,246
- Well, um,
a year and a half ago,

195
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,901
I... I... I got an... an eye twitch.

196
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,990
Uh, and I thought,

197
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:36,298
"Lydia, you are giving
200 talks a year."

198
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:40,215
I'm a motivational speaker.
"You're just tired."

199
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:45,350
But then my best friend
got diagnosed with ALS.

200
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:48,615
Scariest thing ever.
So I went to a neurologist,

201
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:50,965
but he ruled ALS out.

202
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,315
- That's good.
- Right.

203
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:57,537
But then I got coughing fits,
then stiffness...

204
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,191
Then exhaustion.

205
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,585
And nobody could figure it out.

206
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,369
Here I am.

207
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:05,849
- Well, hopefully, we'll
be able to help you today.

208
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,503
If it's okay, I'd like to order
some more bloodwork.

209
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,200
- Yes.
- And in the meantime,

210
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:10,550
I'm gonna take a closer look
at your throat.

211
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,377
- Okay.
- Prep pharyngoscope?

212
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,641
- And a CBC, CMP, and ANA.

213
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,033
- You got it.

214
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:19,080
- I'll be right back.

215
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:21,343
Hey, Mags?
- Mm-hmm?

216
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:22,866
- Were you able
to track down any info

217
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,738

218
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,218
- Oh, no.
I wasn't able to find anything.

219
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,873
But, um, I'll keep trying.

220
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,440
- Okay.

221
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,618
- Morning, Maggie.

222
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,968
- Oh, hey, Sharon.

223
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,536
- Uh-oh. What's up?

224
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,801
Vanessa keeps asking
about her biological father,

225
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:46,890
and I promised her I would try
and get in touch with him,

226
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:50,154
but I haven't.
- Oh.

227
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:51,373
- It's been over 20 years.

228
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,636
I don't want
to disrupt his life.

229
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,641
But it's what Vanessa wants,
and I want to be fair to her.

230
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:01,209
- Good morning, Ben.
- Sharon, nice to see you.

231
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:02,471
- Good to see you.

232
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:04,995
- Oh, walking is something
out there.

233

Coffee after my checkup?
- Yeah, you bet.

235

236
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,092

with Vanessa

237
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:16,354
in the first place,

238
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:19,444
but have you discussed this
with him?

239
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:20,532
- No!

240
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:23,971
- Maggie...
- Sharon, no.

241
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,364
- Hey, where's Sam?

242
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,932
- Uh, just sent him to IR
for an embolization.

243
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:30,020
- Why?
Bullet tract went

244
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,065
straight through the lung.

245
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,240
The chest tube took care
of that.

246
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,546
- Yeah, but look...

247
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,636
the bullet we saw on the x-ray
caused a pseudoaneurysm

248
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,333
in a branch
of the pulmonary artery.

249
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,683
- That thing could have blown
anytime.

250
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,251
- You know, Sam said
he never got shot before,

251
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:44,339
so he must have got hit
twice today,

252
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:45,819

253

the other entry wound.

254
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:48,865

256
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:53,696

257
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,700
I... I've got an idea
how we might know for sure.

258
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,876
- The thing
about bodycam footage

259
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,053
is it's all live and unedited,
so it can get kind of violent.

00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,294
when I told her
that I couldn't find anything.

351
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,687
I don't know,
something about it

352
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,298
just feels a little off.
- Okay.

353
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,910
How can I help?
- I don't know.

354
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:13,913
The long history,
the multiple diagnoses,

355
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,958
she... she could be malingering?

356
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,352
Do you mind talking to her?
- No.

357
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:21,964
Shoot me her chart?
- Okay.

358
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,531
- Well, labs don't show much,

359
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,837
but her pressure's
still creeping up.

360
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,752
Think this could be
pre-eclampsia?

361
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:30,320
- Could be,
but her LFT levels

362
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,628
are slightly elevated
and her glucose is low.

363
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,979
I'm wondering
if this actually might be

364
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,373
acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

365
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,418
- If AFLP is even
on the table...

366
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:42,985
I mean, missing it
would be catastrophic.

367
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:45,466
- Yeah.
We need to know for sure.

368
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,076
- Can you get this
up to Abrams for me?

369
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,208
Thank you.
- Crockett...

370
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:49,818
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?

371
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,167
- Yeah, what do you need?

372
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:53,561
- A liver biopsy
to check for AFLP.

373
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,608
- Okay, but if it is,
you do realize

374
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:59,610
that the biopsy site
could bleed considerably.

375
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:00,785
- Yeah, we need an answer.

376
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,004
If it's just pre-eclampsia,

377
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,440
we'll keep the baby in
as long as we can.

378
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:04,876
- But if it is AFLP,

379
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,574
the only cure is to deliver it.

380
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,054
- And if you watch and wait?

381
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,707
- There's a chance that
it could all work out fine.

382
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,014
But there's also a chance
that the baby, and even Mom,

383
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,799
could die.
We need this biopsy.

384
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,236
Right.

385
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,412
I don't know.
I'm not liking the choices.

386
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,937
- Crockett,
Dr. Asher needs the biopsy.

387
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,634
- I think Dr. Marcel heard me.

388
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,335
- Okay. I'll set it up.

389
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:29,684
- Great.
- You got it.

390
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,251
- Thank you.

391
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:34,950
- Hannah.

392
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,259
Hannah!

393
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:42,610
- Why do you constantly feel
the need to save me, Will?

394
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,003
- Save you?

395
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,744
- What you just did
with Crockett.

396
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,398
Not telling me about the check?

397
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,792
- Whoa, I...
hey, I'm just trying to help.

398
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,359
- Really, Will?

399
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:53,316
Or is it because
you don't think

400
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,015
I can take care of myself?

401
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,452
No matter what I do,
you are still stuck

402
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:00,584
on how you thought about me
two years ago.

403
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,543
- I want to support you.

404
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:03,587
I don't want to derail

405
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,024
all the hard work
that you've done.

406
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,679
- That is my responsibility,
not yours.

407
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,426
- I gotta tell you,
I don't think

408
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,081
she's malingering.
- Really?

409
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,040
But she's seen every specialist
in Chicago.

410
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,563
- Yeah, but true malingering,

411
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,086
I mean, at least
from a clinical standpoint,

412
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,436
would mean that she was
making up

413
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,090
or exaggerating symptoms
for some kind

414
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,701
of secondary gain, right?

415
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,007
Like drug-seeking

416
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,443
or because she didn't want
to go to work.

417
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,836
You know, I'm just not
picking that up.

418
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,098
I think she really wants
an answer.

419
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,143
- What if there isn't one?

420
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:38,405
All of her tests
came back negative.

421
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:39,754
- Well, maybe you have
to keep on digging.

422
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:42,278
Have you thought about,
I don't know,

423
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,847
a lumbar puncture
or an endocrine panel?

424
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,631
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

425
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:50,025
But the history
of doctor shopping,

426
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,244
and that meltdown before...

427
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,463
ugh, I don't know.

428
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,639
I'd also like to give her
a psychiatric questionnaire.

429
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:56,814
Just to make sure
we're not missing anything.

430
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,816
- Okay.
Let me, uh, know

431
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,557
what you find out.
- Okay.

432
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:15,442
- Excuse me, uh, but I know
an officer involved

433
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:18,097
with the raids this morning.

434
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,315
Any word on any other injuries?

435
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,534
- Details are sketchy,

436
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:23,885
but it's still dangerous
out there.

437
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,322
Hey, you got a name?

438
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:30,152
- Actually, no.
They're undercover.

439
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,284
- Well, I'll keep my ears open,

440
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,938
let you know

441

- Dr. Scott. How's Sam?

442
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:43,426

but it's still too early

to tell
if the procedure worked.

444

- Dr. Scott? We need you.

445
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:53,654
- His chest tube's
putting out blood.

446
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,612
The embolization plug
must have dislodged.

447
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,571

and FFP.

- BP's down to 78/52.

00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:34,570
I am... I... I am so... so...
I'm so sorry.

525
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:37,138
- Lydia, what's going on?

526
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:40,489
I don't know
why this keeps happening.

527
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,884
- Well, what keeps happening?

528
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:47,017
- I've been so e...
emotional lately.

529
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:49,672
And it... it...
it just comes over me.

530
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:51,674
- Right.
A... and when that happens,

531
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:53,502
what... how do you experience it?

532
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:56,505
W... what does it feel like?

533
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:57,985
- I don't know.

534
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:01,641
It's, like, so much feeling,

535
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:05,079
and, um, it's...
it's overwhelming.

536
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,123
- Right.

537
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:08,430
But then it suddenly just ends?

538
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,824
- Like someone hit a switch.

539
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,392
- Okay, um,
could you give me a moment?

540
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:18,658
- It... it... it's gotta be
psychiatric, right?

541
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:21,574
- Actually,
these emotional outbursts

542
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,706
are making me think
it could be just the opposite.

543
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,534
I'll be right back.

544
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:31,322
♪

545
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,324
- Hi, Mrs. Devers?

546
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:34,935
We got Sam's CT results,

547
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,589
and he's gonna need
another procedure

548
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,460
to stop the bleed.

549
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,854
- Uh, do whatever you have to.

550
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:43,552
- Actually, uh,
we do need to make a choice.

551
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:47,121
And since Sam is intubated,
the decision falls to you.

552
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:51,386
- Please, have a seat.

553
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,869
So we can do a thoracotomy
and fix the vessel,

554
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:57,827
but it is a major procedure

555
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,003
that comes
with some significant risks.

556
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,789
- Or we can place a stent,

557
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:04,747
which is
a much less invasive procedure,

558
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,488
but it does mean
Sam would have to be

559
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:09,360
on anticoagulants
for the rest of his life.

560
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,625
- It could result in him
being pulled from active duty.

561
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:16,237
- He could still work,
just not on the street, right?

562
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,413
- Yes.

563
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,590
- Mrs. Devers, this is
a very big decision

564
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:24,550
that could potentially end
your husband's career.

565
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:27,466
So if you need more time,
or if you have any...

566
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:32,601
- No.
I'd like you to do the stent.

567
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:33,994
Okay.

568
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:41,001
- How's it looking?
- Almost there. You?

569
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,306
- Still not clotting.

570
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,352
Uh, keep up the FFP,
cryo, and blood.

571
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:45,832
More lap pads.

572
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,747
- All right, uterine incision.

573
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,842
There we go.

574
00:24:55,885 --> 00:25:00,455
Here she comes.
Here comes baby.

575
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,763
All right.
Got her.

576
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,068
Here she is.

577
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:07,506
All right. Apgar, 6.

578
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,989
Baby needs to be intubated.

579
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,687
- I'm on it.

580
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,253
- Still got a lot
of bleeding here.

581
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:18,255
- Uterus is still bleeding too.

582
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,042
- Pressure's down to 82/54.

583
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,826
- I'm in.
Let's get her up to the NICU.

584
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:26,960
- Kat's hemorrhaging.

585
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:29,571
- All right, I need
2 milligrams methergine IM,

586
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:32,966
250 micrograms hemabate subQ.
Get me a Bakri.

587
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,533
- Keep up the leverage.

588
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,274
- She's bleeding from her nose.
She's in DIC.

589
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:39,407
- If she can't clot,
her liver's never gonna hold.

590
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,583
- Down to 70/42.

591
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,193
- Crockett?

592
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:47,458
- Yeah, her liver's ruptured.
Curve six, let's go.

593
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,243
- She's bleeding out.
I need more blood!

594
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:58,121
- Easy, guys.
- What...

595
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,862
no, K... Kat?

596
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:02,865
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you taking her?

597
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,172
- Her liver ruptured.
We're trying to stop the bleed.

598
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:06,390
- What?

599
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,957
- Mrs. Miller?
This is Dr. Blake,

600
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,916
chief of our
transplant surgery.

601
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,482
We believe
that your daughter's gonna need

602
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,441
a liver transplant.
- A transplant?

603
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:14,747
- A section of liver,

604
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,052
ideally from a living donor.

605
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:17,663
- For now, we're gonna take her
to the ICU

606
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:21,362
and get her stabilized
until we can find a match.

607
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,669
We'll keep you updated, okay?

608
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:26,410
- Use me. I'm ready.

609
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:27,760
- Well, there's
a process to this...

610
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,023
- My daughter is not waiting.

611
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,938
I am the same blood type,
I'm healthy,

612
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:33,983
and I'm standing
right in front of you.

613
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:36,029
And I am not leaving
until I can make sure

614
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:38,248
that my daughter lives
to see her baby.

615
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,992
- Okay.

616
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:54,090
- Hi, I'm Lydia Reed.

617
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:55,614
And this is an issue

618
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,703
that many of us parents
deal with.

619
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:00,531
Because we value the truth.

620
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,316
But what we value even more

621
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,580
is our children's
happiness and safety.

622
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,583
So what happens
when those two values

623
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,106
come into conflict?

624
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,065
We know something
that's gonna hurt our kids.

625
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:15,634
So what do we do?
We put it aside.

626
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,984
When you find something
that you...

627
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:20,464
- Okay, halfway
through the IVC anastomosis.

628
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,118
How're we looking, Marty?

629
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:24,033
- Losing too much blood.

630
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,340
Pressure's down to 84/56.

631
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,124
- Come on.

632
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,256
Check that liver again.

633
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,916
Yeah, I got another bleeder.

634
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,352
Maya, buzz me.

635
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:43,139
Right there, go. Okay.

636
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:46,577
Damn it. Another bleeder.

637
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,667
And another.

638
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,711
- Dr. Blake, I could use
another set of hands.

639
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:50,930
- No, I can't.

640
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,975
- Pamela...
- I want the best outcome

641
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,281
for that woman's daughter,
Crockett,

642
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:56,500
and right now that's you.

643
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,328
Just focus on finishing
the anastomosis.

644
00:27:58,372 --> 00:27:59,852
- All right, but she's losing
a lot of blood.

645
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,985
- You can do this.
Stop chasing the bleeding.

646
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:04,552
- 77/48.

647
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,771
- The faster you sew
that vessel,

648
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:07,250
the sooner you can get
out of there.

649
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:09,513
- All right.

650
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,385
Finishing the anastomosis.

651
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,735
72/40.

652
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,868
- Hold on.
- MAPs are in the 50s.

653
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,130
- Hold on!

654
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:22,831
Easy. Easy, easy. Okay, got it.

655
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,746
Cut me.

656
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,792
How're we looking?

657
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,315
- Pressure stabilized.

658
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,751
- All right.

659
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:32,101
Let's get this belly tied up
and get out of here.

660
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:36,845
♪

661
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:39,718
- So we've written down
a few sentences here.

662
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,459
Would you mind reading them
out loud for us?

663
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:45,288
Sure.

664
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,075
"When you find something

"you don't want

"that's usually the thing

667
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:57,126
you need
to tell them the most."

668
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,781
This was from a talk
I gave a few years ago.

669
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:03,306
- Yeah, five to be exact.

670
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,005
I have it right here.

671
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:07,310
When you find something

672
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:09,530
that you don't want
to tell your kids,

673
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:10,836
that's usually the thing

that you need
to tell them the most.

675
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:16,189
That's the thing
they need to he...

676
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:17,625
- I'm hearing
a marked difference

677
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,366
in your speech pattern
on the video.

678
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:24,284
It's not as halting
or pressured as it is now.

679
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:26,765
- Is that significant?

680
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,288
- I think it could be.

681
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,812
And these outbursts of yours,
they're sudden.

682
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:33,075
They're often unwarranted.
- Yes.

683
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,035
- It's called
Pseudobulbar Affect.

684
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:37,297
- What's...

685
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,908
- They're exaggerated
emotional responses.

686
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,780
They're not caused
by emotional instability

687
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:45,609
or an altered
psychological state.

688
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,742
Um, they're caused
by the degeneration

689
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,309
of certain brain cells.

690
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:51,137
- I'm really sorry to have
to tell you this, Lydia,

691
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,227
but I think that we might
be dealing with ALS.

692
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,706
- ALS?

693
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,058
No, no. It c... can't be.

694
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,974
The neurologist ruled it out.

695
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:05,978
- I imagine that they ruled out
a more common presentation.

696
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:07,588
I... I think that you have
a more rare form

697
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,068
which is called Bulbar ALS.

698
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,331
Much more difficult
