Asherman's Syndrome.

317
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,243

- Yeah?

319
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:08,075

- Well, what does that mean?

321
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,513
- The lining of Claire's uterus
is too thick,

322
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,733

to bleed uncontrollably.

324
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:16,518
I can't lose this uterus.

325
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,259
- Let's give the medicine
some time to work.

326
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:21,610
- And if it doesn't,
can you do another transplant?

327
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,481
- First let's send Claire
for a hysteroscopy

328
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:24,439
to get a closer look.

329
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:25,527

we'll have a better idea

330
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,876

332
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,705
- We'll be right back, okay?
- Yes.

333
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,880
- Hang tight.

334
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,538
- Dr. Blake.

335
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,933
- Cadaver uterus.
- Mm.

336
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,369
Makes sense
she's having trouble.

337
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:43,675
A uterus from a cadaver
can be unpredictable.

338
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:46,243
It's much better to get one
from a living donor.

339
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,549
How bad's the bleeding?

340
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,029
- Yeah, pretty heavy.

341
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:50,204
- What do you think?

342
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,553
If she does need
a hysterectomy,

343
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,859
could you do another
transplant?

344
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,512
- Yeah, it's certainly
something to consider.

345
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,036
- I don't like it.

346
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,081
Prolonged bleeding makes her
a poor surgical candidate.

347
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,475
And I'm not gonna give her
another cadaveric organ.

348
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,433
- But she's young
and otherwise healthy.

349
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:04,044
Maybe it'd be worth
working her up

350
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:05,480
just to keep our options open.

351
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,004
- Uterus transplant
is elective surgery.

352
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,485
I'm here to save lives.

353
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,052
We're not doing it.

354
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,360
