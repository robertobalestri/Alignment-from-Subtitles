1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:04,047
.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,310
- With the suggestion
from Dr. Cooper

3
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:08,312
I could've sabotaged
Archer's CVP monitor

4
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:10,401
so that the Vas-COM
could save the day.

5
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,099
And I came close to doing it.

6
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:14,231
- If this ever gets
to be too much for you,

7
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,190
I'll put a stop
to the whole thing.

8
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,105
- I'll take it from here.

9
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,628
- I assumed I'd perform
the surgery.

10
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:20,890
- You're free to watch.

11
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,633
- Best by the powers that be.
- I'm sorry.

12
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:26,809
I made a fool of myself
with Dr. Marcel.

13
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:29,159
I'm crushing on my advisor.

14
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:31,118
- How long
you been doing this?

15
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:33,076
- 35 years.
- How?

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,078
- You got to hang on
to those good days.

17
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:36,732
You got to hang on
to those wins.

18
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:45,480
- Really, Dad?
- What? It's fine.

19
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:48,091
- It's a red zone.
It's for emergencies only.

20
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:52,095
No--
- See?

21
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,444
Now, it's an emergency.

22
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,882
Oh, you know what?
I wanna check this out.

23
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:58,536
New PDT system.

24
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,322
I can check all
of my units in real time.

25
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,540
- But, look,
can I check it out later?

26
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,194
I really do have to go.
I'm late.

27
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:07,371
- Everything okay here?
- Oh, yeah, we all good.

28
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:08,807
Just a little ride-along.

29
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,201
Letting a civilian see
what a real job looks like.

30
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,725
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,901
Am I embarrassing you?

32
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,207
- I'll see you later.

33
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:22,212
Come on, Dad.

34
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,867
Okay, I'm gone.

35
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,570
- Hey, what's up?

36
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:33,963
- Do you remember
how when we were

37
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,618
in physical exam class,
when we did breast exams,

38
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,141
they would tell us
to make small talk

39
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,229
with the patient actors?

40
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,535
- Yeah, to help
put them at ease.

41
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,798
- Yeah and there was
that one guy, Mandelbrot.

42
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,756
Super awkward.
Caught hell for asking

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,584
one of them what
she was doing that weekend.

44
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,804
- Oh.
- He is a panelist

45
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:51,676
at the next summit
for female physicians.

46
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,159
- Wait, that wasn't Mandelbrot.

47
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,247
It was Richardson.

48
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,727
- No, pretty sure
it was Mandelbrot.

49
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,818
- No, it was Richardson.
- You haven't changed a bit.

50
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,560
Always got to one-up me.
- I'm not trying to one-up you.

51
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,779
- Two shots for Dr. Hammer.
Three for Dr. Halstead.

52
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:12,436
-  Thank you.

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,786
Have a good day.
- You too. Thanks, Carly.

54
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,181
- Morning.
- Good morning.

55
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:21,184
Dr. Halstead, how are things
with Dr. Cooper?

56
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:24,231
- Uh, pretty well, I think.
- Oh, yeah?

57
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,798
- I mean, he hasn't said
anything otherwise.

58
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,626
- Good morning,
Ms. Goodwin, Will.

59
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,411
- Matt.

60
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:31,586
- Just the man
I was looking for.

61
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:32,456
I want to tell you about
the conference

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,849
coming up in a few weeks.

63
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,546
- National Critical Care
Society annual meeting.

64
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,461
- It's here in Chicago.
You should go.

65
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,637
Vasik's gonna be
a platinum sponsor.

66
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,639
They're gonna have
a corner booth.

67
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,250
It's gonna be
the perfect chance

68
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:44,729
for you to meet
some of the upper-level execs.

69
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,821
Oh, do you think that you could
spare him for the day?

70
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,867
- It's always good
when our doctors

71
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,477
broaden their expertise.

72
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,479
- I'll be there.
- Okay, great.

73
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,613
I'll get you the details.
Um, Ms. Goodwin.

74
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,660
- This might be good.

75
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:06,447
And maybe I can get them to
offer me a deal like Cooper's.

76
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,453
- Geez, I got to get this, but,
uh, you're on the right track.

77
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,023
- Thank you, La'Shawn.
Morning, Alim.

78
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,242
Hey.
- Hey.

79
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,417
- What time did you get in?

80
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:22,680
- Uh, I don't know.
Like, around four.

81
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,421
- Why so early?

82
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,857
- Always try to get
a leg up on the day.

83
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:28,991
- Two hours before your shift?

84
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,949
- Well, if I'm meeting
with my patients earlier,

85
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,473
then I can read up
on their conditions.

86
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,257
That way, I'm running rounds,
I'll have all the answers.

87
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,345
Plus, if I'm here
a little early,

88
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,781
I can study for my boards.

89
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:39,262
- Sleep ever a factor
in this equation?

90
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,438
- Life of an intern.
What can I tell ya?

91
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:42,700
- Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah.

92
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:45,529
- Treatment three incoming.

93
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:46,617
- What do we got?

94
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,358
- Avery Quinn,
28-year-old female.

95
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,405
Pedestrian versus auto.
BP 80/45.

96
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,537
Heart rate 114, satting at 88.

97
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,886
- Okay, Avery, I'm Dr. Marcel.

98
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,061
We're gonna take
good care of you, okay?

99
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,715
- It hurts so much.

100
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,587
- Trigger the MTP,
give her 50 of fentanyl.

101
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,460
Here we go, guys.
Transfer on my count.

102
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:06,550
One, two, three.

103
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:09,553
- There it is.
All right, let's roll her.

104
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:12,295
You're okay, we got you.
The board...

105
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:19,911
- All right, we're good.

106
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,392
Avery, can you put
your arms by your side for me?

107
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:23,785
You're gonna feel
a little bit of pressure, okay?

108
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,311
- O2 sats down to 82.

109
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:31,401
- Avery, Avery.
Avery...she's out.

110
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,751
We need to intubate.
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

111
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,537
Get a CBC, CMP,
type and cross four units.

112
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,756
Let's get a fastscan
and have them prep OR 12.

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,585
- No, she's going to OR seven.
- Excuse me?

114
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:42,934
- Yeah, I'll take it from here.

115
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,502
And let's add
a coag panel and LFTs.

116
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:46,982
- Dr. Blake,
I think you're mistaken.

117
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:49,071
This is a trauma,
not a transplant surgery.

118
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:51,029
- Yeah, I can see that.

119
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:53,510
She's got free fluid,
and she's in shock.

120
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,077
Her liver's ruptured
but repairable.

121
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,036
We got to get her up now.
- I'm in. Bag her.

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,779
All do respect, Dr. Blake,
you're a transplant surgeon.

123
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,781
I got this.
- Thank you, Dr. Marcel,

124
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,348
but I'll be
taking over the case now.

125
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,784
- I'm sorry,
I can't let you do that.

126
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,264
This is my patient.

127
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,310
- And I understand that,
but she's also my daughter.

128
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,008
Now, I'm gonna need you
to move.

129
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,749
Let's go.

130
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,758
- You got a transplant patient?

131
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,847
- No, I don't.

132
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,544
But we have a problem.

133
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:33,333
â™ª

134
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:42,777
.

135
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,866
- Hey, Alex, I'm Dr. Scott.

136
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,215
- I'm Susan.
This is Todd.

137
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:49,087
And this is Ry--Ryan, come on.

138
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:51,525
- Hey, Ryan, can I get
a couple of those?

139
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,225
- Ryan, enough with the gloves,
okay?

140
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,183
- Thanks.

141
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:01,796
Alex, says here that you

142
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,059
got hit in the head
with a Nerf gun.

143
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:07,062
- Yeah.
- Oof, I bet that hurt.

144
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:10,195
The thing is, you're supposed
to get hit with the foam dart,

145
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,545
not the actual gun.

146
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,285
- Stop it.

147
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,419
- It was an accident.
The boys were playing.

148
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,421
- Mom, it wasn't a Nerf gun.
- Okay.

149
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,075
I--I didn't even see it happen.
I--okay.

150
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,119
- Ryan.
- Mom---mom.

151
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,294
- Hey, just a minute.
- Mom--

152
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:23,470
- They were down in
the basement and--

153
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:24,906
- It wasn't a Nerf gun.
- Ryan, okay.

154
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,603
- Hey, hey, hey, Ryan.

155
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,257
What's up, buddy?
Talk to me.

156
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,955
- It was an Ultra Blaster.
- Oh, yeah?

157
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,001
Triple action
with the slam-fire?

158
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:36,134
- Uh-huh.
- Sweet. Yeah.

159
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,310
- "I'm sorry, Doctor"?

160
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,616
Todd, you want to take him
for a walk to the truck?

161
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,140
Give him his meds.
Okay, go with Dad. Go.

162
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:49,409
- Oh, man.
Tough day, huh, bro?

163
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,149
- He has ADHD.

164
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,934
- Yeah, we have him
on Adderall,

165
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,979
but we keep upping the dose,

166
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,459
and some days
are just a little tough.

167
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:59,506
-  I know.
It's okay.

168
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:02,030
What about you?
How you doing?

169
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,293
-  I'm fine.

170
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,121
- You sure?

171
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,211
Okay then.

172
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:11,082
For now, we're gonna keep
applying pressure

173
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,215
and get you all stitched up.
Shouldn't be too long.

174
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:22,485
Hey, Mags, I need somebody
to throw stitches in six.

175
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:23,573
- I'm on it.

176
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,009
- You already have
two patients up.

177
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,141
You sure you have time?
- Don't worry.

178
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,403
I got it.

179
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,544
- Rough morning, huh?
- Yeah.

180
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,284
It's a tricky family dynamic.

181
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,025
I'm treating
a 10-year-old named Alex.

182
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,244
His brother has ADHD.

183
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:43,419
Seems like
it's pretty tough on them.

184
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,638
- Yeah.

185
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,030
- Takes up a lot
of the family's energy.

186
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:47,423
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,991
Parents so focused
on--on the kid with the illness

188
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,297
that they see right through
the other one.

189
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,082
Yeah, unfortunately
not at all uncommon.

190
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,084
There's even a name for it.
It's called--it's called

191
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,433
glass child syndrome.

192
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,696
- Oh, that sounds like
exactly what's happening.

193
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,046
- Yeah, happy to provide you
with a couple referrals

194
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,526
for a therapist
for the--for the kid

195
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,049
if you think the parents'll
be open to it.

196
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,224
- I think that'd be great.
Thanks.

197
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,226
- Oh.

198
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,619
Dr. Choi,
I've been bugging him

199
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,142
for an update on his rehab.
I better take this.

200
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,318
- Go ahead, man, and tell him
I look forward to meeting.

201
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:14,189
- Will do.

202
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,714
- I understand
this must be hard for you,

203
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,716
but that's the very reason
I can't let you go in there.

204
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,718
- I appreciate your concern,
but I'm fine.

205
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:23,590
- Dr. Blake.
- Ms. Goodwin.

206
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,418
- You know very well
it's against hospital policy

207
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,029
to operate on a family member.

208
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:30,161
- I am perfectly qualified
to perform this surgery.

209
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,512
- Pamela, you are
a transplant surgeon.

210
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,209
- Dr. Archer and I
see these cases every day.

211
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,732
- And I make more money
for this hospital

212
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:39,083
than any other doctor here.
- That is not the point.

213
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:43,305
Dr. Archer is
a top trauma surgeon.

214
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:46,526
He will do an excellent job.

215
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,746
- I will,
and if you're so inclined,

216
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,705
I'd be happy
to have you observe.

217
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:57,972
â™ª

218
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,371
- Ryan.
- Ryan--

219
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:09,287
can you sit still
for just one minute?

220
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,985
-  I'm gonna go
get some air.

221
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,377
- Yeah.

222
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,515
- Will, can I get
your opinion on something?

223
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,170
- Sure.
What's going on?

224
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:23,563
- I've got a 71-year-old woman

225
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:25,608
who's hypotensive
and tachycardic.

226
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,305
Passed out this morning
at home.

227
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:29,786
No medical history
other than asthma.

228
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,614
She could use
some cardiac monitoring,

229
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,311
and I know that
you're big on the Vas-COM.

230
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,704
- Well, I mean, there are
a number

231
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:38,099
of good cardiac output
monitors.

232
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:40,580
But the Vas-COM
is a terrific device.

233
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,625
You mind if I, uh,
have a look at her?

234
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,279
See if she's a good candidate?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

235
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,328
- Eleanor, Ron,
this is Dr. Halstead.

236
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,634
- Hi.

237
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:52,940
- He's just going to ask you
a few questions.

238
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,072
- Nice to meet you.
- You have to help her.

239
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,334
Ellie, tell him,

240
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:57,640
you've never been sick
a day in your life.

241
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:00,643
- Ron--
- No, no, that's good to hear.

242
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,645
You mind if I?
- Mm-hm.

243
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,038
- Make a fist.

244
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,432
And release.

245
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,782
- Good.

246
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,435
Does she have
any sensitivities or allergies?

247
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,220
Recent injuries,
meds that would interfere

248
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,657
with an arterial line?
- Just seasonal allergies.

249
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,355
- Okay. Eleanor, do you
ever have any trouble

250
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,054
when you get your blood drawn?
- I don't think so.

251
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:24,362
- What about leg swelling?
Long car rides, trips?

252
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:26,190
- No, not that I can remember.

253
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:29,672
- That's good.

254
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,109
All right, it was nice
to meet you.

255
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:33,850
I'll have a chat
with Dr. Hammer.

256
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:35,069
We'll be right back.

257
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,508
- What do you think?
She look good for the Vas-COM?

258
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,814
- Uh, maybe.

259
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,554
She was
a little vague in her answers.

260
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:43,686
- But she definitely
should have

261
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,253
her cardiac output monitored?

262
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,255
- Dr. Hammer,
if you're interested,

263
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:48,604
I could give you copies

264
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,868
of the Vas-COM's FDA-approved
usage criteria?

265
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:54,088
- You know, that--that
won't be necessary.

266
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:56,394
I think Eleanor would be
a great candidate.

267
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,614
- Okay, good.
I'll get it set up.

268
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,144
- Dr. Scott.
- Alex?

269
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,798
- Dr. Taylor.
- Buddy? What?

270
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,670
Alex.
- Bud...

271
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,716
- Excuse me.
- Honey, honey?

272
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,849
What--what's happening?
- He's having a seizure.

273
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:18,547
Give him 12 liters of O2
and .five of Ativan.

274
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,505
- Wait, seizure?
Why is he having a seizure?

275
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:21,724
- I'm not sure yet.

276
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,465
Come on.

277
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:26,555
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

278
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:32,604
â™ª

279
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:37,174
Hey, Alex, you with me?

280
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,785
- Uh-huh.

281
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,482
-  Okay.

282
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:46,575
â™ª

283
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,925
We're gonna figure this out
as soon as we can.

284
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,579
Dr. Taylor.

285
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,755
â™ª

286
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,410
- Hi, hi, okay.
It's okay.

287
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,325
- Has that cut been bleeding
like that the whole time?

288
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,153
- I tried holding pressure,
but it didn't work.

289
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,545
And if I would've tried
to stitch too soon,

290
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:01,721
he would've got a hematoma.

291
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:02,765
- He could have
a bleeding disorder.

292
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,288
Did you order coags?

293
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,856
- Um, well, no. I--
- Get a coag panel, Maggie.

294
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,771
And let CT know
we're on our way.

295
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:11,600
- Wait, do you think he
could have a subdural hematoma?

296
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,602
- Yes, and if he does have
a bleeding disorder,

297
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,169
then the trauma
from getting hit in the head

298
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,518
could've caused
a bleed in the skull,

299
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,781
which means he could herniate
at any moment.

300
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,391
All right, now.
Let's go.

301
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:23,568
â™ª

302
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,570
Oh, my God.

303
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:29,139
.

304
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,576
- Okay, ready to release
the pringle.

305
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,796
- Hold on, I didn't get
a good look at the duodenum.

306
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,625
- It's clear.
- Okay.

307
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:37,887
- All right, pulling back
on the lap.

308
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,151
Looks good.

309
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,806
- What's her pH and temp?

310
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,852
- 7.34 and 36.9.

311
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:47,810
- All right, looks like
you're good to close.

312
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:52,119
- Uh, actually, we're just
gonna pack and leave her open.

313
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,773
- No, her bleeding's
under control.

314
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,949
Packing her isn't necessary.
- I disagree.

315
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,777
She's got a grade four
liver laceration.

316
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,256
The risk of re-bleeding
is too high.

317
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,997
- She's a healthy 28-year-old.

318
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,825
Leaving her open puts her
at increased risk

319
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:05,654
for infection, coagulopathy,
hypothermia, and acidosis.

320
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,830
- Dr. Blake, I--
- Close her up, doctor.

321
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:10,572
- I understand your concerns.
- No, no, point well taken.

322
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,313
I see the merit
in what Dr. Blake is saying.

323
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:13,836
- Dr. Archer--
- All right, hold off

324
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,838
on the lap.
I need Celox, Gelfoam,

325
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:18,754
and get an O Max
and suture for Dr. Marcel.

326
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,843
- Dr. Archer, you--
- Dr. Marcel.

327
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,672
â™ª

328
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,589
- Mr. and Mrs. Miller,
I'm Dr. Charles.

329
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,286
I had been consulting

330
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,854
with--with Dr. Scott
on Alex's case.

331
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,161
- Psychiatry?
- Head injury.

332
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,250
You know, can't be too careful.

333
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:38,295
Anyway, Dr. Scott wanted me
to let you know that

334
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,211
Alex's scans are almost ready.
And in the meantime,

335
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,691
is there anything
I can get you?

336
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:43,866
A bottle of water?
- Thank you, but we're fine.

337
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,259
- Yeah.

338
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:46,651
Oh, sorry.
This is work.

339
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,697
Um, don't forget
to text my parents.

340
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,959
Excuse me.
- Oh, okay. Yep.

341
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,657
- Ryan? Is it Ryan?
How about you, buddy?

342
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:55,225
Can I get you something?
- Do you mind if I...

343
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,357
- No, not at all.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

344
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,881
- Not at all.

345
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:02,232
- Would you, uh,
like a sandwich or something?

346
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:07,020
No? Bag of chips?

347
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,370
Soda?
Anything at all?

348
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,025
- No!
You interrupted me.

349
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:15,289
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I, uh, I--I didn't mean to.

350
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,900
- Now I have to start
all over again.

351
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:21,382
- Oh, you were counting.
Huh?

352
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:24,254
Okay, well, I'm--again,
I'm very sorry.

353
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,300
You--you get back to that.
All right?

354
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:32,915
- Mr. and Mrs. Miller, we just
got Alex's test results back.

355
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,917
Alex is stable right now,

356
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:38,181
but the scan did confirm that
he is bleeding into his brain.

357
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,924
And the intracranial pressure
is great enough

358
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:44,884
that he needs
immediate surgical evacuation.

359
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,059
- Oh, my God.

360
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:48,061
- Wait, wait, wait.
How'd this happen?

361
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,150
- Well, his test results
came back positive

362
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:53,327
for a bleeding disorder called
Von Willebrand disease.

363
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,852
So the impact from a small toy
could've caused a bleed

364
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,289
that his body
just wasn't able to stop.

365
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:01,770
- I--I know this is a lot,

366
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:03,772
but Dr. Abrams
will be doing the surgery,

367
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,252
and he's our very best.

368
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,949
The procedure
shouldn't be that long.

369
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,169
I'll be here for status updates
or if you have any questions.

370
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:11,780
- And if we have your consent,

371
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:12,999
we could get started
right away.

372
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,174
- Sure.
- Yeah, of course.

373
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,392
Whatever you need.
- Okay.

374
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,785
So why don't I take you
somewhere

375
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:17,960
that's more comfortable
to wait?

376
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,223
- Um, Ryan.
Hey, buddy.

377
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,311
Come on, buddy.
We're gonna take

378
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,965
a little walk, all right?

379
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:29,972
â™ª

380
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,242
- Hey, I saw
Eleanor's oxygenation

381
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:40,809
and cardiac output are down.

382
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:42,158
Have you gotten her labs
back yet?

383
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,986
- Yeah; they don't show much.
Mild infiltrates

384
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,032
on her chest X-ray
and some eosinophilia.

385
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,903
Still don't know
what's going on.

386
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,687
- I'm a little concerned.

387
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,298
One of her fingers and two
of her toes are going cold.

388
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,995
- Oh, could just be
a vasospasm.

389
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,215
- That could be, but--

390
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,347
look, the major drawback
to any arterial line,

391
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,175
including the Vas-COM,
is the potential

392
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,263
for thrombus formation.

393
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:01,743
So I think we should
pull it out.

394
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:03,440
- Pull it out?

395
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,747
I mean, thromboembolization
in arterial lines

396
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,444
is extremely rare,
and it almost never occurs

397
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,794
this quickly.
- I understand.

398
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,361
I just think we should err
on the side of safety.

399
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,538
What?

400
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:18,325
- Is something going on?
It's getting us great numbers.

401
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,022
Keeping Eleanor's meds titrated

402
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,024
and her pressure
and heart rate optimized.

403
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,373
Without it, we'd just be
shooting in the dark.

404
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,158
- I know.
I just want to make sure

405
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:28,161
we're using it appropriately.
- I think we are.

406
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,206
Let's just give it
a little more time.

407
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,038
â™ª

408
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,301
- Dr. Archer.
- Yeah.

409
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,042
- What the hell
happened back there?

410
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:41,130
- What?

411
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:43,045
- Giving in to Dr. Blake
like that.

412
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,962
- The surgery was a success,
and if you'll excuse me,

413
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,485
I have an ED to run.

414
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,357
- Hold on, Dean.

415
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,141
You know,
with that kind of injury,

416
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,056
keeping her open
is the right thing to do.

417
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,363
- Dr. Blake's reasoning
was medically sound.

418
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,539
I mean, I could argue it
either way.

419
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,193
- Oh, come on!
- Crockett...

420
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:03,065
hospital politics
is a lot like the military.

421
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,067
You put in your time.
You do as your told.

422
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:08,201
And eventually you can rise up
to become a Dr. Blake, too.

423
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:15,208
â™ª

424
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:18,211
- Hey, buddy.
This is my friend, Dr. Charles.

425
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:19,734
- Hey, Alex.

426
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:21,214
- We just came to check in
on you before your surgery,

427
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,867
see if you had any questions.

428
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:25,870
- Is this gonna hurt?
- No, no.

429
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,046
They're gonna give you
some medicine.

430
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,090
It's gonna put you
right to sleep.

431
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:29,309
You won't feel a thing.

432
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:32,225
- Even when they open my head?

433
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,444
- Next thing you know,
you're just gonna

434
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,925
wake up in recovery.
We promise.

435
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:38,970
- Okay.

436
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,452
- Anything else on your mind?

437
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,889
- No.

438
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:53,159
It's just,
when they look inside my head,

439
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,248
will they see my secrets?

440
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:59,426
- Uh, I don't think so.

441
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:02,559
But if there is something
on your mind,

442
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:06,215
a lot of kids tell me that
it's just better to get it out.

443
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,132
- This wasn't Ryan's fault.

444
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,178
- Oh, don't worry about that.
Ryan's not in any trouble.

445
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:14,093
- No, I made him do it.

446
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,619
I made fun of him,
and I know if I did it enough,

447
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:21,230
then he'd get really mad
and hit me.

448
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,016
- Yeah?

449
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,453
Why would you want him
to hit you?

450
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,371
- Because...

451
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:32,589
- Because?

452
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:36,332
If you got hurt, maybe

453
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,291
Mom and Dad pay
a little more attention to you?

454
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,513
- It was stupid.
I shouldn't have done it.

455
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,515
- Hey, it's okay.

456
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:50,477
Let's get you taken care of.
All right?

457
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:55,046
- Alex, it's gonna be okay,
buddy.

458
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,353
You're gonna be fine.
We'll see you in a bit.

459
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:02,489
-  Man, listen,
I deal with a lot of sick kids,

460
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,186
but what do you do for this?

461
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,494
- So... kid with ADHD,
control issues, right?

462
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,931
Random outbursts.
- True.

463
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:13,978
- Yeah, but Alex knew he could
only get Ryan to lash out

464
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,198
if he backed him into a corner.
That's not random.

465
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,505
- So, what are we looking at
if this isn't ADHD?

466
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:20,898
- I think maybe
an anxiety disorder.

467
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,074
- Oh, another misdiagnosis.
Second in a week.

468
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,033
- And if I'm right,
that misdiagnosis

469
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:27,166
is causing this family
a lot of problems.

470
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,996
- You have to come quick.

471
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,085
Something's wrong with Ellie.

472
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:41,223
- Eleanor, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

473
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:44,357
- Okay.
- Squeeze my hand.

474
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,101
â™ª

475
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:52,278
- What's happening?
Why's she like this?

476
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,236
- She had a TIA,
a mini-stroke.

477
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,064
Start her on aspirin
and clopidogrel

478
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,326
and call for an MRI
of her head.

479
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,241
- A stroke?
What--what? Why?

480
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:01,243
- 'Cause she's forming thrombi.
They're blood clots

481
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,984
in her vessels, and one's
travelled to her brain.

482
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,333
- Oh, my God.

483
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:07,075
â™ª

484
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:09,251
- Get a suture kit.
We have to pull the Vas out.

485
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,253
- I'll call Dr. Hammer.
Excuse me, Mr. Halt.

486
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,559
She's up in radiology.
- No, no, no.

487
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:13,734
Every minute that passes

488
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:15,257
increases her risk
of a major stroke.

489
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,519
We have to pull it right now.

490
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:22,569
â™ª

491
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:30,316
.

492
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,753
- Hey, you okay?

493
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:37,323
- No.
I screwed everything up today.

494
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:42,458
- I saw Alex's notes.

495
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,678
Von Willebrand disease?
You couldn't have known.

496
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,767
- I could've ordered
those labs earlier.

497
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,985
- But it doesn't matter.

498
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,248
The outcome still
would've been the same.

499
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:52,599
Look, you're always gonna wish
that you could've done

500
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,296
something earlier.

501
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,689
It's part
of being a good doctor.

502
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:57,386
- Alex is in surgery, Maggie.

503
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,736
He's bleeding into his brain.

504
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,651
- Which isn't your fault.

505
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:12,662
â™ª

506
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:15,317
- You pulled
my patient's Vas-COM?

507
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:22,542
- She had a TIA.

508
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:23,804
The Vas-COM was
most likely the source.

509
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,762
- You don't know that.
Could've been lupus,

510
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:27,721
endocarditis, even leukemia.

511
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,679
And now we have no way
to monitor her.

512
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,420
- She could've had
another stroke at any minute.

513
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:32,421
What--what was
I supposed to do?

514
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,597
- She's my patient, Will.

515
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,077
You at least
should've asked me.

516
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,513
- By the time
you got down here--

517
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:38,949
I'm not taking that chance.
- No, you were afraid

518
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,560
that I would disagree
and that I'd stop you.

519
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:41,778
- No.

520
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:42,953
- It's the same old Will
from med school,

521
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:44,651
always thinking
that you know better.

522
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:47,306
- Stevie, that's not
what this was about.

523
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,046
- You tell yourself that.

524
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:55,575
â™ª

525
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:56,967
- Hi.

526
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,404
I don't know if you remember me
from this morning.

527
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:00,710
I'm the surgeon on your case,
Dr. Marcel.

528
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:01,929
How you feeling?

529
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:04,584
- Like I got hit by a car.

530
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:06,629
- Well, you did
just have major surgery,

531
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,109
but, uh, it went well,

532
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:11,591
and I imagine you will feel
a little better each day.

533
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,593
- Here you go.

534
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:16,335
Dr. Blake said to go slow.
- Thanks, Dina.

535
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:20,077
- Ice chips.
My mom is in love with them.

536
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,818
Frankly, I think they're
just as much

537
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,604
an aspiration risk as liquids.
- Aspiration risk?

538
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,562
What, are you
a--you a doctor, too?

539
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,869
- Made it halfway through
a third year of med school.

540
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,436
- Oh, okay.

541
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:33,134
- Realized I was doing it
for my mom, not for me.

542
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:34,396
- Oh.

543
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,355
- I'm assuming
you've met her by now?

544
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,967
- Made her acquaintance, yeah.

545
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,056
- She try to scrub in?

546
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,014
- How'd you guess?

547
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:45,451
I know my mom.

548
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,017
- She didn't talk to me
for six months

549
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:50,412
after I quit med school.
- Wow, that's rough.

550
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:51,761
- No.

551
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:54,416
The day I took control
of my life?

552
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,375
Best move I ever made.

553
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,554
- Anyway, I should
let you get some rest.

554
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:06,907
Um, enjoy your ice chips,
and I'll check back later.

555
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,476
So wait, what did you
end up doing after med school?

556
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,000
- A malpractice lawyer.
- Medical?

557
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,526
Your mom must be very proud.

558
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:23,532
- Mr. and Mrs. Miller,
I have an update for you.

559
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:27,536
- Be right back, buddy.

560
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,106
- So, look, they're--they're
just finishing up

561
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,586
in surgery now.

562
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,458
All indications are that
the procedure was a success.

563
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,068
And Alex is doing great.

564
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:41,202
- Oh, my God, really?
Thank you so much.

565
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:44,031
Listen, Dr. Scott and I
talked to Alex

566
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:45,685
before the procedure today.

567
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:49,471
And I understand that you have
a lot on your plate right now,

568
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:51,691
but I--I also think
it's important that I share

569
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,040
this conversation with you.

570
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,563
both: Okay.

571
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,870
- So--so what
he told us is that

572
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:59,699
he provoked Ryan
into this outburst today.

573
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:00,961
He feels terrible.

574
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,963
I think he is looking
for some attention.

575
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:05,922
But where Ryan's concerned--
what this means to me

576
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:08,664
is that it wasn't
an impulsive outburst.

577
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,188
It wasn't--it wasn't random.

578
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:15,497
And that and a couple other
things I've observed today

579
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,717
are leading me to believe
it's very possible

580
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,676
that--that your son has
been misdiagnosed with ADHD

581
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,548
and that we were
probably looking

582
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,724
at some kind
of anxiety disorder instead.

583
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:25,899
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

584
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,596
Look at him.
He can't sit still.

585
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,251
- But Mr. Miller,
it's--it's the counting, right?

586
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:31,644
The tapping.

587
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,210
I think that
he's self-soothing

588
00:24:33,254 --> 00:24:35,735
to help him cope
with these feelings of anxiety.

589
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,084
And when that stops working,

590
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,173
I think he feels
backed into a corner,

591
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:41,915
and then you have
a fight-or-flight situation.

592
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,525
- Well, what
about the Adderall?

593
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,787
His doctor said
that would help.

594
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:48,617
- If he actually had ADHD,
it would be working.

595
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:51,751
But it's not, right?
I think that in Ryan's case,

596
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:53,274
it's actually working
against him

597
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:55,755
and serving to only intensify
these feelings of anxiety

598
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,278
to the point
where they're often,

599
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:58,801
frankly, unbearable.

600
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:00,760
- Dr. Charles,
man, look I--I--

601
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:02,544
we appreciate everything
you're doing.

602
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:04,938
Really, but please,
our son's in surgery.

603
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:07,941
- I am sorry.
This is just not an ideal time

604
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:10,030
to have this conversation.
But I just wouldn't

605
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,640
be doing my job
if I didn't tell you

606
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,947
how important I think
it would be to reassess Ryan

607
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,558
and make sure that you are
looking at the right diagnosis

608
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:19,126
for him, for his brother,
for all of you,

609
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,955
for your whole family.
- No, Dr. Charles, it's just--

610
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:24,566
it's just been a long day.

611
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,699
- Listen, I am going
to check back with you

612
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:27,874
when Alex wakes up, okay?

613
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:30,050
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

614
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:37,884
- I should've consulted you
before pulling the Vas-COM.

615
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,669
It wasn't my place.
I'm sorry.

616
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:42,149
And besides, you were right.

617
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:44,630
She's getting worse and
still having embolic events.

618
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:46,109
So it wasn't
the Vas-COM after all.

619
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:48,634
- Clearly,
but I've gone through

620
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:50,679
every clotting disorder,
and none of it fits.

621
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:53,203
- Is it possible
we're looking at this wrong?

622
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:55,597
That she doesn't even have
a clotting disorder?

623
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:59,906
- Of course.
It's just so little to go on.

624
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:02,648
I mean, history of asthma,
eosinophils,

625
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:03,997
and left-sided
lung infiltrates.

626
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,085
- Left?

627
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,652
I thought
they were on the right.

628
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:09,568
- Seriously, Will?
- No, no, wait.

629
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,744
The X-ray from this morning
had them on the left.

630
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,354
But look...

631
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:15,574
The one from this afternoon
shows they moved to the right.

632
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,665
- Migratory infiltrates.

633
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:25,061
Could this be vasculitis?
Churg-Strauss?

634
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:26,672
- I mean maybe.
She could've moved

635
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:29,065
from the asthmatic stage
into the vascular stage today.

636
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:32,155
- It's a long shot,
but it's possible.

637
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,201
- If we're right,
her organs could start

638
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,116
to shut down at any moment.

639
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,770
- I'll start her on prednisone
and azathioprine

640
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,685
and set her up
for a diagnostic lung biopsy.

641
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,774
- Dr. Hammer, Dr. Halstead,
you need to come.

642
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,036
Eleanor's getting worse.

643
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:49,782
.

644
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,219
- I don't like
these QRS complexes.

645
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,177
- Eleanor, do you feel any pain
in your chest or arm?

646
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:56,963
- It feels tight.
- Oh, God, Ellie.

647
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,007
- Why don't you come here?

648
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,228
- She's going into v-tach.
- I'll get the paddles.

649
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,578
- No, no, Ellie.
- Wait.

650
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,320
If this is Churg-Strauss,
this could be a tamponade.

651
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:07,930
We need to aspirate the fluid.

652
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:09,410
- I know, but if we're wrong,

653
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,412
we won't have time
to cardiovert.

654
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:13,893
- I think we're right
about this.

655
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:15,590
- I do, too.

656
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,854
18 gauge on a syringe.
- 18 gauge.

657
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:23,859
- Ron, there's fluid
around Eleanor's heart.

658
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:25,818
They need to drain it.

659
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,430
- Nothing.

660
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,830
Got it.

661
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,049
- Sinus rhythm.

662
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,922
- Eleanor, can you hear me?

663
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:44,967
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, thank God.

664
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,403
- Call IR.
Tell them we're coming up

665
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:49,276
for a drain and a lung biopsy.
- You got it.

666
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,887
- Good job.

667
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:00,330
- Hey. How you feeling?

668
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:04,291
- Okay.
- Good.

669
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,511
Surgery went well.

670
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:12,995
In fact, the neurosurgeon said

671
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,518
that you had
the best-looking brain

672
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,346
he's seen in quite a while.

673
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

674
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,527
Told your parents,
but they weren't surprised.

675
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:26,226
Said they always knew
you had a great brain.

676
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:29,185
- They said that?

677
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:34,887
- Yeah, they did.

678
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,154
You know, Alex,
kids with great brains--

679
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,982
they don't always get
the most attention,

680
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,419
but... people notice.

681
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:53,340
- What's going on?

682
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:56,517
- O2 sats are 91.
BP's down to 83/50.

683
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,519
- Drains are full.

684
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:00,956
- Belly's firm.

685
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,392
Okay, etomidate and sux,
then transduce

686
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:03,654
to a bladder pressure.
Let's go.

687
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:05,265
Hey, Avery, look at me.

688
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,006
You're re-bleeding
into your abdomen.

689
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,530
I need to intubate and take you
back to the OR, okay?

690
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:13,577
- What happened?

691
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:14,970
- Abdominal compartment
syndrome.

692
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:17,059
We're going back to the OR.
- No, no need.

693
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:19,279
You can use a cordis catheter
and decompress here.

694
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:21,020
- There's too much blood.
We don't have enough time.

695
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:22,543
I'm in. Bag her.

696
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,371
- And if you open her up,
there'll be too much swelling,

697
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:26,199
and you'll never
be able to close.

698
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:27,374
- Get the cordis.

699
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,552
- Dr. Marcel,
bladder pressure's 35.

700
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:35,556
- It's too high.

701
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,297
We need to open her up
to release the pressure.

702
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,385
Get me a 10 blade.

703
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,560
- Dr. Marcel,
I already told you--

704
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:42,215
- Back off, Dr. Blake.
Here we go. Ready?

705
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:52,138
â™ª

706
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:57,578
- Sats are up to 96
and BP's 112/83.

707
00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:59,580
She's stable.

708
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,669
- All right,
get her up to the OR.

709
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,236
â™ª

710
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,585
- Make sure
you get her swelling down.

711
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:06,108
â™ª

712
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:08,241
You're gonna need to close
her up as soon as possible.

713
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:15,291
â™ª

714
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:30,089
- How is Alex?

715
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:33,135
- Um, his surgery just ended.

716
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,571
He's doing really well.

717
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,747
- Alex probably hates me.

718
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,185
I want to tell him
I'm really, really sorry.

719
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:40,534
- You'll be able
to see him soon.

720
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:43,450
And then you can tell him.
- Can I see him now?

721
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,323
- I'm not supposed to let you
until he's in his room.

722
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,151
- Please?

723
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:54,113
- Okay, maybe we could
just take a quick peek.

724
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:56,071
If it's okay with your parents.

725
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:57,768
- Mom, can I go
with the doctor?

726
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,379
- Yeah, honey.

727
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:01,685
- Okey doke, let's go.

728
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,691
So he's still a little sleepy,

729
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:09,693
so we're just gonna give him
a quick wave hi, okay?

730
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:17,353
- That's not Alex.

731
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:18,615
- It's okay.

732
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,313
He's just
a little bandaged from surgery.

733
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:22,489
- I didn't do that.
- No, of course you didn't.

734
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:24,186
- I didn't mean to.
No, I'm sorry.

735
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,187
I'm sorry.
- Hey, hey, Ryan,

736
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,406
Ryan, Ryan, it's okay.

737
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:27,755
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Ryan, look,

738
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:29,017
you didn't do anything wrong.
- Stop it.

739
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:30,149
- Ryan!

740
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,196
Ryan! Ryan!

741
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:41,247
â™ª

742
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:52,475
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

743
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,650
- The security camera
picked him up.

744
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:54,869
We're okay.

745
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,176
- Still, I just
can't apologize enough.

746
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:58,873
Maybe I should talk
to his parents or--

747
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,266
- You know what?

748
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:01,615
I think it's probably better
if I handle this.

749
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:03,530
Listen, Vanessa,
not your fault.

750
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:04,748
Okay?

751
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,533
You were trying to help.

752
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:09,449
â™ª

753
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:11,190
- Ryan, your brother
just had surgery.

754
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:14,889
That's why he looks like that.
He's gonna be fine, buddy.

755
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,065
Now, can you please come out?

756
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:19,850
- Please, Ryan?

757
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:25,117
â™ª

758
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,423
- Mind if I give it a try?
- Yes.

759
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,600
- Hey, Ryan.

760
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:35,431
You know what?

761
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:39,609
I don't think that you wanted
to hurt your brother today.

762
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,179
I think the only reason
you threw that toy today

763
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:47,226
was because you didn't know
what else to do.

764
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,272
- I got so mad.

765
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:54,798
- 'Cause those feelings,
they just...

766
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:57,801
They just keep building
and building.

767
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:01,501
- Uh-huh.
I can't stop them.

768
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,546
And I'm always
getting in trouble.

769
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,552
- What if I told you
that I didn't think that

770
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:13,252
that was your fault?
- That's not what people say.

771
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:15,254
They're always telling me
to reset.

772
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,473
- Well, you know what?
I don't think it's your fault.

773
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:22,783
Not only that, you know
those--those feeling you get?

774
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:25,960
I get them, too.

775
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,744
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

776
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:30,269
Everybody does.

777
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:35,448
And one of the things that
really helps me when I get them

778
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,493
is, actually,
to talk about them.

779
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:41,628
You know, there's
this weird magic when you--

780
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:43,630
when you get them out.

781
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:47,634
They just--they just don't
seem to bother you as much.

782
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:50,289
- Really?
- Yeah.

783
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:55,729
And I guarantee you,
whatever feeling you're having

784
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:58,210
there are people in your life--

785
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:01,778
they want to hear about it.
I mean, your mom and dad...

786
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:04,868
They would really want
to hear about them.

787
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:07,784
- They would?
- Of course we would, honey.

788
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,267
- And you won't think
that I'm bad?

789
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,662
- Ryan,
we never think you're bad.

790
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:22,712
â™ª

791
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,332
- I got you.

792
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:40,382
â™ª

793
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:43,907
- You really don't think
this is ADHD?

794
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:45,822
- I don't think it is.

795
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:52,220
- So this Adderall
isn't helping?

796
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:54,483
- I think it's
actually making it worse.

797
00:34:54,527 --> 00:35:01,534
â™ª

798
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:10,108
.

799
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,110
- Hey, I just saw
Eleanor's biopsy results.

800
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:15,025
Churg-Strauss.

801
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:18,159
- Hey, maybe we work well
together after all.

802
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:20,727
- Maybe we do.

803
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,468
I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

804
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:25,732
Oh, I made a few calls.

805
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:30,302
It was definitely Mandelbrot.

806
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,869
Bye.

807
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:34,175
- Bye.

808
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:37,483
- Will, I just met Eleanor.

809
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:41,139
Churg-Strauss,
one in a million.

810
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:42,792
- Yeah.

811
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:44,272
- Though I did see you had
to pull her Vas-COM.

812
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:46,448
- Yeah, I hated to do it.

813
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,058
Uh, but she
was throwing emboli,

814
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:49,582
had some
cold fingers and toes--

815
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,105
- Hey, hey, Will, you
absolutely did the right thing.

816
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,628
The last thing we need
is for the Vas-COM

817
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:54,500
to be used inappropriately
and then it gets a bad rap.

818
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:56,806
- That--that's what I thought,
too.

819
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,200
- Now that she's stable,
however, it did seem

820
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,202
medically warranted to get
her on better monitoring again,

821
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,030
so I just put in
another Vas-COM.

822
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,249
â™ª

823
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,641
- Okay.

824
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:07,948
- Anyway, I'm glad you're
coming to the conference.

825
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:10,211
- Yeah, same here.

826
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:12,387
- Hey, maybe, um,
if you get there early.

827
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:13,388
we could have a drink?

828
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:16,174
- Sure.

829
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:23,181
â™ª

830
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,279
So what do you think?

831
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:37,934
- What do I think?

832
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:42,417
Um, I think that they have made
a crucial breakthrough.

833
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:44,071
And now they got
some work to do.

834
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:47,814
- Yeah, you know,
it's something--

835
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:50,251
how easy it is,
even in a loving family,

836
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,166
to feel so unseen.

837
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,298
- Huh?

838
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:58,999
- I guess I didn't always
appreciate how good I had it.

839
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:05,048
â™ª

840
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:15,320
- Your numbers look good.
And your drains are clear.

841
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:24,329
- So, if you get thirsty,

842
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:27,027
you can just ask the nurses
for some ice chips.

843
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,558
- Ice chips.

844
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:50,920
- Finally going to
get some sleep?

845
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:53,445
- Boards aren't going to study
for themselves.

846
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,012
- Believe me,
a nap wouldn't hurt.

847
00:37:58,363 --> 00:38:00,495
Anyway, I'm going to run
this boy's Adderall

848
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:03,890
over to the pharmacy,
then I'm out of here.

849
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:10,549
- All right, well, um,
see you tomorrow.

850
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:13,334
- Hey, Vanessa,

851
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,597
I know how tough
internship can be.

852
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:18,600
But everyone here already sees
what a good doctor you are.

853
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:22,430
- Thanks, Maggie.

854
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,086
- Yeah.

855
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,350
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Phil.

856

857
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:34,355
- Hey, Dad.

858
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,575
- Hey, Dylan,
what are you doing here?

859
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,969
- Oh, you know, stopping by.
- Okay.

860
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,144
- Italian beef?

861
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:45,323
- Is that Al's?
Oh, come on.

862
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,063
It's been a long time.
- I know.

863
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:48,195
Ever since you
used to bring them

864
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:49,370
to me every day
at medical school.

865
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:53,113
Really, that was just so
I could get one, too.

866
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:57,247
Here you go.
- Thank you.

867
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,423
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Yeah.

868
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:03,558
You know, um,

869
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:07,127
just wanted to say
thank you, Dad.

870
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,957
- For what?
Bringing you sandwiches?

871
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,438
- No, no.

872
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:16,528
For everything.

874
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,761
- Okay, you know what, boy?

875
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:34,241
How many times
I got to tell you

876
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:36,199
you got to ask for
extra giardiniera over there?

877
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:43,119

878
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,609
- Dr. Marcel, this is Enid,
from Dr. Blake's service.

879
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:56,524
Dr. Blake has
a kidney transplant

880
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,787
that she would
like you to scrub in on.

881
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:00,485
Uh, please be here
in half an hour.
