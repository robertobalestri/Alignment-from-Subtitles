1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:04,047
.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,310
- With the suggestion
from Dr. Cooper

3
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:08,312
I could've sabotaged
Archer's CVP monitor

4
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:10,401
so that the Vas-COM
could save the day.

5
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,099
And I came close to doing it.

6
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:14,231
- If this ever gets
to be too much for you,

7
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,190
I'll put a stop
to the whole thing.

8
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,105
- I'll take it from here.

9
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,628
- I assumed I'd perform
the surgery.

10
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:20,890
- You're free to watch.

11
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,633
- Best by the powers that be.
- I'm sorry.

12
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:26,809
I made a fool of myself
with Dr. Marcel.

13
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:29,159
I'm crushing on my advisor.

14
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:31,118
- How long
you been doing this?

15
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:33,076
- 35 years.
- How?

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,078
- You got to hang on
to those good days.

17
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:36,732
You got to hang on
to those wins.

18
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:45,480
- Really, Dad?
- What? It's fine.

19
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:48,091
- It's a red zone.
It's for emergencies only.

20
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:52,095
No--
- See?

21
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,444
Now, it's an emergency.

22
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,882
Oh, you know what?
I wanna check this out.

23
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:58,536
New PDT system.

24
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,322
I can check all
of my units in real time.

25
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,540
- But, look,
can I check it out later?

26
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,194
I really do have to go.
I'm late.

27
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:07,371
- Everything okay here?
- Oh, yeah, we all good.

28
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:08,807
Just a little ride-along.

29
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,201
Letting a civilian see
what a real job looks like.

30
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,725
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,901
Am I embarrassing you?

32
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,207
- I'll see you later.

33
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:22,212
Come on, Dad.

34
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,867
Okay, I'm gone.

35
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,570
- Hey, what's up?

36
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:33,963
- Do you remember
how when we were

37
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,618
in physical exam class,
when we did breast exams,

38
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,141
they would tell us
to make small talk

39
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,229
with the patient actors?

40
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,535
- Yeah, to help
put them at ease.

41
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,798
- Yeah and there was
that one guy, Mandelbrot.

42
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,756
Super awkward.
Caught hell for asking

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,584
one of them what
she was doing that weekend.

44
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,804
- Oh.
- He is a panelist

45
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:51,676
at the next summit
for female physicians.

46
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,159
- Wait, that wasn't Mandelbrot.

47
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,247
It was Richardson.

48
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,727
- No, pretty sure
it was Mandelbrot.

49
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,818
- No, it was Richardson.
- You haven't changed a bit.

50
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,560
Always got to one-up me.
- I'm not trying to one-up you.

51
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,779
- Two shots for Dr. Hammer.
Three for Dr. Halstead.

52
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:12,436
-  Thank you.

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,786
Have a good day.
- You too. Thanks, Carly.

54
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,181
- Morning.
- Good morning.

55
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:21,184
Dr. Halstead, how are things
with Dr. Cooper?

56
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:24,231
- Uh, pretty well, I think.
- Oh, yeah?

57
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,798
- I mean, he hasn't said
anything otherwise.

58
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,626
- Good morning,
Ms. Goodwin, Will.

59
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,411
- Matt.

60
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:31,586
- Just the man
I was looking for.

61
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:32,456
I want to tell you about
the conference

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,849
coming up in a few weeks.

63
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,546
- National Critical Care
Society annual meeting.

64
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,461
- It's here in Chicago.
You should go.

65
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,637
Vasik's gonna be
a platinum sponsor.

66
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,639
They're gonna have
a corner booth.

67
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,250
It's gonna be
the perfect chance

68
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:44,729
for you to meet
some of the upper-level execs.

69
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,821
Oh, do you think that you could
spare him for the day?

70
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,867
- It's always good
when our doctors

71
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,477
broaden their expertise.

72
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,479
- I'll be there.
- Okay, great.

73
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,613
I'll get you the details.
Um, Ms. Goodwin.

74
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,660
- This might be good.

75
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:06,447
And maybe I can get them to
offer me a deal like Cooper's.

76
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,453
- Geez, I got to get this, but,
uh, you're on the right track.

77
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,023
- Thank you, La'Shawn.
Morning, Alim.

78
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,242
Hey.
- Hey.

79
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,417
- What time did you get in?

80
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:22,680
- Uh, I don't know.
Like, around four.

81
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,421
- Why so early?

82
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,857
- Always try to get
a leg up on the day.

83
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:28,991
- Two hours before your shift?

84
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,949
- Well, if I'm meeting
with my patients earlier,

85
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,473
then I can read up
on their conditions.

86
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,257
That way, I'm running rounds,
I'll have all the answers.

87
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,345
Plus, if I'm here
a little early,

88
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,781
I can study for my boards.

89
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:39,262
- Sleep ever a factor
in this equation?

90
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,438
- Life of an intern.
What can I tell ya?

91
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:42,700
- Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah.

92
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:45,529
- Treatment three incoming.

93
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:46,617
- What do we got?

94
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,358
- Avery Quinn,
28-year-old female.

95
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,405
Pedestrian versus auto.
BP 80/45.

96
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,537
Heart rate 114, satting at 88.

97
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,886
- Okay, Avery, I'm Dr. Marcel.

98
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,061
We're gonna take
good care of you, okay?

99
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,715
- It hurts so much.

100
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,587
- Trigger the MTP,
give her 50 of fentanyl.

101
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,460
Here we go, guys.
Transfer on my count.

102
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:06,550
One, two, three.

103
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:09,553
- There it is.
All right, let's roll her.

104
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:12,295
You're okay, we got you.
The board...

105
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:19,911
- All right, we're good.

106
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,392
Avery, can you put
your arms by your side for me?

107
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:23,785
You're gonna feel
a little bit of pressure, okay?

108
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,311
- O2 sats down to 82.

109
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:31,401
- Avery, Avery.
Avery...she's out.

110
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,751
We need to intubate.
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

111
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,537
Get a CBC, CMP,
type and cross four units.

112
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,756
Let's get a fastscan
and have them prep OR 12.

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,585
- No, she's going to OR seven.
- Excuse me?

114
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:42,934
- Yeah, I'll take it from here.

115
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,502
And let's add
a coag panel and LFTs.

116
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:46,982
- Dr. Blake,
I think you're mistaken.

117
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:49,071
This is a trauma,
not a transplant surgery.

118
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:51,029
- Yeah, I can see that.

119
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:53,510
She's got free fluid,
and she's in shock.

120
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,077
Her liver's ruptured
but repairable.

121
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,036
We got to get her up now.
- I'm in. Bag her.

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,779
All do respect, Dr. Blake,
you're a transplant surgeon.

123
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,781
I got this.
- Thank you, Dr. Marcel,

124
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,348
but I'll be
taking over the case now.

125
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,784
- I'm sorry,
I can't let you do that.

126
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,264
This is my patient.

127
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,310
- And I understand that,
but she's also my daughter.

128
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,008
Now, I'm gonna need you
to move.

129
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,749
Let's go.

130
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,758
- You got a transplant patient?

131
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,847
- No, I don't.

132
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,544
But we have a problem.

133
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:33,333
♪

134
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:42,777
.

135
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,866
- Hey, Alex, I'm Dr. Scott.

136
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,215
- I'm Susan.
This is Todd.

137
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:49,087
And this is Ry--Ryan, come on.

138
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:51,525
- Hey, Ryan, can I get
a couple of those?

139
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,225
- Ryan, enough with the gloves,
okay?

140
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,183
- Thanks.

141
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:01,796
Alex, says here that you

142
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,059
got hit in the head
with a Nerf gun.

143
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:07,062
- Yeah.
- Oof, I bet that hurt.

144
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:10,195
The thing is, you're supposed
to get hit with the foam dart,

145
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,545
not the actual gun.

146
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,285
- Stop it.

147
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,419
- It was an accident.
The boys were playing.

148
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,421
- Mom, it wasn't a Nerf gun.
- Okay.

149
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,075
I--I didn't even see it happen.
I--okay.

150
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,119
- Ryan.
- Mom---mom.

151
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,294
- Hey, just a minute.
- Mom--

152
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:23,470
- They were down in
the basement and--

153
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:24,906
- It wasn't a Nerf gun.
- Ryan, okay.

154
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,603
- Hey, hey, hey, Ryan.

155
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,257
What's up, buddy?
Talk to me.

156
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,955
- It was an Ultra Blaster.
- Oh, yeah?

157
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,001
Triple action
with the slam-fire?

158
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:36,134
- Uh-huh.
- Sweet. Yeah.

159
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,310
- "I'm sorry, Doctor"?

160
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,616
Todd, you want to take him
for a walk to the truck?

161
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,140
Give him his meds.
Okay, go with Dad. Go.

162
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:49,409
- Oh, man.
Tough day, huh, bro?

163
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,149
- He has ADHD.

164
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,934
- Yeah, we have him
on Adderall,

165
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,979
but we keep upping the dose,

166
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,459
and some days
are just a little tough.

167
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:59,506
-  I know.
It's okay.

168
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:02,030
What about you?
How you doing?

169
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,293
-  I'm fine.

170
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,121
- You sure?

171
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,211

It's a tricky family dynamic.

His brother has ADHD.

183

Seems like
it's pretty tough on them.

184
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,638
- Yeah.

185
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,030
- Takes up a lot
of the family's energy.

186

Alex is stable right now,

356

he is bleeding into his brain.

357
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,924
And the intracranial pressure
is great enough

358

immediate surgical evacuation.

Von Willebrand disease.

00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:32,421
What--what was
I supposed to do?

514
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,597
- She's my patient, Will.

515
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,077
You at least
should've asked me.

516
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,513
- By the time
you got down here--

517
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:38,949
I'm not taking that chance.
- No, you were afraid

518
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,560
that I would disagree
and that I'd stop you.

519
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:41,778
- No.

520
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:42,953
- It's the same old Will
from med school,

521
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:44,651
always thinking
that you know better.

522
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:47,306
- Stevie, that's not
what this was about.

523
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,046
- You tell yourself that.

524
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:55,575
♪

525
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:56,967
- Hi.

526
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,404
I don't know if you remember me
from this morning.

527
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:00,710
I'm the surgeon on your case,
Dr. Marcel.

528
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:01,929
How you feeling?

529
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:04,584
- Like I got hit by a car.

530
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:06,629
- Well, you did
just have major surgery,

531
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,109
but, uh, it went well,

532
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:11,591
and I imagine you will feel
a little better each day.

533
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,593
- Here you go.

534
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:16,335
Dr. Blake said to go slow.
- Thanks, Dina.

535
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:20,077
- Ice chips.
My mom is in love with them.

536
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,818
Frankly, I think they're
just as much

537
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,604
an aspiration risk as liquids.
- Aspiration risk?

538
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,562
What, are you
a--you a doctor, too?

539
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,869
- Made it halfway through
a third year of med school.

540
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,436
- Oh, okay.

541
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:33,134
- Realized I was doing it
for my mom, not for me.

542
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:34,396
- Oh.

543
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,355
- I'm assuming
you've met her by now?

544
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,967
- Made her acquaintance, yeah.

545
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,056
- She try to scrub in?

546
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,014
- How'd you guess?

547
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:45,451
I know my mom.

548
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,017
- She didn't talk to me
for six months

549
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:50,412
after I quit med school.
- Wow, that's rough.

550
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:51,761
- No.

551
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:54,416
The day I took control
of my life?

552
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,375
Best move I ever made.

553
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,554
- Anyway, I should
let you get some rest.

554
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:06,907
Um, enjoy your ice chips,
and I'll check back later.

555
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,476
So wait, what did you
end up doing after med school?

556
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,000
- A malpractice lawyer.
- Medical?

557
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,526
Your mom must be very proud.

558
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:23,532
- Mr. and Mrs. Miller,
I have an update for you.

559
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:27,536
- Be right back, buddy.

560
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,106
- So, look, they're--they're
just finishing up

561
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,586
in surgery now.

562
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,458
All indications are that
the procedure was a success.

563
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,068
And Alex is doing great.

564
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:41,202
- Oh, my God, really?
Thank you so much.

565
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:44,031
Listen, Dr. Scott and I
talked to Alex

566
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:45,685
before the procedure today.

567
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:49,471
And I understand that you have
a lot on your plate right now,

568
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:51,691
but I--I also think
it's important that I share

569
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,040
this conversation with you.

570
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,563
both: Okay.

571
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,870
- So--so what
he told us is that

572
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:59,699
he provoked Ryan
into this outburst today.

573
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:00,961
He feels terrible.

574
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,963
I think he is looking
for some attention.

575
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:05,922
But where Ryan's concerned--
what this means to me

576
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:08,664
is that it wasn't
an impulsive outburst.

577
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,188
It wasn't--it wasn't random.

578
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:15,497
And that and a couple other
things I've observed today

579
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,717
are leading me to believe
it's very possible

580
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,676
that--that your son has
been misdiagnosed with ADHD

581
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,548
and that we were
probably looking

582
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,724
at some kind
of anxiety disorder instead.

583
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:25,899
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

584
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,596
Look at him.
He can't sit still.

585
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,251
- But Mr. Miller,
it's--it's the counting, right?

586
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:31,644
The tapping.

587
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,210
I think that
he's self-soothing

588
00:24:33,254 --> 00:24:35,735
to help him cope
with these feelings of anxiety.

589
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,084
And when that stops working,

590
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,173
I think he feels
backed into a corner,

591
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:41,915
and then you have
a fight-or-flight situation.

592
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,525
- Well, what
about the Adderall?

593
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,787
His doctor said
that would help.

594
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:48,617
- If he actually had ADHD,
it would be working.

595
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:51,751
But it's not, right?
I think that in Ryan's case,

596
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:53,274
it's actually working
against him

597
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:55,755
and serving to only intensify
these feelings of anxiety

598
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,278
to the point
where they're often,

599
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:58,801
frankly, unbearable.

600
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:00,760
- Dr. Charles,
man, look I--I--

601
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:02,544
we appreciate everything
you're doing.

602
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:04,938
Really, but please,
our son's in surgery.

603
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:07,941
- I am sorry.
This is just not an ideal time

604
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:10,030
to have this conversation.
But I just wouldn't

605
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,640
be doing my job
if I didn't tell you

606
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,947
how important I think
it would be to reassess Ryan

607
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,558
and make sure that you are
looking at the right diagnosis

608
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:19,126
for him, for his brother,
for all of you,

609
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,955
for your whole family.
- No, Dr. Charles, it's just--

610
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:24,566
it's just been a long day.

611
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,699
- Listen, I am going
to check back with you

612
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:27,874
when Alex wakes up, okay?

613
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:30,050
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

614
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:37,884
- I should've consulted you
before pulling the Vas-COM.

615
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,669
It wasn't my place.
I'm sorry.

616
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:42,149
And besides, you were right.

617
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:44,630
She's getting worse and
still having embolic events.

618
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:46,109
So it wasn't
the Vas-COM after all.

619
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:48,634
- Clearly,
but I've gone through

620
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:50,679
every clotting disorder,
and none of it fits.

621
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:53,203
- Is it possible
we're looking at this wrong?

622
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:55,597
That she doesn't even have
a clotting disorder?

623
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:59,906
- Of course.
It's just so little to go on.

624
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:02,648
I mean, history of asthma,
eosinophils,

625
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:03,997
and left-sided
lung infiltrates.

626
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,085
- Left?

627
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,652
I thought
they were on the right.

628
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:09,568
- Seriously, Will?
- No, no, wait.

629
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,744
The X-ray from this morning
had them on the left.

630
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,354
But look...

631
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:15,574
The one from this afternoon
shows they moved to the right.

632
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,665
- Migratory infiltrates.

633
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:25,061
Could this be vasculitis?
Churg-Strauss?

634
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:26,672
- I mean maybe.
She could've moved

635
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:29,065
from the asthmatic stage
into the vascular stage today.

636
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:32,155
- It's a long shot,
but it's possible.

637
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,201
- If we're right,
her organs could start

638
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,116
to shut down at any moment.

639
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,770
- I'll start her on prednisone
and azathioprine

640
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,685
and set her up
for a diagnostic lung biopsy.

641
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,774
- Dr. Hammer, Dr. Halstead,
you need to come.

642
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,036
Eleanor's getting worse.

643
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:49,782
.

644
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,219
- I don't like
these QRS complexes.

645
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,177
- Eleanor, do you feel any pain
in your chest or arm?

646
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:56,963
- It feels tight.
- Oh, God, Ellie.

647
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,007
- Why don't you come here?

648
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,228
- She's going into v-tach.
- I'll get the paddles.

649
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,578
- No, no, Ellie.
- Wait.

650
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,320
If this is Churg-Strauss,
this could be a tamponade.

651
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:07,930
We need to aspirate the fluid.

652
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:09,410
- I know, but if we're wrong,

653
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,412
we won't have time
to cardiovert.

654
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:13,893
- I think we're right
about this.

655
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:15,590
- I do, too.

656
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,854
18 gauge on a syringe.
- 18 gauge.

657
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:23,859
- Ron, there's fluid
around Eleanor's heart.

658
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:25,818
They need to drain it.

659
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,430
- Nothing.

660
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,830
Got it.

661
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,049
- Sinus rhythm.

662
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,922
- Eleanor, can you hear me?

663
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:44,967
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, thank God.

664
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,403
- Call IR.
Tell them we're coming up

665
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:49,276
for a drain and a lung biopsy.
- You got it.

666
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,887
- Good job.

667
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:00,330
- Hey. How you feeling?

668
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:04,291
- Okay.
- Good.

669
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,511
Surgery went well.

670
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:12,995
In fact, the neurosurgeon said

671
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,518
that you had
the best-looking brain

672
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,346
he's seen in quite a while.

673
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

674
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,527
Told your parents,
but they weren't surprised.

675
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:26,226
Said they always knew
you had a great brain.

676
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:29,185
- They said that?

677
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:34,887
- Yeah, they did.

678
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,154
You know, Alex,
kids with great brains--

679
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,982
they don't always get
the most attention,

680
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,419
but... people notice.

681
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:53,340
- What's going on?

682
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:56,517
- O2 sats are 91.
BP's down to 83/50.

683
