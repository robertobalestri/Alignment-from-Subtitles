received emails

178
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,921
Patients Pro, okay?

179
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,880
If it's not in your inbox,
check your spam.

182
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:33,496
You will be using this system
to log how much time you spend

183
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,020
with each patient from now on.

184
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:38,806
Special Forces has a slogan...

185
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:41,243
"Slow is smooth
and smooth is fast."

186
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:44,551
In other words, we need
to be deliberate and tactical

187
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,291
in our approach to medicine.

188
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:50,252
The more patients we're able
to see, the more lives we save.

Oh, and as an added bonus,
whoever ends the month

190

Not bad, huh?

194
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,486
All right, let's get going.
Thank you.

195
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,531
- Not a Blackhawks fan,
Dr. Charles?

196
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,228
- Oh, huge Hawks fan.

197
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:12,274
Not a big fan
of incentive-based medicine.

198
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,016
- I mean, fast is slow,

199
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:17,758
but smooth--sorry, I don't know
what that means.

200
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,673
- I don't.

201
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,109
- Hey, can I ask you something?

202
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,719
- Hey, Maggie?
- Yep.

203
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:25,548
- Can I tempt you away
from your brick?

204
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,767
- Yeah.
- Ah, Dr. Hammer,

205
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,335
you too, as well.

206
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,469
Listen, Elaine Foster
is on her way here.

207
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,385
She suffered a minor fall
at her home.

208
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,561
And her husband, Jim,
is driving her here.

209
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:41,172
- Elaine and Jim Foster--
big-time moneybags.

210
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:44,567
- No, no, they are two
of our most generous funders.

211
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:47,048
I've mingled over the years
with the Fosters

212
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,616
at donor events.
They're really good people.

213
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,139
Very down-to-earth.

214
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:53,707
Anyway, I'd like the two of you
to look out for them

215
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,317
while they're in the ED.

216
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,713
And I'll stop in to see Elaine
once she's settled in.

217
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:03,281
Thank you.

218
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,414
- VIPs aren't your cup of tea,
I take it?

219
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:08,809
- I like them--
just from a distance.

220
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:11,246
- Didn't you rub elbows all the
time with the rich and fabulous

221
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,248
over in Grosse Pointe?
- Yeah, hence my reluctance.

222
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,467
- Well, heads-up,

223
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,339
'cause here they are.

224
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,994
Mr. and Mrs. Foster,
we're going to treatment six.

225
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:23,040
- All right.

226
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,827
- How did the fall happen,
Mrs. Foster?

227
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,351
- Oh, Elaine, please.

228
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:32,615
I got home and smelled
something burning--ow!

229
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:33,834
- Sorry.

230
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:36,140
- Uh-oh.
- It's okay.

231
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:39,361
I'm just being a big baby.

232
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:42,233
Anyway, I hightailed it
to the kitchen.

233
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,932
And tripped over
my own two feet.

237
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,680

that the house was about

of the long-term side effects?

- Best friend.

347
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,530
I left Chicago at the height
of the pandemic

348
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,532
and just got back last week.

349
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:42,925

what was going on...

350
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,231

351
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:45,797

352
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,234
You have to show them.

353
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,501
- Well, listen, Gina,
if it's any comfort,

354
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:56,852
we've seen every wart, boil,
cyst known to man.

355
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,681
So you've got nothing to be
embarrassed about here.

356
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:06,644
♪

357
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:13,434
Uh-huh.

358
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:16,785
.

359
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,396
- Remember when I said Cooper
was getting consulting fees

360
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,138
from Vasik and various
other companies?

361
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:25,663
Well, I started looking
at those other companies.

362
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:29,885
And I found some peculiar
things like stock photos

363
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,410
on their websites, contact
numbers that are connected

364
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,630
to overseas call centers.

365
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:37,893
So I got in touch
with one of my friends

366
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,375
who's a wealth manager.
Asked him to do some digging.

367
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:44,291
And it turns out
they're shell companies.

368
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,989
- So Vasik set them up
as a cover.

369
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,992
- Anyway, how'd it go
this morning?

370

sure Cooper took the bait.

Ms. Goodwin.

00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:57,826

- Oh, I'm sorry.

373
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:59,523
I didn't mean to interrupt.
- I gotta get back

374
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:00,872

- All right.

375
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,874
Thank you for stopping by,
Dr. Halstead.

376
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,833

377
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,313
- So where are you guys
at with this thing?

378
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,532
You got enough evidence yet
to go to the authorities?

379
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,012
- Unfortunately, no.

380
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,319
What I told you about
the shell companies--

381
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:16,714
well, there's no way to prove
that Vasik was behind them

382
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:19,761

at their books.

383
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:22,633

how important this is to you.

384

But much more importantly,

I'm worried about
your stress levels.

386
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,334

What's your latest A1C?

391
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:38,040
- Daniel, I'm fine.
Look, I even got myself one

You wouldn't know it

00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,142
- We have to get them back here
right now, please.

691
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:14,535
- Okay.

692
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:18,191

693
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,759
- Hey, Michael.
- I remember you.

694
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,500
- Mm-hmm.
- Surgery went very well.

695
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:26,503
- Hey, Michael, we're gonna
move you over to the PICU.

696
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:28,114
Your mom and dad are
waiting to see you.

697
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,246
- Am I in trouble?

698
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,423
- I think they're just happy
that you're okay.

699
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:36,992
- But, hey, maybe you learned
something about guns today?

700
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:38,646
- Not toys.
- Right.

701
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:42,389
I mean, besides, what superhero
do you know that has a gun?

702
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:45,827
We don't need 'em.

703
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:56,142

704
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,970
kid would have bled out,
no question.

You saved his life, Dr. Scott.

- Back shortly, okay?

707
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,852
- She still wants to wait
on the surgery.

708
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:13,289
- If nearly drowning in her own
blood didn't convince her...

709
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,683
- How does someone let it get
to this point?

710
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:16,902
- You know, the mind can have

711
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:19,382
this mysterious
and profound ability

712
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,297
to convince us
to put off almost anything.

713
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:22,864
- Yeah.

714
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:24,735
- Why is that?

715
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:28,348
- One line of thinking is that
we have this bizarre tendency

716
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:31,568
to disassociate
from our future selves.

717
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:33,919
There's this really interesting
experiment at Princeton

718
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:36,182
where two groups of students

719
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:38,140
were recruited to drink what
was described to them as

720
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:41,013
this disgusting,
foul-smelling liquid.

721
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,492
Now they were given a choice

722
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:44,451
about how much
they could drink.

723
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:47,236
And the group that was told
they had to drink it that day

724
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,672
agreed to drink very little.

725
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,413
But the group that was told
to come back

726
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:51,850
in a couple of months
and drink it

727
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,373
agreed to drink much more.
- Right.

728
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:54,896
So they can kick the can down
the road.

729
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,289
- Right.
- Right.

730
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:58,247
Okay, so how do we
solve the disconnect?

731
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:01,555
- You gotta find a way to make
her future self feel...

732
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:02,948
more tangible to her.

733
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,124

734
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,170

- Hmm.

736
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,611
I had a patient early on
in my nursing days
