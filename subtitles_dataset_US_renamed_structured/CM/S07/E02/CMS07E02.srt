1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,380
.

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,464
- Your shoe laces.
Those are gang colors.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,425
- What are you, a cop?

4
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,719
- I used to be.
But now I'm a doc.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,178
- Doctor Hammer.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,346
- What brought you back
to Chicago?

7
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,431
- Home, sweet home.

8
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,474
- What made you stay?
- Same.

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,059
- And what's up
with you and her?

10
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,855
- Let's go.
- All right, let's get her CT.

11
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,064
- Dr. Cooper?

12
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,315
What happened
with your patient?

13
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,193
Is this due to
the cardiac output monitor?

14
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,653
- I want to come back to Med.

15
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,656
- Dr. Cooper is our biggest
booster of the Vas-COM,

16
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,243
and I suspect it's because
he's getting kickbacks.

17
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,870
- You're saying you want me
to be your spy?

18
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,705
- Are you in...

19
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,081
or out?

20
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,587
- Dr. Halstead.
Thank you.

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,714
Glad to catch you
on your way in.

22
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,800
I did some digging
on the Open Payments website.

23
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:55,430
Turns out, Dr. Cooper
has gotten some very fat perks

24
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,266
since he started boosting
the Vas-COM.

25
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,061
He has also received
more than a few

26
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,855
"consulting fees"
from Vasik Labs

27
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,398
and other companies.

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,317
- And you think
they're hidden bribes

29
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,069
for promoting the device.

30
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,779
- Yeah, illegal kickbacks.

31
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,074
We have to establish
that they are bribes

32
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,867
tied to the sale of the device.

33
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,330
Look, I can't report
Dr. Cooper, ruin his career,

34
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,249
unless I know for sure.

35
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,126
- I could stop
by the ICU today,

36
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,420
see what the Critical Care docs
are saying about the Vas-COM

37
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,256
and why they're using it
so frequently.

38
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:34,052
- See if it's Cooper's doing.
I like that.

39
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,473
Uh, Dr. Halstead.
Be careful.

40
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,982
- Maggie!

41
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,568
- Morning, Dr. Taylor.

42
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,903
- I, um--

43
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,197
I found this in my locker.
Was it you?

44
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,159
- Yeah, I didn't mean to--
- No...thank you.

45
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,330
- Happy birthday.
And don't worry.

46
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,623
No one else knows.

47
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,583
- Good, 'cause I don't like
to make a fuss.

48
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,043
- And of all the days
to come in early.

49
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,420
What are you doing here,
anyway?

50
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,547
You shift doesn't start
for another two hours!

51
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,215
- Decided to start
rounding early.

52
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,884
I want to stay two steps
ahead of my competition.

53
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,469
No, actually,
I want to crush them...

54
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,679
- And win some brownie points

55
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,973
with Dr. Archer.
- Atta girl.

56
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,393
Oh, and I know that you
probably have other plans,

57
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,396
but if you don't,
can I take you out for a drink?

58
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,107
- Okay, I might be down
for a drink.

59
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,525
I'll let you know.

60
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,527
- Okay.

61
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,321
- And that's when I realized
that standing out

62
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,365
was way better
than trying to fit in.

63
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,242
So next time
them little girls

64
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,952
start runnin'
their little mouths

65
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,454
making fun of your height,

66
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,080
you don't throw hands.

67
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,291
You just look at them
and say...

68
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,043
- Don't hate me
'cause you ain't me.

69
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,669
- That's right!

70
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,796
- Thank you, Dr. Scott, really.
- Hey, it's my pleasure.

71
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,673
- Okay, just try to calm down,
please.

72
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,301
- Y'all take care.
- Please, I'm scared. Please.

73
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,678
Oh, my God, are you a doctor?
Please help me, please help me.

74
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,013
I don't want to die, please.
- It's okay, it's all right.

75
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,598
What happened?
- Said she took some pills.

76
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,351
Sleeping pills, I think.
Her name is Krista Valdez.

77
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,935
- Hey, Treatment 4.
- All right, calm down.

78
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,354
- Sorry, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

79
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,271
Just slow your breathing.
- Okay.

80
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,564
- Okay?

81
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,899
So you say you took
some sleeping pills.

82
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,525
You gotta tell me how many
and how long ago.

83
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,277
- Uh, I don't know.
12, maybe 14,

84
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,528
about ten minutes ago.

85
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,613
- Grab the activated charcoal.
- Got it.

86
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,906
And I'll grab an NG setup.

87
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:29,376
.

88
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,460
- Oh, God.
- You got that charcoal ready?

89
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,088
- Right here.
- All right. Okay, Krista,

90
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,298
I need you to drink that down
slow and steady, all right?

91
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,008
It'll help absorb the drugs.

92
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,471
There you go.
Uh-huh.

93
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,722
- Oh, God, I can't.

94
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,432
- All right, come on.
Give it one more try.

95
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,601
You got it.
There you go.

96
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,062
Yup. See?

97
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,107
- NG tube.

98
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,900
- I'm sorry, I can't do it.
- It's all right.

99
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,276
It's all right.
Listen, I'm gonna

100
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,362
take this tube, I'm gonna stick
it down your nose,

101
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,239
and into your stomach,
give you the charcoal that way.

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,990
- No, just wait--
Am I gonna die?

103
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,159
Because this was a mistake.
Okay? I swear.

104
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,245
- Listen, you did
the right thing by coming in.

105
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,248
We got you.
Now, hang tight.

106
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,499
You're gonna feel this,
but it won't last a second.

107
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,501
- Okay.
- Page Dr. Charles.

108
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,962
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,093
- Hey, Trish.
Orders for L3.

110
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,469
I was wondering,
is it me,

111
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,555
or does it seem like we've
been seeing the Vas-COM

112
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,432
used a lot more frequently
as of late?

113
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,558
- Oh, yeah.

114
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,976
Dr. Cooper can't stop
talking about it.

115
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,353
- Really?
What's he, uh, saying?

116
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,438
- Heard my name.

117
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,231
You looking for me?
- Matt, hey.

118
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,318
Yeah, actually.
Was, uh,

119
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,863
curious to learn more
of the benefits

120
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,114
with the Vas-COM device.

121
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,657
- It's a pretty remarkable
product, really.

122
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,534
In fact, since we've
started using it,

123
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,120
we've seen an 8% reduction
in mortality.

124
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,663
- Phew.
8%?

125
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,250
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's impressive.

126
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,419
But, uh, how exactly
do you draw

127
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,212
a correlation to the device?

128
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,630
- Oh, it's pretty simple math,
really.

129
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,632
So when you're monitoring flow,
your patient is,

130
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,593
more often than not,
in the correct fluid balance,

131
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,720
and so that alone
has dramatically reduced

132
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,638
ICU acute kidney injury rates,

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,725
which we know is directly
correlated to prognosis.

134
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,352
It's not a perfect science.

135
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,228
But the Vas-COM's the
only new variable

136
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,772
we've introduced, so...

137
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,316
- Pretty straight line.
- Yeah, yeah.

138
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,151
And the other devices
on the market

139
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,779
can't even hold a candle.

140
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,280
Vas-COM is a bit more pricey.

141
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,573
- Oh, yeah?
- Sure, of course.

142
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,493
But, I mean, cost/benefit,
am I right?

143
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,661
Oh, listen.
Sorry, I gotta run.

144
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,580
I can send you more info
if you're interested.

145
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,623
- Yeah, please do!

146
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,294
- Hey, Nancy,
have you seen Dr. Halstead?

147
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,755
- Uh, not for a while, no.
- Okay.

148
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,173
Oh! Dr. Marcel.

149
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,675
- Hey, morning, Ms. Goodwin.

150
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,551
- I've been meaning
to touch base with you

151
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,054
about a new program
the hospital is setting up.

152
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,390
- Uh-huh.
- Totally voluntary,

153
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,685
but attendings can sign up
as advisors to residents.

154
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,103
- Advisors?

155
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,480
- You know, meet regularly,
offer counsel

156
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,357
if they have any questions
or concerns.

157
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,527
Just, you know, see them
through their residency.

158
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,071
- Oh, uh, well, listen.

159
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,115
That sounds like
a great program.

160
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,491
I just, uh--you know,

161
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,451
I wouldn't want to leave
anyone hanging, you know?

162
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,997
- Leave anyone hanging how?
You planning on leaving Med?

163
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,667
- No, no.
Nothing like that.

164
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,294
Just, uh, like to keep
my dance card open, is all.

165
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,839
- Mm.
- But, hey,

166
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,507
let me think about it.

167
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,509
- You know, you're the fifth

168
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,512
"Let me think about it"
this week.

169
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,972
Thank you.

170
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,099
- Hey! Hey, you okay?

171
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,227
- Um, uh, just
a little light-headed.

172
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,603
- Come on, let's sit down.

173
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,651
- You know, I've got this, uh,
this gadget, let's--

174
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,572
- Oh, blood sugar's a bit high.

175
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,699
- Yeah, it's been like that
all week.

176
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,327
Maybe I'll stop
by Endocrinology,

177
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,788
see if Dr. Yang
can squeeze me in.

178
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,665
- Okay, just as a precaution.
You know?

179
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,542
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, you gonna be okay?

180
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,294
- I'm gonna be fine, thank you.

181
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,507
Hey.
- I didn't get far.

182
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,469
Cooper caught me off-guard.
Gave me his hard sales pitch.

183
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,054
I gotta say, this guy's good.

184
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,805
- So if he's ever confronted,

185
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,684
he can defend everything
he's doing as legit.

186
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,145
Do you think
he suspected anything?

187
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,856
- No, but if he is
who you say he is,

188
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,566
confession's gonna be tough.

189
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,568
- Incoming!
Who's free?

190
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,112
- Oh, go, go.
And swing by later?

191
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,947
- Yeah.

192
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,825
I'm on it.
- I got this.

193
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,203
- More the merrier, I guess.
- After you.

194
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,621
- What do we got?

195
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,873
- 17 year-old male,
passed out at a skate park.

196
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,835
BP 100/20, heart rate 70.
Blood sugar was 200.

197
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,338
Gave a liter of normal saline
in the ambo.

198
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,298
- What's your name?
- Brandon.

199
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,133
- Brandon, I'm Dr. Hammer.

200
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,885
- I'm Dr. Halstead.

201
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,470
You got a history of diabetes?

202
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,222
- No, uh, no, I don't.

203
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,473
Did someone call my mom?

204
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,183
- Oh, cops called her.
She's en route.

205
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,309
- Brandon, you feel
stable enough

206
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,686
to switch beds yourself?

207
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,229
- Uh yeah, yeah I'm fine.
- Brandon?

208
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,022
Oh, my God.
Are you okay, honey?

209
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,482
- I'm fine, Mom, really.

210
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,234
- What were you doing
at the skate park?

211
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,027
You were supposed
to be studying.

212
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,278
- I know.
- It is not good

213
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,407
to exert yourself like that.
The stress.

214
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,159
He has Addison's disease.
Was this another crisis?

215
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,494
- No, it's his blood sugar.

216
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,788
But is he on steroids
as a part of his regimen?

217
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,872
- Yes, Prednisone.

218
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,457
- Prednisone can cause
high blood sugar

219
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,750
if he's getting too much.
- He's not.

220
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,961
I manage
all of Brandon's medications.

221
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,587
I take care of everything.

222
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,590
What he eats, steps per day.
We're very careful.

223
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,134
Are you sure you're all right?

224
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,011
- Yes, Mom, I'm fine.

225
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,847
- Well, if we're sure
medication isn't the cause,

226
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,807
let's get an A1c test.

227
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,434
That'll give us an idea
of his blood sugar levels

228
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,352
over a period of time.
- It'll help us determine

229
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,479
whether his body's
making insulin.

230
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523
There's a chance that he
could have developed diabetes.

231
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,651
- Oh, God.
No.

232
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,779
Brandon's supposed to be part
of an Addison clinical trial

233
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,322
for a subcutaneous
medication device.

234
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,699
- Mom, please.

235
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,659
Diabetes is
an exclusionary factor.

236
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,246
- It's okay, Mom.
There's gonna be other trials.

237
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,706
- Let's not jump the gun
just yet.

238
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,875
There may be
another explanation.

239
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,127
- We'll circle back around
as soon as we have something.

240
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,670
We're gonna figure this out.

241
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,008
- So, Krista,
Dr. Scott's telling me

242
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,594
that this is the first time
that you find yourself

243
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,387
in a situation like this.
Is that right?

244
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,056
- Oh, my God.
Yes.

245
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,975
It was such a stupid mistake.

246
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,102
I had been drinking,
so I wasn't in my right mind,

247
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,563
and as soon as I took
the pills, I regretted it.

248
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,232
- When you say that you
weren't in your right mind,

249
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,360
what do you mean by that,
exactly?

250
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,403
- Um...

251
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,572
I got into an argument
with my mom,

252
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,576
and I just sort of... lost it.

253
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,869
I don't even know why I
called her in the first place.

254
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,579
We don't even have
a relationship, so...

255
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,998
- I'm sorry to hear that.

256
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,628
- Yeah, I totally overreacted.

257
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,630
So how much longer
do I need to be here?

258
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,340
I just--I have a work trip
next week.

259
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,591
I'm headed to the Congo,

260
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,510
and I just have so much
to take care of.

261
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,555
- The Congo, wow.
What kind of work do you do?

262
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,558
- I work for UNICEF.
I'm a human rights attorney.

263
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,978
I act as a negotiator,
helping to free child soldiers.

264
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,232
- Wow. That's impressive.

265
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,734
- You know what?
That is truly admirable.

266
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,819
Really.

267
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,946
I imagine, pretty stressful,
too.

268
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,365
- No, I have it--
I have it really easy.

269
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,369
These kids, the things
that they're forced to see,

270
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,079
forced to do--

271
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,164
Some of them are as young
as five years old.

272
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,582
Trust me, we all live

273
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,668
really charmed lives
in comparison.

274
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,297
Just--listen, I would
really like to be discharged

275
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,800
as soon as possible, so...

276
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,552
do you have any more tests
to run or--

277
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,803
how much longer do I
need to be here?

278
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,347
- I want to give you
another liter of fluid,

279
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,974
you know,
make sure you're hydrated.

280
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,434
We'll talk after that.

281
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:47,272
- You should rest a bit,
and uh, we'll be back.

282
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,565
Nice to meet you, Krista.

283
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,365
- Oof.
Child soldiers?

284
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,616
She's seen
some horrible things.

285
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,160
- Oh, yeah.
No doubt.

286
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,663
I mean, I think we're looking
at a mix of PTSD,

287
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,416
chronic depression,
just general burnout, you know?

288
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,169
- Yeah, she seems
genuinely regretful, though.

289
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,670
You think this is
the wakeup call she needed?

290
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,880
Ending up in the hospital
like this?

291
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,173
- I think she wants
to believe that.

292
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,507
I'm not remotely sold.

293
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,718
Without--without an outlet,

294
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,763
she's very likely
to self-harm again.

295
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,848
- We can't just let her
walk out of here then.

296
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,558
- You know, hopefully
Krista will admit herself

297
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,726
to in-patient psych,

298
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,853
but we gotta get her there.

299
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,022
- A bag of saline
will buy us an hour.

300
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,945
- Stevie.

301
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,781
- Brandon's A1c results?
- Yep.

302
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,116
Blood sugar's been normal.

303
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,327
- So no diabetes.

304
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,746
I guess he could be
hyperthyroid?

305
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,997
- Yeah, I thought about that,

306
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,540
but all of his thyroid labs
are normal.

307
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,002
- What about pancreatitis?
- He's got no pain.

308
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,879
His amylase and lipase
are normal too.

309
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,715
I think the obvious answer
is right in front of us.

310
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,342
- You mean his medicine.

311
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,094
- Yeah.

312
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,055
- You think this is
Munchausen's by proxy.

313
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,598
- Maybe she's giving him
a little extra

314
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,100
to keep him sick.

315
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,602
- I don't know.
Feels like a reach.

316
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,688
- Is it?
You said so yourself.

317
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,814
She's incredibly involved.

318
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,732
A bit too involved,
don't you think?

319
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,526
I mean, 17's a little old

320
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,778
for Mom to be doling out
your pills, no?

321
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,405
- Teens aren't exactly
the most reliable

322
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,531
when it comes
to taking their meds.

323
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,575
- Yeah, but Marie
does fit the profile.

324
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,202
Hovering, overly concerned--

325
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,579
- She cares about her kid!

326
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,790
- Look, if you have
another explanation...

327
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,876
We owe it to Brandon
to get to the bottom of this.

328
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,670
Without a competing theory,

329
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,630
we at least have to explore
the possibility.

330
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,346
- Dr. Archer, Dr. Marcel.

331
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,931
MVC with a motorcycle incoming.

332
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,434
- We're out of beds.
- Hybrid OR.

333
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,519
Taylor, with me.

334
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:50,645
- Second victim's
right behind us.

335
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,939
- I got this.

336
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,233
- Sean Ritner,
a 26 year-old male,

337
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,569
motorcycle creamed
by a car at the intersection.

338
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,029
Intubated in the field.

339
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,157
GCS 3T, BP 190/60,
heart rate 130.

340
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,451
Significant blood loss
in the field.

341
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,037
Placed a tourniquet and put him
in a cardboard splint,

342
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,788
but his limb's pretty mangled,
and he's shocky.

343
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,832
- Trigger MTP.
On my count.

344
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,500
- We're going to Hybrid OR.
What have we got?

345
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,044
- Oh, my God.
- 38 year-old female.

346
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,503
Unrestrained driver.
Struck a motorcycle

347
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,463
while crossing
the intersection.

348
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,964
Couple scrapes and bruises,

349
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,591
but no focal complaints other
than some minor back pain.

350
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,384
- I didn't see him!
I tried to swerve,

351
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,552
but he came out of nowhere.

352
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,636
- Okay, don't worry.

353
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,637
We're gonna take
good care of you.

354
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,057
John, let me get a bed
in here.

355
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,558
Nice and easy.

356
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,643
Here we go.
Line it up right here.

357
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:34,105
There it is.
All right, guys, on me.

358
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,357
One, two, three.

359
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,651
- I want you to breathe
for me now.

360
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,487
- Okay.
- Deep breaths.

361
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,072
There you go.

362
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,284
Okay, clear breath sounds
bilaterally.

363
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,828
- Is he gonna be all right?
He's not moving.

364
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,455
- Dr. Archer's gonna take
good care of him.

365
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,956
Let's just focus on you, okay?

366
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,751
- I suffer from anxiety.
I--I need my medication.

367
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,794
- Okay, we're gonna get you
a little something

368
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,003
to help you relax.

369
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,838
Half a milligram of Ativan,
please.

370
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,590
You feeling any pain
anywhere?

371
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,842
Okay.
Chest x-ray, stat.

372
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,010
Look at me.
Look at me.

373
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,387
Look at me.
What's your name?

374
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,013
- Mya.
- Mya, okay.

375
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,598
My name is Dr. Marcel.
I'm gonna take care of you,

376
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,058
okay?
- Okay.

377
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:25,990
.

378
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:26,825
- All right, pelvis looks good.

379
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,993
I gotta check his arm.

380
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:35,500
No active bleeding,
and I don't feel a pulse.

381
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,627
I'll need a CT angiogram
to confirm,

382
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,963
but I'm guessing he needs
a completion amputation.

383
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,549
- Amputation?

384
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,717
- Yeah, that's what I said.

385
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,052
Unless you have
a better idea.

386
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,555
- If the brachial artery
is out, which I suspect it is,

387
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,765
can't we try
to revascularize the arm

388
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,517
with a reverse
saphenous vein graft?

389
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,311
- All right, we do that
and the repair goes down,

390
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,604
then what happens?

391
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,314
The arm dies,
now he's septic,

392
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,649
now he might die.

393
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,109
- Right. Forget it.
Dumb idea.

394
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,445
- No, not a dumb idea.

395
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,030
Good decisions come
from experience,

396
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,574
and experience comes
from bad decisions.

397
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,661
Actually, you might want
to scrub in for this,

398
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,954
if you've got
the stomach for it.

399
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,749
- That'd be incredible.
Thank you, Dr. Archer.

400
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,500
- All right.
I'll come grab you

401
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,710
once the patient's prepped.

402
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,178
- Thank God.
So it isn't diabetes.

403
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,347
Then he can do the trial!

404
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,682
But then...
what's going on?

405
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,684
- Well, we haven't quite
figured that out yet.

406
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,562
But the most obvious answer
is usually the right one,

407
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,023
which brings us back
to Brandon's medication.

408
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,983
- I already told you, though,
I manage his medication,

409
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,860
so I know he's getting
the right dosage.

410
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,612
- Are you giving him
any other supplements?

411
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,615
- No, nothing.
Just his prescriptions.

412
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,450
- All right, well,
we're gonna send over

413
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,410
a social worker
to speak with you.

414
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,620
- A social worker?
Why?

415
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,457
Wait, what's going on?

416
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,085
- We'd like to get a better
picture of Brandon's regimen.

417
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,295
- Do you not believe me?
- No, it's not that.

418
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,172
- It's just that we've ruled
out any other causes.

419
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,133
- I cannot believe this!
You think I'm lying,

420
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,552
that I'm one of those people

421
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,055
that would deliberately
make their kid sick?

422
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:16,142
I would never hurt my son!
- Mom?

423
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,019
What's going on?

424
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,897
They think I'm messing
with your medication,

425
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,442
giving you too much.
- What? Okay, no.

426
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,735
She's not.

427
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,028
She would never do
something like that.

428
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,031
- Look, we're sorry
that we upset you.

429
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,574
We should go.

430
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,451
- We're only trying to help,
Brandon.

431
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,536
Figure out what
caused the episode.

432
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,621
- But you can't, can you?

433
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,956
That's why you're blaming me,

434
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,874
because of your own ineptitude.
- Mom, please--

435
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,460
- No, that is it.
I have had it.

436
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,712
I want to speak
to your supervisor.

437
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:44,921
I'm gonna report you both.

438
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,464
- Mom, stop!
It was me, okay?

439
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,716
I did it.

440
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,721
- What?

441
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:57,017
- It was--it was me.

442
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,107
I've been giving myself
the extra drugs.

443
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,202
- Hey, looks like
this thing's about done.

444
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,663
So do I need to sign
paperwork, or--

445
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,291
- We'll let the nurses know
about that in just a sec.

446
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,792
- Uh, Krista.

447
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,420
What you told us earlier
about your work--

448
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,922
it really spoke to me.

449
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,591
Before I became a doctor,
I was actually a cop

450
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,551
for, like, ten years.

451
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,178
- Really?
- Yeah.

452
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,558
Saw a lot of awful things.

453
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,603
- I bet.

454
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,980
- I had a run at one point,
where, like,

455
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,567
I was racking up
loss after loss,

456
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,693
started to feel like
what I was doing

457
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,320
wasn't even making
a difference.

458
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,573
- One of my superiors--
he encouraged me

459
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:54,824
to talk to somebody.

460
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,994
I didn't want to do it
at first, but...

461
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,164
once I finally decided
to sit in that seat

462
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,834
and started just letting
it all come out,

463
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,836
it was like a weight
came off my shoulders.

464
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,011
- As gratifying as a career
helping other people is,

465
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,722
there can be
a real emotional cost there.

466
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,015
You know, me?

467
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,851
I see a psychiatrist regularly.

468
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:22,811
You know?
And those sessions

469
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,187
are a lifeline for me.

470
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,482
I can't imagine doing this work
without them.

471
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,401
- Okay, look.

472
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:33,405
I do not have time
to indulge in therapy, okay?

473
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,532
These kids--they need someone
to fight for them.

474
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,158
I--no, I don't have time
to sit around

475
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,243
and to lick my wounds.

476
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,036
- You know, you characterize
self-care

477
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,580
as some kind of selfish act.
Right?

478
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,542
But truthfully, Krista, if
you don't address this stuff,

479
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,210
next time you hit a low,

480
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,879
it might not turn out
the way it did today.

481
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:53,341
- And all those kids that
you've dedicated your life to--

482
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,552
they won't have you around
to fight for them.

483
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,221
- No, but I cannot
let them down!

484
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,431
And it gets really hard.

485
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,350
It's really, really hard
to just keep going.

486
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,151
Look, this wasn't
the first time, okay?

487
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,819
It's not the first time.

488
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,616
- I thought that that
might be the case,

489
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,994
which is why what
I would really like to do

490
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,705
is get you checked into
our in-patient psych clinic,

491
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,623
just for a few days.

492
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,791
Help you get your bearings,

493
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,753
start to talk
about some strategies

494
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,672
to help you out
with this stuff going forward.

495
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,132
What do you say?
Just a few days.

496
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,845
We all need a break sometimes.

497
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,680
You know?
You just--

498
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,807
you can't give
what you don't have.

499
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,730
- Okay.

500
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,815
- So you took the pills
to hike your blood sugar

501
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,069
because you knew diabetes
was an exclusionary factor.

502
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,820
- You don't want
to join the trial.

503
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,614
- Brandon, what were
you thinking?

504
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,782
You could have
seriously hurt yourself.

505
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,368
- I'm sorry, Mom.
It's just that...

506
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,786
I knew you weren't
going to budge on this.

507
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,581
I've spent my whole life

508
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,876
being careful, being monitored.

509
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,962
I have missed out on so much.

510
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,964
And if I start another trial,

511
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,550
I'm not gonna be able
to go to college in London.

512
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,552
- Brandon, I think that
your mom is just concerned

513
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,097
that you'll have
another crisis.

514
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,723
- I--I get that.

515
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:27,352
But I know my body
better than anybody,

516
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,187
and I know I can handle it
on my own.

517
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:34,734
- I know you may not
understand this now,

518
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,488
but I am only doing
what is best for you.

519
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,865
I'm sorry, honey.

520
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,868
London's gonna have to wait.
You are doing the trial.

521
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,331
- We'll go get your
discharge paperwork ready.

522
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,457
- Thank you.

523
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,717
- I feel for that kid.

524
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,011
This really should be
his decision.

525
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,595
- Pulling a stunt like that
doesn't instill

526
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,432
a ton of confidence in his
ability to look after himself.

527
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,933
- It's a separate issue.
You heard him.

528
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,351
He felt desperate.

529
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,311
- But this
clinical trial device

530
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,397
could be life-changing
for Brandon.

531
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,565
It'll administer his doses

532
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,067
so that he doesn't
have to monitor himself.

533
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,111
Marie's giving him
more freedom in the long run.

534
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,697
- I think she's trying
to keep him at home.

535
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,866
- Yeah, well,
agree or disagree,

536
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,075
it's not our call, is it?

537
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,056
- Your mom's just signing
your discharge paperwork.

538
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,935
How you doing?

539
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,564
- This is crazy.
I'm gonna be 18

540
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,274
in less than six months.

541
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,402
My mom is--

542
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,113
She just doesn't get it.

543
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,326
- I hear you.

544
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,454
- What can I do?
What can I do?

545
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,419
- There is one thing.

546
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,427
- Hey, Dr. Marcel.

547
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,970
- Hey, Dr. Taylor.
How's it going?

548
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,015
- Uh, it's going.
- Yeah?

549
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,475
Actually, no, it's not.

550
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,394
Listen, you overheard
my conversation with Dr. Archer

551
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:35,355
in regard to Sean
the motorcyclist's care?

552
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:39,025
- Ah, yeah.
I caught some stuff, I think.

553
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,694
- I just--I can't shake
this feeling

554
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,405
that we still might be able
to save Sean's arm.

555
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,448
- Huh.
- But Archer is probably right,

556
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,908
right?

557
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,119
- Well, there's an argument
for either side, honestly,

558
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,079
but for my money,
I would have gone

559
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,289
with what you suggested.

560
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,458
- You would have.
- Yeah.

561
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,961
There's nothing dumb
about your idea.

562
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,296
But I have a feeling
you already know that.

563
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,757
We have to go upstairs?
Great.

564
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,969
- I just--look, I didn't
want to ruffle any feathers.

565
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,262
Archer's the chief of E.D.

566
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,763
and I'm, like, barely a doctor.

567
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,099
- No, actually,
you are a doctor,

568
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,392
and a very sharp one at that.

569
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,354
Look, I understand work
politics and power hierarchies,

570
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,605
all of that,

571
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:18,898
but the next time
you're feeling passionately

572
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,484
about something,
don't be afraid to stand by it.

573
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,278
I learned early on,
sometimes you gotta choose

574
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,573
between being respected
and being liked.

575
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:37,667
.

576
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:38,752
- What do you mean
you don't have a bed?

577
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,629
Well, then why does my tablet
say you have two?

578
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,839
You know what?

579
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:43,923
That's not good enough,
all right?

580
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,592
I just got a patient
to admit herself,

581
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,177
to this hospital,
to my care.

582
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,391
- Scott!
Scott, come here.

583
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:57,270
Ah, system is showing that
your patient, Krista Valdez,

584
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:00,482
has been occupying that room
for almost four hours now.

585
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,900
You said you were going
to be transferring her

586
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,610
to in-patient psych?

587
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:04,903
- We were, but they don't
have any beds.

588
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,321
- Listen, you need to start
looking around

589
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,948
at neighboring hospitals,
and make it snappy, please.

590
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,077
We've got more patients
with more problems, you know.

591
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,204
Can't turn the ED into a
bed and breakfast, now can we?

592
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,127
Ah, there she is.
My prize pupil.

593
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:23,630
I went over your chartings,
very meticulous work.

594
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,215
You round early today too?

595
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,633
I did, yes.
I wanted to get a head start.

596
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,093
- I tell ya,

597
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,221
my other residents could learn
a thing or two from you.

598
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,847
All right, we're about due
up in the OR.

599
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,516
Ready to head up?
- Uh, Dr. Archer, about that.

600
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,642
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry,

601
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:36,643
I should have said
something sooner,

602
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,061
but I still think
it's worth trying

603
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,437
a less aggressive approach
first,

604
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,940
if there's any chance
to salvage Sean's arm.

605
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,526
- Well, uh, I appreciate
your honesty,

606
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,777
but the OR's booked,

607
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,612
and Sean's family
has signed off,

608
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,947
so, uh, let's hit it.

609
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,783
But you did only present
one option to his family.

610
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,326
I also consulted Dr. Marcel.

611
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,161
- Did you?
Huh.

612
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,792
You go ahead and present
your option to the family.

613
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,877
Be sure to inform
them of risks,

614
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,130
and if they sign off,

615
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,756
then I'd be happy to pass
the case onto you

616
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,008
and Dr. Marcel,

617
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,176
seeing as you two
have already consulted.

618
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:15,515
Oh, and you can deliver
any potential outcomes

619
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,475
together as well,
good or bad.

620
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:28,987
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

621
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,156
Dr. Marcel advised me
to stand by my opinion

622
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,324
on a case, and he's right,
I should.

623
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,993
I'm just--

624
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,411
I don't know, I'm hoping
things break my way.

625
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,834
- What?
What does he mean?

626
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,336
- Calm down, Mom.
Just let me explain.

627
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,211
- Mrs. Davis, please--

628
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,796
- Don't tell me to calm down.

629
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,340
- Mom.
- You told him to do this,

630
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,716
didn't you?

631
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,843
You have been after me
from the minute I got here.

632
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,303
- Whoa!
What's going on?

633
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,513
- Tell her.

634
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,558
- Brandon has decided to seek
counsel to become emancipated

635
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,226
so he doesn't have
to join the clinical trial.

636
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,729
- What?
- How could you do this?

637
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,564
How could you even
consider this?

638
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:08,026
- I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm sorry, but...

639
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,404
I can't do the trial.
I didn't know what else to do.

640
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:13,156
- Excuse us.
I need to talk to you.

641
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,373
- I can't believe you.

642
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:24,042
You are still just like
you were in med school,

643
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,710
always getting
in other people's business.

644
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,045
- Excuse me?

645
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,380
- Why couldn't you
just leave it alone?

646
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,298
- I'm trying to help
our patient.

647
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,633
- How?

648
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,760
By tearing his family apart?

649
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,512
You planted the idea
in his head, didn't you?

650
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,138
He was distraught.
I told him his options.

651
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,140
- At his mother's expense.

652
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:41,059
You've been judging Marie
since she walked in here.

653
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,686
- And you've been
defending her.

654
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:46,231
- Because I don't like seeing
that poor woman being attacked.

655
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,982
- Why are you making
this personal?

656
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,943
- I just think she deserves
someone in her corner.

657
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,861
- Well, news flash, Stevie,
she's not our patient.

658
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,238
Brandon is.

659
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,739
And if he wants my help,
I'm gonna advocate for him,

660
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,991
because that is my job.

661
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,993
Yours too, though you seem
to have forgotten it.

662
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,418
- Not a single bed?

663
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,044
Not even any discharges
scheduled

664
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,797
for the end of the day?

665
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,425
No, I get it.
I appreciate you checking.

666
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,926
Thank you.

667
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,511
- Any luck finding Krista
a transfer?

668
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,596
- I've called every hospital
with a decent psych ward

669
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:19,681
in a 50-mile radius.

670
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:20,974
They're all full
to capacity.

671
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:22,434
System's messed up.

672
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,436
Medical interventions
are given precedence

673
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,688
over psychiatric ones.

674
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,356
- What about relatives?

675
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,816
Is there a world
where we could release her

676
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,276
under family care
for the night,

677
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,610
bring her back in
for an appointment tomorrow?

678
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,404
- Thought about that too,
but her dad's deceased,

679
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,823
and she's estranged
from her mom, you know?

680
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,701
She's pretty damn isolated.
It's just her and her work.

681
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,661
- All right, fellas.

682
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:45,165
You find another hospital
to transfer Ms. Valdez to?

683
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,125
I need this room free now.

684
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,835
- We're working on it,
we're not there yet, all right?

685
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,879
Every psych ward
in the area is full.

686
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,422
- All right,
well, you know what to do.

687
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,008
All right, arrange for a
transfer to Bachmann Medical.

688
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,844
- The state hospital?
- Whoa, Dean, Dean, Dean--

689
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,305
Patient is extremely fragile.

690
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,474
Bachmann is the wrong
environment, trust me.

691
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,184
- The way they transfer
patients there,

692
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,102
with police, in cuffs--like,

693
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,563
the whole thing is humiliating,
traumatizing.

694
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,357
They treat people like perps
for seeking help.

695
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,150
- I get it, I get it.
I do, but--

696
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:15,153
- Do you get it?
Do you?

697
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,446
Because you've been
running this joint

698
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,240
like a drive-through car wash
since I got here.

699
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:22,077
We're supposed
to be helping people.

700
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,912
What the hell are
we doing here any--

701
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,470
Sorry.

702
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,013
I should have kept my cool
back there.

703
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,890
- Don't gotta apologize
to me.

704
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,767
A crappy situation.

705
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,395
- Just when you think you're
making in-roads, you know?

706
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:51,189
Helping somebody.

707
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:55,068
Run into red tape
or lack of resources.

708
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,361
It's so damn frustrating.

709
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,865
- You had a fair amount
of experience with bureaucracy

710
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,575
at your old job.

711
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:05,245
- Grew up in the same
community I was policing.

712
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,997
South Side, hundreds.

713
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,000
Too many times, I felt
like I had to betray

714
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,668
the people I was
supposed to be protecting.

715
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,755
- Hmm. Why you left?

716
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,924
- Part of the reason.

717
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,010
You're not trying
to shrink me?

718
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,595
- No, not trying
to shrink you, man.

719
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,892
- Some years ago,
my partner and I--

720
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,436
we responded to a call.

721
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:34,274
Stray bullet from a drive-by
hit a 14 year-old boy.

722
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:38,194
Kid was bleeding out,
shot through the thigh.

723
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,574
By some miracle,
I was able to hold pressure

724
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,744
long enough on the wound
for the paramedics to respond.

725
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:46,870
- He make it?

726
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,164
- Yeah, he survived.

727
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,378
It's from the slug
that hit him.

728
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,092
Man, it was the most alive,
the most useful

729
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,053
I felt on the force,
you know?

730
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,972
It's what drew me to medicine.

731
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:09,142
But days like today...

732
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:10,560
- Don't I know it.

733
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:14,064
I know it feels like
we failed her.

734
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:16,274
But the reality is,
it's not safe

735
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,984
for Krista to be alone
right now.

736
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,155
Given where we are, I think

737
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,157
I don't really have a choice.

738
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,284
I gotta call the admitting room
at State.

739
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,622
Now look, some good doctors
there.

740
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:31,831
I know a couple of them.

741
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:35,126
I'll call them up,
get her on their radar.

742
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,795
You still got a couple
of buddies on the force?

743
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:40,131
Maybe we can get them
to handle the transfer?

744
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:43,635
- Yeah, yeah, I could do that.
- All right.

745
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,222
What do you say we go, uh--
we go make her safe?

746
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,808
- Yeah.
- All right.

747
00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:58,400
.

748
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,442
- Crockett, can I talk
to you for a sec?

749
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,069
- Sure.

750
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:03,446
We gotta make it quick,
though, sorry.

751
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,532
I'm due in the OR in a sec.

752
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:08,118
- Yeah, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

753
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,162
You advised Dr. Taylor to push
back against Archer today

754
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,707
after a treatment plan
had already been put in place.

755
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,333
- Uh, no, not exactly.

756
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,627
Dr. Taylor asked me
for my advice,

757
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,337
and I told her--
- You told her

758
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,964
to stick her neck out

759
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,716
and make an enemy
of the chief of the ED.

760
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:23,717
You think that
was sound advice?

761
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,510
- Oh, hold on, Maggie.

762
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:28,221
Dr. Taylor went to Archer
of her own accord.

763
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:31,307
And I gotta say, I admire her
for advocating for her patient.

764
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,977
Where's this coming from?

765
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,688
- As a person in a position
of influence,

766
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,647
I think you should be
more mindful

767
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:38,857
of the things that you say.

768
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,944
Your two cents--
it has consequences.

769
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,154
Remember that.

770
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,498
- Mrs. Davis?
Can I join you?

771
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,384
- I swear I only want
what's best for Brandon.

772
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,137
- I know it probably feels

773
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,598
like everyone's judging you
right now, but...

774
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,725
not me.

775
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,268
I see how deeply
you love Brandon,

776
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,395
and I admire that
more than you know.

777
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,150
- Brandon suffered
his first crisis

778
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:25,070
right after his father died.

779
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,072
My husband was killed
in a head-on collision

780
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,449
by a drunk driver.
- I'm so sorry.

781
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:35,538
- A few weeks
after the funeral,

782
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,833
Brandon started vomiting
out of nowhere.

783
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:44,297
He could barely move.
He wasn't making any sense.

784
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,757
We don't have
any family nearby,

785
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,677
I didn't know who to call,
I had just lost my husband,

786
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,303
and I was so scared that--

787
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,097
- You were gonna lose
Brandon, too.

788
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:57,018
I can see why you're
so determined to protect him.

789
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,021
- It's just--

790
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:03,817
the thought of him
being so far away.

791
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:05,819
If anything were
to happen to him,

792
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,861
and I wasn't there--

793
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:08,822
- Mrs. Davis.

794
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:10,824
I know that the prospect
of letting him go

795
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,784
must be terrifying.

796
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,204
But you've taken such good care
of Brandon all these years,

797
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:17,872
I think that you can trust
that you've shown him

798
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,374
how to take care of himself.

799
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:24,129
- He really is a good kid.

800
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:32,095
You must have kids of your own.
- No, no kids.

801
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:35,974
But I was always
the little girl

802
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,892
that wished that she had
a mom like you.

803
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:49,362
- Okay, repair's done.

804
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,740
Removing the vascular clamp
from the artery.

805
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:53,074
Hand me the Doppler.

806
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:04,210
- Not hearing a signal.
Just static.

807
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:08,256
There's no flow
to the wrist.

808
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,550
All right, we're not sunk yet.

809
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:12,218
If I can pull out the clot,
there's a chance

810
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,929
we can still restore
blood flow.

811
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:16,514
Let's open up the repair,

812
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:19,142
stick down a balloon,
and thrombectomize.

813
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,435
- Putting another quarter
in the machine.

814
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:26,649
- Wait, what do you mean
you don't have a bed for me?

815
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:28,860
- I am so sorry that
we can't accommodate you here.

816
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,195
Really, I am.

817
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,405
But we have found a bed
for you at Bachmann.

818
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,825
- Bachmann?
No.

819
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,118
No, no, no.
There's no way.

820
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,287
That is for people
with really serious issues.

821
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:40,622
That's...

822
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,956
Oh, my God.
That's like lockdown.

823
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,625
No, if I cannot stay here,

824
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,752
then I would like
to go home now, please.

825
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:48,421
- Krista, I'm really
very worried about you.

826
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,424
So I'm afraid that discharge
is just not an option.

827
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:53,009
You know, it's my opinion
that you are still

828
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:55,428
a danger to yourself,
and I really think

829
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,099
you need to be somewhere safe.
- I don't--I don't--

830
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,558
You know what?
You made it seem

831
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,102
like this was my choice.
- And you made the right choice

832
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,771
- No, what you both did
was lie to me.

833
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,272
You were always going
to commit me, weren't you?

834
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:07,315
- Krista--
- You told me

835
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:08,650
that I can stay here,

836
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,026
and that we were gonna figure
this out together.

837
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,111
You know what?
Screw you guys.

838
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,278
I'm out of here.

839
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,238
Get this out of me.
- Whoa, Krista--

840
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,614
- No, do not touch me!

841
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:15,949
- Hold still Krista,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

842
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,950
- Let me go, please!
- Restraints!

843
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,118
- No!
- Whoa, Krista--

844
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,327
- Restraints, please?
- No, please!

845
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:22,622
No, please!
No I don't want to!

846
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:23,957
No!
- Calm down.

847
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:25,500
No, please leave me alone.

848
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,128
- Just let her help you!
- Leave me alone!

849
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,630
Please leave me alone!
- Please, calm down.

850
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:32,090
- Please.

851
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,344
Liars!

852
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:41,516
.

853
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:47,272
- Going to London!

854
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:49,190
- Good luck at school.
- Thank you!

855
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:51,401
- Aw, man.

856
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:57,240
Marie agreed to let
Brandon skip the trial.

857
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,950
She said you spoke to her.

858
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,329
Come on.
What, you're not gonna tell me?

859
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,375
What'd you say?

860
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,461
- There you go,
sticking your nose in again.

861
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,217
Seriously, though, I'm sorry
that I was hard on you today.

862
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:19,054
You know I can hit
below the belt sometimes.

863
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,973
But it's always followed
by a healthy dose of guilt,

864
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,850
if that's any consolation.
- Oh, it is.

865
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:28,855
- Dr. Hammer? Your paycheck.
- Thank you.

866
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,482
- Don't spend it all
at one place.

867
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,192
- Yeah, right.

868
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,569
Least I'll be able
to make rent this month.

869
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,279
- Always was your thing.

870
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:38,156
Always loved to cry broke.

871
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,825
- Well, some of us didn't
get a full ride to med school.

872
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:42,994
- Well, maybe if you spent
a little less time on your hair

873
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,788
and a little more time
in the books...

874
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,924
- Hey!
How'd it go?

875
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,759
- Hey!
We were able to get a pulse.

876
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,053
- Looks like Sean's
gonna keep his arm.

877
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,721
- Really?
- Yeah, thanks to you.

878
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:04,599
- This is amazing.

879
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:05,975
- Well, let's go share

880
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:07,227
the good news
with the family, yeah?

881
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,606
Um, listen.
I also need to apologize.

882
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,316
You know, when I weighed in
this morning,

883
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,528
I didn't mean to, you know,
throw you into the lion's den.

884
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:19,239
Maggie said I--
- Wait, Maggie?

885
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,491
- Yeah, she pointed out
that I may have

886
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,576
put you in a bad spot
with Archer.

887
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:25,120
Maybe I did, but I--
- No, please,

888
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,246
if you hadn't said something,

889
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,956
it would have
haunted me forever.

890
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:32,127
I am so, so thankful
for your advice.

891
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,462
- Okay.
- As a matter of fact,

892
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:36,631
they're doing this program
with the residents.

893
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,425
- Yeah, I heard of it.

894
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,969
- Well, they haven't
paired me up with anyone yet.

895
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,221
Any chance you'd want
to be my advisor?

896
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,850
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.

897
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:48,393
- Great!

898
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,728
- Come on.
- Okay.

899
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:53,398
- I really appreciate
your making time

900
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,941
to check me out,
Dr. Yang.

901
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,276
- It's no problem.

902
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:59,029
I'm actually glad
you checked in when you did.

903
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,947
- I don't like
the sound of that.

904
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,407
What's up?

905
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,452
- Your labs show
your blood sugar

906
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:08,371
has been climbing
over the last month or so.

907
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:09,998
- Well, I haven't
changed anything.

908
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,250
I'm still eating healthy,
exercising,

909
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,669
adhering to my insulin regimen.

910
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:16,463
- Well, as you know,
sometimes the disease

911
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:19,007
can progress despite
a healthy lifestyle.

912
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:22,344
But no need to worry.
We'll adjust your meds,

913
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:25,347
add an oral that will reduce
your resistance to insulin.

914
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,683
Also, stress
can definitely play a part.

915
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:31,311
Are you dealing with anything
particularly taxing right now?

916
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:34,105
- Uh, come in?

917
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,358
Just the usual work stuff.

918
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:39,527
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, no.

919
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:42,030
- I was just leaving.
I'll call in a prescription.

920
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,365
- Thank you.

921
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,287
- Everything okay?

922
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,705
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

923
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:53,958
- Ms. Goodwin,
I think we've taken

924
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,169
the wrong approach
with Matt Cooper,

925
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:58,338
coming at him headlong,
hoping eventually

926
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,839
he'll slip up, say something.

927
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:01,383
- Okay?

928
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:03,176
- If he's really on the take,

929
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,928
the more devices
the hospital buys,

930
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:07,263
the bigger his kickbacks,
right?

931
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:09,557
So he's gonna want as many
departments as he can get

932
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,352
to start using the thing.
- Right.

933
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,521
And he needs docs
not to just use the device,

934
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:18,108
but to shill for it.
Corruptible docs.

935
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,820
So I make myself
the perfect target.

936
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,030
- And how do you do that?

937
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:26,282
- Cry broke.

938
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:28,410
Make him think
I'd do anything for money.

939
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:30,412
- Let Cooper hook you in.

940
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:35,291
I knew you were
the right man for this job.

941
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:43,800
- Okay, gotta go.

942
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,427
- Dr. Taylor.

943
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,763
Hey!

944
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:57,230
Vanessa.
Vanessa.

945
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:00,275
Are you leaving now?
What about the drink?

946
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:01,776
- When I confided
in you earlier,

947
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:02,819
I was silly enough to think

948
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,446
that it was gonna stay
between us.

949
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:07,198
But you continue to prove
you can't stay in your lane.

950
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,034
- Vanessa, look.
I'm sorry--

951
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,452
- No.

952
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,328
I just want you to treat me
like everyone else.

953
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,872
That's all I want.

954
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:22,213
- Hey, Willie,
no cuffs, all right?

955
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:24,674
I know it's protocol,
but do me a solid.

956
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,343
- You got it.

957
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,732
- How long you been doing this?

958
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,904
- 35 years, I don't know.
Something like that.

959
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:47,739
- How?

960
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,617
- You gotta hang on to those--
those good days.

961
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:52,786
You know, hang on to the wins.

962
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,330
That's why you got that bullet
around your neck, right?

963
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:58,333
There you go.

964
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,211
Really important, buddy.

965
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,296
I mean for me, anyway.

966
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:08,218
Gotta hang on to those wins.
