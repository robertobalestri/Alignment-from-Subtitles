I'll take it from here.

Dr. Blake.
You're a transplant surgeon.

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:11,054
I got this.
She tried to scrub in.

5
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:14,666
How'd you guess?
I know my mom.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,061
You need a roof over
your head, heat, running water.

7
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:19,410
You just wanna
call the shots.

8
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,412
You owe me $1,200.

9
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:23,110
Do what you want
with it, Mom.

10
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:25,155
I screwed up everything
today.

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,157
I know how tough
internship can be.

12
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:29,768
Boards aren't gonna study
for themselves.

13
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:31,466
You pulled my patient's
Vas-COM?

14
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:33,468
I just think we should err
on the side of safety.

15
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,730
It did seem medically
warranted to get her

16
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:35,861
on better monitoring.

17
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:37,515
So I just put in
another Vas-COM.

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,169
Is something going on?

19
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:44,783
Dr. Halstead tells me
you're progressing well.

I have excellent doctors
to thank for that.

with your staff.

Well, Dr. Halstead
is one of our finest.

Don't forget Dr. Cooper.
Hey, there, what'd I miss?

24
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:59,798
We were just discussing
Eleanor's marked improvement.

25
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:01,583
How she looks much
less edematous.

26
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:03,193
Yeah, right, it's terrific.

27
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:05,195
I've been able to strategically
manage her fluids

28
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,414
using the Vas-COM.

29
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,198
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

30

peak at her cardiac output.

31
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:12,420
It's all right.
I have to go anyway.

32
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:13,595

You two take care.

35
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,471
Still can't believe
Cooper put in another Vas-COM.

36
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:22,169
I thought it was confirmed
that Vas-COM

37
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,301
didn't contribute
to her embolic events.

38
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:27,609
It didn't, but with Eleanor's
clotting issues, it's risky.

most coordinated person.

compressing him?

Nice and easy, okay?

This way I can stay
on top of her case.

Okay, well,
how do you wanna handle this?

229
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,873
You take the lead.

230
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,963
She's more likely
to listen to you anyway.

231
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:19,662
Terri, you definitely have
an infection in your arm

232
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,316
that has spread
to your bloodstream.

233
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,274
We have to treat it like MRSA
until your cultures come back.

234
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:25,189
We already knew
it was infected.

235
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,148
Yes, Mom,
but this particular type

236
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:30,151
of infection is resistant
to most forms of antibiotics.

237
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:33,328
I thought she was my doctor.

238
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:34,677
We can still treat it, Terri.

239
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:35,896
We'd like
to put in a PICC line.

240
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:37,680
It's a catheter
we'll leave in your arm.

241
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,290
Because if you do have MRSA--

242
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,902
It's a minimum of six weeks
of intravenous antibiotics.

243
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:44,165
Out of the question.
It's not really optional.

244
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,820
You can't force me to take
some medicine I don't want.

245
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,691
We have no intention
of forcing anything.

246
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:51,172
But if the infection goes
untreated, then it could spread

247
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,696
to your heart valves
and turn into endocarditis.

248
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,219
Which could kill you.

249
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,308
Six weeks I have to keep
coming back to the hospital?

250
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:58,701
No.

251
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,270
We could also make
arrangements

252
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:03,967
for a home health nurse
to come to your house.

253
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,666
Or wherever you're staying.

254
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,972
She's ashamed of me
because I live in a van.

255
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,757
Once the infection
is cleared, then we can--

256
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,803
No, no, I'm not letting you
put some thing in my arm

257
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:16,284

like a fish whenever you want.

259
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,815
How long has this been
going on, Gordon?

260
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,599
Just a few days--
A week.

261
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:32,082
Marielle's been nagging me
to get this looked at,

262
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:35,564
but sure it's just a cold.

263
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,262
What kind of cold
makes it hard to breathe?

264
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,482
It's called a chest cold,
hon.

265
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,527
COVID PCR test
came back negative.

266
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,486
Let's get a CBC, BMP, ABG,

267
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,357
blood and sputum cultures
and chest X-ray.

268
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,750
You got it.

269
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:48,751
We're gonna get to the bottom
of this, Gordon.

270
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,013
You sit tight.

271
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:53,451
Don't worry.
I won't let him go anywhere.

She's a tyrant, doc.

273
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:58,369
Wouldn't even let me
get a motorcycle.

274
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:00,894
30 years,
he still talks about that.

275
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,286
Just my two cents.

276
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,461
But you should keep
listening to her.

277
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,550
Thank you.

278
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,684

your large green tea

279
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,165

280
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,428
Thank you, Olivia.

281
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:16,257
Dr. Charles,
do you have a minute?

282
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,260
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?

283
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:23,612
Uh, my, uh,
my mom came in earlier.

284
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:26,702
I think you saw.
Yeah, I did.

285
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,922
Yeah, I was hoping
that you might talk to her.

286
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,575
She has a MRSA infection,

287
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,360
but she won't get
treatment for it.

288
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:33,665
Oh, boy.

289
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,450
Yeah, she's always
been this way.

290
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:36,799
I can't even get her to commit

291
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,714

blood pressure medication,

292
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,500
much less
intravenous antibiotics.

293
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:43,806
Frustrating, right?

294
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,939
Yeah.

295
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:50,813
She and I kinda speak
a different language.

296
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,467
It's kinda why I was hoping
that you might have

297
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,817
a better chance
of changing her mind.

298
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,341
Happy to give it a shot.

299
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,213
Anything else you think
that I should know?

300
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:01,519
You'll see pretty quickly
what you're up against.

301
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:04,392
Okay, it's just, you know,

302
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,263
don't wanna be flying blind,
that's all.

303
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:12,661

my mom and I.

304
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:15,533
My dad left before
I could even remember.

305
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:19,494

from apartment to apartment.

306
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,452
Sometimes leaving
in the middle of the night

307
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:24,368
to avoid paying
the last month's rent.

308
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,674
Pretty chaotic.

309
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:29,504
Yeah, at the time
I thought it was normal.

310
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:30,810
It was all I knew.

311
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,508
And she wanted
to make a home for us.

312
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,858
She really tried.

313
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:40,776
She just couldn't
get out of her own way.

314
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,951
How--how do you mean?

315
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,866
She couldn't hold down a job.

316
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,694
She'd mouth off to a boss,
get fired.

317
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:48,523
Right.
She started drinking.

318
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:50,873
Started using.

319
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,745
We wound up on the street.
Oh, man.

320
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm pretty sure she has some
undiagnosed mental illness.

321
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:00,883

really simplify your ability

to declare her incompetent.

326

to take away a patient's
decisional capabilities,

329
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,774

330

set of criteria.

00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:18,352
at East Mercy's emergency room
about a year ago.

350
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,006
That was another
terrible accident.

351
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,443
Siobhan just doesn't
pay attention sometimes.

352
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:23,705
Her head's in the clouds.

353
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,446
We'd come inside
from the grocery store.

354
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:28,449
It had been raining, and I was
unloading the groceries,

355
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,800
and I--I left my umbrella
on the kitchen tile.

356
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,758
And when I finally went
to pick it back up again,

357
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:37,806
there was this puddle
of water underneath and--

358
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:39,025
That's all we can think of.

359
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,548
I--I thought
that I cleaned it up,

360
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,332
but I guess
I must have missed some and--

361
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,812
Yeah, she had
a head CT then too.

362
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,988
Yeah, she--she fell
and hit--hit the back

363
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,859
of her head
on the kitchen counter.

364
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:50,645
It took four staples to...

365
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:54,083
But like we said, Siobhan's
always been kind of clumsy.

366
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,783
And what do you think,
Siobhan?

367
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:01,003
Are you clumsy?

368
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,353
I guess I do fall down a lot.

369
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,009
We'll have an orthopedic
resident coming soon

370
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,403
and cast Siobhan's arm.

371
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:13,102
And we'll go make sure he
brings his purple casting tape.

372
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,848
Call DCFS.

373
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:22,894
Wait,
what are you talking about?

374
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,592
There's a pattern
of suspicious injuries.

375
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,897
Yes, but they explained
what happened

376
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,595
and--and Siobhan confirmed it.

377
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,901
What do you think
she's gonna say, huh?

378
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,860
If there's one thing I learned
from my days at CPD,

379
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:33,688
is that the more convoluted
the story sounds,

380
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:35,516
the more likely it is not true.

381
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,041
Yes, but to call DCFS on that
with what little we saw?

382
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,000
Do you know what it could do
to those parents?

383
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,827
If you won't call them,
I will.

384
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:45,526
No, I--

385
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:53,838
So your mom is--
she's depressed.

386
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,449
She--she's definitely anxious.

387
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:59,409
I wouldn't be surprised
if a proper clinical evaluation

388
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,063
would yield
a bipolar diagnosis.

389
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,805
But right now she has capacity.

390
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,068
Even if she refuses
to take care of herself?

391
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,156
It doesn't disqualify her

392
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,811
from making
her own medical decisions.

393
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,160
What if it kills her
this time?

394
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:12,944
She seems to be aware
of the risk.

395
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,645
I didn't wanna suggest this
before running it by you first,

396
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,473
but there is
a pill form of antibiotics

397
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:21,127
that's had
some success with MRSA.

398
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,087
Linezolid, I know, but she'll
never stick to the regimen.

399
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:26,697
You know, could be
different this time.

400
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,221
Why?

401
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,223
Well, for instance, with her
blood pressure medication,

402
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,702
right, that she won't take,

403
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:34,575
we don't experience
high blood pressure physically.

404
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,229
But your mom,
she has a high fever.

405
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,753
Her arm is swollen.
She's in a lot of pain.

406
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:41,060
It's possible
that her physical symptoms

407
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,062
could compel her to act.

408
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,585
And if they don't?

409
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:47,936
Unfortunately,
it's her decision to make.

410
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,199
I'll talk to her.
I'll see what I can do.

411
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,683
Thank you.
Of course.

Any word from CPD?

418

Only that his prints
didn't turn up any records.

Oh. So what now?

out of here on my own two feet.

430

Ah.

432
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:41,685
A little
overly concerned about

adhering to hospital policy,
if you ask me.

434
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:44,993
I am afraid you'd sue

435
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,777
the hospital
if given the chance.

436
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,039
Uh-oh.

437
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,172
I wanted to thank you again,
Dr. Marcel.

Yeah, it was my pleasure.
Just happy it all worked out.

Yeah.

441
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,531
How's he doing?
Not good.

442
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,054
He suffered
major oxygen deprivation

443
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:04,578

00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,754

irreversible brain damage

Avery, I'm gonna
call you an Uber.

I'm sorry, sweetie.

What am I looking at?

475
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:24,658
New technology
called a nanodrug.

476
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,137
It's a smart drug that works

477
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:28,575
with the digital
feedback system.

478
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,403
I don't understand.

479
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,535
It's for patients that forget
to take their medicine.

480
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,494
Their caregivers can track
the exact date and time

481
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:36,583
that a patient ingest
their pills on a phone app.

482
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,541
How?
Watch.

483
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,457
Each pill is embedded
with a microscopic nanosensor.

484
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,459
When it dissolves
in the stomach acid,

485
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,331
the sensor then sends a signal

486
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,637
to a patch
on the patient's body.

487
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,726
And that patch
tells the phone app.

488
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,338
I could track whether
my mom's taking them or not.

489
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:55,079
But her antibiotics
don't have nanosensors.

490
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,472
Well, researchers at Med
are working

491
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,387
on their version of this.

492
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,302
They said they can
add nanosensors to any pills.

493
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:01,825
So when my mom's are ready
at the pharmacy,

494
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,436

00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,443
I mean,
does she have to know?

498
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:16,100
What is it? What's wrong?

499
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:18,755
I'm having trouble

Hi, there. I'm Dr. Cooper.

501
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,543
Matt, there must've
been a mistake.

502
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:26,372
I asked for the pulmonologist
on call.

503
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,851
Your request came to my unit,

504
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:30,245
and as the critical care doctor
on call, you got me.

505
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,073
Excuse me.
Are you the patient's wife?

506
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,509
Marielle.

507
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:35,206
Marielle, this is what I do.
Okay.

508
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,166
I'm--I'm confident I can
address your husband's issues.

509
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,820
All right.

510
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:42,126
Gordon came in
with a bad case of pneumonia.

511
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,128
I had to intubate him.

512
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,347
But I'm having difficulty
achieving

513
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:47,218
adequate gas exchange.

514
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:48,655
I thought he was fighting
the ventilator,

515
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:50,526
so I sedated him with propofol

516
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,398
but his airway pressures
are still up.

517
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,748
Not--not exactly sure
what the problem is.

518
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,315
I think an early ARDS.

519
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,665
Already started him
on the ARDs net protocol.

520
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,232
ARDS?

521
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:03,191
Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome.

522
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,759
There are tiny elastic sacs

It seems Gordon's are not
properly exchanging oxygen.

524
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:11,373
So to improve his gas
exchange, we need

525
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,376
to sedate him more deeply
and then paralyze him.

526
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,812
Paralyze him?

527
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:17,553
Yeah, I know
that sounds extreme.

528
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:19,250

inside his chest.

530
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:23,603
And to do that,
you need to paralyze him?

Hey, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

along Ricky Sussman's hip?

700
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:35,442
Yeah, I thought it might've
been from a hip replacement.

701
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:36,965
Yeah, it was.

702
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,358
When I looked back at the CT

703
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,751
I saw his prosthesis
had an identification chip.

704
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:43,102
So I had it scanned,

705
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:45,017
called around
several device manufacturers

706
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,021
until one claimed
the chip's serial number.

707
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:50,718
That got you to his name.

708
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:55,157
From there, tracking down
his cousin was pretty easy.

I'd like Ms. Gastern
to hear this,

725
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:43,858

status might clear things up.

726
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:50,299
I went back
and took a look at her scans.

727
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:53,824
This is Siobhan's head CT
from East Mercy last year.

728
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:57,350
And this is the one
we took this morning.

729
00:31:57,393 --> 00:31:59,874
They look exactly
the same to me.

That's what I initially
thought too.

731

But then I noticed this.

732
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:06,968
Siobhan's cerebellum has shown
some signs of atrophy

733
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,274
in this last year.

734
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:09,884
Atrophy?

735
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,407
Meaning there's been
a loss of brain cells.

736
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:14,976
It's subtle, but if you look
really close,

737
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,543
you can see
that this part of the brain

738
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:20,112
is somewhat smaller
in appearance.

739
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:22,070
Might explain why she's
always been a little clumsy.

740
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:23,854
Has that gotten worse
this year?

741
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,856
I--I suppose so.

742
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,423
I believe that
that is a result

743
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,208
of these changes
in her cerebellum,

744
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,906
which is the part of the brain
that controls coordination.

745
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,997
Are you saying Siobhan
has a brain disorder?

746

Not exactly.

747
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,087

which causes her

748
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:42,351
to not produce an important
enzyme called HEXA.

749
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:45,354
The name of the disease
is Tay-Sachs.

750
