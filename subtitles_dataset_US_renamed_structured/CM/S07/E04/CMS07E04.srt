.

2
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:08,138
Any chance you'd want
to be my advisor?

3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:10,140
Yeah, I'd like that.

4
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:12,490
We need to be deliberate
and tactical

5
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,318
in our approach to medicine.

6
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:16,755
We can't just do
a three-minute evaluation.

7
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,453
Gotta spend more time
with the patients.

8
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:21,282
Maybe psychiatry
just doesn't belong here.

9
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:22,805
I'm Jessa Rinaldi.

10
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:24,633
We at Vasic want
to make the Vas-COM

11
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:26,156
the new standard of care.

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,680
Doctor cooper said that
you could be a real asset.

13
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,726
I am definitely interested.

14
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:35,774
So is anything
jumping out?

15
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:36,775
No.

16
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,168
Each of these patients,

17
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,214
I think Dr. Cooper's choice
to use the Vas-COM

18
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:42,390
was appropriate.
Yeah, I did too.

19
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:46,220
But that's good.
It's a relief, actually.

20
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:50,180
Mm, there he is.

21
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:51,703
And the rep, Jessa Rinaldi?

22
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:54,358
Do you think she's
in on it with him?

23
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,708
As far as device reps go,
she's as green as they come.

24
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:58,493
Hasn't even graduated
from the backpack

25
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:00,408
to the roller board.

26
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,540
You should know,
she and Dr. Cooper asked me

27
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,239
to pitch the Vas-COM
at Grand Rounds.

28
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,849
We're having
a practice round today.

29
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:09,286
Well, that's good.
Show them you're onboard.

30
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,461
Just don't agree

31
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:13,377
to actually go through
with Grand Rounds.

32
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:14,726
Yeah, I won't.

33
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,119
Oh, I gotta go.

34

Oh! Hi, Dr. Halstead.
Good morning.

37
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,525
I didn't even see you
sitting here.

38
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:32,788
Hiding in plain sight,
I guess.

I am so excited for today.

40
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,487
If everything goes well,

41
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,142
you can start pitching
the Vas-COM for real.

42
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:40,926
Maybe! One step at a time.

Oh.
First, a 26-year-old female.

128
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,148
Ankle injury,
said she wore heels on the "L"

X-ray's negative.
It's just a sprain.

Other two are a father
and his teenage daughter.

132

Single vehicle crash.
Driving lesson gone wrong.

133

Exams were unremarkable,
cleared their c-spines.

is a wildcard.

Fuzziness could last a while.

180
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:20,265

chest X-ray, and a head CT.

You got it.

182
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,138
What about the arm?

183
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,705
Life over limb.

184
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,097
We'll deal with it
after the CT.

185
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,931
Mr. Channing,
I'm Dr. Halstead.

186
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,280
Oh, call me Pete.

187
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,412
I'm not going to be
Mr. Channing

188
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,980
until at least 35.

189
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,372
You got it.

190
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,765
Tell me, what's going on?

191
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,072
I've been puking up a storm.

192
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,377
How fun.

193
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:49,773
Vitals are normal.
Temp's elevated, 101.1.

194
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:52,036
Not for nothing, Pete,
but you smell like a keg.

195
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,299
Yeah, sorry.

196
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,954
Back on campus
after a year and a half online.

197
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:59,130
Been making up for lost time
on the party front.

198
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:00,871
Aha.

199
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,960
That hurt?

200
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:05,136
Everything kind of hurts.

201
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,269
I thought it was just
another bad hangover,

202
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:11,142
but the elixir that
usually knocks them out, isn't.

203
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,014
May I?

204
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,017
That coconut water?

205
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,149
With some electrolyte powder
and ice.

206
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:20,151
I've been drinking it nonstop
all morning,

207
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,979
but I'm not feeling any better.

208
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,894
Okay, all right, well,
let's run some labs,

209
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,200
and we'll go from there, okay?

210
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:28,159
CBC, BMP, amylase, lipase,
and a chest X-ray.

211
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:29,247
I'll be back in a bit.

212
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,424
Saw you in the café
this morning

213
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:33,904
with that device rep.

214
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,515
Was gonna say hi,
but I didn't want

215
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,429
to be a third wheel.

216
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,171
Jut business, Dean.
Hey, my mistake.

217
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:42,173
Must be one hell of a device.

218
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,179
It's all right, come on.
It's okay.

219
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:50,442
Maggie, what's open?
Treatment 3.

220
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,183
Okay.
You need a psych tech?

221
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:53,402
On standby. Dr. Charles?

222
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,970
On his way down.
All right.

223
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:05,719
♪

224
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,812
Hey, you need anything?

225
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,336
Water? Something to eat?
No. No, thank you.

226
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,381
Hey, you call
for a psych tech?

227
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,209
Yeah, just stay close.

228
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:20,951
Restraints?
No.

229
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:25,477
It's okay. It's all right.

230
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,394
Hey, Dr. Charles.

231
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:35,792
Roland is 22--he was diagnosed
with schizophrenia,

232
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,794
like, three months ago.

233
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:40,449
These are his meds.

234
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:43,321
Fluphenazine.
First generation antipsychotic.

235
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:47,325
30 milligrams a day?
Heavy dose.

236
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:50,764
His mom, Pam Baxter,
says he never misses a dose,

237
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,461
yet today he still had a break.

238
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:53,941
How you doing?

239
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,899
Nothing I haven't
dealt with before, man.

240
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:59,599
Ms. Baxter?

241
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:01,122
How are you doing?
I'm Dr. Charles.

242
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:02,427
It's great to meet you.

243
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:04,560
You'll help my son?
That's why I'm here.

244
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,127
Uh, you mind if I say hello
to him?

245
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,353
Roland, how you doing?
I'm Dr. Charles.

246
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,880
It's all right. It's okay.

247
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:25,581
Pam, let me show you
to the waiting room, okay?

248
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,365
Cardiac output and index.

249
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,237
Pulse pressure
and stroke volumes.

250
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,109
Central venous pressure,
mean arterial pressure,

251
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:35,417
and calculated values
like oxygen delivery.

252
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,161
The Vas-COM is the all-in-one
cardiac monitoring device.

253
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:43,512
It almost makes us unnecessary.
Almost.

254
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,341
I love that.

255
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,516
Dr. Cooper.

256
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,474
So with Covid cases,
it can be useful

257
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,215
to quantify pulmonary edema.

258
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,130
Is that something the Vas-COM
is capable of?

259
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,523
Lung water volume?
Absolutely.

260
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,090
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

261
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,962
Uh, I just--I left
my water bottle there

262
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,312
from the budget meeting.

263
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,445
Gotta stay hydrated, right?

264
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:06,056
Sorry, just forget
I'm not here.

265
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,102
Uh, actually,
speaking of water,

266
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:11,105
what were you saying
about lung water volume or...

267
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:14,151
Right. Yes.

268
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:15,979
It can be calculated
in seconds.

269
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,285
The reason:

270
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:19,983
the Vas-COM's sophisticated
neural network AI.

271
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,856
This, in combination with
a thermistor at the tip

272
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,293
of the central venous line
and the waveform analysis

273
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:28,122
from the arterial side
ensures the device delivers

274
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,993
consistent and accurate
measurements.

275
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:32,648
And it's minimally invasive.

276
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,519
Well, not when it comes
to your wallet.

277
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:38,915
I mean, those catheters
are pretty pricey, right?

278
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,439
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to say that out loud.

279
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:45,008
No, I mean,
it's a fair point.

280
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,010
What do you think,
Dr. Halstead?

281
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,185
Well, yes and no.

282
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,926
I mean, the Vas-COM is
more expensive

283
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,493
than other devices,
but it's certainly

284
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,538
not overpriced considering
the multitude of functions

285
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:54,539
it's capable of.

286
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,019
Oh, yeah, I mean, it is

287
00:11:56,063 --> 00:12:00,023
a Swiss army knife,
there's no doubt about that.

288
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,721
Dr. Archer,
that's not a bad thing.

289
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:04,288
Uh, no, but it's
not necessary, either.

290
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,421
At the end of the day,
the Vas-COM just seems

291
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:09,729
like a high-tech repackaging
of all the hemodynamic devices

292
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:10,991
already out there.

293
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:12,514
I mean, why complicate things

294
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:16,039
when info from central venous
pressure's been working

295
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,519
perfectly well for decades?

296
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,651
At least, that's, you know,
that's how I see it, so.

297
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,088
Well, I disagree.

298
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,524
I'd liken the CVP
you're describing

299
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,395
to a flip phone.

300
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,615
The Vas-COM though,
is the smart phone

301
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:27,616
we all want in our pockets.

302
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,009
Yeah, well, not all of us.

303
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,489
Some of us just want
to make a phone call, right?

304
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,056
And this has been
working excellent

305
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,405
for me, still does.

306
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,972
Anyway, I'm old school.

307
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:39,280
All right, I got my water,
and I'll leave you to it.

308
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:45,503
♪

309
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:48,245
X-rays on Ashley's arm.
Distal radius fracture.

310
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:49,377
I paged Ortho--

311
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,509
they're gonna come down
and cast it.

312
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:54,164
Is that her CT?
Take a look.

313
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:58,168
Oh, man. Lesions.

314
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,691
Four.
Yeah.

315
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:02,607
And this area here
is a resection cavity.

316
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,610
Surrounding tissue shows
evidence of radiation necrosis.

317
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,177
So there was a tumor
that was removed.

318
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:10,267
It must have been cancerous
given the dead tissue.

319
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:13,531
Anaplastic astrocytoma.

320
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,142
I was able to pull up
Ashley's medical records

321
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,447
dating back to 2000.

322
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,710
That's when everything
started going digital.

323
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:21,322
Diagnosis was made
sometime before that.

324
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:23,106
Yes, since 2000,

325
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,239
there have been
three recurrences.

326
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,154
Appears biopsies
on those lesions, though,

327
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,459
were all negative.

328
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,548
So all benign,
but only three recurrences?

329
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:33,116
I'm counting four here
on her CT.

330
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,990
Yeah, there's a new lesion.
The cancer may be back.

331
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:43,170
.

332
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,912
So I'm thinking an
adverse reaction to his meds

333
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,871
definitely had a lot to do
with his episode this morning.

334
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,438
Yeah, I was leaning
that way too.

335
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,787
I noticed some
spastic muscle contractions

336
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,832
when I brought him in.

337
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,007
Yeah, he's also
having a hard time

338
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,660
controlling his tongue
inside his mouth.

339
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,141
Both of those things, you know,
symptoms of overmedication.

340
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:00,013
I just think his dose
is too high.

341
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,884
He's coming down now, though.
Oh, yeah.

342
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,539
Gave him some Ativan and some
Benadryl so he can rest.

343
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,541
I'm gonna reassess in a bit.

344
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:10,893
You know, I've known the family
since I was a rookie cop.

345
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,025
Roland's always been
a bright kid

346
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:15,593
but shy, sensitive.

347
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:17,073
Doesn't help that
his neighborhood's a war zone.

348
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:18,422
Yeah.

349
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,598
I'm sorry that you had to
go it alone out there,

350
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:23,688
but, look, thank God
you were there, right?

351
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:26,561
So a good job.

352
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:27,605
I'll check back.

Hey, Mr. Kumar.
I'm Dr. Marcel.

354
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,790
I'm the E.D. surgeon
on call today.

355
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:41,532
Oh, man, I've been upgraded?

356
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,186
That's--that's not a good sign.

357
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,058
Well, the resident you saw
when you came in

358
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,843
asked me to consult because
of your chest X-ray results.

359
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,628
It's protocol,
not necessarily an omen.

360
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:53,588
All right, the X-ray.
Lay it on me.

361
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:55,851
So it showed
a widened mediastinum,

362
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,809
partition between your lungs.

363
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:02,945
So given your symptoms,
fatigue, back pain,

364
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,947
trouble swallowing,
hypertension.

365
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:07,080
The widened mediastinum
could by symptomatic

366
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:10,561
of a lot of things,
or it could be nothing.

367
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:13,477
Nothing. Let's--
Yeah, let's go with that.

368
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,957
Right.

369
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,872
Well, you know,
I'm gonna send you

370
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,092
for a CT
of your chest and abdomen.

371
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,528
Get a better look
at what's doing,

372
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,965
and then we'll go
from there, okay?

373
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,880
I'd be on my bike by now.

374
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,621
I'm sorry?

375
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:31,800
I had to pull out
of a Half-Ironman triathlon.

376
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:34,498
Oh.
1.2 mile saltwater swim,

377
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,500
56 mile bike ride.

378
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:40,113
Now it tires me out
just watching the race online.

379
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,071
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, man.

380
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,812
Yeah, well, listen,
hang in there.

381
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:46,684
Tech'll be by soon,
get you that scan, okay?

382
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,599
Okay.
All right.

383
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:54,910
It started with migraines
when I was in the 11th grade,

384
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,653
and they found the tumor
a year later.

385
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,829
The day after I graduated
from high school,

386
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:04,659
they took it out,
and I felt much better.

387
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:09,142
No speech issues,
no more balance problems.

388
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:12,580
I was healed, or so I thought.

389
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,888
Turns out the tumor
was cancerous.

390
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:25,158
Anaplastic astrocytoma
has been my life since 1991.

391
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:28,857
The previous recurrences
were benign.

392
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,034
It's possible that
this one is too.

393
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,081
But we can't be sure without--
A biopsy.

394
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,825
Digging out a little more
of my brain.

395
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:41,913
No, thank you.

396
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:46,048
Do you not want to know
what it is?

397
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:48,355
The original chemo
and radiation,

398
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:51,358
they were brutal.

399
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,794
And the biopsies?

400
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,840
Each one has left me
a little worse for wear.

401
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:58,321
My eyesight's bad,
my hearing's going,

402
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:00,323
my hormones are out of whack,

403
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:04,719
my bones are brittle.

404
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,591
I just don't want
to risk anymore damage.

405
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,811
So, okay, you can treat my arm.

406
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,639
But after that,
I want to go home.

407
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:17,079
♪

408
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,821
Okay.

409
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,127
Ortho will be by soon.

410
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,830
I feel so bad for her.

411
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:31,659
She's been through hell,
there's no question.

412
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:34,227
But her diagnosis,
Anaplastic astrocytoma,

413
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,271
it doesn't add up.

414
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,359
What do you mean?

415
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:37,969
A.A. is fatal.

416
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:40,276
Life expectancy post-diagnosis
is a few years at best.

417
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,930
Ashley has survived 30.

418
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,975
You don't think she has it.

419
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,413
I don't know what's going on.

420
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:48,328
But whatever's happening,
it started in 1991

421
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,373
with that original tumor.

422
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,940
30 years.

423
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:54,029
I mean, any chance
a tissue sample still exists?

424
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,117
Oh, no, I doubt it.

425
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,121
But maybe the pathology report
still does.

426
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,427
Pre-dates 2000,
so it won't be

427
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,558
in her electronic file,

428
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:04,083
but it has to be
on paper somewhere.

429
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,172
Yep.

430
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,174
Let's start looking.
Okay.

431
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,265
Roland's sleeping now.

432
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,440
When he wakes up,

433
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,050
Dr. Charles will come
do another exam.

434
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,926
We were on the bus
when the break happened.

435
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,843
To visit Harold Washington.

436
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,323
Hmm. City College?

437
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,284
Since the diagnosis,

438
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,808
Roland hasn't left
the apartment.

439
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,375
But yesterday,

440
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,681
he said he wanted
to try again at school.

441
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,251
I was so hopeful it was...

442
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,341
The beginning of something
for him.

443
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,258
But the bus was crowded.

444
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,176
And there was traffic.

445
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,227
If you hadn't come,

446
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,707
it was almost my family today.

447
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:13,239
Roland is a sweet boy. Kind.

448
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:15,241
He is.

449
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:18,200
I wish we weren't
the only ones who knew that.

450
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,165
Labs are back on Pete,
your belly patient.

451
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,210
White count's 21,000.

452
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:31,344
That's high.
Let me see the chest X-ray?

453
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,041
Motion artifact. Tough to read.

454
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:34,738
He vomited just before
the image was taken.

455
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:35,870
He had a hard time
staying still.

456
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:37,045
All right.

457
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:38,525
Oh, Doc, thank God
you're back.

458
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,179
My stomach is killing me.

459
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,528
Yeah, your labs show
you're fighting

460
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:42,790
more than just a hangover.

461
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,921
Let me take another look.

462
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,227
Ahh!

463
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,750
That hurts
way worse than before.

464
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,274
Okay, Trini, grab Mike.

465
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,972
Sorry, I gotta keep checking.

466
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:52,234
Oh, this is bad isn't it?

467
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,018
Oh, God, okay,
no more crap food.

468
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,369
Just give me salads
and vegetables.

469
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:59,154
No, no, full vegan from now on.
I promise.

470
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,373
Let's get another X-ray
before you make

471
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,504
any huge life decisions.

472
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:02,940
Upright chest, 90 degrees.

473
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,900
And Pete, I know you're
in a lot of pain,

474
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:08,772
but you gotta stay
really still, okay?

475
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:11,035
Clear.

476
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,865
Yep, free air
under the right diaphragm.

477
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,911
Trini, find me Dr. Archer.

478
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:18,391
What's going on?

479
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,957
So you need surgery.

480
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,351
Your stomach pain is
from a tear in your GI tract.

481
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,135
Air is leaking into your belly.

482
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,964
Leaking?
How does that happen?

483
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,531
Well, around here,
typically I see it

484
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:32,013
from penetrative trauma, uh,
bullets, stab wounds...

485
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:33,406
Guns and knives?

486
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:36,235
But I'm keg stands
and peer pong.

487
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,151
I think I'm gonna puke again.

488
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:41,544
I need my drink.

489
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,155
Sorry, man, no liquids
before surgery.

490
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:49,552
Hey, your elixir.
I saw you eating ice.

491
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:50,988
Is that always
part of the process?

492
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:55,384
Yeah, chewing on a cold cube
is just satisfying.

493
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,821
Well, I think one
might have caused the tear.

494
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:58,996
Yeah, it's likely
been getting bigger

495
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,955
with each cube
you've swallowed since.

496
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,392
Seriously? An ice cube?

497
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,089
It's looking that way.
What's up?

498
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,961
Hey, so this is the surgeon.
I'm gonna fill him in,

499
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:08,484
then he's gonna take over,
okay?

500
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,445
Pneumoperitoneum.

501
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:13,968
I suspect the tear's
somewhere near

502
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,361
the gastro-esophageal junction.

503
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,058
Yeah, there's no blood.

504
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:18,364
Ah, wasn't shot or stabbed.

505
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,148
I think an ice cube
went down the wrong way.

506
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:23,847
Get out, really?
All right, cool.

507
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,153
All right, I'll take it
from here.

508
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,332
You know, Dean,
kid's a nervous wreck.

509
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,507
Not in the greatest shape,
either.

510
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:34,205
Post-surgery, I think
cardiac monitoring

511
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,468
would be appropriate.

512
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:38,862
Uh, let me guess, uh,
use the Vas-COM?

513
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:42,257
I know you like
your old-school CVP,

514
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,346
but I do think the Vas-COM
might be better suited

515
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,000
for this patient.

516
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,524
Well, I'll consider it.

517
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,004
Thank you.

518
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:52,180
Okay, I've considered it.

519
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:54,530
No. I'll stick with my device.

520
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:06,150
.

521
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:08,805
Archer's a real
ball buster, huh?

522
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,938
Yeah, he enjoys it, too.

523
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,461
But still, part of me hoped

524
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:15,943
he would at least
consider the Vas-COM.

525
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:17,945
You mind if I offer you
a little advice?

526
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:19,076
Please.

527
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,339
Look, you nailed
highlighting

528
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,166
the Vas-COM's positives.
You nailed it.

529
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,866
But you whiffed on pointing out
the CVP's negatives.

530
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,216
That monitor has to be
leveled and calibrated

531
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:30,261
before each use.
Right.

532
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:31,872
But what if
that's not done appropriately?

533
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:35,266
All the numbers are off.

534
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,877
None of that data
can be trusted.

535
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,314
A bad calibration
in the moment.

536
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,968
That's happened before?

537
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:44,406
Not to me.
Because I use a Vas-COM.

538
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,844
Anyway, food for thought.

539
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:49,193
You know, as we move
toward Grand Rounds.

540
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,329
See? Right there.

541
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,853
CT shows the wall
of the aorta has thickened.

542
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:58,594
I think it's an aortic tumor.

543
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,161
No way.

544
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,337
Thoracoabdominal
aortic aneurysm.

545
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,470
I don't know, the walls
are abnormally shaped.

546
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:06,167
Aneurysms are symmetrical.

547
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,429
It isn't a classic
presentation,

548
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,865
I'll give you that,
but aortic tumors

549
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:12,173
are super rare,
aortic aneurysms are not.

550
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,175
Okay, look, I get it,
Dr. Bickman.

551
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:15,306
Common things are common,

552
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,786
but that doesn't rule out
a curveball.

553
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,962
No, but your point is moot
'cause that's a fast ball.

554
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,573
Thoracoabdominal
aortic aneurysm.

555
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:22,357
I'm not comfortable
with that diagnosis.

556
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,054
It's an IR case now,
Dr. Marcel.

557
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,099
Send him up to the cath lab.

558
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,100
I'll put in a stent,

559
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:27,144
and he'll be good as new.

560
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,629
How's it going?

561
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:35,892
I've only come across
four cases in which

562
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,330
patients outlived a diagnosis
of anaplastic astrocytoma,

563
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:42,072
and two of them were determined
to be misdiagnoses.

564
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:44,248
So odds are Ashley likely
isn't another medical miracle.

565
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,642
No. But can we prove it?

566
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,383
Maggie and I have been
trying to dig up

567
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,080
her original files
and path reports.

568
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:51,473
Slow go.

569
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,695
Sweet. She's got something.

570
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,392
Your research, good stuff.

571
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,133
Hey, Dr. Hammer.

572
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,397
How many cases you working?

573
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,007
Just one.

574
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,966
That's an improvement.
You had any food?

575
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:10,144
I'll take that as a no.

576
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:11,362
I'll grab something later,

577
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:13,147
but this is just
more important than lunch.

578
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,018
Yeah, I disagree.

579
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,020
You can't help your patients
if you run out of gas.

580
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:23,505
Dolmeh, koufteh ghelgheli.
Made them last night.

581
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:26,073
Take five. Recharge.

582
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:37,040
Roland. How you feeling?

583
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:40,174
I'm Dr. Charles.
We met earlier.

584
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:42,176
I remember. Kind of.

585
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,006
I'm sorry about
my behavior earlier, sir.

586
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,269
You have absolutely nothing
to apologize for.

587
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:50,140
You mind if I come in?
We can chat a bit?

588
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,709
Sure.

589
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:57,191
Last time the doctor
just stayed in the doorway,

590
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:59,585
wrote me a prescription.

591
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,762
So, um, I understand
that you and Dr. Scott

592
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,677
go way back.

593
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,462
Long as I can remember.

594
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,682
We not as tight
as we used to be, though.

595
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,074
No?

596
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:12,206
I mean, he doesn't
send the calls

597
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,990
to voicemail or nothing,
it's just...

598
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:18,560
He's a doc now, so, you know,

599
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,257
he's not around
as much anymore.

600
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,695
I miss him.

601
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:25,132
I can understand that.
I would too.

602
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:26,699
Yeah.

603
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:29,571
I wish I was more like D.

604
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,181
Guy's not afraid of nothing.

605
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:35,359
Shadow doesn't even mess
with him.

606
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:36,752
Shadow?

607
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:39,494
It's outside.

608
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,235
Waits for me
to leave the apartment.

609
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:47,067
Always feels like
it's gonna attack me.

610
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,199
So do you ever see
the shadow inside

611
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:50,549
when you're at home?

612
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,813
No.
Except when I don't sleep.

613
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,728
What does the shadow
look like?

614
00:25:55,771 --> 00:26:00,167
I mean, is it a person?
Does it have a specific shape?

615
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,344
I don't know.
It's just a thing.

616
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:04,475
A blur.

617
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,651
I see it,
but when I turn around,

618
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:07,522
it's someplace else.

619
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,567
Shadow ever speak to you?

620
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,177
I mean, does it have a voice?

621
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,788
No. It don't make any noises.

622
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:17,401
It's just always there.

623
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,620

Last time,
the doctor had a checklist.

632
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,294
I'd answer yes or no.

633

bit differently around here.

He did. He did.

You know, there's no doubt
in my mind

639
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,095
that it's very real to him,

640
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:01,707

to irregular sleep cycles.

641
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,099
Hmm.

642

Also, you know,
he only sees the shadow, right?

643
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:08,670
It doesn't talk to him,
and with schizophrenia,

644
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:11,717
you'd think there'd be an
auditory hallucination as well.

645

Also, there's this
extreme level of agoraphobia,

646

and I don't know,
it's just not tracking.

it's schizophrenia.

00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,956
that the stent
would ease the pain,

706
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:46,654
but it's worse, it's worse.

707
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:48,656
And my legs are numb.

708
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:49,875
They're numb.
Okay.

709
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:50,876
I can't move them.
Okay, we're gonna

710
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,312
figure this out.

711
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:57,665
No way this is an aneurysm.

712
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,799
I need an MRI.
Ow!

713
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:08,415
.

714
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,026
Damn it. I knew it.

715
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,854
Tumor in the inner layer
of the aorta.

716
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,334
It's occluding several
perforating vessels

717
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,075
to the spine.
It's not getting enough blood.

718
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:17,859
Explains why
his legs went numb.

719
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,861
Looks like blood's leaking
into the wall of the aorta.

720
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,080
If it keeps compressing
the vessels--

721
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:24,083
His legs will go
from numb to paralyzed.

722
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:25,649
That tumor's gotta come out.

723
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,305
Roland doesn't
have schizophrenia?

724
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:31,438
I don't believe he does.

725
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:34,833
After talking with him,
looking at his test results,

726
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:37,661
getting more medical history
from Dr. Scott,

727
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:39,925
it's my belief that
the more appropriate diagnosis

728
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,709
would be bipolar disorder.

729
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,885
But the other psychiatrist--
Was wrong.

730
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,151
But he was so sure.
Said he'd seen it before.

731
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:52,111
Psychiatry is far
from an exact science.

732
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:55,288
And unfortunately,
research does show

733
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,768
that African Americans,
particularly males,

734
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:01,120
are misdiagnosed
with schizophrenia

735
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,469
far more than whites.

736
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:04,906
We're perceived as dangerous,

737
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,388
and so we get a diagnosis
to match that perception.

738
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:10,303
This why the dosage
on Roland's meds

739
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:11,913
was so high also?

740
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,742
Because he was assumed
to be a threat?

741
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:17,876
It's very likely.

742
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,443
And that high dose
also probably contributed

743
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,141
to exacerbating the condition
that I think

744
00:31:22,184 --> 00:31:24,360
that he actually has.

745
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,928
Today could have been
avoided.

746
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,843
I'm so sorry.

747
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:33,979
Is there a way
to make things right?

748
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:37,025
We do a complete
reassessment, okay?

749
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:40,855
New meds. The right doses.
Therapy.

750
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,161
I know of an outpatient clinic

751
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:44,859
that I think that Roland
would really respond to.

752
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,730
Okay?

753
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,950
I'm gonna leave you two
for a minute.

754
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:51,083
Thank you.
Of course.

755
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,871
What do you think?

756
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,742
I think he sees
the same thing in Roland

757
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,048
that we see.

758
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:06,228
What do you say?
Follow Dr. Charles' advice?

759
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:15,020
An anomaly?
I don't understand.

760
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:17,152
According to
your medical records,

761
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:20,199
we have reason to question
whether your original tumor

762
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:23,289
was in fact
anaplastic astrocytoma.

763
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,943
We came across
a pathology report

764
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:27,902
that suggests it might be
pilocytic astrocytoma.

765
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,035
Well, what's the difference?

766
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:34,256
Anaplastic is malignant.
Pilocytic is benign.

767
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,390
So I might not have cancer?

768
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,131
We don't know.

769
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:40,828
There's no tissue left
from that original tumor

770
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:42,264
to examine.

771
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:43,962
In order to make
an updated diagnosis,

772
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,920
we'd need to test a new sample.

773
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,488
Biopsy the latest recurrence.

774
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:51,012
In 1991,
technology only allowed us

775
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:53,841
to analyze the tumor's tissue.

776
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:56,365
Today, we're able to dissect
its molecular structure.

777
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,585
Identification will be exact.

778
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,891
Even so,
I might still have cancer.

779
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,067

780
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,417

Was hoping you'd say that.

882
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,978
So the thing is,
the program, it's on the table,

883
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:06,240
but it's stuck there.

884
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,502
Lots of training
needed for police,

885
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:09,678
but not enough
training resources.

886
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:11,027
I don't know
the time commitment,

887
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:13,813
and I can only imagine
that the bureaucracy

888
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,902
will be infuriating--
I'm in.

889
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:22,300
That was easy.

890
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,790
Oh, excuse me.
Just grabbing a snack.

891
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,096
Taking five, I hope?

892
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:38,228
More like a 30-second
breather.

893
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:40,709
But, since I've been caught,

894
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:42,189
I guess I have
four and a half minutes to go.

You okay?

896
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:50,980
Yeah.

897
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,852
No.

898
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:55,028
My aortic patient.

899
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,552
His procedure was a success,
I just--

900
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,685
I wasn't able to see it
all the way through.

901
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:01,687
Got benched
by the powers that be.

Yeah.

that was inappropriate.

Don't worry.
Okay. Cool.

911
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:26,276
I have to go, uh, check
on some test results, so, uh.

912

Uh, Dr. Hammer, Maggie,
I just--I need a minute.

913
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:36,199
Sure.

914

That's gonna sting for a bit.
She'll be okay.

I, um--

I made a fool of myself
for Dr. Marcel.

The doctors' lounge?

921
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:08,406
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm crushing on my advisor?

00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:11,278
Seriously, I'm a cliché.

923

Kind of. Welcome to the club.

For real? You?
Yeah.

My Crockett was
Dr. Andrew Jacobson.

Well, I'm sure
you handled it

better than I did.

928

If only.

Would have spared me
a lot of heartache.

Instead I married him.

Oh, I didn't even know
that you were married.

932

I'm not, no.
Didn't work out.
