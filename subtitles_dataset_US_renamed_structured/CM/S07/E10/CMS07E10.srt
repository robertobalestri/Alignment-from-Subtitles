1
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:05,396
.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,224
- Merry Christmas.

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:09,705
- What happened,
that was just for fun.

4
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,403
- I'm sorry for the stress
that I caused you

5
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,492
for wanting you here.
- I understand why you did it.

6
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,364
You had a daughter
and you wanted to meet her.

7
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:19,019
Maggie Lockwood
is my biological mother.

8
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,499
- For every Vas-COM catheter
the hospital ordered,

9
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,240
Dr. Cooper
received a percentage.

10
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:25,242
- I mean isn't this
kinda like kickbacks?

11
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:26,722
It's illegal.

12
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:29,333
- We can go to the FBI now.
- The board does not feel

13
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,205
that is in the hospital's
best interests.

14
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:33,163
- Matthew Cooper,

15
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:34,686
Jessa Rinaldi,
you're under arrest.

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,689
- Any and all fallout
lands on me.

17
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,041
- Believe me, Sharon,
there will be fallout.

18
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:44,522
- There she is.

19
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,220
- Sharon Goodwin.

20
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:48,004
Dr. Matthew Cooper
is out on bail.

21
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,919
Vasik Lab
is denying any knowledge

22
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,529
of the alleged fraud schemes.

23
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:53,357
- That it was the work
of their rep, Jessa Rinaldi.

24
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,837
Government even have a case?

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,186
- Listen, I have no comment.

26
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,406
- There are reports
of impending civil actions

27
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,669
from families and patients
affected by the Vas-COM.

28
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:01,757
- You've been named
in any of these suits?

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,193
- I said no comment.
- Excuse me.

30
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:04,890
Excuse me for a second.
Excuse me.

31
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:06,066
- Thanks.

32
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,850
- Yes...

33
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:11,810
I use--used the Vas-COM

34
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:14,552
for cardiac monitoring
on some patients.

35
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,337
- Eleanor Holt, now deceased,

36
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,948
was one of those patients?

37
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:20,558
- Yes.
- The hospital uses

38
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:22,778
multiple cardiac monitoring
devices, correct?

39
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:23,909
- Yes.

40
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:25,694
- Still you opted
for the Vas-COM?

41
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:27,870
- It was promoted
as a better option

42
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:29,219
than the competing devices.

43
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:32,179
It was getting talked up
a lot by other doctors.

44
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,442
- Anyone in particular?

45
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:37,097
- I've only been at Med
a few months.

46
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,274
I know some faces
but not many names.

47
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:43,233
- Was one of those faces
Dr. Will Halstead?

48
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,628
Why don't we come back
to that question?

49
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:49,805
I've already gotten a statement
from Dr. Halstead.

50
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,728
- How's that 15 minutes
going for you?

51
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,947
- What? Of fame?
That was the last thing

52
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:04,820
I was thinking about
when I called the FBI.

53
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:08,911
And now
all that hoopla out there.

54
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:11,740
I'm worried
about the hospital, Daniel.

55
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:15,265
The feds are seizing files,
computers.

56
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,268
They're interviewing
board members and staff.

57
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:20,749
- Look, it's a little crazy
right now, okay?

58
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,664
But the dust
will settle, you know?

59
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,100
It always does.

60
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,276
- Sharon.

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,887
Just heard an interesting fact.

62
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:32,195
It turns out whistleblowers
are entitled to a reward.

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,155
Six, even seven figures.

64
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,417
How 'bout that?

65
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,683
- Always a pleasure, Roger.

66
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,251
- You got the chart?
You up to speed?

67
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,340
- Yeah. Lawrence Givens, 50,

68
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:47,689
end-stage renal disease.

69
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:50,039
No longer tolerating
hemodialysis.

70
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,823
Grafts keep clotting.

71
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:54,217
But he only has one kidney
to begin with.

72
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,307
- Yeah. He donated the other
to his father 25 years ago.

73
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:59,048
He also has kidney disease.

74
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:00,745
Turns out it's a genetic issue.

75
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:04,096
Autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease.

76
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,272
Lawrence has it too.

77
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,230
- Yet the doctor
still took his kidney.

78
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:08,449
They missed it.

79
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:09,711
Either a misdiagnosis

80
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:12,279
or the screening
didn't pick it up.

81
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,585
- Oh, man.

82
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,848
Chart says Lawrence has a son.

83
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:18,328
- Luke, he's 19.

84
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:19,547
He hasn't been tested

85
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,897
to see if he also
has polycystic kidneys.

86
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,986
- Okay, so if he doesn't
have the disease,

87
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,292
he could be a possible donor.

88
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,163
- I've thought about
testing him a few times

89
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,599
and always shied away.

90
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,253
- Why?

91
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:35,084
- It's complicated.

92
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:38,392
Hi, Luke. It's Dr. Blake.

93
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,394
- You remember Dr. Blake,
don't you?

94
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,352
She's helping
fix Daddy's kidney.

95
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:45,355
- I want to help too.

96
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:49,664
- I know you do. I know you do.

97
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,231
- It's good to see you again,
Luke.

98
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,884
This is Dr. Marcel.

99
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,887
- Hey, Luke.
Pleasure to meet you.

100
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,020
- Luke, honey,

101
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:00,283
let's let the doctor
speak with your dad.

102
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,676
Come on.

103
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,287
All right, there we go.

104
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,334
Okay?

105
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:10,859
- Look, I can hold out.

106
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,556
I know there's
a donor somewhere.

107
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,428
I mean, I've gotta be on top
of the transplant list.

108
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,648
- You are
but time is running out.

109
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,564
I think we should consider Luke
as a possible donor now.

110
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,392
At least test
for polycystic disease,

111
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:23,959
make sure he doesn't have it.

112
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,091
- I want to be with Daddy.
He needs my help.

113
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,571
- We're gonna help him.

114
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:31,706
-  I don't know.

115
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:34,099
- You need a new kidney,
Lawrence.

116
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:35,579
And I truly believe
that Luke is your best,

117
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:38,365
and possibly,
last chance to get one.

118
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,285
- Okay.

119
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:03,912
.

120
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,914
- Luke wants to help
his father.

121
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:07,263
I can get behind that.
- Believe me,

122
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,786
I want to also
but his developmental ability--

123
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,918
I mean what are we talking
about here?

124
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:10,919
- Look, it's not ideal,

125
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:12,573
but we don't have
a better move.

126
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:15,097
And Luke needs his dad.

127
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,707
I've known Lawrence
for a long time now

128
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,361
and Luke is always
his first concern

129
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,102
and he gave us the okay.

130
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,201
- Okay.

131
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:33,594
So we're on
safe ground legally.

132
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,291
What about morally?

133
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,901
- All right.

134
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,947
I'll take it
to the ethics committee.

135
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,341
Get their opinion.

136
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,430
- Negative CT
and clinically improved

137
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,649
for the patient in five.
He can be discharged.

138
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,956
Want me to put it through?
- I've got it. It's okay.

139
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:51,176
A flu in two and
dislocated shoulder in seven.

140
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,703
- Can't believe you're her mom.

141
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:57,095
How'd you keep that so quiet?

142
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,228
- Easy, I didn't tell you.

143
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,447
- Ha.

144
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,842
So...who's the dad?

145
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,278
- Why don't you turn over five?

146
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,631
- Good morning, Will.

147
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:11,936
Oh, hey.

148
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,460
Another article
in the Trib this morning

149
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,940
about your takedown
of corporate greed, yeah?

150
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,812
- Yeah. My email's blowing up.

151
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,640
- Well then, I guess
you won't be needing this, huh?

152
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:20,989
I thought you might want
to cut out the article

153
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,817
and use it in your--
your scrapbook,

154
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,296
you know,
put it on your trophy display?

155
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,037
- I didn't do it
for the accolades, Dean.

156
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,648
- Hey, um, I got your back
on this one.

157
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,998
I mean, you--you went
out on a limb for justice

158
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,782
and you won. Proud of you.

159
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,349
Truly.

160
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,048
- Spent the morning with feds

161
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,486
and they wanna talk again soon.

162
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,052
Thank you very much.

163
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:43,403
- Hey, I'm sorry, Stevie.

164
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,666
Really. I didn't--I didn't mean
for you get caught up in this.

165
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:48,059
- Then why didn't you read me
in on what was going on?

166
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:51,193
Especially when it came
to Eleanor Holt.

167
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,281
If I'd known what you knew,

168
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:53,891
I might have treated
her differently.

169
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,763
- Halstead, Hammer, you're up.
You're going to treatment 3.

170
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,547
Chart's in your tablet.

171
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:05,250
- Mr. Sanon, I'm Dr. Halston.
This is Dr. Hammer.

172
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,208
- Hi.

173
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,644
So I can see you got a bum arm

174
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,777
and a lump on the head.
What happened?

175
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,909
- Um, he doesn't speak English.

176
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:14,042
I'm his son, Emmanuel.

177
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,004
- Okay.

178
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:22,703
He says he's okay
with me doing the talking.

179
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,095
- Great. French?

180
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:25,270
- Haitian Creole.

181
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:26,576
I've been in the U.S.
a few years.

182
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,013
My father was finally
able to join me.

183
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,102
He got out this past summer.

184
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:36,325
- So, Emmanuel, what happened?

185
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,980
- Last couple of months,
he's been a little off.

186
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:41,417
Dizziness, confusion.

187
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,246
But Chicago moves a lot faster
than rural Haiti.

188
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,553
- Yeah. Culture shock
must be staggering.

189
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:49,033
- Yeah. That's why
I didn't think much of it.

190
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:52,080
But recently
he's been clumsy too.

191
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:53,429
Today, he missed a step

192
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,865
like he didn't know
where it was,

193
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,258
fell down the stairs.

194
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,129
- Lungs are good,
heart seemed normal

195
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:00,349
but can't rule out
a syncopal episode.

196
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:03,657
- Let's get a chest X-ray,
a 12-lead EKG, cardiac labs,

197
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,355
CBC, BMP, and a head CT.

198
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,707
- Um, he is asking
if his fiancée, Fabienne,

199
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,013
can come to the hospital?

200
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:14,798
- Of course, yeah.
Give the nurse her number.

201
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:17,148
- Okay. Merci.

202
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,759
- You're welcome.

203
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,717
- We'll check back soon.

204
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,593
- How you holding up?

205
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:30,292
- Uh...been better.

206
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,902
Put colleagues
in an uncomfortable spot.

207
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,035
Not what I wanted.
- I hear that.

208
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,081
FBI speak to you yet?
- Yeah.

209
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,518
Told me you made it very clear

210
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,258
that I was working
on your behalf.

211
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:42,957
- I did because it's true.

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,437
We're gonna get through this.

213
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,665
- Peter, really?

214
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,493
Shutting me out
of budget meetings?

215
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,973
- Well, the board
can't fire you.

216
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:00,322
You're the hero.

217
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,585
- And this is their plan
to put me in purgatory?

218
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,195
- What do you expect?
There's stink

219
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,328
all over Med right now. We're
getting hammered

220
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:08,417
by the press,
donors are fleeing,

221
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,288
doctors are getting poached
by other hospitals.

222
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,116
Had three more
resignations today.

223
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,509
These are department
heads, Sharon.

224
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,207
- Silencing me is not
gonna clean up their mess.

225
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,514
- I suspect the board
knows that.

226
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,646
- Suspect?

227
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,822
Look,

228
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,867
as a Sharon Goodwin ally,
I'm out of the loop.

229
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:27,044
But if I had a guess,
they're gonna come at you.

230
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,090
And I doubt it's gonna be
from head-on.

231
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,578
- What'd they say?
- The ethics committee's

232
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,668
comfortable with moving ahead
with Luke as a possible donor.

233
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:42,582
Look, do the tests.

234
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,713
See if he's even a candidate,

235
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:45,497
then we'll go from there.

236
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,158
- Sharon Goodwin?

237
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,682
- Yes.

238
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,640
- Randall Shentu.

239
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,773
- Can I help you
with something?

240
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,732
- Oh, I assumed
you'd be expecting me.

241
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,560
Nobody told you?

242
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,736
- Why don't we talk
in my office?

243
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:14,439
"The Shentu Group,
health care consultancy?"

244
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:18,052
- We provide hospitals
with practical guidance

245
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:21,708
to navigate the ever-evolving
healthcare landscape,

246
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:25,363
whether it be regulatory,
operational, fiscal,

247
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,452
or reputational management.

248
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:30,455
- You got a lot going on
after your name.

249
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:35,112
President, CEO, MD, JD.

250
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,201
Impressive.

251
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,160
Why are you here, Mr. Shentu?

252
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,381
- Board told me
you don't mess around.

253
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,168
They've brought me on
to help Med

254
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:50,693
through this challenging time.

255
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:54,436
To establish a culture
of transparency with vendors,

256
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,786
device companies, reps,

257
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,135
and especially patients.

258
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,746
- You mean Med's business

259
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,923
shouldn't happen
behind closed doors?

260
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:04,707
- Exactly. Well said.

261
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,100
- I hope so.

262
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:07,710
It's been my mission at Med

263
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:11,671
since I started here
as a nurse 35 years ago.

264
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:15,805
- I'm sorry.
I meant no disrespect.

265
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,808
And I need to acknowledge
your leadership.

266
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,724
Exposing Dr. Cooper's
abuse of the Vas-COM

267
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,466
was brave, admirable.

268
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:27,251
I'm not here
to be an obstructionist,

269
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:30,994
but right now Med's in trouble.

270
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:33,214
And, uh, if it gets worse,

271
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:36,347
ultimately, it'll be
the patients that suffer.

272
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:41,135
I don't want that.

273
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:43,572
- Then we have something
in common.

274
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:45,835
- Mm.

275
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,882
- I'm gonna take you
at your word.

276
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,187
- That's all I can ask for.

277
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,493
Thank you.

278
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,321
I look forward
to working together.

279
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,366
- It was nice to meet you,
Mr.--

280
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,760
sorry, Dr. Shentu.

281
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,936
- Randall. Please.

282
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,331
One more thing.

283
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,595
An ED resident upstaged Santa

284
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:10,164
to announce that the ED
charge nurse was her mother?

285
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,818
Do I have that right?

286
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:15,343
- Dr. Vanessa Taylor
and Maggie Lockwood.

287
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:18,172
- Wow, talk about left field.

288
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:20,522
Can only imagine your surprise.

289
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:28,051
.

290
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:30,010
- Hey, Luke.

291
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:33,361
I'm Dr. Marcel. We met earlier.

292
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:35,667
Luke, I'm gonna take
some blood from your arm.

293
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,800
Gonna feel a little pinch,

294
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,715
but before you know it,
we'll be all done, okay?

295
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,195
- Where's my daddy?

296
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,806
- He's in his treatment room
right across the way.

297
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,200
- I see him.

298
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:47,549
Sleeping.

299
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,421
- That's right.

300
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,162
- He's tired, honey.

301
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,773
- I don't wanna be here.
- It's okay.

302
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:56,645
- I understand. Ready to do it?

303
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:58,255
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,302
- Okay, Luke.
Can I see your arm?

305
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,870
Here you go, bud.
I'm just gonna...

306
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,524
roll your sleeve up, all right?
- Don't wanna.

307
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,918
- We're almost there.

308
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,485
- Cold.
- I know.

309
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,922
I'll pull it right down
when I'm done, okay?

310
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,794
Okay, this is a tourniquet.

311
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,448
- No. Tight. It hurts.
Take it off.

312
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,928
- I can't do that quite yet,
all right?

313
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,103
Just hang in there
for me, okay?

314
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,757
- I don't like it. It's cold.

315
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,846
- Okay.

316
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,195
- What's that?

317
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,371
- This is just a wipe
to clean your arm.

318
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,896
That's it. That's it.

319
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,769
Just hang in there
for me, okay?

320
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,905
- No shot! No shot!
I don't want a shot!

321
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:41,124
Daddy!
- Right, need a hand?

322
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,648
- No, no. Shutting it down.
That's it. We're done.

323
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:44,867
All right, bud. We're done.

324
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,956
- I want my daddy.
- Okay, all right.

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,046
- Daddy!
- Come on, sweetie. Come on.

326
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,788
- Saw your patient's chart.

327
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,182
Wasn't that his best shot
at a kidney?

328
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,228
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

329
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,795
You got a plan B?

330
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,841
- No.

331
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,106
- Take a deep breath
for me, Claudia.

332
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,415
Can you tell me what happened?

333
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,895
- I was in class.

334
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:14,418
I couldn't really concentrate.

335
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:17,421
And my teacher let me
go to the water fountain.

336
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:18,858
- Okay.

337
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,250
Bilateral breath sounds,
heart's good,

338
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,078
regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs.

339
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:23,558
- I was really thirsty

340
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,647
but when I leaned over
to get a drink,

341
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,127
I just got really dizzy

342
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,390
and I fell and hit my head.

343
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,871
- Did you lose consciousness?
- I don't know.

344
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,437
I just remember
sitting on the floor

345
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:36,310
with the school counselor,
Ms. Jones.

346
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:39,879
- BNP, CBC, bolus a liter
of saline and a 12-lead EKG.

347
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,532
- Is my mom coming?

348
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,317
- I called her, no answer.

349
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,492
I left a message.

350
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,015
- We'll keep trying
your mom, Claudia.

351
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,626
Be right back.

352
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,932
- She okay?

353
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,368
- Gonna run some tests
but all signs

354
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:53,109
just point to Claudia
being dehydrated.

355
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:55,242
- Oh, that's a relief.

356
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,634
I've been worried
about her lately.

357
00:14:56,678 --> 00:15:00,073
Her grades have slipped,
absences have gone up.

358
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:02,031
I tried reaching out
to her mom.

359
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:04,947
We've been looking for a time
to sit down.

360
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,427
This is Claudia's backpack.

361
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,560
I know I shouldn't have
looked inside but I did.

362
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,955
Found this.

363
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,305
What are they?
- Furosemide.

364
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:16,393
It's a diuretic.

365
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:17,829
It's sometimes used
as a diet pill

366
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,657
to lose water weight.

367
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,137
"Sarah Rey?"

368
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:23,270
- Claudia's mother.

369
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,970
- Anel's cardiac labs
and EKG were normal

370
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,450
so unlikely he blacked out.

371
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,582
X-ray of his arm showed
a distal radius fracture.

372
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:34,368
Page ortho.
Should be down soon to cast it.

373
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:35,543
Is that his CT?

374
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,154
- Not good.
Check out the hippocampus.

375
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:41,027
- Diminished in size,
significant atrophy,

376
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,854
but there's no evidence
of a bleed or stroke.

377
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,334
- No.

378
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,294
Makes me think
it could be Alzheimer's.

379
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,600
Could explain the confusion
and the visual-spatial issues.

380
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:52,516
- Yeah, but Anel's only 45.

381
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,866
- Yeah, he might be
one of the 5 to 6%

382
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,217
that develops symptoms early.

383
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,349
Tell ortho to hold off
on casting the arm.

384
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:02,222
Let's get
a neuro consult first.

385
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,833
- Scott, need extra hands.

386
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,313
- Keith Varig,
35-year-old male,

387
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,054
unrestrained driver,
high-speed MVC.

388
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:11,709
GCS 8, BP 100/60,
heart rate 124,

389
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,842
grossly deformed left femur,
intubated in the ambo.

390
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:15,713
Apparently, a truck kicked up
a rock on the Eisenhower,

391
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:16,976
flew across the divider,

392
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,455
smacked through
this guy's windshield,

393
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,891
hit him in the head and
sent him right off the road.

394
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,023
- Or somebody's got it in
for him.

395
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,025
All right, come on. Let's go.

396
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,462
All right.
Transfer on my count.

397
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:27,769
One, two, three.

398
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:30,380
Watch his bag. All right, good.

399
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:35,037
- Multiple lacerations
to the face, neck, and arms.

400
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:36,908
Likely closed femur fracture.

401
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:39,955
- Belly's distended. I do not
like the way it feels either.

402
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,349
Quick fast, please.

403
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:45,047
- Bilateral breath sounds.

404
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,006
Kathleen, let's set up
for a chest X-ray.

405
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,008
- Free fluid
all over the belly.

406
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,445
Heavy internal bleeding.
Vitals?

407
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:55,579
- BPs dropping 90/55.
Heart rate's on the rise, 136.

408
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,146
- Let's trigger the MTP.

409
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,583
2 units blood,
2 units plasma, stat.

410
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:00,758
- Clear.

411
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:01,977
X-ray up.

412
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,068
- Wow. Chest X-ray's clean.

413
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,983
Lungs up, no hemothoraces.

414
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,593
- Yeah, lucky us.
One less crisis.

415
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:11,073
This guy's still
trying to die though.

416
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,248
Okay, Hank, call the O.R.

417
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:13,554
Tell 'em we're coming up.

418
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,686
Come on.
Let's move, people. Let's go.

419
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:20,082
- Look, my feeling just because
the ethics committee says

420
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,041
we can use Luke as a donor

421
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,868
doesn't mean we have to.

422
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,479
- So there's another option?

423
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:27,785
- It's not a great option
but yes.

424
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,136
Peritoneal dialysis, PD.

425
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,094
It's a slower type of dialysis,

426
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,009
puts less strain
on the vascular system.

427
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,228
- Slower.

428
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,664
- Well, given your
clotting issues

429
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,057
from regular hemodialysis,

430
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,928
PD's the next best alternative

431
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,582
until the kidney
becomes available.

432
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,195
Doesn't sound too pleasant.

433
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,807
- It's not but it buys time...

434
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,636
to keep working
that transplant list, right?

435
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:02,864
- This, uh, this PD, it--

436
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:05,519
it won't involve Luke?

437
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:06,694
Ever?

438
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,696
- No.

439
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,265
- Then let's do it.

440
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:19,794
- Sharon.
- Yeah?

441
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:21,317
- I just got a call from HR.

442
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,363
They're asking me about
my relationship with Vanessa.

443
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,799
What's this is all about?

444
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,627
- Randall Shentu.
- Who?

445
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,282
- Compliance officer
the board brought in.

446
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,547
- You think they're gonna
call Vanessa in too?

447
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,722
- I imagine so.

448
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,724
- We were finally getting
to a good place.

449
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,205
- I'm sorry, Maggie.

450
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:49,650
- Here. Is that better?

451
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,173
- Uh, sure.

452
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,524
- I'm sorry. Lawrence.
I know it's uncomfortable, man.

453
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:55,873
- Dr. Marcel?
- Yeah.

454
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:57,484
- Speak outside?

455
00:18:57,527 --> 00:19:00,008
- Yeah.

456
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:02,141
I'll be right back.

457
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,884
- Peritoneal dialysis.
- Yeah.

458
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:09,191
- He's dying, Crockett.

459
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,714
We had a path towards
possibly saving him

460
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:11,889
and you've blown that up.

461
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,543
- Luke couldn't handle
the blood draw.

462
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,328
What happens
when it's time for surgery?

463
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:16,546
That'd be torture.

464
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,592
- We could help Luke
with his anxiety.

465
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,202
- What? Sedate him
because we're inconvenienced

466
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,073
by his emotions?
That's not a solution.

467
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:25,207
- Neither is PD.
It's a stopgap at best.

468
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,253
Transplant organs
don't grow on trees.

469
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,384
Sometimes we have
to go get them.

470
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:31,082
- Yeah, well, not like this.

471
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,432
And Lawrence agrees.

472
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:35,826
- Well, you better hope
that decision

473
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,263
doesn't cost him his life.

474
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:45,184
.

475
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:48,143
- Is everything okay?

476
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:52,408
- He's asking about
a prescription

477
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,845
for him and his fiancée,
Fabienne,

478
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,500
for their, um, wedding night.

479
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:59,023
- Oh.

480
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,764
- Uh...

481
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,680
how about we talk
about that later?

482
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:06,988
- Merci.
- Okay?

483
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,080
Um, what did
the neurologist say?

484
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:15,910
- It's his opinion
and ours as well

485
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:19,740
that your father likely
has early-onset Alzheimer's.

486
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:24,353
- Okay.

487
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,269
Wow.

488
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:28,662
Um...

489
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:41,327
- Okay.

490
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,938
- Um, so...

491
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:48,116
how long until he's not
him anymore?

492
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,248
- Hard to say.

493
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,597
Likely a few years

494
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,686
but maybe more,

495
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:53,948
maybe less.

496
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,210
- There are medications.

497
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,734
One, Donepezil,
we'd like to start today.

498
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:00,955
And going forward, neurology
will devise a treatment plan.

499
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,218
- But there's no cure?

500
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,133
- No.

501
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,309
I'm sorry.

502
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:08,963
With Alzheimer's,

503
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:11,095
the best that we can do
is slow it down.

504
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:18,625
- He's asking
about his fiancée?

505
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:19,974
The nurse reached her.

506
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,758
She'll be here soon.

507
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,243
Merci.

508
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:35,294
- Vitals had been stable
but now BP's crashing.

509
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,949
Down to 94/60.
Heart rate's rising 130.

510
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:42,388
- He's bleeding again. A lot.

511
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,867
- 2 blood, 2 plasma stat.

512
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:46,174
Re-trigger the MTP.
Call the O.R.

513
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:48,394
We're going back in.
We'll reintubate there.

514
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:52,485
- Am I gonna die?

515
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:54,008
- Your injuries are severe.

516
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,358
You sustained
incredible trauma.

517
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:57,925
I've already
had to take your spleen

518
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,970
and a good deal
of your small intestine.

519
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:01,494
You're still
bleeding internally.

520
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:04,453
I'm sorry to be so blunt-- -
No, I get it.

521
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:05,933
My family,

522
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:08,109
my parents, my sisters,
they're in Minnesota.

523
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:11,373
- Yeah, I called 'em.
They're on the way.

524
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,462
- His family, how long
until they get here?

525
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,681
- They're three hours away.

526
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:17,248
- Call 'em back.
They need to drive faster.

527
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,948
- But you knew Vanessa Taylor
was your daughter

528
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:22,384
before you visited her

529
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,691
at the medical school's
residency fair, correct?

530
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,040
- Yes.

531
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,390
But I spoke to many other
students that day,

532
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,044
not just Dr. Taylor.

533
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:31,219
- How many of those students

534
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,090
are now employed
by the hospital?

535
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:37,399
- None.
- Which makes it appear

536
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:38,879
as if you had
an ulterior motive

537
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:41,229
when you visited the fair
in the first place.

538
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:44,014
- I wanted to meet my daughter.

539
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:45,581
But I had nothing to do
with her being hired

540
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,583
by this hospital.

541
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:50,064
She earned this
on her own merit.

542
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,413
- But that's not
the issue right now.

543
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,284
We're talking
about appearances.

544
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:57,941
- Claudia Rey, 13,
in the eighth grade,

545
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,378
treating her for dehydration.

546
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:02,250
CT confirmed that her
head injury was superficial.

547
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:05,384
But, look,
I could use your help.

548
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,037
- Tell me.

549
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:09,866
- I don't want to call DCFS.

550
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,390
- Okay.

551
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,696
- Claudia passed out
because she was using diuretic

552
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,133
as diet pills,
mom's prescription.

553
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:18,397
She says mom
gave 'em to her but

554
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,790
I just don't know
if that's true or not.

555
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,226
- Where is mom anyway?

556
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,271
- Still trying to get
ahold of her.

557
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:25,229
Three calls, three voicemails.

558
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,448
- Yeah.

559
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,494
Daughter in the hospital,
no sign of mom.

560
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:29,973
I mean, it's not a great look.

561
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,453
- I mean, notifying them
might be protocol,

562
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:35,588
but once that ball
gets rolling, it's--

563
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,285
look, I just want to get
mom's side of the story

564
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:38,982
before I start something
that I can't undo.

565
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:40,941
- I get it. I mean,
you really wanna be sure

566
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,638
before you make that call.

567
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,771
- Yeah. Okay.

568
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,599
Uh, I'm gonna keep trying mom.

569
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:49,253
And once she arrives,
do you mind talking to her?

570
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,473
- Why don't we talk to
her together?

571
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,003
- Okay, Keith.

572
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,049
Let me scrub in and then
we're gonna get started.

573
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,009
- I'm finally gonna
get what I deserve.

574
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,666
Ten years ago,

575
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,495
I was at a bar.

576
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:16,324
I was drunk.

577
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,501
A guy hit on me.

578
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,809
I saw red.

579
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:24,419
I punched him

580
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,465
and I walked away.

581
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:31,339
Later, I found out
that when he fell,

582
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:34,429
he hit his head.

583
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,040
He died.

584
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:40,522
No one knew it was me

585
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,611
so I didn't tell.

586
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:49,096
I murdered a man.

587
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:51,881
And now it's time to pay.

588
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,884
A life for a life.

589
00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,498
- Everything all right?

590
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:02,457
- Yeah, yeah.

591
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,894
- Pushing meds,
20 of etomidate.

592
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:09,769
- Oh, fun.

593
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:12,336
Got another morning meeting
with the feds tomorrow.

594
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,990
- Dr. Halstead, Dr. Hammer,

595
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,905
I think something's up.

596
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:18,517
I was just in Mr. Sanon's
treatment room.

597
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,301
Overheard him
with this fiancée.

598
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:23,304
I speak French so it's not
a one-to-one to Haitian Creole,

599
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:25,219
but I'm pretty sure
he was explaining

600
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:26,960
that his son said the fall

601
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:29,049
was just a balance issue.

602
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:31,573
That meds called
Donepezil will take care of it.

603
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,662
- Emmanuel didn't tell
his father.

604
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,403
- Yeah, looks that way.

605
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:37,013
- Nancy, do you know
where Emmanuel is?

606
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,667
- Waiting room.

607
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,630
- I didn't tell him
and I'm not going to.

608
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:46,545
- Emmanuel,

609
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,981
I know Alzheimer's
was not the news

610
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:49,765
that you were expecting today.

611
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:50,897
I'm so sorry.

612
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,202
But lying to your father
is just--

613
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:55,031
- I'm protecting him.

614
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,337
You can't understand.

615
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,121
In Haiti, all my father knew

616
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:01,908
was poverty, hardship, and war.

617
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:06,260
But now there's freedom,
joy, love.

618
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:09,089
He finally
has everything to live for.

619
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,178
And I won't take that from him.

620
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:14,050
- Emmanuel,
the disease will progress

621
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,791
so you--you can't keep it
a secret forever anyway.

622
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:17,706
- Why not?

623
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,014
Let my father live
a few years in ignorant bliss.

624
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:22,624
When the time does come,

625
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:27,411
he won't even remember
this day happened.

626
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,326
Please.

627
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:38,292
- No. No way.

628
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,641
Anel should be
the one to decide

629
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,164
what's best for his life,

630
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,601
especially when there's
a time clock on it.

631
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,951
- When the truth
may do more harm than good,

632
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:48,215
therapeutic privilege gives us
some leeway to hold back info.

633
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,782
I mean, plus I imagine

634
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,959
Emmanuel knows his father
better than anyone.

635
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:54,482
We should consider his opinion.

636
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:57,267
- Is it his opinion or yours?

637
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:58,791
Seems these days,
you're the one who's in charge

638
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:02,098
of what people should
or rather shouldn't know.

639
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:12,631
.

640
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,242
- Fabienne doesn't know either,
does she?

641
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:17,548
Keeping the diagnosis secret
affects her life too.

642
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:19,115
- I'm doing
what I think is right.

643
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,377
- Okay, Emmanuel,

644
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:21,509
I get that you want to preserve

645
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:23,119
your father's happiness

646
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:25,165
but he and Fabienne
are engaged.

647
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,862
She needs to know
her future may not be

648
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:29,473
what she's envisioning.

649
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,519
Please tell her.

650
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,523
- So Claudia's gonna be okay?

651
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,917
- Yes. Her latest labs
came back normal.

652
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,222
Small bruise on her forehead

653
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,703
but she's now hydrated
and feeling much better.

654
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:43,923
- I had my cell in my pocket,
but I was on shift.

655
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:45,141
There's a strict phone policy.

656
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:46,708
I didn't know
it was the hospital.

657
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:49,668
- Don't worry about it.
We, um, we found you

658
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,801
and you're here
and that's what's important.

659
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:56,675
- Um, Claudia told me
that you gave these to her.

660
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:05,205
- I've struggled with my weight
my entire life.

661
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,511
I was raised on fast food
and huge portions.

662
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:09,209
And before I knew it,

663
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,864
I was raising Claudia
the same way.

664
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:14,649
I tried to break the cycle
with lean recipes,

665
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,781
meal prep, organic,

666
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:18,566
but I--I work two jobs

667
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,002
and can barely make rent.

668
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:22,178
Eating right
takes planning and money.

669
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:24,267
- Must be frustrating
feeling like,

670
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:26,443
you know, all those--
all those healthy options

671
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:29,925
are not available to you.

672
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:33,059
So could you tell us
about the pills?

673
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,802
- I found them on the internet.

674
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,674
I was just trying
to get to spring

675
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,589
and nicer weather
so we could walk again.

676
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,460
- Right.

677
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,332
- I've been Claudia,

678
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,203
the overweight teenager,

679
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:48,378
and kids can be cruel,

680
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:50,032
especially when you get
to high school

681
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:52,556
and I just wanted to spare her
that pain but I'm failing.

682
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,037
- No, I don't see that.

683
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:56,560
I see a mom

684
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,780
who's doing the best
that she can.

685
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,956
- You know, we have
a couple of excellent

686
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,566
educational programs
here at the hospital.

687
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,746
The one I'm thinking about,
Exercise and Nutrition,

688
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,052
both online and in-person.

689
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,141
Is that something you think
you might be interested in?

690
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,316
- Yes. Thank you.

691
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,884
- I can put together
some info for you.

692
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,407
- Can I go back
and be with Claudia now?

693
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,279
- Yeah, of course.

694
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:21,368
It was very nice
to meet you, Ms. Rey.

695
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:28,854
- So, holding off on DCFS,

696
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:30,681
that was the right call.

697
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:33,423
- Mothers and daughters have
been on my mind a lot lately.

698
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:36,644
- Well, came in handy today.

699
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:39,995
Good work, Doctor. Keep it up.

700
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,128
- Thanks.

701
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:50,005
- Fabienne?

702
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,877
Hi.

703
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,227
I'm Doctor Hammer.

704
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:59,188
I'm hoping Emmanuel told you
about Anel's diagnosis?

705
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,755
- Yes.

706
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,453
It was a shock.

707
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:07,457
- I understand.

708
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,285
I want to respect your space

709
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:13,550
and I apologize
for overstepping...

710
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:18,338
but Emmanuel has chosen
not to tell his father.

711
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,688
How do you feel about that?

712
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:25,258
- Conflicted.

713
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,347
I love Anel.

714
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,697
Keeping a secret from him
is not the way

715
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,481
I want to begin our marriage,

716
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:37,661
but I agree with Emmanuel
that he doesn't need to know.

717
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:41,796
- Oh. Really?

718
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,755
- Anel is reunited
with his son.

719
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,889
His world, at last,
is at peace.

720
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,022
Telling him it's only
a fleeting moment

721
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:54,417
will destroy him
far faster than the disease.

722
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:58,073
That's not the marriage
I want either.

723
00:30:58,117 --> 00:31:01,860
I support Emmanuel's decision.

724
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:05,254
- But he's made it
for both of you.

725
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:06,342
That's not fair.

726
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:08,649
- It won't be easy,
I understand,

727
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:12,044
but I'm prepared.

728
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,221
- In our culture,

729
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:18,398
nothing is more important
than family.

730
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:23,794
Emmanuel knows this because
his father instilled it in him.

731
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:27,494
What's not fair,
even more than the diagnosis,

732
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:34,066
is that Anel will never know
what Emmanuel is doing for him.

733
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:38,026
He would be proud of his son.

734
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,603
- The damage was extensive.

735
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:53,215
It was a very difficult
surgery.

736
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:58,699
We couldn't awaken Keith
after the surgery and...

737
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,048
we gave him a CT,

738
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,920
found that he had suffered
a hemorrhagic stroke

739
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:04,574
while he was on the table.

740
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:07,229
- He's not gonna wake up?

741
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,797
- There are no
brainstem reflexes.

742
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,452
Neurology will run
an apnea test to confirm

743
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:17,718
but the stroke was massive
and catastrophic.

744
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:19,763
- Keith's gone?

745
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,809
- I'm very sorry.

746
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:28,424
- Keith spoke to me
before he went under.

747
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:31,645
- What did he say?

748
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:35,649
- Well, he said...

749
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,042
that if he were to die,

750
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:39,479
he would want his organs
to be donated.

751
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:44,049
- Yes.

752
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,485
Yes, we'll donate.

753
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,621
- Um...

754
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:53,972
if you'd like to spend
some time with Keith.

755
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,201
- Damn, man.

756
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:09,030
That's what he was saying?

757
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:11,598
- His exact words:

758
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:13,513
"a life for a life."

759
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,743
- Well, my plan B
isn't working.

760
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:29,268
- Well then, new plan.

761
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:31,139
Got a patient on life support,

762
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:32,793
no chance of recovery,

763
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:34,447
blood type O-neg.

764
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,145
Kidneys being HLA tested
right now.

765
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:40,018
Here are the preliminary
numbers.

766
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,324
The family's agreed
to direct organ donation.

767
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:45,893
If the kidney matches
your patient, it's yours.

768
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:47,808
- Yeah, I think this'll work.

769
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:49,418
- Okay.

770
00:33:58,558 --> 00:33:58,775
.

771
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,473
- Look, I should've
run PD by you

772
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:01,952
before making the switch.

773
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:03,737
You're right.
It was a Hail Mary

774
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,087
and it could've ended badly.

775
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:08,481
I get it if after today you
want to drop me from your team.

776
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:10,309
- Not drop you, Crockett,

777
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,311
strangle you.

778
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:13,877
- Mm.

779
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,271
- The truth is
I believe in you.

780
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,882
Hell, I even like you.

781
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:21,276
Maybe that's because
you piss me off.

782
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,322
- Thank you.

783
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:24,845
I guess.

784
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,325
- Look,
I'm not opposed to you

785
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:28,979
wearing your heart
on your sleeve,

786
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:31,765
but you and I are strongest
when we work together,

787
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,462
got it?

788
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:36,204
- Got it.

789
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:37,901
And I like you too.

790
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,601
- Let's go save
Lawrence's life.

791
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:49,783
- Vanessa.

792
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,393
I've been looking for you.

793
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:55,745
- Sorry,
I'm just taking a moment.

794
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:02,839
- I had to sit down
with HR today.

795
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:08,280
They're digging into

796
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:14,460
how I met you and ultimately
how you ended up in Med.

797
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:17,289
I'm so sorry.

798
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:20,727
I keep on getting in the way.

799
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,425
I never wanted
to be a distraction.

800
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:27,429
But over and over, that's--

801
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:32,217
that's what I've been.

802
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,219
Anyway, uh,

803
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:37,265
they're probably
gonna reach out.

804
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:40,138
- I don't care.

805
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,835
Let HR call.

806
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:46,274
- You're not upset?

807
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:48,058
- You know, when--

808
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:52,280
when I first started at Med, I
was just--

809
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:54,674
I was just so intimidated.

810
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:57,416
The early hours,
the ten-year binder,

811
00:35:57,459 --> 00:36:01,420
the...Adderall, that was--

812
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:04,640
that was just me trying
not to feel like an imposter.

813
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:07,252
Like I belong.

814
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:10,255
But I know now I do belong.

815
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:12,605
And I wouldn't have figured
that out if it weren't for you.

816
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:15,608
All you've been is supportive.

817
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:20,265
- I don't know what to say.

818
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:22,571
- You don't have
to say anything.

819
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:28,751
Just know that I am so grateful

820
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:31,319
that you're in my life.

821
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:34,540
I don't care who knows.

822
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:40,763
- You know,
when I went to the FBI,

823
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:44,289
I really thought I was
doing right by this hospital.

824
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,116
And now, I don't know.

825
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,161
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.

826
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,250
For what it's worth,
I, for one,

827
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,818
am absolutely positive
that you did the right thing.

828
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,472
- I appreciate that.

829
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:55,604
- So positive in fact,

830
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,302
that I am gonna take you out

831
00:36:57,345 --> 00:37:00,696
for an incredibly expensive
dinner right now.

832
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:05,266
Let's go.

833
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,849
- Just so you know,

834
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,894
the Vas-COM business,
sneaking around,

835
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,853
playing nice with the enemy,
it sucked,

836
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,464
but I needed
to protect patients.

837
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:31,684
I had to help.

838
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,860
And if I had to do it again,
I would.

839
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:36,428
So I'm sorry
I didn't fill you in.

840
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:38,038
I wish I could have.

841
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:41,171
- No, you were doing
what you thought was right.

842
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:42,956
Yeah, I get that now.

843
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,267
- So we're cool?
- Yeah, we're cool.

844
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,833
Um, hey.

845
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:53,923
The device rep, Jessa,

846
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:57,449
did you sleep with her to get
the information you needed?

847
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:59,364
- No.

848
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:01,148
Absolutely not.

849
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:02,584
- Good.

850
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,687
- Congratulations.

851
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:20,776
Another W.

852
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,996
- Thanks to your
11th-hour heroics.

853
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:27,957
You saved us
from an impossible choice.

854
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:31,918
Deus Ex Machina.

855
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:36,444
- Dues--
oh, "god from the machine."

856
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:42,885
I like that.

857
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,670
Goodnight, Pamela.

858
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:47,063
- Night, Dean.

859
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:55,550
- Crockett.

860
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:58,118
- Avery, hey.
What? Another follow-up?

861
00:38:58,161 --> 00:39:00,033
- No, I'm working here
just like you.

862
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:01,774
- Oh.
- My firm's been meeting

863
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:03,776
with patients and families
affected by the Vas-COM.

864
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,821
- Oh, that's right.
Well, you got a case?

865
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:07,562
- Oh, yeah. Good one.

866
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:08,911
- Nice.
- Speaking of,

867
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:11,566
my mom filled me in
on your big win.

868
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,438
- Ah.
- Way to kick ass.

869
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:15,570
- You say so.

870
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:18,573
- Are you refusing to
pat yourself on the back, huh?

871
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:21,054
That's pretty sexy.

872
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:23,230
What do you say,
dinner then my place?

873
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:26,102
- Oh, not tonight.

874
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,277
- Yeah.

875
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:28,496
Yeah, sure. I get it.

876
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,542
Single in the city.
I know how it works.

877
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,195
- Yeah.

878
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:36,678
- Well, okay.

879
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:38,376
I'll see you around.

880
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:41,074
- Yeah, see you around.

881
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:48,255
- So what are you thinking?

882
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:49,299
- I don't know.

883
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:51,824
The duck, gnocchi,

884
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:53,129
Spanish octopus.

885
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:56,872
- Mm, you got
a tough decision to make.

886
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,657
Me on the other hand,
I have no such issue.

887
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,745
- The Wagyu strip.

888
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:02,443
- How'd you know?

889
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:09,450
What about the--
the tasting menu?

890
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,017
- Ms. Cooper.

891
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,235
I'm actually glad
I ran into you.

892
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:13,846
There's something
I've been wanting to say.

893
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:15,848
- I'm not interested.

894
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,287
- You come at me
as hard as you want, okay?

895
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,636
It doesn't matter.
- Come on.

896
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,159
- I'm gonna win.
You're gonna lose.

897
00:40:23,203 --> 00:40:24,509
- This is neither
the time or the place,

898
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:25,510
all right?
- That's it.

899
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:27,860
Enjoy your dinner.
