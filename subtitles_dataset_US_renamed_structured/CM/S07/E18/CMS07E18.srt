.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,180
- We need
an experienced attending.

3
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:07,616
She's the one.

4
00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:09,052
- Good news--your drug test
came back negative.

5
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:10,314
Plan on doing it again
next week.

6
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,012
- Ms. Goodwin said it was
just pro forma.

7
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:14,840
- It's my E.D., not hers.

8
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:17,060
- The spinal fusion--it'll
require at least two months

9
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:18,496
of rehab post-op.

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,021
- We'll welcome you back
whenever you're ready.

11
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,152
- Milena.

12
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:23,762
I gotta assume
that's your cover.

13
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:26,765
What's your real name?
- When the case is over.

14
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,028
- How'd you find me?

15
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,507
- I'm resourceful
when I need to be.

16
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,249
- This could be dangerous.
- I'm okay with dangerous.

17
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,741
- You headin' out?

18
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:48,744
- Less eyes the better.

19
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,922
- You all right?

20
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:55,707
We can't keep this up.

21
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,448
But...

22
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:00,843
as long as we're careful...

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,722
- At least let me make you
some coffee or something, huh?

24
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,420
- Make it to go?

25
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,349
- Hey, Milena, your alarm.

26
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:44,234
- Hey, do you have
a toothbrush I could--

27
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,106
- What is this?

28
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,110
- What are you doing
with my bag?

29
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:52,460
- You didn't answer
the question.

30
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:59,771
-  1505 funds.

31
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:02,209
Department issued flash money,
all right?

32
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:05,168
So I can front like I wanna
make a purchase if I need to.

33
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,866
- Yeah, there's at least
50K or more in that bag.

34
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,261
- Yeah, these aren't corner
boys slinging nickel bags.

35
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:13,220
You know,
these people move weight.

36
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:17,441
Look, it's--
it's on the up and up,

37
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:20,183
if that's
what you're wondering.

38
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,146
You know what?
I don't need this.

39
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:29,540
- Dang it, Milena, wait.

40
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:30,802
Mile--

42
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,816
- Uh-uh!

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,515
You're not supposed to be here
until next week.

44
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,561
- I know.
That was the strategy.

45
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:51,649
- Did you know about this?

46
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,303
- No,
I swore Archer to secrecy.

47
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,349
I don't want anyone
making a fuss.

48
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,524

Put security on high alert?
- Yeah, she's harmless.

53
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:14,672
- Oh, boy. Yeah.
Well, seriously, welcome back.

54
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,196
- Thanks for holding
things down for me

55
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,545
while I was out of commission.

My brother in arms.
- Hey, forget about it.

57
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,594
Uh, matter of fact,
if you want a few weeks

58
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,683
to settle back in
and hit your stride,

59
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm more than happy
to stay on as chief

60
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:29,513
till the end of next month.

61
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:30,775
- Thanks,
but you don't have to do that.

you know?

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,735
Take your time.
I got your back.

64
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,087
- It's moving, Daniel.
- Can I?

65
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,481
- Yeah, yeah.
Constant movement all the time.

66
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:42,657
- Oh, my God.

67
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,745
When your mom told me
you were comin' in,

68
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,660
I just had to see
this bump in 3D.

69
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:48,053
- I know.
She looks great, doesn't she?

70
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,881
- Well, she makes it look easy.

71
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,883
- That's what it is, right?
Just like you did.

72
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:54,408
- Look, I'll never forget
the night you were born.

73
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,453
I was working
what was supposed to be

74
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:59,761
my last shift at the hospital--
- I know, Ma.

75
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:01,545
You told me this story
a million times.

76
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:06,333
- No, but instead, my water
broke on my lunch break,

77
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:10,685
and you landed earthside
just about 8:00 p.m.

78
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,426

79
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,384

I gotta get back upstairs.

80
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:15,603
But thank you so much
for letting me

81
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:16,995
crash your time with your mom.

82
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,258
It's great to see you, Tara.

83
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,911
- See you later, Daniel.

84
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,523
You know, I was glad I went
into labor at a hospital,

85
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:25,917
given what a difficult delivery
it ended up being.

86
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,659
- I haven't changed my mind
about a home birth,

87
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:30,922
and I'm not going to.
This is what I want.

88
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,402
- I know that, Tara.

89
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:35,318
- I know that this is all
a bit unconventional--

90
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,754
using a sperm donor,

91
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:38,930
choosing
to have a kid on my own,

92
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,845
and now, home birth--

93
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,847
- Are you okay?

94
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,936
- I'm fine.
It's probably just gas.

95
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,289
My point is these were all
very considered

96
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,682
and well-thought-out choices.

97
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,294
- And I'm not
implying otherwise.

98
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:58,472
But unexpected things happen
when you go into labor.

99
00:04:58,515 --> 00:04:59,951
- I know that,
and I'm prepared.

100

Let's just drop it, okay?

101

- Did your doctor
determine why?

When did you doctor find it?

- Oh, Tara.

00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,086
You should've told me.

Nothing on the right.

chest x-ray goin'.

- ]Sup with the clown suit,
sis? You workin' this case?

157

- Oh.

- Clear.

159
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,262
- Right hemopneumothorax.
- He needs a chest tube.

160
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:19,874
I got it.
Curly, set me up.

162
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,617

Good news--the assailant
was a real genius.

164
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:27,447
Left the weapon behind.

165
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,885
Semi-automatic rifle.
- Was Gavin the only one?

166
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:33,757

out of town for the weekend.

- Submucosal fibroid looks like
it's degenerating.

170

- And becoming necrotic.

171
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:49,556
Putting Tara at high risk for
pre-term labor and sepsis.

172

All right, let's load her up
with 100 of indomethacin

and we'll start triples, yeah?

174
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,737
- But the fibroid
has also grown

175
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,608
since Tara's last ultrasound.

176
00:07:58,652 --> 00:07:59,783
If this trend continues,

177
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,350
it'll lead to
fetal growth restriction.

178
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,525
- Well, yeah,
there's a good chance of that,

179
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,658
but that's a conversation
for another day.

180
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,616
- Well, I think
that's a conversation

181
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,096
we need to have
with Tara right now.

182
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,271
- Well, why?

183
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,577
We can't do anything
for the fetus

184
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,492
except watch and wait.

185
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,409
- Hey, what about a myomectomy?

186
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,586
- For a pregnant person?
Are you out of your mind?

187
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,675
The possibilities of
hemorrhaging are too great.

188
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,372
- We can give Tara
TXA during surgery,

189
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:24,678
help minimize with blood loss.

190
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,462
- All right, so
you're suggesting that we risk

191
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,986
Mom's life to save the fetus?
- That is not true.

192
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,553
A myomectomy will also help

193
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:33,295
prevent against sepsis
and organ damage in Mom.

194
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,166
Look, I know
it's an unorthodox approach.

195
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,777
I get that.
- That's an understatement.

196
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,562
- By all means, share your
reservations with Tara.

197
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,521
But she deserves to know
all her options.

198
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:48,440
- I said no!
No, no hospital!

199
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,051
- Ma'am, lie back, please.

200
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,662

struck by a motor vehicle,

201
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,664

- Whoa, easy, easy.

206

We have to check you out.

207
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,981
All right,
let's transfer on my count.

208
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,156
Everybody ready?

209

One, two, three.

210
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,509
- No, I have to leave.
Let me go.

211
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,164

- Ma'am, please.

212
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:17,644
Take a deep breath.
- No.

213

- Okay?
- I can't--I can't be here.

214

Pupils equal and reactive.

What's going on?

217
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,047
I promise
we'll take care of you.

218
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:36,097
- I--I'm not a citizen.
I don't have papers.

219
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,578

no one here's gonna report you.

00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,405
Okay? You're safe.

221
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,364
Can you tell us your name?
- No, no.

222
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:45,541
I don't want it in computer.
- We'll keep you anonymous

223
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,456
in the system.
But what should we call you?

224
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,808
- Lia.

225
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,462

- Okay, Lia, I'm gonna check

226
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,116

Ow! Aah!

229
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,121
- All right,

- Also chest and pelvis x-rays,
CT head and c-spine.

This is Dr. Marcel.

Is he...

238

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,419
- Yeah,
lots of toys and snacks.

240

- I can take them.
- Okay.

Go with the nice lady, kids.
We'll be by soon.

pseudo-stable at the moment,

244

his chest tube
is still putting out blood.

245

- Oh, my God.

246
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:57,439

gonna have to open up his chest

the bleeding's coming from.

I should've let him come
along with you and the kids.

250

If I had--
- Krystal, stop.

251
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,410
If he has to have surgery,
will he be okay?

252
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:17,764
- Um...your husband
arrested in the field.

253
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,723
Paramedics don't know how long
his brain went without oxygen.

254
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,464
- We won't know
until Gavin wakes up

255
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:25,336
whether he suffered
any cognitive impairments.

256
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,730
- You mean like
he might not be able to talk?

257
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:30,951
Or feed himself?

258
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,866
- That is a possibility, yes.

want to live like that.

We've talked about
this type of thing.

Well, not this, but...

you know, if something were
to happen to either of us...

if Gavin's heart

264
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,711
would've stopped beating again,

265
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,713
you don't believe
he'd wanna be resuscitated?

266
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,071
- Did he put that
in writing somewhere?

267
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,900
- No, he just told me so.

268
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,295
Said he wouldn't
want to be a burden.

269
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,254

With your husband unconscious,

00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:17,737
you can make decisions
on his behalf.

272
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,393
- You know, we can note in
Gavin's chart that he's a DNR,

273
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,613
meaning no life-saving measures
will be performed

274
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,876

I think she's in shock
or something.

282
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,996
- We see that a lot.
Give her some time.

283
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,348
- Gavin's a gambler--
bankrupted the family.

I've been writing Darlene

Radiology won't commit, though.

With her so antsy to leave,

safest bet might be

345
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,694
they'd have to remove
your uterus--

346
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,523
- I understand that.
- Look, I know you're worried

347
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:03,310
about the baby, but you cannot
jeopardize your own health.

348

with the surgery.

351

- Tara--
- I'm sorry, Mom,

352
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:13,102
but either support my decision,
or just go.

353
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,067
- How's Gavin?
He awake yet?

354
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,894
- Not yet.
We're transfusing him,

355
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,418
but he's still bleeding.

356
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,159
- There's still a chance
things will turn around though.

357
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,944
Any leads on that rifle?
- Yeah, actually.

358
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,294
Gun's registered to Gavin.

359
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,993
He must've confronted
the offender, struggle ensued,

360
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,690
the intruder
got ahold of the weapon--

361

- I didn't see
any defensive wounds on Gavin.

362

- Nope, nothing.

363
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,003
- Maybe he didn't confront
the person.

364
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,744
Maybe it was a surprise attack.
They caught him off-guard.

someone close to him.

367

- You know, Gavin's wife

was stoic earlier.

369
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:58,147

Question for you:
flash money, right?

375
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:19,125

377
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:22,563
Probably like 10 Gs.

378

Small bills--
look like street money.

00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:53,780
- Well, I'm not.

517
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:55,695
So pack her
with warm moist laps,

518
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:59,525
and do not do anything else
until I get back.

519
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:03,398
- Where are you going?

520
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,358
I'll be right back.

521
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:14,540
.

522
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,064
- So you think the second
fibroid is parasitic?

523
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:19,153
- That's why it didn't
show up in the ultrasound.

524
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:20,937
It was hiding
behind the first one.

525
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,548
- What's your QBL so far?

526

a liter of blood at this point.

527

Now, Ms. Goodwin,

528
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:30,556
you are Tara's surrogate,
all right?

529
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,862
It's your call.
I recommend we close.

530
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,690
- And I would strongly urge
against it.

531
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,171
I've seen worse cases
in my training, and if we don't

532
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:39,521
remove those fibroids,
I fear Tara will become septic.

533
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:42,002
- Which is why we continue her
on antibiotics.

534
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,351
- She's already
under and responding well

535
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:46,049
to the anesthesia.
We've made the incision.

536
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:49,749
Both Tara and her baby are
gonna be so much better off

537
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:52,229
if we just proceed.

538
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,146
- It's too risky.

539
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,758
Close her up.
- Very well.

540
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:00,542
- I'm sorry, but no.

541
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,893
I'm sorry.
I don't feel comfortable

542
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,547
just abandoning
my patient's wishes...

543
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,201

this is my daughter--

544
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:10,117
- When I see a clear path
forward.

545
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,989

I'll leave it up to you
to explain what the hell

549

you both were thinking
overriding Gavin's DNR.

550

- The DNR has only been
in place for a couple of hours.

551
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,791
- It's still legally binding.

552

I got some intel

It's a part of an on-going
police investigation.

555

forced to share it

If she did this,
and it looks like she did,

561
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:56,511
legally and morally, I couldn't

I wasn't just gonna

- Yeah,
your blood pressure dropped.

That's why
you're feeling dizzy.

571

Who canceled it?

- No, no.
I have to leave.

is a sign of internal bleeding.

Somebody better start talking.

582
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:00,009
- What's going on?
- The ethics committee

583
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:02,055
ruled in Dr. Asher's favor.

584
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:04,535
They're proceeding
with the surgery.

585
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,494
- Oh, well,
so what's your plan?

586
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:09,236
- I'm gonna urge them
to reconsider.

587

- You know
they're not gonna allow that.

588

- We'll see.
- Sharon.

589

- Daniel, please.
- Look.

590
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:16,635
You brought Dr. Asher back here
because you believe in her.

591
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,768
Right, her judgement,
her skill...

592
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:23,380
Now's the time for you
to trust that decision.

593
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,996
- Why didn't you read me
in from the start?

594
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,127
Were you just
never gonna tell me?

595
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:32,651
Discharge her
from under my nose?

596
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,092

exactly forthcoming.

597
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:42,878
You're treating her.
I know she's here,

598

and the last thing we need
is another FBI raid.

599
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,929
Did you know about this?
- No, he didn't, Dr. Shentu.

600

Neither did Maggie.

601
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,542
