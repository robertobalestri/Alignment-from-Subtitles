1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:06,641
<i>Today could become every day.</i>

2
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:08,014
<i>I'm here for a reason,</i>

3
00:00:08,146 --> 00:00:10,069
and it's not
to keep the status quo.

4
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,882
I've run this ED just
fine before you came here.

5
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:14,536
Are you worried
Goodwin's lost confidence

6
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:16,494
<i>in your ability to lead alone?</i>

7
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:19,410
- <i>You really care about her.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I do.</i>

8
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,759
What are you gonna do
when Jackson-Monroe

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,171
closes next week?

10
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:23,153
I don't know.

11
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:25,677
Beg someone to let me
finish my residency?

12
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,377
Sully and his boys followed
Pawel to a bar in Lincoln Park.

13
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:31,857
Cops don't care
about small-time stuff.

14
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:34,382
A witness just came forward
who puts you at the scene.

15
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:37,125
An arrest is not
out of the question.

16
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:40,779
Now, Jimmy,
this might tickle a bit,

17
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,979
so I need you to promise
not to giggle, OK?

18
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:44,701
- OK.
- OK.

19
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:47,308
Figured it must have fallen
on the floor when I didn't

20
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,700
see it under the pillow.

21
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:51,703
And got it.

22
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:53,444
Look at that.

23
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:54,837
Yes.

24
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,665
I think the tooth fairy
better give you a bonus

25
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,971
for this one.

26
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:08,677
Good morning.

27
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:11,114
Good morning.

28
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:13,073
Oh, that's nice.

29
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,639
I thought you were going home.

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,988
Mm-mm.

31
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:17,860
Someone needed to be on call.

32
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:20,210
What happened to Gephardt?

33
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:23,213
Caroline was let go.

34
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:25,085
As was Mia,

35
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:27,783
Sammy the day before.

36
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:31,569
Wow.

37
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:33,615
Goodwin's really
racking up the body count.

38
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:35,791
Yeah, at this point,
I'll just be happy to see

39
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:37,314
reinforcements arrive.

40
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:40,143
Well, that's assuming
you survive the cut.

41
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:43,146
The worst is over,
from what I hear.

42
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:44,279
Hmm.

43
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:47,143
We should do something
to celebrate.

44
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:49,891
Hmm, as long as it involves
climbing into my own bed

45
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,199
tonight, I'm up for anything.

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,116
Well, then maybe we
should get a head start.

47
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,963
What is it?

48
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,748
Goodwin.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,794
She wants to see me
in her office.

50
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:32,882
Hank, I'm so sorry.

51
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:40,116
- This is so brutal.
- I know.

52
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:43,288
I mean, how long have we been
working with Vicki and Hank?

53
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,816
They're all like family.

54
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:47,428
I feel like my insides
are being ripped out.

55
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,169
Yes, absolutely.

56
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,822
Me too.

57
00:02:50,823 --> 00:02:53,303
But I was talking about how
short-staffed we're gonna be.

58
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:54,783
Couldn't Ms. Goodwin
have waited

59
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:57,960
until after the Jackson-Monroe
people got onboarded?

60
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,992
You're unbelievable.

61
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:01,529
Mm, sometimes it is important

62
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,662
to make room for new blood.

63
00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:08,231
He looks awfully familiar,
doesn't he?

64
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:10,209
Yes, because he was here,
helping out

65
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:11,713
with the mass casualty
from the ferry last week.

66
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:14,324
No, no, that's not it.
Mm-mm.

67
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:16,587
- Mm.
- Morning, Maggie, Doris.

68
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:18,415
Good morning, Dr. Frost.

69
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,809
- For you.
- What's this?

70
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,114
It's a little thank-you
for getting

71
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:23,986
- my residency transferred.
- Oh.

72
00:03:23,987 --> 00:03:26,249
I know you put in a good word
with the powers that be, so...

73
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,511
Well, don't make me regret it.

74
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:29,383
You have a patient in 6.

75
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:31,515
Parents think
that he has a broken rib.

76
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:33,169
All right,
let's see what we got.

77
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,867
Mm-hmm.

78
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:39,741
All right,
does this hurt when I touch it?

79
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:41,482
- A little.
- Little bit?

80
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:42,918
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

81
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,267
I got elbowed pretty good

82
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:45,703
going up for a header
in the box the other day.

83
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:47,618
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have
a word with your coach

84
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,490
about how hard they're
letting you guys practice.

85
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:52,188
Please, I don't want
any more special treatment.

86
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:55,670
I missed all of last season
'cause of the surgery.

87
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,411
The Ewing's sarcoma
they removed.

88
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:59,543
Max had a graft done
on his femur.

89
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:02,024
They took some bone
from my forearm.

90
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,808
But good thing I don't
need that for soccer.

91
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,768
Well, I can see
from your chart here, Max,

92
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:08,596
that the cancer is in remission.

93
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:09,945
Yeah, he licked it.

94
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:11,076
Yeah, my son's a fighter.

95
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:12,295
I can tell.

96
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:13,296
What position do you play?

97
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:14,906
Center mid.

98
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:16,995
This guy Aidan took my number
10 jersey while I was out.

99
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:19,433
- Uh-oh.
- But that's cool.

100
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:21,261
I'm gonna win it back before
regionals next month.

101
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,306
Kid's got a one-track mind.

102
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:24,916
Well, let's see what Mike
here can show us, all right?

103
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:26,876
Joe, Gina, please.

104
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:31,271
X-ray.

105
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:38,103
Well, Max, I'm not seeing
any rib fractures here,

106
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:41,498
but sometimes we just can't
catch those on a plain X-ray.

107
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,413
So if it's OK with you all,

108
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:46,329
I'd like to do a CT scan
for a closer look.

109
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,462
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, we got time.

110
00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:50,507
- I'll check back in a bit.
- Thanks.

111
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:54,076
- Hey, Maggie?
- Yeah?

112
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:56,121
Can we get this young man
a chest CT

113
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:57,166
as soon as we can, please?

114
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,602
Roger that.

115
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:02,737
And loop in oncology
to take a look as well.

116
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:04,782
Yeah.

117
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,451
Dr. Ripley.

118
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm sure you're wondering

119
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,933
why I've summoned you here
this morning.

120
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,848
Please have a seat.

121
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,938
It's come
to the hospital's attention

122
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,114
that a new witness
has come forward

123
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:35,160
placing you at the scene
of Pawel Wapniarski's

124
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:36,640
aggravated battery.

125
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,773
I've already talked
to the police about it.

126
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:41,428
Well, now we'd like
for you to speak with us.

127
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:43,647
We've scheduled
a committee hearing

128
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:46,694
later today so you could
tell your side of the story.

129
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:49,218
Here is the official notice.

130
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,704
You thought
you were being fired.

131
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,009
It did cross my mind.

132
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,838
Well, I assure you,
Dr. Ripley,

133
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,840
that the outcome of this hearing

134
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,800
could have a far more damaging
effect on your career

135
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:08,193
than simply being laid off.

136
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:12,415
If the committee is not
satisfied with your account,

137
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,765
you could very well
be suspended,

138
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,377
your license
to practice medicine

139
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,422
in jeopardy of being revoked.

140
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:21,468
For being suspected
of roughing up

141
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:23,034
a known scam artist?

142
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:26,386
For being suspected
of retaliating against someone

143
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,866
who sued you for malpractice.

144
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:32,435
Look, I suggest you take
the rest of the morning off

145
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:34,263
to think about
what you're going to say.

146
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,215
Hey, uh, Mitch just got
summoned to see Goodwin.

147
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,409
OK.

148
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,845
He's not getting fired, is he?

149
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:50,324
Well, why are you asking me?

150
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:52,483
Because you're
the chief of the ED.

151
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:53,937
Cochief now, apparently.

152
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:55,460
And no, I don't know
anything about that.

153
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:57,625
I mean, it's not like Goodwin is

154
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,564
keeping me in the loop lately.

155
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:01,335
You've navigated

156
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:03,120
choppier waters than this, Dean.

157
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:05,644
I have faith you'll manage.

158
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,742
Fresh pot of coffee
if you're interested.

159
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,781
I already had one
this morning, thanks.

160
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:12,303
I was wondering if you
had time to look over

161
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:14,174
the memo I emailed last night.

162
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,002
The one that arrived
at 10:43?

163
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,178
Can't say I did.

164
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,137
I compiled some data regarding

165
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:22,574
our door-to-doctor times
and other throughput metrics,

166
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,054
and I took the liberty
of drawing up

167
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:25,708
a proposal
on how we might divvy up

168
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,492
the management of operations.

169
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:28,841
It goes into
considerable detail...

170
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,364
Oh, I know.

171
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:33,106
Crashed my hard drive,
the file was so big.

172
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:35,152
It's understandable

173
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:38,242
that you're resistant
to change, Dean,

174
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:41,027
but it's only going to hinder
your ability moving forward.

175
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,507
No, actually,
I'm fine with change.

176
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:45,379
I even came up with an idea
on that very front myself.

177
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,165
I have one that fits
on a Post-it note.

178
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,123
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.

179
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:52,125
We each take half the ED.

180
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:55,215
I handle trauma.
You run emergency medicine.

181
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:57,391
It's a clean division
of labor, right,

182
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:59,916
so you staying in your lane,
me staying in mine.

183
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,483
I'm not sure
that's going to work.

184
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:02,832
Ah, sure, it will.
Just give it a chance.

185
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,050
- Hey.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,182
Naomi's intaking
a patient out there,

187
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:06,400
and she needs one of you
to supervise.

188
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:07,793
What brought the patient in?

189
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:10,100
Fell off an obstacle course,
banged up her ankle.

190
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:13,278
Guess that's me.
See? Simple.

191
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,541
Well, I'm afraid, Cadet Herrera,

192
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:20,414
that your ankle is, in fact,
fractured and dislocated.

193
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:23,722
Good news is, I can reduce
and splint it for you.

194
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:25,245
Thank you, sir.

195
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:27,944
But what is most concerning
for me is why you fell.

196
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:29,249
Student Doctor Howard
tells me that you

197
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,381
reported that you fainted?

198
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:32,252
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah?

199
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:33,602
Has this ever happen
to you before?

200
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:34,994
No, sir.

201
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,996
All right, can you
lean forward for me, please?

202
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:38,607
Take a deep breath.

203
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:40,173
Did you get an EKG yet?

204
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:43,089
Sinus rhythm, normal rate,
but she's got PVCs.

205
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,352
O2 sats at 93, trending down.

206
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:47,137
Cadet Herrera passed
her yearly physical

207
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:49,182
just last month
with flying colors.

208
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:50,532
I'd feel a lot better
if there was something

209
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,142
in your history
to explain the dizziness

210
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:53,578
and shortness of breath.

211
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,102
Now, you attend Illinois West,
is that correct?

212
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,495
Yes, sir.

213
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,367
IW had a rep as
a party school back in my day.

214
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:02,108
Any chance you might be
nursing a hangover?

215
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,197
No, sir.
I don't use alcohol.

216
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:06,460
How about other
recreational drugs?

217
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:08,462
The ROTC unit under my command

218
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:11,814
is routinely drug tested,
including just this morning.

219
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:14,425
If Cadet Herrera had been using,

220
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:15,774
she'd have already
lost her scholarship.

221
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,602
OK, well,
I'm glad we can rule that out.

222
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:20,997
All right, let's grab
a CBC, CMP, BNP, and a UA.

223
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:23,216
And I'll be back in a little
bit to take care of that ankle.

224
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,002
Thank you, sir.

225
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:28,744
Wait, so that's your plan,
to say nothing?

226
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:30,310
It's the Physician
Wellness Committee.

227
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:32,443
It's not like I'm facing
a congressional subpoena.

228
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:35,402
Is this Sully's idea,
you stonewalling?

229
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,666
No, I haven't... I haven't
spoken with him about this.

230
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:38,797
Mitch, that's...

231
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:40,016
Hannah, he has enough
on his plate

232
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:42,061
with the cancer, his new baby.

233
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:43,410
OK, you really think
that if Sully knew

234
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:44,586
that you could lose your license

235
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:46,936
that he'd let you
take the fall for him?

236
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:53,029
OK, if I'm gonna do this,

237
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,379
I will need to speak
with him first.

238
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,424
OK, look, I'm needed downstairs.

239
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,731
But...

240
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,647
if Sully's as good
of a friend as you say he is,

241
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,519
he will understand.

242
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:10,046
Kendall.
I'm Dr. Asher.

243
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,091
I understand you suffered
a bit of a spill.

244
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:14,006
She fell down a flight of stairs

245
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:15,704
in our apartment building.

246
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:17,488
Seems like her wrist
took the worst of it.

247
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:19,142
- OK, may I?
- Mm.

248
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,623
OK.

249
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:23,712
My baby, is she gonna be OK?

250
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:25,757
I noticed a spot of blood
in my underwear.

251
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,846
The fetal monitor is showing
a healthy heartbeat,

252
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:29,500
so that's a positive sign.

253
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,676
But I would love
to do an ultrasound

254
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:32,808
just to make sure, OK?

255
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:35,158
OK?
Of course it's OK.

256
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,507
Why wouldn't I want
an ultrasound?

257
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:39,553
You should be aware
we suffered a miscarriage

258
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:42,034
a couple years ago,
later even than this.

259
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,209
May I ask what happened?

260
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,211
I lost the baby.

261
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,560
What more do you want me to say?

262
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:49,172
We don't really like
to talk about it.

263
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:51,217
I understand.

264
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,743
OK.

265
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:58,398
So how far along are you?

266
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,009
About 21 weeks?

267
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,185
22.

268
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,230
All right.

269
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,580
I know you gave her
a bit of a jostle,

270
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:09,583
but I am not seeing
any placental eruption.

271
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:11,150
Wait, something's wrong
with the placenta?

272
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:13,239
No, no, no, no, no.
The opposite.

273
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,632
This is good news.

274
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,200
Honey, it's OK.

275
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:18,505
- Baby's OK.
- You know what?

276
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:20,116
Why don't we
get that wrist X-rayed

277
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:21,987
and make sure
everything's OK there too?

278
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:24,903
OK, I'll be right back.

279
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,776
Hey, listen.

280
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:28,994
Sorry for my wife.

281
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:30,430
That's totally not like her.

282
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,258
I mean, she got in a big fight
with her sister

283
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,130
just before the accident,
so she was all worked up.

284
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:35,435
No need to apologize.

285
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:36,828
I'm sure she had
quite the scare.

286
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,702
Well, she seems
a bit confused still.

287
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:43,269
Is it possible she hit her head?

288
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,968
You know, we can
check on that as well.

289
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:47,056
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,109
"Trim the fat, Sharon,"
the board says,

291
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,243
like I'm some kind of butcher.

292
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:03,159
This is the hardest week
I've ever had here.

293
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,509
No one's holding you to blame.

294
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,382
Well, the doorjamb on my
office tells a different story.

295
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,910
It'll be OK.

296
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:18,348
I'll catch up with you later.

297
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:25,398
Oh, hey.

298
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,704
Did I hear correctly that, like,

299
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,488
all of a sudden,
Ripley's being called

300
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,360
in front of
the Wellness Committee today?

301
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:33,972
You know, maybe we should
discuss this in private.

302
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:37,933
I'm telling you, I am becoming

303
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:41,066
genuinely concerned
that Mitch might be

304
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:43,547
getting railroaded, really.

305
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:46,811
Well, you know
what concerns me, Daniel?

306
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:50,684
Someone that I consider
a close personal friend

307
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:53,426
failed to notify me that
the hospital may have hired

308
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:57,082
a doctor that he knows
has a history

309
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,345
of violent and erratic behavior.

310
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,694
Sharon, he's a patient of mine.

311
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,044
You know I can't talk
about that stuff.

312
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:05,830
All I'm saying is that
you could have found a way

313
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,746
to warn me
about some of his red flags

314
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,359
without overstepping
any ethical boundaries.

315
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:16,014
You know what?
You're right.

316
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:18,974
I could have, and I apologize.

317
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,673
But if you're curious
about why I've been defending

318
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:24,980
this guy, Sharon, it's 'cause
I think I failed him back then.

319
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:28,853
I just can't shake the feeling
that this Mitch

320
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:31,856
simply isn't capable of doing
what he's being accused of.

321
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:33,292
I truly hope not.

322
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:38,689
But listen,
I need you to recuse yourself

323
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,387
from this hearing,
all things considered.

324
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,477
Honestly, I'm relieved.

325
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:51,658
Hey, Dan?
Hi, sorry to interrupt.

326
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:54,139
I have a patient who came in
behaving erratically.

327
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,620
I thought it might have been
due to a fall that she took,

328
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:58,578
but imaging came back negative,

329
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:00,885
so I pulled her medical records.

330
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:03,583
And she's been prescribed
an antipsychotic

331
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,455
for the past 15 years.

332
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:07,457
Do you think it could have
stopped working?

333
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:12,157
- Excuse me, Dr. Archer.
- Yeah.

334
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:15,073
I have a patient in T5
with severe GI distress.

335
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:17,380
- Is it a trauma?
- No.

336
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,861
It's not my bailiwick anymore.

337
00:14:19,862 --> 00:14:20,819
She's your man.

338
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:28,260
Is it possible he ate something?

339
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:30,262
I don't think so.

340
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:32,656
Nothing I can point to.

341
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:35,354
We had breakfast at the
Cracker Barrel on the way in

342
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:39,097
to pick up a new F-250
Tyler bought for us.

343
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:41,491
Sorry, Mom.

344
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:43,362
You didn't even get to enjoy
the new-car smell.

345
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:45,060
Oh, please.

346
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:46,800
Can you believe this boy?

347
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:50,195
He almost single-handedly
saved the family farm.

348
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:51,631
Thought we were gonna have
to sell,

349
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:54,025
but then Tyler figured out a way

350
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,072
to increase the yields
on our sunflowers.

351
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:58,595
What happened here, Tyler?

352
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:02,468
Oh, I sliced up my hand picking

353
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,688
without gloves, stupidly,
a few days back.

354
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:06,255
Looks like you may have
burned it as well.

355
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,952
Oh, no.

356
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,823
Here it comes again.

357
00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:14,480
I can't remember
when I've seen him this sick.

358
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,830
Ms. Howard, any thoughts?

359
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:18,920
Uh, likely viral
gastroenteritis.

360
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,225
So what now?

361
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:24,490
We should get a CBC,
CMP, lipase, and a UA

362
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,753
and maybe start him
on Zofran and saline

363
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:27,929
to get him feeling better.

364
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,104
Very good.

365
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:30,453
Go put those orders in.

366
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:32,977
I need a hand in here!
She can't breathe!

367
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:37,851
Sats are down to 84.

368
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:39,288
Speak to me.
Can you speak to me?

369
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:40,332
Cadet Herrera?

370
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,507
All right, we need to intubate.

371
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,293
Push 20 of etomidate, 50 of roc.

372
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,214
I-I don't know
if this is gonna work.

373
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,302
Why?
What is it?

374
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:03,991
Hey.

375
00:16:04,268 --> 00:16:06,791
Lynne told me you're here
for a PET scan?

376
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:09,342
Just getting my results
from the last one.

377
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:11,491
I was gonna come bother you,
but I figured you were

378
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:14,451
busy saving lives
or whatever it is you do.

379
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,105
Mr. Sullivan,
we're ready for you now.

380
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:22,720
Hey, uh, how about
we grab lunch after?

381
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,243
Lunch?

382
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:28,856
Hmm, like cucumber sandwiches
and a glass of Chablis?

383
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,643
Yeah, or just street tacos, whatever.

384
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:34,732
Why does this sound serious?

385
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,736
I'll be out here
when you're done.

386
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:48,876
So what are you saying?

387
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,530
Our son is terminal?

388
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:53,403
The sarcoma, unfortunately,
has metastasized

389
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:55,666
throughout his body...

390
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:59,147
most concerningly,
Max's spine and lymph nodes.

391
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:02,760
What kind of timeline
are we talking about here?

392
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:04,544
I hate to hazard
these kinds of guesses.

393
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:08,461
Please, Doc, just...

394
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,289
just shoot straight with us.

395
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,466
Given this rate of progress,

396
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,381
Max has two, maybe three months.

397
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,865
No!

398
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:22,780
Oh.

399
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:26,000
There must be something you
can do to give us more time.

400
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,524
We could go in and debulk

401
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:30,222
the most aggressive tumor
in the spine.

402
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,181
That might buy Max
six months or so.

403
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,053
A-and you can do that today?

404
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,837
Yes.

405
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:40,406
But I have to warn you,
even if successful,

406
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,452
your son's quality of life
post-surgery

407
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:44,802
will be extremely compromised.

408
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:47,674
Max would be confined
to a wheelchair,

409
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:50,982
unable to play soccer
or even walk.

410
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,208
<i>I mean, falling down the stairs,</i>

411
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,906
it must have been terrifying.

412
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:03,560
Did you trip
over something or...

413
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,441
Yeah, I was late for work.

414
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:07,041
Did we not discuss this already?

415
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,695
Did we?
I'm sorry.

416
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,044
I definitely need
another cup of coffee.

417
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,527
Says here you're on
risperidone and...

418
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,007
- Uh-huh.
- Right.

419
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:18,444
Can I ask what that
was prescribed for?

420
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,751
I was diagnosed
with schizophrenia.

421
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:24,189
Back when she was in college,
way before we even met.

422
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,512
I know, it seems inconceivable
to me, the very idea.

423
00:18:28,537 --> 00:18:30,978
I don't think I know anyone
more sane than my wife.

424
00:18:31,372 --> 00:18:34,316
Hmm, well, it sounds like
it's been working well for you.

425
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:35,902
And how's your mood been
in general?

426
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:39,770
I mean, obviously, pregnancy
can be a bit of an adventure.

427
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:41,641
How so?

428
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:43,269
Do I understand correctly
that you got

429
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:45,332
into a heated argument
with your sister

430
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,410
right before the accident?

431
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,348
What?
No, I hadn't.

432
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:49,318
Did I get that wrong?

433
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:51,363
I mentioned earlier
to Dr. Asher

434
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:54,363
I heard you screaming
on the phone at someone, honey,

435
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:55,137
from the other room.

436
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:56,738
- Screaming?
- Yeah, something like,

437
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:59,201
"Stop talking to me like that."

438
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:02,009
I just assumed
it was your sister.

439
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,105
Oh, yeah, I rem...
yeah, I remember now.

440
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,449
I-I got a call from work,

441
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,629
and it was an emergency,

442
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:11,062
and that's why
I ran off when I did.

443
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,502
Do me a favor, would you?

444
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:19,496
Add a risperidone level
to Kendall's blood work.

445
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:20,988
What, you think
she stopped taking it?

446
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:21,855
Not necessarily.

447
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:25,668
But look, a lot more research
needs to happen,

448
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:26,879
but there is some data out there

449
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:29,012
linking it to increased risk
of miscarriage.

450
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,777
Risk is low in the first place,
but I don't know.

451
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,300
I guess there could be
a scenario

452
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:34,999
where she might have blamed it
for their earlier loss.

453
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,219
OK, but so you know,
it's been known to take the lab

454
00:19:38,472 --> 00:19:39,603
a few hours for that test.

455
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,803
Anything you can do
to buy some time

456
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:43,133
while we wait to get it back?

457
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:44,569
I can recommend
she be admitted overnight

458
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,137
for toco monitoring
to make sure the baby's OK.

459
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:48,616
Excellent idea.

460
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:51,837
We pushed the Zofran?

461
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:53,360
4 milligrams, yes.

462
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:55,972
BP's softer
than I was hoping for.

463
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:57,887
Tell me, Diedre,
do you keep any chickens

464
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,149
or ducks on your farm?

465
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,325
We got a brood of hens
for the eggs.

466
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,109
Why?

467
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,197
Avian flu.

468
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:05,808
I was thinking
the exact same thing

469
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,287
as soon as they said
they were farmers.

470
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,855
Why didn't you
say something earlier?

471
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,292
Assertiveness and confidence...

472
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:14,033
two critical qualities
for a doctor, Naomi,

473
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,643
especially for a woman.

474
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:16,949
If it doesn't come naturally,

475
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,168
keep practicing in the mirror
till it does.

476
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:20,257
- Prep nasal swab, H5N1.
- OK.

477
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:22,520
Thank you, Dr. Lenox.
I-I'll work on that.

478
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,000
Student Doctor Howard,

479
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:26,960
where are we at
with this patient's labs?

480
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:29,744
Pretty unremarkable,
to be honest.

481
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:32,182
No drugs in the urine
or the blood.

482
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:34,532
Higher-than-normal
levels of B3 and D,

483
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,273
but that can be explained
by the amount of time

484
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:37,752
she spends outdoors.

485
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:40,886
And her BNP levels aren't
indicative of heart failure.

486
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:43,280
Something's just not adding up.

487
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:45,238
Her tongue swelling up
suggests an extreme

488
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:47,066
anaphylactic response
to something, though, right?

489
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:49,025
Yeah, the question is, to what?

490
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:52,202
Push 0.3 milligrams epi IM,

491
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:55,596
125 milligrams SOLU-MEDROL IV,

492
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:57,555
and 50 of Benadryl.

493
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,470
And let's grab an echo

494
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:01,689
so we can rule out
any underlying cardiac issues.

495
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,952
OK.

496
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:05,606
Just remember,
all of this takes precedence

497
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:07,434
over some projectile vomiting,

498
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:09,916
regardless of what
Dr. Lenox may say.

499
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:13,527
Oof.

500
00:21:13,528 --> 00:21:15,443
The sarcoma's back?

501
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:18,706
I don't believe this.

502
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:21,579
Regionals are supposed to start
in a couple of weeks, Dad.

503
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,928
I...

504
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:25,061
I know it's not
what you were hoping to hear.

505
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:29,456
But hey, we... you know,
spoke with the doctors, and...

506
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:34,809
And they tell us that
with one more simple surgery,

507
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,943
they're confident...

508
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:41,077
you'll finally be cancer-free.

509
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:42,513
And there's a good chance
you might even

510
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:44,907
be ready for spring season.

511
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:55,004
I apologize for pulling you
away like this,

512
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:58,572
OK, and I-I know
how difficult it must be

513
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:00,226
to communicate these things
to your child.

514
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:02,185
But I-I guess I'm confused.

515
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,100
None of that was what
we discussed earlier...

516
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:05,666
the prognosis, the timeline.

517
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,408
Doc, I know.

518
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,454
Hey, we just decided,
after all he's been through,

519
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,543
we couldn't tell him
he was terminal.

520
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:14,501
I get that.
I do.

521
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:17,635
But you are overstating
his chance for recovery.

522
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,420
Doc, we just want
to keep his hopes up.

523
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:21,987
His hopes or yours?

524
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:28,124
This surgery is going
to constrain him physically

525
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,734
for the remainder of his life.

526
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:32,693
Max should know all the facts
before consenting.

527
00:22:32,694 --> 00:22:34,043
He deserves to know the truth.

528
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:37,524
We appreciate
your concern, Dr. Frost,

529
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:40,136
but this isn't something we're
really looking to discuss.

530
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:42,442
But you are grossly
misleading your child.

531
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:44,705
Our child,

532
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:46,055
not yours.

533
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:48,796
This is our decision to make.

534
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:57,153
And we're gonna need you
to refrain from discussing

535
00:22:57,154 --> 00:22:59,329
any of this with him.

536
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:23,470
Hey, Dan,
Kendall's labs came back.

537
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:25,243
No evidence
of risperidone in her system.

538
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,201
- Nothing?
- Mm-mm.

539
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:29,073
Could have weaned herself off

540
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,618
when she found out
she was pregnant.

541
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,093
How long might it take until
she shows signs of an episode?

542
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:34,034
Honestly, I think
that we're looking

543
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:35,320
at some early signs now.

544
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:36,664
Is it possible that an episode

545
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:38,400
could have led her
to falling down the stairs?

546
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:39,300
Sure.

547
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:40,772
Is there any way we can hold her

548
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:42,521
so she doesn't harm herself
or the baby?

549
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:45,349
Not taking her meds is
clearly a conscious decision,

550
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:46,568
right, not against the law.

551
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:48,309
I mean, unfortunately,
she hasn't said anything,

552
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,137
done anything
presumptive enough yet

553
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:51,747
for me to issue a hold.

554
00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:52,828
Yet.

555
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:55,839
I thought you two should know
Kendall is leaving AMA.

556
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:02,889
I am doing what needs
to be done to protect my baby.

557
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,325
Done.
End of story.

558
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:07,546
I completely understand
that it is tempting

559
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,983
to attribute the cause
of your miscarriage

560
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,419
to the meds you were taking.

561
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,812
Not to mention,
there are other meds

562
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:14,161
we could try with safer profiles

563
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,250
- right n...
- I'm fine, OK?

564
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:18,774
In fact, I'm not sure I need
to be on the medication at all.

565
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:21,603
I implore you,
please don't take this risk.

566
00:24:21,604 --> 00:24:24,519
Have I signed
everything I need to sign?

567
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,305
Just a couple more forms.

568
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:28,393
I can't find my phone.

569
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:29,481
Could you please
go grab it for me?

570
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:30,743
- Yes.
- And I will finish this up.

571
00:24:30,744 --> 00:24:31,745
Thank you.

572
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:38,707
Bryce, I need to level with you.

573
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,841
I'm becoming very concerned
that your wife could already

574
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:45,035
be well on her way to putting
herself and your child at risk.

575
00:24:45,348 --> 00:24:47,629
Dr. Charles, I think
you are overreacting.

576
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,893
She hasn't had an episode in
all the time you've known her?

577
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:51,590
That's a wonderful thing.

578
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,767
If and when Kendall starts
to experience symptoms again,

579
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:57,901
things could get
very challenging very quickly.

580
00:24:57,902 --> 00:24:59,250
How so?

581
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:01,905
That argument that you
overheard this morning,

582
00:25:01,906 --> 00:25:03,341
do you think
that there's a possibility

583
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:04,820
that she might not actually

584
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:06,692
have been on the phone
with anybody?

585
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:09,738
Then who was she talking to?

586
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:11,871
I'm just curious
if you can think of any detail

587
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:15,092
that might lead you
to believe that...

588
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,311
she was talking
to somebody who wasn't there.

589
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,748
I don't... I don't know.
I don't know. Maybe.

590
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:22,447
If we were to check
her call history right now,

591
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:23,839
we'd know for sure.

592
00:25:25,973 --> 00:25:28,757
Oh, good, you found it.

593
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:31,238
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

594
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:40,508
Listen.

595
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,815
I'm sure it's gonna be OK.

596
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:45,470
Bryce, good luck to you, really.

597
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,672
You're considering
bypassing the parents?

598
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:54,305
I'm fairly certain
I'm well within my rights

599
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:55,523
as a patient advocate.

600
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:57,090
In a vacuum, maybe.

601
00:25:57,091 --> 00:26:00,006
But in this circumstance,
the parents expressly requested

602
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:01,664
that you not communicate
the drawbacks

603
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:03,053
of the surgery to their child.

604
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:05,838
Doctor?

605
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,710
Thank you.

606
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,714
Personally, I prefer my
residents have as much autonomy

607
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:15,979
as possible and make
decisions for themselves,

608
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,851
as long as they're not
stepping over any bright lines.

609
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:21,288
I mean, but, you know,
what do I know?

610
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,116
Well, great.
Thanks, Dr. Archer.

611
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:24,640
Mm-hmm.

612
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,916
What happened to us
staying in our lanes?

613
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:29,905
I'm sorry? What?

614
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:32,679
Dr. Frost's patient
is pretty clearly

615
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:34,823
under the purview
of emergency medicine.

616
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:35,888
Really?

617
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:37,601
Because I thought the boy
came in initially

618
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:38,566
with injured ribs.

619
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,525
But hey, if you prefer a more

620
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:43,310
"spirit of the law"
interpretation,

621
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:44,485
I'm OK with that.

622
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,944
From what this committee
can glean, Dr. Ripley,

623
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:51,101
it appears the victim
of the alleged assault,

624
00:26:51,102 --> 00:26:53,494
a Mr. Pawel Wapniarski,

625
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:55,496
recently sued you successfully
for malpractice.

626
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,020
That was settled out of court.

627
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:58,673
Nonetheless,

628
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,675
there's an appearance of motive

629
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,851
or at least
a conflict of interest.

630
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:04,906
Add in the fact that you had
left the hospital

631
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:07,185
the day in question,
depriving you of an alibi,

632
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,713
plus a witness
who places you at or near

633
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:13,166
the felony itself, and...

634
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:17,712
Reputationally,
this hospital can't afford

635
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,216
to have our doctors be seen

636
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:23,046
as carrying vendettas
for retribution.

637
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:26,919
So we need to ask you,
Dr. Ripley, directly,

638
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,618
were you or were you not
responsible for what happened?

639
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,321
I have no comment.

640
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:45,198
Dr. Ripley, you do understand
that if you don't

641
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:47,505
cooperate with this committee,

642
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:52,205
you could face
indefinite suspension?

643
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:56,601
I do.

644
00:28:04,242 --> 00:28:06,116
Hey.

645
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,676
I thought we agreed
you were gonna come clean.

646
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:10,764
I changed my mind.

647
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:13,027
You changed your mind, great.

648
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:15,423
Just like that, 'cause now...
now you've been suspended.

649
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,122
What happened?

650
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,082
Did Sully tell you
not to say anything?

651
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,389
Uh, no.

652
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:31,132
He told me
his cancer was terminal.

653
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:32,655
What?

654
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,790
Yeah, his latest PET scan
confirmed it.

655
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:43,536
He might only have
a few weeks left.

656
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:45,016
Mitch, I am so sorry.

657
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:46,452
How was I supposed to tell him

658
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:50,499
that I was being forced
to snitch on him, that...

659
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,371
he was gonna have to spend
the remaining days of his life

660
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:54,547
caught up in arraignments
and bail hearings,

661
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:56,853
away from Lynne and his kid?

662
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:01,249
Look, none of this
changes the fact,

663
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,077
though, Mitch, that your career
is on the line.

664
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:05,166
Stop.
Stop, OK?

665
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,733
None of it matters anymore.

666
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:08,300
But you not practicing medicine

667
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:10,389
- doesn't change what's...
- I won't put him through that.

668
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,529
Any improvement?

669
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,357
Her ABGs are really acidotic.

670
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:23,924
Looks like she'll need dialysis.

671
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:25,360
Her kidneys are failing?

672
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:27,188
Not yet, but they're
trending in that direction.

673
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:30,409
Dr. Archer, I know this might
seem completely irrelevant,

674
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,802
but Dr. Lenox
has a patient in T5.

675
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:34,326
- His name's Tyler...
- All right, Dr. Lenox

676
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:35,980
is perfectly capable of taking
care of her own patients.

677
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:37,285
At least, I hope so.

678
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:39,461
No, I-I agree, sir,
but in this case, anyway,

679
00:29:39,462 --> 00:29:40,767
her patient is showing

680
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:43,117
some fairly inconsistent
symptoms himself.

681
00:29:43,118 --> 00:29:44,249
I mean, at one point, we thought

682
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,685
he might have bird flu, but...

683
00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:46,991
All right, you care
to tell me what any of that

684
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:49,080
has to do
with Cadet Herrera here?

685
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:51,256
Tyler's kidneys
are also failing.

686
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,954
Maybe you and Dr. Lenox
should compare notes.

687
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,046
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm not seeing it.

688
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,135
I mean, yes, they both have
a metabolic acidosis,

689
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:03,094
but that's not that uncommon.

690
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:04,443
Well, did your patient
present with anything

691
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:06,619
- that is uncommon?
- Her tongue, right?

692
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,055
Her tongue?

693
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,796
Yeah, it swelled up
pretty quickly after intake.

694
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:12,103
Sores, lesions...
suggests that she

695
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:14,279
must have ingested something.

696
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,020
- Huh.
- Yeah, your patient's

697
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,630
not demonstrating any of that, right?

698
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:18,892
No.

699
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:19,807
What about the cut on his hand?

700
00:30:19,808 --> 00:30:21,286
The cut?

701
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,288
Tyler cut himself
harvesting sunflowers.

702
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,985
But you mentioned it looked
like he'd been burned,

703
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:26,465
the way it scarred up.

704
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,815
Could just be a reaction
to something he was growing.

705
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:30,295
You said he was
a-a farmer, right?

706
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,732
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, sunflowers and hemp.

707
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:36,040
My patient's B3 levels
were high when she came in,

708
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,085
and her commanding officer
said something about her

709
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,869
being tested for drugs
this morning.

710
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,654
Maybe she was trying
to rig the test?

711
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:43,003
Mm.

712
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:44,396
Tyler's mother mentioned

713
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:46,398
that they were up here
buying a new pickup.

714
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,313
They came into some money
recently.

715
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:49,923
I'm... I'm sorry.
What are we talking about?

716
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:56,321
On your farm, Tyler,
are you growing pot?

717
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:58,366
My boy wouldn't do
anything like that.

718
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,194
All right, there's a young
woman who may die over there

719
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:01,891
unless we get
an honest answer out of you.

720
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:03,806
Tyler, is this what's going on?

721
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:08,463
I started growing marijuana
on the back acreage, yeah.

722
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:10,422
But only to keep
the farm going, Mama.

723
00:31:10,423 --> 00:31:11,597
Tyler.

724
00:31:11,598 --> 00:31:13,512
Have you been using
any pesticides?

725
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:15,688
Yeah, a little, but only
to increase the yield.

726
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:17,777
both: Paraquat.

727
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:20,823
Any chance you may have
sold any on the IW campus?

728
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,089
All right, we need to up
the firepower on Herrera.

729
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,525
Let's do a quick
bedside UA to confirm.

730
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:28,222
- Mix 10 milliliters urine...
- Chemo, maybe.

731
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:29,658
With 1 gram
of sodium bicarbonate...

732
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:31,182
- Cyclophosphamide.
- And 1 of sodium dithionate.

733
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:32,183
Plus, amp up
the immunosuppressants.

734
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:33,575
- OK.
- OK?

735
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:35,360
Got it.

736
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:40,104
Why did my parents lie to me?

737
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:41,409
Why did they lie?

738
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,934
You know,
if I had to take a guess,

739
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:48,068
it's because they were motivated

740
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:51,245
by their love for you, Max,
and their desire

741
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:54,727
to spend as much time
with you as possible.

742
00:31:57,252 --> 00:32:00,167
And if I were them, I might
be doing the same exact thing.

743
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,169
What's going on here?

744
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,433
Max, are you OK?

745
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:09,611
No, I'm not OK.

746
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:14,181
Pops, you promised me
I was gonna play soccer again.

747
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,096
What did you just do?

748
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:18,403
I told you
that as a pediatrician,

749
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:21,145
I am obligated to advocate
for my patients.

750
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:23,495
Can I speak with you
outside, please?

751
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,849
Dad!

752
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,286
Ron, Derek, get over here.

753
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:34,897
Don't you ever
talk to my son again!

754
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:35,812
- Are you OK?
- Come on.

755
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:37,161
I'm fine.

756
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:38,988
- Take this man into custody.
- No, no, no!

757
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:40,686
No, no.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

758
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:42,253
Leave him be.

759
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,951
- All right, we're fine here.
- Honey.

760
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:56,267
- Dr. Asher?
- Yeah.

761
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:58,225
Ambo's wheeling in
peds versus auto,

762
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,835
22 weeks pregnant.

763
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:01,228
You're going to trauma 1.

764
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:05,580
Head trauma,
patient unresponsive,

765
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:09,149
GCS 3, BP 202 over 95,
heart rate 52.

766
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,455
Kendall?

767
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,934
She was lucid for a moment,
but she crumped,

768
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:13,066
so we intubated her.

769
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:14,633
- OK.
- Kendall, I'm right here.

770
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:16,461
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stay right there, please.

771
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,419
- Right there.
- OK, on my count.

772
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,553
One, two, three.

773
00:33:21,554 --> 00:33:22,684
- Thank you, Courtney.
- Yep.

774
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:23,643
Thank you, Matt.

775
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,601
OK, pupil's blown.

776
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:28,299
It's gotta be
an epidural hematoma.

777
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,735
If we don't release
the pressure,

778
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:31,476
her brain can herniate.
Mags, call CT.

779
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,304
Get someone from neurosurgery
down here stat.

780
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,175
- You got it.
- It all happened so fast.

781
00:33:35,176 --> 00:33:36,611
One second, we're walking home
from the market,

782
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:38,004
and the next, she's screaming
at I don't know who,

783
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:39,397
insisting they're trying
to get her.

784
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:41,225
And then she just
bolted out into traffic.

785
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:42,748
OK, we're gonna do
what we can, Bryce.

786
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:44,793
All right, both scanners
have patients on the table.

787
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:46,360
CT2 can see you in 10 minutes.

788
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:48,362
Neurosurg can meet you
in the OR in 20.

789
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:50,277
What?
She doesn't have time for that.

790
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,757
No, we need to alleviate
the pressure now.

791
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:52,975
OK, get me an IO kit.

792
00:33:52,976 --> 00:33:54,325
We're gonna place
a 15-millimeter

793
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,109
interosseous needle
to aspirate the blood.

794
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,415
Is she gonna be OK?

795
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,764
When's the last time
you did one of those?

796
00:33:58,765 --> 00:33:59,722
I watched one
when I was a medical student.

797
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:01,070
- Med...
- We don't have any

798
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,202
better options, Mags.
Time is brain.

799
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:04,117
- Scalpel.
- Mm-hmm.

800
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,338
What is that, a drill?

801
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,817
- What are you doing with that?
- Sir.

802
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:14,519
Syringe.

803
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:26,052
15 mls for now.

804
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:27,227
BP's normalizing.

805
00:34:27,228 --> 00:34:29,882
Fetal heart tones
are holding strong.

806
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:32,406
OK, this is a temporary fix
until we get mom to the OR.

807
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,671
Let's get this patient to CT.

808
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:38,576
I checked Kendall's
call history.

809
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:41,173
You were right.

810
00:34:41,174 --> 00:34:44,045
She wasn't talking to anyone,

811
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:46,743
at least not on the phone.

812
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:51,531
I don't know why
I was so afraid to look.

813
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,759
Mr. Lange, the good news is,

814
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:55,143
Kendall's been stabilized
for now

815
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:56,971
and your baby's still viable.

816
00:34:56,972 --> 00:35:00,322
However, your wife sustained
significant head trauma.

817
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:01,675
She's not out of the woods yet.

818
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,021
The next 24 to 48 hours
will be crucial.

819
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:10,637
I suspected she was
showing signs of distress.

820
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:12,378
What was I supposed to do?

821
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:14,467
She wanted a baby.

822
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:17,818
She wanted a baby badly.

823
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:19,602
Bryce, it's
the trickiest part, right?

824
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:21,561
I mean, it's so confusing.

825
00:35:21,562 --> 00:35:24,259
Of course we want
to respect our loved one's

826
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:25,956
sense of autonomy, right?

827
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,567
And the vast majority
of the time,

828
00:35:27,696 --> 00:35:30,178
you're able to do that.

829
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:33,181
But sometimes, sometimes
we gotta... we gotta step in

830
00:35:33,182 --> 00:35:34,530
and protect people
from themselves.

831
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:41,755
We're gonna need
to keep you overnight

832
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:44,105
until the pesticides
are flushed completely.

833
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:47,543
But your body
is responding well so far.

834
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:53,027
And overall, we feel that
you're past the worst of it.

835
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:53,940
Thank you.

836
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:55,531
Do we have any idea how she was

837
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:56,599
exposed to the paraquat?

838
00:35:56,727 --> 00:35:58,032
Well, unfortunately,

839
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,915
we're swimming in toxins
these days.

840
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:05,282
Cadet Herrera probably
just accidentally

841
00:36:05,307 --> 00:36:07,041
ingested something.

842
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:09,306
Well, I'm gonna
call back into the base,

843
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:11,654
give them a progress report.

844
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:13,788
Way to keep battling, Herrera.

845
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:22,753
Maybe lay off the weed
moving forward, Cadet.

846
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:27,742
Pretty impressive catch
there, sir,

847
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:29,106
though I still can't figure out,

848
00:36:29,107 --> 00:36:30,586
how did you know
that she'd been smoking weed?

849
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:32,719
Her elevated B3 levels.

850
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,112
Pounding niacin
is a time-honored hack

851
00:36:35,113 --> 00:36:36,723
for dodging drug tests.

852
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:37,985
How would you know?

853
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:40,117
Well, contrary
to how it might appear,

854
00:36:40,118 --> 00:36:41,728
I was young once too.

855
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,556
Well, perhaps Dr. Lenox
used to cut loose

856
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:44,948
back in the day as well.

857
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:46,908
I don't even want to think...

858
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:54,610
Look, and again,

859
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:56,177
I don't want to press charges
against the guy.

860
00:36:56,178 --> 00:36:58,092
I completely understand
where he was coming from,

861
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:00,442
though I still contend
I was doing the right thing.

862
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:01,748
Yeah, of course you do.

863
00:37:01,749 --> 00:37:03,793
But just for my edification,

864
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:05,621
what made you think
you had the authority

865
00:37:05,622 --> 00:37:08,451
to circumvent
Max's parents like that?

866
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,280
You can blame me.

867
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:14,151
I OK'd it.

868
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:16,241
Dr. Frost was acting
within his rights

869
00:37:16,242 --> 00:37:17,851
as a pediatric EM resident.

870
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:19,026
I concur.

871
00:37:19,027 --> 00:37:21,028
At least we know
he can take a punch.

872
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:24,118
Yeah, well, I guess it beats
having another doctor

873
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,554
who's throwing them.

874
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:28,731
Now we need to decide
how to deal with the father.

875
00:37:28,732 --> 00:37:29,950
Just so we're all
on the same page,

876
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:32,039
we're transferring Max
up to surgery now.

877
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,301
They're still
going through with it?

878
00:37:33,302 --> 00:37:35,390
Far as I can tell,
the kid's OK with it.

879
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:36,652
No, no, no.
That can't be right.

880
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:38,481
Jonathan, don't.

881
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:45,139
I'd like to speak
with Max, please.

882
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,619
No.

883
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,968
That's not gonna be possible.

884
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:50,797
Mom, Dad,

885
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:54,366
please, let Dr. Frost in.

886
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:57,231
I want to speak to him too.

887
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:01,635
Thank you.

888
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:06,579
In private, guys.

889
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,645
Sorry about that.

890
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:14,212
It's OK.

891
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:21,262
Look, I don't know if they
explained this to you fully,

892
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:22,872
but you don't have
to go through with this

893
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:25,180
just because it's what
your parents want.

894
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:31,794
When I was first diagnosed,

895
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:34,344
my uncle actually had me
write down

896
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:38,589
everything I still wanted
to accomplish in my life.

897
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:43,502
I think it was to keep my
spirits up, you know, 'cause...

898
00:38:43,503 --> 00:38:47,201
'cause of the fight with cancer.

899
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:52,859
But anyway, that... that list
got really long, and...

900
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,687
I mean, now it looks like
I'm not gonna be able

901
00:38:54,688 --> 00:38:58,125
to accomplish much of any of it.

902
00:38:58,732 --> 00:39:01,161
The only thing I know for sure
I can accomplish

903
00:39:01,186 --> 00:39:05,219
in the life that I have left
is to make my parents happy.

904
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:12,531
I can still do that.

905
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:14,533
It's gonna have to be enough.

906
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,106
Well, then I think you're
making the right decision.

907
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:34,462
Uh, I may have been
hasty earlier

908
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:37,556
when I suggested
we split up the ED 50-50.

909
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:38,308
It's too big a risk.

910
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,926
Patient care suffers if it
falls in the gap, you know?

911
00:39:41,373 --> 00:39:43,810
That's the point I was
attempting to make earlier.

912
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:47,287
But I suppose
I should be grateful

913
00:39:47,312 --> 00:39:50,633
it only took you one shift
to reach the same conclusion.

914
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:53,921
Anyway, I-I printed up
the memo that you sent.

915
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:56,923
Some real interesting
ideas here.

916
00:39:56,924 --> 00:39:59,274
And of course, I have notes.

917
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:14,767
Hey, uh, I'm looking
for Detective Girardi.

918
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:16,899
To what may I tell him
this pertains?

919
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,466
Yeah, he questioned me earlier

920
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:21,687
about the Wapniarski assault.

921
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,863
I'm...

922
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:25,865
I'm here to turn myself in.

923
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:28,434
Take a number.
Have a seat.

924
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:31,392
Excuse me?

925
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,373
What the hell did you just do?
