1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:09,312
<i>Gas explosion.
50 to 60 victims.</i>

2
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,835
Keep it moving, people!

3
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:14,013
We gotta keep this area clear
for the first responders!

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,058
I can't die yet.
Not like this.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,582
Are you looking for someone?

6
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,107
<i>Whoever torched that server room</i>

7
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:23,892
is responsible for
this whole disaster.

8
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:26,025
You guys are lucky you
had those respirators on.

9
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:30,116
<i>We've got two armed
suspects in CCT jumpsuits</i>

10
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:31,421
<i>in the subbasement.</i>

11
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,034
<i>Shots fired. Sergeant
Platt's been hit.</i>

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,383
You see a guy in a jumpsuit?

13
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:37,862
Ruzek?

14
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,867
Hey, where's Kidd?

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,393
<i>The tunnel just--</i>

16
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,525
The whole thing just collapsed.

17
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:51,441
Lieutenant Kidd, do you copy?

18
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:54,096
<i>Lieutenant Kidd, do you copy?</i>

19
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,620
Give me space, people.
What do we got?

20
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:57,882
A lot of free
fluid in the belly.

21
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,188
She's hemorrhaging.
We need more blood.

22
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:00,450
Get a second transfuser going

23
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,061
and a chest tray
for a thoracotomy.

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,279
Copy.

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,020
We got one hole
here, right shoulder.

26
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,369
Another through
the belly button.

27
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,718
You want me to open
up the Hybrid OR?

28
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,850
Won't make a
difference if we can't

29
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:09,894
get her heart beating again.

30
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:10,895
Push another milligram of epi.

31
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:12,593
Epi.

32
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:13,768
Thank you.

33
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:17,163
Still asystole.

34
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:18,120
We gotta get this under control.

35
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,470
Give me a scalpel.

36
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,124
Trudy, can you hear me?

37
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,169
I'm right here, baby.

38
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,387
You just hang in there.

39
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:25,649
Mouch, man, we need some space.

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,042
I got you.

41
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,435
Randall, why don't
you come with me?

42
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:29,914
Let's give the
doctors some space.

43
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,221
Oh, yeah.

44
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:36,921
Must have been another gas pipe.

45
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,532
OK, go grab some
cribbing and air bags.

46
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,750
Ah! Ah!

47
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,883
Just stay calm,
Jordan. It'll be OK.

48
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,537
I don't want to die.

49
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,060
That's not gonna happen.

50
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:49,760
Done three tours of duty
in theater, Officer.

51
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,153
Haven't lost a man yet.

52
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,286
Come on, let's get a
monitor over here right now!

53
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,722
One second!

54
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:56,376
Hey, hey, what did I
say about staying put?

55
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:58,421
I heard someone got
their legs crushed?

56
00:01:58,422 --> 00:01:59,640
That's what we're
working on now, yeah.

57
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:01,337
Before my mom's dot disappeared,

58
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:02,773
it seemed like she
was moving this way.

59
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,253
Ellie, your mom is not in
the rubble, I swear, OK?

60
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:05,428
But if you don't
get out of the way,

61
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,821
I have to stick
you on an ambo, OK?

62
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:07,996
Go!

63
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:15,177
Here's the last
footage we have of him.

64
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,921
He's not responding
to his radio.

65
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:21,792
Those don't always
work in the tunnels.

66
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,533
Adam's gonna be fine.

67
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:25,753
- I know it.
- You're right.

68
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:26,667
He and Kidd both.

69
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:29,670
We just got to keep the faith.

70
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,853
It's gonna cave in on us.

71
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,376
Hey.

72
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,162
Is everybody OK?

73
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,296
Everyone all right?

74
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:48,993
You good? Hey.

75
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,125
You all right?

76
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,213
Yeah, think so.

77
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,301
Just banged my
head on the window

78
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:53,563
when everything came down.

79
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:55,261
You the man that
captains this ship?

80
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,524
I am. Name's Cory.

81
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:00,570
Cory, I'm Lieutenant
Kidd, CFD, Firehouse 51.

82
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:01,789
Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,399
Is there a first
aid kit on board?

84
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,705
Yeah, let me see
if I can find it.

85
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,620
All right.

86
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,448
5021 IDA.

87
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,101
Squad, do you copy?

88
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:11,190
I already tried every channel.

89
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,321
It's not working.

90
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:13,801
5021 IDA area central.

91
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:14,976
Do you copy?

92
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:16,107
Does anyone got ears on?

93
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:17,196
Hey!

94
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,241
Can someone give us a hand?

95
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,550
My arm is stuck!

96
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:25,987
Please, help me to get up.

97
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,554
I'm afraid I'm hurting her.

98
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,033
- What's going on?
- You got him?

99
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,861
Ah!

100
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,691
Get the chair.

101
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:42,830
Oh, Esme, I am so sorry.

102
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,745
It's OK, Mr. Cy.
It's not your fault.

103
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,268
OK, I'm gonna lift you on three.

104
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,139
One, two, three.

105
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,619
OK.

106
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,273
OK.

107
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,841
I've seen something like
that in one of my mom's

108
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,364
medical journals.

109
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,453
It looks like both the radius
and ulna are fractured.

110
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:58,846
Becca, stop showing off.

111
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,326
No, she's right.

112
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,110
All right, good thing is,

113
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,068
I can just pop that right
back into place for you.

114
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,549
How's that sound?

115
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,377
OK, all right, does anybody have

116
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:11,337
any painkillers of any kind?

117
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,164
Aspirin? Tylenol?

118
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:14,557
Something stronger?

119
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,037
I have a couple
ibuprofen in my bag.

120
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,517
I've got some Valium.

121
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:20,911
Yeah. Thank you.

122
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:23,393
Good. Pop that open
and give me one.

123
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,744
Here you go.

124
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:29,137
All right.

125
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:31,008
And then we'll just give
it a second to kick in.

126
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,360
Let's just get
this over with, OK?

127
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,752
All right.

128
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:37,841
Ruzek, will you hold
her shoulder steady?

129
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:39,626
And then I'm gonna
pull on her arm.

130
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:42,803
All right, Esme, on
the count of three,

131
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:44,892
I want you to take
a deep breath in.

132
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,764
One, two, three.

133
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:51,725
OK!

134
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,293
You did great. You did great.

135
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,774
All right, now I need something
for some kind of splint.

136
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,863
I'll, uh-- I'll figure that out.

137
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,909
I'm gonna keep trying
to get a signal.

138
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,563
All right.

139
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:11,572
Coming in.

140
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,923
Still nothing.

141
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,533
Why isn't more
blood transfusing?

142
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:18,926
We've already got
two lines going.

143
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,102
- Then hook up a third.
- OK.

144
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,452
One second, Trini.

145
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,367
At this rate, even if we
can get her to the OR,

146
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,674
she's bleeding too fast to
ever make it out of surgery.

147
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,240
So?

148
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:32,722
So maybe instead of pushing
more and more blood in,

149
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,724
we should be thinking
about taking it all out.

150
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,117
What?

151
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,598
If we can quickly cool
her body down below 50,

152
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,339
it might let us hit pause,

153
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,994
give you enough time to go
in and--and patch the holes.

154
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,388
OK, everyone, listen up.

155
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,390
Stop MTP, and switch
her resuscitation

156
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,610
to saline, cold saline.

157
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,829
Let's ready bypass and
call the perfusion team.

158
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,875
We're gonna try to freeze her.

159
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,411
OK, Jordan, these
fine gentlemen tell me

160
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:10,804
they'll be ready to go
in a few seconds, OK?

161
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:11,892
Now, things are
gonna move quickly

162
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,415
once we get this off you.

163
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,851
So is there anything we
should know about your health

164
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:17,332
before we start?

165
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,943
I've been dealing with
some nephritis lately.

166
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:22,076
My doctor has me on dialysis.

167
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:23,773
And, uh, when is
your next session?

168
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:27,342
I'm not sure, but my last
one was two days ago.

169
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:28,691
OK, stop, stop, stop, stop.

170
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,780
OK, all right. Hold on.

171
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,303
All right, guys.

172
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,044
All right, we need
to rethink this.

173
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,133
The crush injury is gonna
cause a wave of potassium

174
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:38,092
to be released into his blood.

175
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:41,008
And combined with
his kidney disease,

176
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,706
it could lead to a
dangerous arrhythmia.

177
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,316
Meaning?

178
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,318
Meaning you move that slab,
and his heart's gonna stop.

179
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,103
Yeah, we can't take that chance.

180
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,064
OK, Jordan.

181
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:56,937
Listen to me now.

182
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,376
You probably don't
want to hear this,

183
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:04,727
but we have no other option

184
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,991
but to amputate your legs.

185
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,906
No.

186
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,692
No.

187
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:17,000
Both of them?

188
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,872
I'm sorry, soldier.

189
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:20,003
I wish this wasn't necessary.

190
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,310
I really do.

191
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,225
OK, I'm gonna need 100
milligrams of ketamine,

192
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,662
a couple of
tourniquets, and a saw.

193
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,664
- All right.
- Go, go.

194
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,104
- Nothing?
- No, nothing yet.

195
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:38,109
All right, come on now.

196
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,463
Adam?

197
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,768
Adam, are you OK?

198
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,204
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:48,945
I'm just really happy
to hear your voice.

200
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:49,990
<i>Hi.</i>

201
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,644
What happened?

202
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:52,906
I don't know.

203
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:55,386
I chased the offender down here.

204
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:58,477
And I thought he hopped on
this stalled subway train,

205
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,392
and it was like the whole
tunnel collapsed on top of us.

206
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,306
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

207
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:05,048
Guys, it's--it's--it's Ruzek.

208
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,876
OK, you're on speaker.

209
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,791
Hey, buddy.

210
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,140
Where are you?
You on the train?

211
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,228
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

212
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:12,795
Stella, is she all right?

213
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,014
Yeah, she's-- she's all right.

214
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,885
Kidd's with me. We've
got some injuries.

215
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,191
<i>She's tending to them now.</i>

216
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,584
How many civilians
you got down there?

217
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,760
<i>I'd say 30, 40.</i>

218
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,675
You guys got a plan
to get us out of here?

219
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,111
We're working on it.

220
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,112
Get us a proper headcount
when you got a chance.

221
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:26,679
<i>OK.</i>

222
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,550
Well, don't worry about
getting to the party too early,

223
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,595
all right?

224
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:31,379
Just hang in there!

225
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,685
Kim, you still there?

226
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:34,861
Yeah. It's me.

227
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:37,124
It's me alone. What's up?

228
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,255
I think the offender
that shot Trudy

229
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,605
is still on the train.

230
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,128
Did you ID him?

231
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,608
No, I never got a good look,

232
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,697
but there's about five,
six guys down here

233
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:45,785
that match the build.

234
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:47,264
All right, we're
digging into it.

235
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,788
And listen, we're gonna be
down there soon, OK, Adam?

236
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,703
So--

237
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:53,533
Adam? Adam?

238
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Oh, what the hell?

239
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,625
Oh, guys, you got to back up.

240
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:00,756
- I was waiting first.
- I need you to step back.

241
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:01,931
I need to call my daughter.

242
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:02,976
Guys, everyone off your phones.

243
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:04,238
You just made my call drop.

244
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,718
You got to turn off your phones.

245
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,546
We need to preserve all of
the bandwidth we can find.

246
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,025
- Do you understand?
- That doesn't work for me.

247
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,331
I'm sorry.

248
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:11,506
I need you to get out of my way.

249
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:12,638
You have that backwards, my man.

250
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,639
Now step back.

251
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,381
Everybody, please.

252
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,340
Come on.

253
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,647
Listen, our rescue is contingent

254
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,692
on us being able
to maintain contact

255
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,520
with emergency services.

256
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,349
So I'm gonna have to ask you
to power your phones down

257
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,959
so that we can keep
this channel open.

258
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,874
I'm gonna contact each and
every one of your loved ones,

259
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,356
keep them appraised of
what's going on, all right?

260
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,792
- Thank you for understanding.
- Thank you.

261
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,272
- Hey, Cory.
- Yeah?

262
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,665
It would be real helpful

263
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,841
if you could gather
everyone's information.

264
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:43,016
Of course.

265
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,845
Hey, uh, start
with the men, yeah?

266
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,369
Yeah.

267
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,805
OK, body temp's down to 65.

268
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:53,505
More ice and another
200 CCs of saline.

269
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,465
- Sharon!
- Hey.

270
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,640
What are you doing here?

271
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,381
What else was I supposed to do?

272
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:01,774
When I called to
give you an update,

273
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,863
I didn't intend it to mean
that you should come in.

274
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:07,084
Well, I was planning on
coming back next week anyway.

275
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,131
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

276
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,437
I-I'm fine. How's
Sergeant Platt?

277
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:17,180
Sorry I haven't been able
to update you till now.

278
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,486
As you've probably noticed,

279
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:19,530
things have been moving quickly.

280
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,707
All this ice? What's going on?

281
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,405
We were unable to restart
your wife's heart upon intake.

282
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:27,408
The ice is an attempt to
decrease her metabolism enough

283
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,888
to prevent damage to her brain.

284
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:30,454
Oh, my God!

285
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,500
We'll be taking her to
surgery in about five minutes.

286
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,894
And the hope is after, when
we've warmed her back up,

287
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:37,548
we will be able to
reestablish a heartbeat.

288
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:39,550
And I wish I could
be more definitive,

289
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:41,378
but we're committed
to a plan now,

290
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:45,034
and hopefully it's one
that leads to success.

291
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,080
She's tough,

292
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,909
and she's in very good hands.

293
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,303
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

294
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,088
Here.

295
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:26,336
Can I help you?

296
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:27,555
Are you related to this patient?

297
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:28,991
Can you help identify her?

298
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,819
Sorry, I can't.

299
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,866
Hey, anyone able to ID
our Jane Doe here yet?

300
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,345
Not yet.

301
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,043
How's the bronchoscopy look?

302
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,001
Well, she's got some pretty
substantial bronchial injury,

303
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,351
all right, but none that
appears to have been caused

304
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,310
by exposure to this fire.

305
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:44,746
Looks like the scar
tissue in her lungs

306
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,748
predates today's events.

307
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,663
Tell radiology we're
coming up for a CT.

308
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:49,839
Yeah.

309
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:54,495
OK, whoever did this
was in the building

310
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,323
at the time of the explosion.

311
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:58,586
I want you to canvass
every patient.

312
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,806
No one gets discharged
till you talk to them.

313
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,242
Yeah.

314
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:05,288
Oh, and Kiana, keep
me updated on Trudy.

315
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,681
This stretch of track

316
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:08,422
runs right under
where we're standing.

317
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,511
The collapse cut off
access from the north

318
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:13,035
and south for at least 100
yards in either direction.

319
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,255
That would take two
weeks to clear, at least.

320
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:17,300
No, we get--we get a mole
machine, dig right through it.

321
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,563
Do that, we could bring the
whole building down above us--

322
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,130
And maybe the one across
the street as well.

323
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,828
We can't take that risk.

324
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,351
What about the risk of people
being crushed to death,

325
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:25,700
running out of air to breathe?

326
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,528
There's over 30
people down there.

327
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,530
Do you have any estimate on
when they run out of oxygen?

328
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,836
I don't know. It's
not my specialty.

329
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:33,229
I say we place a team
here in the sewer line

330
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,796
that runs parallel
to the tracks.

331
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,885
Then we see if we can
break through somewhere.

332
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,801
Finally. A decision.

333
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,025
Both tourniquets
fixed and clamped.

334
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,287
Ketamine's in.

335
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,557
All right, Jordan.

336
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:59,299
You want to keep your
eyes closed during this.

337
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,584
Oh.

338
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:24,890
Oh.

339
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,893
OK.

340
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,512
I've been doing some
research online.

341
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,906
From what I can tell,
this hypothermic protocol

342
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,777
is entirely experimental.

343
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:46,433
It looked like it was only
extensively studied on animals.

344
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,782
In that particular trial, yes.

345
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,915
And there didn't seem
to be much success.

346
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,874
No, but the theory behind
it is--is still valid.

347
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,660
You didn't just propose
all this on a whim?

348
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,837
Her heart wouldn't start, Mouch.

349
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,534
If there were a better option,
we would have taken it.

350
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,057
You have to trust me on that.

351
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:04,103
Why should I trust you?

352
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:10,152
Tell me you didn't
just kill my wife.

353
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,683
Yeah, we are socked in.

354
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:22,512
At least I'm not detecting
any signs of more gas pockets.

355
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:23,687
All right, that's...

356
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,646
Any news from up top?

357
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,256
No, not much.

358
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:31,347
I think they're still
weighing their options.

359
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:33,523
Hey, hey, Ruzek.

360
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:36,526
Look, you took
control of the comms,

361
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:38,789
and I am fine by that,

362
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,444
but you're rationing out intel

363
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:44,795
like I'm on a need-to-know
basis, and that's not who I am.

364
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:46,928
Down here, I'm on your team.

365
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,061
I need to know everything.

366
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:50,714
Yeah, I respect that.

367
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,978
So when you came in here,

368
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:55,851
you had your hand
on your weapon.

369
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,941
I'm assuming the guy
that you chased in here

370
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,988
is armed and dangerous?

371
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,599
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

372
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,471
I believe he shot Platt,
and under the circumstances,

373
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:10,473
I didn't think that would
be helpful information.

374
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,475
Platt got shot?

375
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,913
We split up when we
were chasing him.

376
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,916
And then--

377
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,693
I shouldn't have let her go
off on her own like that.

378
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,312
Oh, Ruzek.

379
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:25,532
Hey, I'm--

380
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,187
God, I'm sorry.

381
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:31,494
Oh, I don't even
know what to say.

382
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,800
Is she OK?

383
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:35,368
Ah, last I heard,
she's still in surgery.

384
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:38,066
Hey.

385
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,416
Hey! My friend can't
breathe over here.

386
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,425
Hey, Jacob.

387
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:50,774
Hey.

388
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:51,862
Can you describe
how you're feeling?

389
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:53,168
It's nothing.

390
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:54,387
It's probably just the
air getting stuffy.

391
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,476
No, no, he's really
been struggling.

392
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,043
Slammed against the
railing pretty hard.

393
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,740
Can you take a
deep breath for me?

394
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:02,482
No, it hurts.

395
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,701
OK. Hang on.

396
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,181
Be right back.

397
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:08,357
Gotta make a phone call.

398
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:11,404
Come here. Do me a
favor. Sit with him.

399
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,195
You got this, right?

400
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,154
I am a trained paramedic.

401
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,547
I am not a doctor.

402
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:37,734
Another dead end, Lieutenant.

403
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,519
We got any sense of
how far we got to dig

404
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,477
until we get parallel
to the train?

405
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:43,088
We're still about 100 yards out.

406
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:48,310
Save your energy,
Severide, all right?

407
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:52,445
Hey. This is not the way in.

408
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,969
The kid's sternum, did it
take the brunt of the blow?

409
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,928
<i>Yeah, there's a pretty big
bruise on his left side.</i>

410
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,452
And his heart rate?

411
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:00,366
<i>It's fast.</i>

412
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,803
It's probably about 140 or so.

413
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,109
He's basically hyperventilating.

414
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,459
<i>And how are his breath sounds?</i>

415
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,939
His left side is pretty weak.

416
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,245
And if you percuss him,

417
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,378
does it sound solid
or more like air?

418
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:15,076
It's more like air.

419
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,904
OK, so from what
you're describing,

420
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,775
it sounds like a pneumothorax.

421
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,082
So you're gonna need
to aspirate his chest

422
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,128
and let that air out.

423
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:25,304
<i>Can you find a needle
or--or something sharp?</i>

424
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:27,393
Anybody have anything sharp?

425
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:29,395
A knife? A needle?
Some scissors?

426
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,439
Anything?

427
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,963
I have a knife.

428
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:35,531
I'm an electrician.

429
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,316
Thanks.

430
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,927
I keep an IV start kit
for Cy just in case.

431
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,582
Thank you.

432
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,935
OK, Doc, we got something
to aspirate with.

433
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:49,067
All right, good.

434
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,243
Now, you're gonna
need to find the gap

435
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,158
between the second and third rib

436
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,116
beneath the center
of his clavicle.

437
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,510
<i>That's where you'll
stick the needle.</i>

438
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,815
OK.

439
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:01,340
<i>Puncture the skin
at a 90-degree angle</i>

440
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:04,169
until, hopefully, you
get a gush of air.

441
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,129
OK!

442
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,391
OK. Remove the needle,

443
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:11,393
but leave the catheter in place.

444
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:12,394
OK.

445
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,312
OK, Doc.

446
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:19,314
Yeah, I think we're good.

447
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,534
That was so much
cooler than bio lab.

448
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:22,622
<i>OK.</i>

449
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,537
Good work down
there, Lieutenant.

450
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,843
OK. All right.

451
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,846
Oh, hey.

452
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,544
Here you go.

453
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,633
You know what? Let's
hold on to that.

454
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,549
You never know when
we might need it.

455
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,856
Sergeant Voight.

456
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:41,684
Got everything I could
collect from the C-suite--

457
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:44,687
Personnel files, pension fund
financials, pertinent emails.

458
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:47,473
- Any word yet on Trudy?
- Nothing.

459
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:49,127
I blame this whole
thing on the suits.

460
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,519
How's that?

461
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,651
What did they think
was gonna happen?

462
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:53,696
Leave that much money
out in the open?

463
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,481
You know, same thing every
time with these guys,

464
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:56,699
gambling with our retirement.

465
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,440
Well, that's a problem
for another day.

466
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,747
Excuse me.

467
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:03,271
Torres says our guy Milken
appears to have clean hands.

468
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:05,186
Asset forfeiture ran
him inside and out.

469
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,970
And there's no big
changes recently

470
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,842
to his lifestyle or finances.

471
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:11,236
So we have Atwater running down
names of potential offenders

472
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,281
that Ruzek provided, but
we've got no hits yet.

473
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:15,240
- Nothing?
- No.

474
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,372
No hits yet, because there's
a lot of common surnames

475
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:18,895
down there-- Harris,
Miller, Duffy.

476
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,549
So it's a lot to sift through.

477
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,030
These offenders just tripped
the loudest alarm in history,

478
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,553
and we're still
chasing our tails.

479
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:27,208
I want to get ahead of this now.

480
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:32,431
CT just sent back a report.

481
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:34,737
Malignant mesothelioma.

482
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,870
Oncology estimates she had
less than 12 months to live,

483
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,915
and that was before
all this happened.

484
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,135
Wow. Poor thing.

485
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,397
Burn is concerned about her skin

486
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,833
and wants to do an escharotomy,

487
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,531
so how much longer is this
debridement gonna take?

488
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:47,533
Uh, maybe 5 to 10 minutes.

489
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,840
- Send her up when you're done.
- OK.

490
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,755
Dr. Asher,

491
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:55,105
is there any chance I can
interview this one yet?

492
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,195
Oh, we're transferring
to pre-op now.

493
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,850
At best, it will
be a few hours out.

494
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,243
Why? You have any leads?

495
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,766
Nothing new.

496
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,464
We only know that the
offenders were ID'd

497
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,380
wearing Chicago City
Transit jumpsuits.

498
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,470
- But thank you.
- Yeah.

499
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,604
What are you doing?

500
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,258
I can't believe I didn't
think of this earlier.

501
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,607
Think of what?

502
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:19,913
This.

503
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,784
The jumpsuit that I
scissored off our Jane Doe

504
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,699
when we brought her in.

505
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,398
OK, here we go.

506
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,491
I think I may have found
one of the bad guys.

507
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:40,281
Sarge, Cook says a doctor
ID'd a potential offender--

508
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,065
The Jane Doe they pulled
from the subbasement.

509
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,806
- Who is she?
- We don't have an ID.

510
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,417
There's too much facial
scarring to get a visual.

511
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:48,246
We can't pull prints 'cause
her fingers are--well--

512
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,551
All right, can we talk with her?

513
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:50,900
Not until she's out of surgery.

514
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,554
I'll keep trying to run it down.

515
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:54,426
I understand there's a
chance one of the burglars

516
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:55,949
is on board that train?

517
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,559
Well, we don't
know that for sure.

518
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,127
Still, he might be in
possession of the hard drive.

519
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,998
I don't know if anybody told
you how much it's worth,

520
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:03,826
but I implore you
to direct your team

521
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,524
to do whatever they can
to recover that drive.

522
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:08,788
34 people are still on board
that train, including my wife!

523
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,311
- You got that?
- Hey, easy.

524
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,617
Sev, you made your point.

525
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:14,315
Come on. Come on.

526
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:17,318
All right, and
that should do it.

527
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,538
A couple of weeks,
you'll barely notice it.

528
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,323
My mom's dot was
moving, you know?

529
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,107
I wasn't making it up.

530
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,022
I believe you.

531
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,808
She's probably still
down on that subway.

532
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,331
You know, I bet you're right.

533
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,420
And I told Chief
Pascal to let me know

534
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,509
as soon as they ID
everyone down there.

535
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,078
Her name is Greta, right?

536
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,559
OK, Ellie.

537
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,257
I rustled up the good stuff.

538
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:44,824
Thank you.

539
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,043
The case you have on your
phone, that's really pretty.

540
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,219
My mom and I got matching ones.

541
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,699
That's fun.

542
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,527
Is there anyone
that we can contact

543
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:56,226
to come and be with you
until we find your mother?

544
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:57,489
A neighbor?

545
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,708
We just moved someplace
new a week ago,

546
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,668
so we don't really know anybody.

547
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,278
What about your father?

548
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,020
He's been living in St. Louis,

549
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,588
you know, since he
and my mom split up.

550
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,024
Might you have his number?

551
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:13,070
I think he'd want to
know that you're OK.

552
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,559
When I touched her hand

553
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,258
while they were trying to
bring her temperature down,

554
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:30,739
she was so cold.

555
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,742
It felt like she
was already gone.

556
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:37,398
Hey, look, you
know, Trudy's in a--

557
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,052
She's in a tough
spot, man, you know?

558
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:40,923
And I just--I just hate

559
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,882
that you got to go
through this right now.

560
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:45,928
But here's what I know.

561
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,583
Ripley, in fact,

562
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:52,239
insanely good instincts
as a physician, all right?

563
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,808
And on top of
that, your wife is,

564
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,766
among many other things,

565
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:00,943
a really, really tough lady.

566
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:08,081
I missed her birthday
yesterday, you know?

567
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:11,867
Worse, I--I just
forgot it completely.

568
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:16,916
I don't know where my
head goes sometimes.

569
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,266
Even now--

570
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,572
Even now what?

571
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,574
- No, I can't.
- Mouch.

572
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:24,924
I'm a shrink, remember?
Nothing's weird to me.

573
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,492
Just talk to me.

574
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,929
Even now,

575
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,106
what I'm thinking,

576
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:35,456
I know I should
be here for Trudy,

577
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,023
and I want to be.

578
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:40,766
But part of me...

579
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:44,073
Needs to get out
there with my team

580
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:47,773
to help dig Kidd out of there.

581
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:50,340
Makes me a pretty
horrible husband, right?

582
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:51,777
No, buddy.

583
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:54,301
It makes you a "that's why
she married you" husband.

584
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,651
What, I got to explain
your own wife to you?

585
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:05,486
I don't know.

586
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,966
It feels like
whichever choice I make

587
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,794
is gonna be the wrong one.

588
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:11,971
I don't know.

589
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:13,451
I mean, at least it's something.

590
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,018
Maybe we can connect Jane
Doe to someone on the train.

591
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,846
Well, let's hope so.

592
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:19,413
Adam, I was thinking
if you wanted,

593
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:20,980
I could, um--

594
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,285
I could pull Mak out of school

595
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:24,157
and give you a chance
to speak with her.

596
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:26,028
No, no, no, no,
no. No, no, no, no.

597
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:29,336
Kim, this is not a "stuck
on Everest" type situation.

598
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:31,512
Fire's gonna come dig
us out, I know it.

599
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,514
I'm gonna see you and
Mak tonight for dinner,

600
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:36,038
<i>in person.</i>

601
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,041
Yeah. I mean, we'll
order in pizza.

602
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,173
<i>Hell, yeah.</i>

603
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,828
Yeah, whatever Mak wants.

604
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:45,352
Whatever you both want.

605
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:47,180
Severide wanted me
to give you a message

606
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:49,443
- to deliver to Kidd.
<i>- OK.</i>

607
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:53,012
He said, tell her,
you were right.

608
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,883
You have to make the time.

609
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:56,363
All right, I got it.

610
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:58,104
I got it, whatever that means.

611
00:24:58,105 --> 00:24:59,888
It means he's scared.

612
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:03,457
Kim, I'm gonna be fine.

613
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,938
I know.

614
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,896
I love you, Adam.

615
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:10,464
And I love you, too.

616
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,425
Burgess.

617
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:16,905
Yeah?

618
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:18,124
- You OK?
- Yeah.

619
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,473
What's up? What do you got?

620
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:20,779
Security confirmed
that there were

621
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,563
no unauthorized entry
into that server room

622
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,696
- before the robbery, right?
- That's right.

623
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,480
No signs of forced entry?

624
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,134
Yeah, why?

625
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,657
Watch this.

626
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:32,442
This is from about an
hour before the explosion.

627
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,575
Three men, all matching
the stats of our offenders.

628
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,446
That's them.
What--where is that?

629
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:37,970
Underground.

630
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,233
CCT has cameras set up every
2/10 of a mile down there.

631
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:43,802
- OK.
- This is mile marker 3.2.

632
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:46,239
But they never show up on the
next camera, mile marker 3.4.

633
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,501
And they don't turn around.

634
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:48,894
So where did they disappear to?

635
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:53,376
You think the
offenders tunneled in?

636
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:55,553
No way, it's too long of a span

637
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,598
for them to have dug
and gone undetected.

638
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,296
But what if they accessed
tunnels that already exist?

639
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:01,689
No, I don't think so.

640
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,996
We scoured every documented
tunnel down there--

641
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,345
Water, sewer.

642
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,782
What if they accessed
undocumented tunnels?

643
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:08,914
Seriously?

644
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:10,089
Are you guys talking
about Al Capone?

645
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,438
What about Al Capone?

646
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:14,093
Um, urban legend has
it that, you know,

647
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,921
he dug a network
of secret tunnels

648
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:17,226
to move his booze around.

649
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:18,837
It's not an urban legend.

650
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,273
Me and Burgess pulled a body out

651
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,927
of one of those
tunnels on patrol.

652
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,145
Yeah, that's kind of thin, guys.

653
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:25,060
You said it was around
mile marker 3.3?

654
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:26,540
Mm-hmm.

655
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,281
That stretch of track is
where the train's trapped.

656
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:30,109
So if they figured a way from
there to the server room--

657
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,806
Maybe we can retrace their steps

658
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,895
and get back to the train.

659
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:35,288
We gotta recon the server room.

660
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,639
All right. Put
together a team, yeah.

661
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,862
Hey, Meg, what's the matter?

662
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,691
We have a situation.

663
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:50,346
You hear that?

664
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:53,045
It sounds more solid now.

665
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,352
Uh-huh. Take me off
speaker, all right?

666
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,311
OK.

667
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:00,008
I'm concerned there might
be blood now in his chest,

668
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,488
collapsing his lungs.

669
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:02,968
<i>You need to drain it out.</i>

670
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,752
With what?

671
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:06,841
Like a--like a chest tube?

672
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,582
I--I don't have one of those.

673
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,757
<i>No, don't worry about that.</i>

674
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:10,932
<i>We'll find a way
to manufacture one.</i>

675
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:13,500
Now, the first thing to do is--

676
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,159
Can you hear me?

677
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,422
Aw, damn it!

678
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:24,032
Hold on.

679
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,512
We're good,
everybody. We're good.

680
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,514
It's just the rubble
settling. Right, Lieutenant?

681
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,473
- Yeah, we're good.
- We're good.

682
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:32,171
Hey.

683
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:33,172
All right.

684
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:35,478
Where were we?

685
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,002
Archer?

686
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:39,700
Archer. Come on. No.

687
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,006
Archer.

688
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,144
Ah!

689
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:50,319
Can someone get him
to shut the hell up?

690
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,452
Relax, buddy. He's
in a lot of pain.

691
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:55,368
So am I.

692
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:56,761
Hey, hey, Jacob.

693
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,545
I need you to stay calm.

694
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:01,853
Take nice, easy breaths, OK?

695
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:03,245
Stella.

696
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:05,160
With or without Archer,
we can do something

697
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:08,120
for this kid, right?

698
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,295
I was told you wanted
to speak to someone

699
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,775
about the system's comms?

700
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:12,428
Yeah, how do you
communicate back and forth

701
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:13,865
with your train operators?

702
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:15,693
Ordinarily via radio.

703
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,738
But we've lost
signal with car 8247.

704
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,436
OK, how about non-verbal
communications,

705
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:23,004
uh, traffic lights telling
them to stop and start?

706
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,354
We use bulbs and indicators,
as you would suspect.

707
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:28,183
But that's only built for a
one-way flow of information

708
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,532
from traffic control out.

709
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,839
The trains can't communicate
back the same way.

710
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,234
Why? What are you thinking?

711
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:38,759
- Hey, Cory.
- Yeah?

712
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,546
These lights on your board
just started flickering.

713
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:45,461
Those signal traffic.

714
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:46,898
They must be shorting out.

715
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:49,291
No, I don't think so.

716
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:51,729
That flickering isn't random.

717
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,600
- It's Morse code.
- Hold on now.

718
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:54,993
How do you know that?

719
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:56,734
My brother and I did a
lot of walkie-talkie-ing

720
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,909
when we were kids.

721
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,215
Can you tell me what it says?

722
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,695
Uh, anybody got a pen?

723
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,219
I have a pen.

724
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:07,048
Here.

725
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,921
Uh, let's see.

726
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:19,713
Uh, I believe it says,
"Can you read this?"

727
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:21,323
And now it's repeating.

728
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:24,413
Kidd, Archer's trying
to send us a message.

729
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:26,198
Cory, how do we send one back?

730
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,329
I don't know.

731
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,984
The system's not
set up to do that.

732
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,638
Hey, Becca. Whoa,
what are you--

733
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:34,076
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Give me a second.

734
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:37,600
Yep.

735
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:39,168
I can work with this.

736
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,391
What is that, young lady?

737
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:47,393
This is Theo, Jacob
and mine's robot.

738
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:49,308
He took bronze in the
all-city last year.

739
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:51,049
Think I can maybe
use his transmitter

740
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,704
to send a signal back
onto the same frequency.

741
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:57,272
If this doesn't work,

742
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:59,622
we might lose all chance
of regaining communication.

743
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,233
Do you got a better idea?

744
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:02,495
I do not.

745
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,671
I need, like, five minutes.

746
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:06,413
- Do it. Yeah.
- Yeah.

747
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,938
Hey.

748
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,811
Hey, this duct work goes
straight up and out.

749
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,944
So if they came in through this
way, it doesn't do us any good.

750
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:20,774
It's all brick and
concrete behind here.

751
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:28,826
Hey, guys.

752
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,350
Let's move this thing over.

753
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:45,581
Would you look at that?

754
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:47,192
<i>So they did dig
their way in there?</i>

755
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:48,367
Yeah.

756
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:49,977
They came up through
some kind of duct

757
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:51,283
running under the floor.

758
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:52,937
Why is that not shown
on the schematics?

759
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:54,460
Building underwent renovations

760
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:56,766
about four years ago.

761
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:59,030
They updated the
entire HVAC system.

762
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:01,119
What'd that duct connect to?

763
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,643
I don't know, you know, the
rubble did cut off any access,

764
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:06,994
but trust me, it led up
to some kind of tunnel.

765
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,300
Ruzek thinks one
of the offenders

766
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:09,605
is down there on the
train with him, right?

767
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:11,129
- Right.
- Whoever it is,

768
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,870
is gonna want to come
out of there alive,

769
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,132
even if it means getting busted.

770
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,437
No.

771
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:17,309
Even if Ruzek is able
to smoke this guy out,

772
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,615
there's way too many ways
that this plan goes wrong.

773
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:22,270
Guy's carrying a weapon, all
those civilians on board--

774
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:25,273
Yeah, let's just hold
off on that for now.

775
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:27,146
Kim, come on.

776
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:35,109
How's Sergeant Platt?

777
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,285
Uh, patched the aorta
and a grade 5 liver lac,

778
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:39,548
and miraculously,
there was only hollow,

779
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:40,941
viscous injury to her stomach,

780
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,551
and her bowels
remain fairly intact.

781
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:46,555
So we caught a break there,
but that was the easy part.

782
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:48,775
When do you think you'll be
able to restart her heart?

783
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,995
You mean try to
restart her heart.

784
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:52,605
And it won't be for a
couple of hours at least.

785
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,172
We just started warming her up.

786
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:57,088
I understand everyone's desire
to hold on to as much hope

787
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:00,091
as possible, but the odds
are very long against.

788
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,962
How's our burn victim?

789
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,833
Well, apparently, her
escharotomy went well,

790
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,923
but as you know, "well"
is a relative term.

791
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,837
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

792
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:10,231
Um, the Jane Doe being treated,

793
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:12,103
who's responsible for her care?

794
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,452
I'm the chief of the ED.

795
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:15,019
I'm responsible for
every patient here.

796
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,543
Is there someplace we can talk?

797
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:21,547
So as you can see, we are
in desperate need of intel

798
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,983
to help the rescue effort.

799
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:26,073
So you want us to
extubate the patient now

800
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,249
so that you can interrogate her?

801
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,295
I need to ask her
some questions, yeah.

802
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:32,079
I mean, the lives of
30 people are at stake.

803
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,515
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

804
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,474
That's not going to
be possible just yet.

805
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,345
Excuse me?

806
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:40,000
This woman just underwent
a horrific trauma

807
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,523
and extensive surgery.

808
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:43,569
Extubating her now would
run the near-certain risk

809
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,831
of jeopardizing her health.

810
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:47,007
You're--you're kidding?

811
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,227
Jeopardizing her health?

812
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:52,012
You have any idea how many
deaths she's responsible for?

813
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,101
But didn't you say you hadn't

814
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:56,974
definitively ID'd
her as a suspect yet?

815
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,019
Not definitively, no.

816
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,673
This all feels way
too speculative

817
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,370
and borderline inhumane.

818
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:03,806
You know, we've
got one of our own

819
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:06,113
down there on that
train, Doctor.

820
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:07,767
I mean, he's family.

821
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,812
Fire's got one down there, too.

822
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:11,640
I'm--I'm sorry,

823
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:14,948
but my responsibility has
to lie with the patient.

824
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:16,384
- I took an oath.
- You're responding as if

825
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:18,430
you're reciting from a textbook.

826
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,475
Are you even hearing
us right now?

827
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:22,303
Yes.

828
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:24,653
- I don't know what to say.
- I do.

829
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:26,829
I could arrest you for
impeding an investigation

830
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,179
and haul you downtown.

831
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,702
All right, Burgess,
that's enough.

832
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:31,573
Thank you for your
help, Dr. Lenox.

833
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:34,055
I'll talk with you later.

834
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:37,666
Those deaths,

835
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,799
they'll be on your hands.

836
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:55,467
Dr. Lenox, Voight and
Burgess are good police.

837
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,643
Sometimes they just

838
00:33:57,644 --> 00:34:00,167
lead with their emotions.

839
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:02,256
I know everyone must be
looking at me as the villain

840
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:03,475
right now.

841
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,129
Look, at the end of the day,

842
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,480
they all have to respect that
you have an ethic to maintain.

843
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:12,223
At least, most of them will.

844
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:14,094
I want to help. I do.

845
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,009
I just--if I were to contribute

846
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,793
to that woman's pain or
suffering in any way--

847
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:19,665
There's no need to explain.

848
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:23,583
We all need to honor
where our own limits lie.

849
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:27,717
Yeah.

850
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:32,156
Detective.

851
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,418
Detective!

852
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,159
One second, please.

853
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,769
Look,

854
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,511
I could technically lose my
license for disclosing this--

855
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,121
It being a HIPAA
violation and all--

856
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:43,297
But it might be
helpful for you to know

857
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:45,517
that the Jane Doe
has mesothelioma.

858
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:48,128
I'm not sure how that's
pertinent, Doctor.

859
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:51,392
From my experience, most
mesothelioma patients

860
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,612
are swarmed almost
immediately by lawyers

861
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,396
eager to sue their
place of employ

862
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:57,355
if there had been
workplace exposure.

863
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:58,878
It's a long shot, I know--

864
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,445
But there might
be a court record.

865
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:07,931
Thank you.

866
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,458
I wish we had
something stronger.

867
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,981
Unfortunately,
that's all we got.

868
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:15,982
All right.

869
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,810
Down the hatch.

870
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,594
Good. OK.

871
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:22,031
Let's lay you down
nice and easy.

872
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:37,395
Stay with me. Stay
with me, Jacob.

873
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,005
OK.

874
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,746
This should create a vacuum
to help suck the blood out.

875
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:42,748
All right. Thanks.

876
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:44,793
All right, all right, he
says, once you're in, you--

877
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:46,708
You need to push through
the first resistance

878
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,493
all the way into
the pleural cavity.

879
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:49,755
Got it.

880
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,713
There you go. There you go.

881
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,150
OK.

882
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,152
All right.

883
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,414
- Adam.
- Yeah.

884
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:57,980
I need you to come hold this.

885
00:35:57,981 --> 00:36:00,374
You need to create a vacuum
to help with the drainage.

886
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,768
Just suck on the straw
connected to the water seal

887
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:05,031
till the blood starts to flow.

888
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:27,140
Hey. Doing OK?

889
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:29,796
Welcome back to the
living, my friend.

890
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,494
- Nice work.
- You, too.

891
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,017
- Becca.
- Good job, Becca.

892
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:36,584
Yeah. Thank you.

893
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,460
You scared me.

894
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:44,331
Don't do that again, you dummy.

895
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,995
I don't know.

896
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:58,519
Half of me is wondering
who I'm even kidding,

897
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,914
trying to keep up with
these millennials.

898
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:03,656
At my age?

899
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:08,704
That's the part where you
say something brilliant.

900
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:13,795
I try to have these kinds
of conversations with you

901
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:17,146
in my mind sometimes, you know?

902
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:20,802
I say this, you say that, but...

903
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:24,632
they always fizzle
out because...

904
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:26,808
I can't predict

905
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:30,204
or even fathom what it
is you're ever gonna say.

906
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,468
And that's one of the things
I love most about you, Trudy,

907
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:39,299
that I have no idea what's
gonna come out of your mouth.

908
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:45,697
If only I'd met you sooner,

909
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:49,309
maybe I'd have figured
you out by now.

910
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:56,795
Oh, baby, you better not
quit like this on me.

911
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:59,842
Who the hell would I
be left to talk to?

912
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,759
God.

913
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,327
Hey, Sarge.

914
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,329
The tip Burgess got
might have paid off.

915
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,637
Torres pulled the record of
every personal injury lawsuit

916
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:14,378
filed in Chicago over
the last 10 years.

917
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,553
- OK.
- And most of it

918
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:16,815
didn't fit the profile,

919
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:19,208
but he did find a
Margaret Simshaw, 38,

920
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:20,688
who had a case
dismissed by the city.

921
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:21,689
- OK.
- Now get this--

922
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,125
Her last place of employment?

923
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:26,172
The City Employee
Benefits Department.

924
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:27,826
Margaret Simshaw?

925
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:30,002
It would explain motive,
her holding a grudge.

926
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:32,265
That may be enough to get a
warrant to search her home.

927
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,440
We got an address?

928
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:35,355
No, her LKA is outdated.

929
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,096
Sounds like she moved.

930
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:39,752
But there might be someone here
who does know where she lives.

931
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:45,931
Yeah, the, uh, security guard
found it outside the building,

932
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,193
just before it collapsed.

933
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:49,848
You know, he put
it in his pocket,

934
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:52,285
and he was on his way
to, you know, turn it in.

935
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:53,634
And--

936
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:56,115
Well, that explains
why you saw it moving.

937
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:57,943
But it doesn't mean
she's definitely

938
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:00,032
not on the train, though.

939
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:03,122
I mean, she could have
dropped it before she got on.

940
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:05,646
Ellie, we finally got a
full list of all the people

941
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:08,693
on board, and your
mom's not on it.

942
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:12,566
By the same token, her name
also isn't among the victims

943
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,046
we've identified.

944
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:16,876
So, you know, there's no
reason to give up hope.

945
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,140
Hey.

946
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:23,795
Look, we are going
to find your mom, OK?

947
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:25,231
One way or another.

948
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,016
That, I can promise you.

949
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:32,456
The security guard
who found this,

950
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:33,631
did he make it?

951
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,807
Jordan survived. Yeah.

952
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:37,461
He's with his family right now,

953
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:41,943
and the doctors think
his prognosis is good.

954
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:46,165
But his life is gonna be
different forever, right?

955
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:50,257
One sec.

956
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:52,737
Hey.

957
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:53,999
What's up?

958
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,914
I need to ask her
a few questions.

959
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,481
Really not the best
time, Hank, she's just--

960
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:58,656
Sorry, it's really important.

961
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:00,832
It's a police matter.

962
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:04,052
OK, um, couple
minutes, all right?

963
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:05,576
And please, just,
you know, go easy?

964
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:07,316
I will.

965
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:09,014
Hi, Ellie.

966
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:12,060
I'm Ms. Goodwin from
Patient Services.

967
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,454
Yeah, I'm Sergeant Voight
from the Chicago PD.

968
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:17,457
And he'd like to ask
you a few questions,

969
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,808
if that's OK with you.

970
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:24,377
- OK.
- Thank you.

971
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:26,379
Ellie,

972
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,209
your mom is Margaret
Simshaw, is that right?

973
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,907
She goes by Greta, but yes.

974
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,432
OK, Greta. All right.

975
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,087
I was told that you
two moved recently.

976
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,439
Do you happen to remember
your new address?

977
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,745
Why?

978
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:48,227
Well, we think there could
be something in your new home

979
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:50,577
that could help us
rescue the passengers

980
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:52,318
from that train collapse.

981
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,886
Why would my mom know
anything about that?

982
00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:57,628
It's kind of complicated.

983
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:59,281
OK, um, you know what--

984
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:03,634
I heard the nurses talking
to a cop about a Jane Doe.

985
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:07,202
You think that might be my mom?

986
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,074
We think there's a
good chance, yes.

987
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,510
Well, my mom
wouldn't be involved

988
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,599
in something like this.

989
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,080
I don't believe it's her.

990
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:16,690
I want to see her for myself.

991
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:20,259
Ellie, your mother was burned
very badly in the fire,

992
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,915
and we were hoping to save
you from seeing her like that

993
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,525
until she gets better.

994
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:26,570
Yeah, that's right.
I just need--

995
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:27,962
No!

996
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:30,704
I'm--I won't give
you my address.

997
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,924
I won't give you a thing

998
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:35,492
until you let me see her.

999
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,930
Now.
