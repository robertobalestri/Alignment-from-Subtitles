1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,135
<i>Ariel's not overdosing.</i>

2
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:08,007
- And you are?
- Dr. Reese.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,486
I used to work here.

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:12,228
You got too close to
your patient again.

5
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,361
Lost all objectivity again.

6
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:16,319
Let's face it, been an
issue before, Sarah.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,147
You arrogant son of a bitch.

8
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:20,454
You could never fathom
that you might be wrong.

9
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:22,108
That was the reason I left.

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,981
Resignation letter, going to
slip it under Goodwin's door.

11
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:29,854
<i>Lenox is the future of the
ED. Time for me to move on.</i>

12
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:33,336
<i>I don't have a family
anymore because of you.</i>

13
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:35,034
Scream, and I cut
your damn throat.

14
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:41,692
No, no, please
wait. Wait! Please!

15
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:43,043
Wait!

16
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:51,354
Hey.

17
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:53,226
Oh, hey. What's up?

18
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:54,705
Do you want to go grab a coffee?

19
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:58,057
You know, I can't. I got
rounds starting in five.

20
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,971
Are you... are you good?

21
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:02,322
Um...

22
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,846
Carl didn't show up for our
first therapy appointment.

23
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:05,890
Oh, man.

24
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,631
Do you... do you know why?

25
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:09,198
He lost track of
time, apparently.

26
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:11,113
OK, that's lame.

27
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:12,680
- Yeah.
- But don't worry about it.

28
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,508
Totally typical, much
harder to get men to show up

29
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:17,380
for therapy appointments.
I gotta dash.

30
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:20,383
But I will come find you later,
and we'll strategize, OK?

31
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,037
- OK.
- Looking forward to it.

32
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,043
Come on!

33
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:29,088
Oh.

34
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:37,313
Hey, hey, call security.
Code Silver. 10th floor.

35
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:40,534
Oh, no. No. No.

36
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,107
Ugh.

37
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,067
No!

38
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,568
Stop!

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,442
Hey, come here. Come on.

40
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,792
Come on. Come on.

41
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:25,274
I can't... I can't...

42
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:28,016
- I can't feel it...
- I got you.

43
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:31,019
I got you. I got you.

44
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,629
I need help! Maggie?

45
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,675
- Get me a gurney.
- Right now, let's go!

46
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,372
- Sharon?
- What the hell happened?

47
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:37,634
Abdominal stab wound.

48
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:38,809
We need a trauma room right now.

49
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,984
- She's lost a lot of blood.
- Maggie?

50
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,116
We're going to
Trauma 1. Let's go.

51
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:42,204
She's been out of
it in the elevator.

52
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,336
- Let's go. Move it.
- Let's rotate.

53
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,380
Line her up, get
her resuscitated

54
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:45,468
while I get the OR ready.

55
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:46,991
- Come on.
- Oh, my...

56
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,254
Let's get an IV.

57
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,646
- Bilateral breath sounds.
- Going over you.

58
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,387
Radial pulse is
weak and thready.

59
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,955
- Dr. Archer.
- All right, activate MTP.

60
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:56,087
2 grams TXA.

61
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,915
- She needs a Cordis. Kai?
- Yeah?

62
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,309
EFAST her. Get a good
look at her heart.

63
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,137
- Already on it.
- Cordis.

64
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,094
We're going to need to intubate.

65
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:05,793
Heart rate 140. BP 80/55.

66
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,451
Sharon? We got you.

67
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:14,932
We're going to get you
through this, Sharon.

68
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,370
All right, push a dose of
epi so she doesn't code.

69
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,415
10 of etomidate. 100 of sux.

70
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,591
Epi on board. Etomidate
and sux going in.

71
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:23,289
- What happened?
- I don't know.

72
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,682
No pericardial effusion.

73
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:27,684
- OK, I'm in.
- Damn it.

74
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:29,599
Free fluid in the belly.

75
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,210
Bleeding into her abdomen.

76
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,515
All right, let's
find the source.

77
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,996
- Let's get her to the hybrid.
- All right.

78
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:36,258
Let's go.

79
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,129
- OK.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,566
Let's rotate. Here we go.

81
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,487
Let's go. Let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

82
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:53,493
I just heard. I
can't believe it.

83
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,799
I should have forced Sharon
to let security trail her.

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,497
Just tell me one time

85
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:00,978
anytime anyone's ever been able
to force Sharon to do anything.

86
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,720
Peter, it isn't your
fault, all right?

87
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,332
Everybody, law
enforcement included,

88
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,116
thought that this
stalker thing was over.

89
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:19,214
Ms. Goodwin's alive.

90
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:20,520
She's stable.

91
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:21,912
She's not out of the woods yet.

92
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,915
Bad news is the knife
lacerated her pancreas

93
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,700
and her common bile duct.

94
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:28,223
Damage is extensive,
but temporized.

95
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:31,095
Some tough decisions
need to be made.

96
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:33,054
- Maggie?
- Yeah?

97
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,751
Who's her medical proxy?

98
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,971
Her daughter, Tara.
She's on her way.

99
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,233
All right, let me know
when she gets here.

100
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:40,453
- Yeah.
- You know...

101
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:42,455
Just, what...

102
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,545
w-what's really going on here?

103
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:47,982
She's hour-to-hour, OK?

104
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,810
And we'll see how
well she resuscitates.

105
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:52,291
And...

106
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,077
you know, it's a
waiting game now.

107
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,527
Thank you.

108
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,399
What's her condition?

109
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,706
Her local wound
exploration was negative.

110
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:19,100
The knife didn't hit any organs.

111
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,710
That's some kind of luck.

112
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,103
It's not luck.

113
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,931
Ms. Goodwin knows her anatomy.

114
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,020
She was avoiding
the major organs.

115
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,805
Is she dead?

116
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,811
We'll clean her up.
Then she's all yours.

117
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:41,079
Then I suggest you
get her out of here.

118
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:51,262
What's going on?
Where's Dr. Reese?

119
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:54,091
Listen, I completely get
how upsetting this must be.

120
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:55,876
But the fact of the matter is

121
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,530
that while you're
here at Gaffney,

122
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:01,011
I'm responsible for your
care, not Dr. Reese.

123
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:04,928
This is about the pills I took.

124
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,756
Why do I keep having
to repeat myself?

125
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,018
I told you it was an accident.

126
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,673
I just... I just got
confused. That's it.

127
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,066
I believe that you believe that.

128
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,720
Really, I do.

129
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:16,679
The trouble that I'm
having is that you've been

130
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,160
taking antidepressants
for a long time, right?

131
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,641
And you know that
the appropriate dose

132
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:23,425
is one pill a day.

133
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:24,905
So what I'm struggling with

134
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,080
is how could you all of a sudden

135
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,038
just take a dozen,

136
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,040
and it's an accident?

137
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,870
I-I don't know,
OK? I don't know.

138
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,524
But it's not what you think.

139
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:39,049
Well, what do you
think that I think?

140
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,617
You obviously know I
tried to kill myself.

141
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,576
Well, I mean, since
you bring it up,

142
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:46,406
Dr. Reese actually
left that part out.

143
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,107
Look, this was not that, OK?

144
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:56,502
I... I don't want to die.

145
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,112
And you know why?

146
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,331
It's because of
Dr. Reese, because she...

147
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,508
she brought me back
from a very dark place,

148
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,598
so if you don't mind, I'd
like to talk to her now.

149
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,557
There is one more thing
that I think that you have

150
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,951
a fundamental right to know.

151
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,648
OK, which is?

152
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,913
You have not actually
been taking citalopram.

153
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,396
What are you talking about?

154
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:25,400
You've been taking a placebo.

155
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,793
A placebo?

156
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,143
Yeah.

157
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:34,627
So Dr. Reese lied to
me the whole time.

158
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:37,368
Look, I know that
Dr. Reese was acting

159
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:40,241
with your best
interests at heart, OK?

160
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,938
You know, she was trying
a new course of treatment

161
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,505
where others had failed.

162
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,551
And believe it or not, placebos,

163
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,204
when used appropriately,

164
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:50,251
can be effective for depression.

165
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:53,254
I just don't believe that
that was the case here

166
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,300
and that you have a
right to know that.

167
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,392
I thought I was getting better.

168
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,743
I know it's a whole
lot to process.

169
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,703
I'm sorry to
interrupt, Dr. Charles.

170
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,749
Do you have a minute?

171
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,621
I'll be right back.

172
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:15,885
What?

173
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,365
It's not Sharon.

174
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:21,630
But I need you to meet me
in the conference room ASAP.

175
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,023
Why?

176
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,807
Look, I know this is the
worst possible timing,

177
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:27,593
but Dr. Reese filed a
professional misconduct claim

178
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,769
- against you last night.
- What?

179
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,118
I know.

180
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,555
Look, from the
IDPH's perspective,

181
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:36,297
Ariel Sparkman is a
potential suicide risk

182
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,255
on a 72-hour hold, OK?

183
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:41,215
If they deem you unfit to
continue as her psychiatrist,

184
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,738
we need to find a
suitable replacement

185
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,174
before the hold ends.

186
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:46,655
Not to mention, if
this claim is upheld...

187
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,136
I could lose my license. You
have got to be kidding me.

188
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,485
Daniel, I'm sorry, OK?

189
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,489
But, please, we just have
to deal with this now.

190
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,058
Allie, Dr. Abrams
from Neurosurgery.

191
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,930
I've asked him to consult
on your new imaging.

192
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,063
I'm Grace, Allie's foster mom.

193
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:05,065
So what I'm seeing
is consistent with

194
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,502
progressive Moyamoya disease.
Her carotid arteries are...

195
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,112
Are severely narrowed,
and I'm not getting

196
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,028
enough blood flow to my brain.

197
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,731
Sorry. This is boring you?

198
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:21,385
You bore me, Dr. Abrams.

199
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,301
You're reading me a
book I've heard before.

200
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:27,174
Well, forgive the
redundancy, young lady,

201
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:30,090
- but you need surgery.
- Oh, I don't think so.

202
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,396
Already had three, and
they didn't do jack.

203
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,181
Allie.

204
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:35,835
The last so-called surgeon

205
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:38,054
failed to establish
perfusion to my left side

206
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:39,621
and didn't even
bother with my right.

207
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,536
Which is why it's
still progressing.

208
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,625
Your history is one of
endless mini strokes,

209
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,279
and imaging shows
some concerning

210
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,629
true strokes as well, and
if that's not corrected...

211
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,284
I could die.

212
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:54,070
You could suffer permanent,
life-threatening damage.

213
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:57,205
- Yes.
- Please, save me, Dr. Abrams.

214
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,121
Um, I'd like to
restore blood flow

215
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:03,340
with the direct bypass
bilaterally today.

216
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:07,562
Yeah, but there is one issue.

217
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,999
Well, Allie knew
you'd suggest surgery,

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,915
so she has a request.

219
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,614
Oh, do tell, Dr. Frost.

220
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,269
Well, she doesn't
want her hair cut off.

221
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,575
The kids make fun
of her at school.

222
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,142
They call me a
freak. I hate it.

223
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:23,665
All right, that's impossible.

224
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,536
I need the area around the
incision to be cleared.

225
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,364
Hair gets in the way, and
that's an infection risk.

226
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,759
Unacceptable. I choose death.

227
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,763
DCFS gave signed consent?

228
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,199
- They did.
- Good.

229
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,638
OR is booked for 2:00
p.m. See you then.

230
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:58,395
I'm so sorry
about Ms. Goodwin.

231
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,136
Thank you.

232
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,790
It's important to
me that you know

233
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,011
I filed the claim yesterday.

234
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,621
OK, so have either
of you been through

235
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,579
a misconduct claim before?

236
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,234
No.

237
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:13,367
I've been sued
before, but I've never

238
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:16,457
been subject to a complaint
from a colleague before.

239
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,546
All right, well, it's
a multi-step process,

240
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:19,852
the first of which
is to establish

241
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,375
the validity of the claim.

242
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:24,073
A risk management facilitator
will run the proceedings,

243
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:27,120
and an expert witness
in your specific field

244
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:30,210
will analyze the data,
speak to Ms. Sparkman

245
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,691
and decide if it should
advance to the next step.

246
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:37,086
And they should be
here momentarily.

247
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,262
In the meantime,
Dr. Reese, I'm wondering

248
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:42,396
if there is a chance that you
and Dr. Charles could resolve

249
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:45,313
this claim between us,
you know, here and now.

250
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:51,232
No, I'd like to proceed.

251
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:01,720
The facilitator is
stuck in traffic.

252
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,809
They send their
apologies. I guess...

253
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,812
Don't worry about it, Peter.

254
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,379
You know, there aren't
any other psych patients

255
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,381
in this hospital that need
my attention right now,

256
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:13,296
and my best friend
in the world's life

257
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,995
isn't hanging by a
thread a floor below us.

258
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:17,866
So, yeah, I have all
the time in the world.

259
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,999
No place I'd rather be.

260
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:25,961
What's going on?

261
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,007
Isn't Allie supposed to
be prepping for surgery?

262
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:31,662
Allie talked a lawyer
into petitioning

263
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,839
the ward that
greenlit her surgery,

264
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,797
so I've now been
forced to cancel it.

265
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,973
Foster kids have rights too.

266
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,975
Allie, I wish you'd reconsider.

267
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,282
You've known me
three weeks, Grace.

268
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:46,242
So please be a
peach and butt out.

269
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,854
She won't win, but obviously

270
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:50,986
protecting her hair seems
to be more important

271
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:53,336
than protecting her own life.

272
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:56,992
Allie, you need to
have this surgery.

273
00:12:56,993 --> 00:13:00,126
This is your fault,
too, Dr. Frost.

274
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,693
Me? How do you figure?

275
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:03,825
You lied to me.

276
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,479
You told me Dr. Abrams

277
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,395
was the number one
neurosurgeon in the country.

278
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,353
- I am.
- He is.

279
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,442
Not according to the
"Northwestern Journal

280
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,531
of Neurological Medicine."

281
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:18,057
That distinction belongs
to a Dr. Harrison DeSocio.

282
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:19,798
Is he available today?

283
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,191
Those rankings are
highly political.

284
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,367
Oh, and you're not
very good at politics,

285
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:27,241
are you, Dr. Abrams.
What a profound shock.

286
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,768
As you kids like
to say, I'm out.

287
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:42,037
Allie, is this really
about your hair?

288
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:44,953
I've been told three times
by three different doctors

289
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,913
that they'd fix my brain.

290
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:51,046
Every time they say I
have to cut my hair.

291
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:55,486
Every time they fail, I end
up looking like a freak.

292
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,057
The kids at school are
happy to point that out.

293
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,628
All my life, I've
been the sick kid.

294
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:12,286
I just want one small
piece of it to feel normal.

295
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,897
Well, you know what?

296
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,682
I think that is completely fair.

297
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,946
- You do?
- Sure.

298
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,078
When people keep
letting you down,

299
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,082
why would you keep
believing them, right?

300
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:31,652
But, hey, I am not going
to let you down, Allie,

301
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:35,699
and neither is Dr. Abrams.

302
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,791
Look, middle school may
feel like it's forever,

303
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,793
but it is the blink of an eye

304
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:45,318
compared to the
rest of your life,

305
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,756
which you won't get to see if
you don't have this surgery.

306
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:56,155
I know it feels right now like
you have no choice, I get that.

307
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:59,332
But, Allie, choice is what
lies on the other side

308
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,509
when you are free
of this disease.

309
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,294
So come on, please,
just drop the petition.

310
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,993
Let us help you.

311
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:12,736
I'm sorry,

312
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,390
but until you can promise me

313
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:17,785
that Dr. Abrams
won't touch my hair,

314
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,875
my answer is no.

315
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,967
Um, what's a Whipple procedure?

316
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,926
I would take the head
off the pancreas,

317
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,536
the first part of
the small intestine,

318
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:32,713
the gallbladder, and the
damaged common bile duct,

319
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:37,022
remove them, repair and
reroute her digestive tract

320
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,459
so that it functions normally.

321
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,548
That sounds like a lot.

322
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,985
It is, but it would
allow your mother

323
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,380
to live the life she's used to.

324
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,688
Dennis, what do you think?

325
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:53,995
Sharon's lost a lot of blood.

326
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,041
And if you factor
in her diabetes,

327
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,217
the risk of complications
is pretty high.

328
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:01,611
Look, I really would
like to move forward.

329
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:05,354
I've considered all the risks,
and this is her best plan.

330
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:08,009
And what if we didn't
do the Whipple?

331
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,968
Without the surgery now,

332
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,361
she would need a
biliary drainage bag.

333
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:15,451
And due to complications
associated with that,

334
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,584
it's likely she wouldn't be
able to eat by mouth again

335
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:18,889
for the rest of her life.

336
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,543
Her life is our primary concern.

337
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:21,762
And mine.

338
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:23,416
But if drainage fails,
I wouldn't be able

339
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,244
to get back in for
at least a year

340
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,897
or longer because
of the scar tissue

341
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,988
from the injury, so...

342
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:36,864
I can't risk losing mom.

343
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:39,214
No Whipple.

344
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:42,697
Of course. Of
course, I understand.

345
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:53,054
Look, look, I know that
this is frustrating.

346
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,142
When the hell did everybody stop

347
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:55,578
listening to me around here?

348
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,407
They're just afraid,
Dean. Everyone is.

349
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:00,583
Yeah, well, Ms.
Goodwin is going to pay

350
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,803
the price for that fear.

351
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,902
Dissect here with
the right angle.

352
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:17,252
Wait, stop. What is that?

353
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:20,081
Biliary drain is dislodged.

354
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:23,650
The common bile duct is totally
transected at the ampulla.

355
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:25,478
Bile from her liver,
pancreatic enzymes

356
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,568
are leaking everywhere in the
back wall of the bile duct.

357
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,004
Draining her isn't
going to work.

358
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,833
So we'll have to reattach
the duct over a stent.

359
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,443
No, no.

360
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,271
The damage to the
pancreas and the ampulla,

361
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:39,231
it'll just happen
all over again.

362
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,019
We have to do the Whipple.

363
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,239
We already need to
reattach the duct.

364
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,155
It would be irresponsible not
to do the entire procedure.

365
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:52,853
Dr. Archer, we need
Tara's permission

366
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,115
if we're going to
be changing course.

367
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,464
No, actually we don't.

368
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,813
It's part of all the
other indicated procedures

369
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,250
on the current consent.

370
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,208
She and Dr. Washington
were very clear that...

371
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,123
Ms. Goodwin is not going to
spend the rest of her life

372
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,777
attached to a bag and an IV.

373
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:06,171
It's my call, we're doing it.

374
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,130
Hand me the clip and plier.

375
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,832
Hey. Where's Grace?

376
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,139
Off finding me Jell-O.
She thinks I'm 6.

377
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,622
I take it you're not
her biggest fan, huh?

378
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,667
She's fine, actually.

379
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,452
But she'll be gone
in a few months.

380
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,367
They always go.

381
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,586
Did you talk to Dr. Abrams?

382
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:32,719
I did, yes.

383
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,505
But he is not willing to
compromise the surgery.

384
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:38,507
And, Allie, look, I
totally understand.

385
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:40,422
I mean, he's just
trying to protect you.

386
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,642
I don't like him.

387
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:44,688
I think you might.

388
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:51,172
Look, Allie, I know
a lot of surgeons

389
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,827
have made you promises
that they couldn't keep,

390
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:56,569
but Dr. Abrams is
not one of them.

391
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,658
All right? I have
full confidence

392
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:01,661
that he will succeed
where others have failed.

393
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:04,185
Sorry, no dice.

394
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:07,188
Yeah, I thought
you might say that,

395
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:11,279
which is why I brought you this.

396
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,935
I'm not going to let
you cut my hair either.

397
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,720
It took forever to grow it
back out after my last surgery.

398
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,418
Yeah, I bet.

399
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:24,641
But this is me trying to make
your situation 1% fairer.

400
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:29,341
I can't make middle school
kids nicer, all right?

401
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:32,779
But I can make sure that you
don't go through this alone.

402
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,607
So here's the deal,

403
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:36,739
whatever Dr. Abrams
does to your hair,

404
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,264
you can also do to mine.

405
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:42,876
- If I'm bald, you're bald.
- Oh, even better.

406
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,835
You get to be the one
that makes me bald.

407
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,716
The other doctors
will make fun of you.

408
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:59,719
Oh, trust me when I say
they already do, so...

409
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:06,205
So? Deal?

410
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,032
Deal.

411
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,599
Yes.

412
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,514
- All right.
- Yeah.

413
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:16,126
Dr. Cuevas, did you assess
Ariel Sparkman earlier today?

414
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,389
I did.

415
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,304
She adamantly maintained

416
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:21,654
that yesterday's
overdose was accidental.

417
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:24,047
Do you think Ariel
is being truthful?

418
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:26,528
She certainly appears
to believe it.

419
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,922
But?

420
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:31,446
Well, her behavior
is undeniable.

421
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,710
She took 12 pills she
believes to be antidepressants

422
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,104
when her prescribed
dose is only one,

423
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,498
and I certainly observed
a great deal of anxiety

424
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,151
in my conversation with her,

425
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:42,936
and in light of her
two suicide attempts...

426
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:45,112
Two suicide attempts?

427
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:47,941
Yes, the first was
about eight months ago,

428
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,290
plus the incident from
yesterday morning.

429
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,292
Hold on, I'm
sorry, Dr. Cuevas,

430
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:55,818
but not only do you work here,
you report to Dr. Charles?

431
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,864
This is a clear
conflict of interest.

432
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:59,300
Point taken, Dr. Reese,

433
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,737
but Dr. Cuevas is just
an expert witness.

434
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,217
She doesn't decide the case.

435
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:04,784
And, quite frankly,
given the urgency

436
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:06,873
with which you
filed your petition,

437
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:10,442
it was our only option
given such short notice.

438
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,792
Mm.

439
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:16,361
Please continue, Dr. Cuevas.

440
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:20,147
Ariel is upset because
she can't see Dr. Reese

441
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,192
while on her 72-hour
cycle because

442
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:24,064
Dr. Reese's Gaffney
privileges were revoked

443
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,153
by Dr. Charles last night.

444
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:29,548
But she is infuriated
she's being denied

445
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,637
her citalopram
dose today when...

446
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,595
Wait. I'm sorry, Dr. Cuevas.

447
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:37,599
You said she was infuriated
that she was denied her...

448
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,949
her dose today?

449
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,822
I told her this morning that

450
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:45,564
she had been taking sugar
pills for seven months.

451
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:47,000
Wait, you broke the placebo?

452
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,828
Yes, because she
deserved to know.

453
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:50,612
I'm sorry, am I the only
one who's lost here?

454
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:53,615
Wait, wait, so I interviewed
this morning in an attempt

455
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:57,140
to get some clarity on why
she took 12 antidepressants.

456
00:21:57,141 --> 00:21:59,186
So what we're saying
is that even though

457
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:02,755
she knew they were placebo,
she asked for them again?

458
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:06,280
Maybe she didn't believe you.

459
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:09,762
Or more likely...

460
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,416
she forgot you told her.

461
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,854
Exactly.

462
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:21,034
I'm thinking EML,
episodic memory loss.

463
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:23,384
Which would explain
why she didn't remember

464
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,864
taking so many pills.

465
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,083
Yeah, she was confused
because, well,

466
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:28,737
she couldn't remember.

467
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,173
Maybe even a little embarrassed.

468
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,306
So that's the name she gave it

469
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:36,005
to make sense of it
that it was an accident.

470
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,398
Which means she isn't depressed

471
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,880
and something else is
causing her memory loss.

472
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,490
That's right, and the
root causes of EML

473
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:46,233
can be very serious, so we
need to figure this out.

474
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:49,541
So are we good?
Are we done here?

475
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:58,985
Clear the room, please.

476
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,118
- Sure.
- OK.

477
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:08,951
Tara and Dennis are
asking for an update.

478
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:10,910
It's all good. Kai's
closing her up,

479
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:12,694
and then we're taking
her to surgical ICU.

480
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:15,218
All right, good. They'll
be happy to hear that.

481
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:17,264
I can't believe we just
did a trauma Whipple.

482
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,918
Make sure you're
closing her right.

483
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,441
Take 1 centimeter
by 1 centimeter

484
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:21,921
bites of fascia.

485
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:24,271
We don't want a hernia after
all the work we've done.

486
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:26,752
This isn't my first
abdominal closure.

487
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:33,019
- What the hell was that?
- Pulse ox is dropping.

488
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,934
Almost done here.

489
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,415
Dean, she's more difficult
to ventilate now.

490
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,112
Peak pressures are high.

491
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,244
Her X-ray showed broken
ribs on the right side.

492
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,725
Right.

493
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,510
Marty, what do you hear?

494
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:46,946
No sound on the right side.

495
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:48,469
Trachea's deviated.

496
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,905
She's got a tension
pneumothorax.

497
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,430
- All right, needle her.
- She's in asystole.

498
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,475
14 gauge Angiocath and
get the crash cart.

499
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,737
Damn it. Push epi!

500
00:23:57,174 --> 00:24:00,176
I'll take over compressions.

501
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:03,266
- Epi's in.
- All right, pulse check.

502
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:04,790
No pulse. Still asystole.

503
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,357
Move over.

504
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,839
Another round of epi.

505
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:14,191
Come on, Ms. Goodwin.
Come on. Come on.

506
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:34,472
Ms. Goodwin is on
her way to the ICU.

507
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,517
She's going to be OK.

508
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,044
Thank you, Dean.

509
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,699
- I owe you everything.
- Oh, you owe me nothing.

510
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,746
We all wanted the same thing.

511
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:51,140
Thank you for saving my mom.

512
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:05,546
Graves' disease? No way.

513
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,461
Physical presentation
doesn't match.

514
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:09,332
Oh, well, that's
the end of that.

515
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,551
What does that mean?

516
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,510
That you always
have to be right.

517
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,381
I am wrong all the time.

518
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,165
Don't give me that
fake mea culpa BS.

519
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:17,558
One of your best moves.

520
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,908
Close cousin to the
double-edged compliment...

521
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:21,997
you build me up and then
tear me right back down.

522
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:24,957
I might have pushed
you hard on occasion

523
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,046
because I believed in
you, but tear you down?

524
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,656
Give me one example?

525
00:25:28,657 --> 00:25:30,789
You called me
insubordinate and reckless

526
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,008
for using exposure
therapy on a patient.

527
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,010
Could that have been the
time when you let a patient,

528
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:37,317
who had been having
recurring visions

529
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:40,363
of stabbing his wife to death,
put a knife to your throat?

530
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:41,669
Not walking that one back.

531
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,846
My point is you did
not trust me to decide

532
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:47,370
- how much was too much.
- Trust you to decide.

533
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:50,373
It was the third or fourth
time you'd crossed that line.

534
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:51,766
What line?

535
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:54,421
The line where what was
going on in your own life

536
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,379
compelled you to overpersonalize

537
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,687
your treatment of patients
and put yourself in danger.

538
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:02,516
- I almost fired you.
- Well, I was a kid, OK?

539
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:03,822
I was still learning.

540
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:06,085
And you're one to tell
me about crossing lines.

541
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:08,696
You? You gave Tic
Tacs to patients

542
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:09,871
on more than one occasion
and just told them...

543
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:11,743
Completely different,
and you know it.

544
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,701
How? Because the
only difference

545
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:16,008
is that it's coming
out of your mouth.

546
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:19,620
Only you get to decide
how far is too far,

547
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,014
and you just move the line
whenever it suits you.

548
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:25,191
And this placebo
situation is no different.

549
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:26,409
Let's just say that we're right

550
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,628
about episodic memory loss.

551
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,717
OK, well, when did it start?

552
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,893
How often did it
happen? Who cares?

553
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:34,722
You kept prescribing
a fake antidepressant

554
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:38,466
to somebody who is suicidal.

555
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,733
Ariel tried to commit suicide
while she was on citalopram.

556
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:48,606
And you and I both know
that one of the most

557
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,218
dangerous proven possible
side effects of SSRIs

558
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,220
is suicidal ideation.

559
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,917
OK?

560
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:59,138
So I had a hunch that the
pills were responsible,

561
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:01,749
but Ariel deeply believed
they were helping her,

562
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,664
so I consulted my colleagues

563
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,623
and several
significant new studies

564
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,451
and switched her to a placebo.

565
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:11,019
Yes, without telling her.

566
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,979
But guess what? It worked.

567
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,113
Why didn't you tell
me all this before?

568
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:21,116
Your voice

569
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:24,119
stayed in my head for so
long after I left here,

570
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,557
and I just went on
second guessing myself,

571
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:28,950
like I couldn't
do anything right

572
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:31,953
unless you were
there to tell me so.

573
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:34,913
So when I learned Ariel had
been brought to Gaffney,

574
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:38,656
I was admittedly a
little anxious and...

575
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,659
and then also excited because

576
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,705
I realized I missed you.

577
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,577
But then you just
went right back in

578
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,144
with your questions
and your judgments

579
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:51,190
and I just felt like a
little kid again, OK?

580
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:53,148
And I hated it.

581
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:55,673
You want to know
the real reason why

582
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,285
I could never bring
myself to fire you,

583
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:02,723
and why I kept you
around? The real reason?

584
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:06,292
It's because you
were right so much.

585
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:10,688
And I don't mean right in
a, oh, that's a sharp kid.

586
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,646
She's going to make a
great shrink one day.

587
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:15,997
I mean, in a complex,

588
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:19,218
diagnostic, like, why didn't
I think of that kind of way.

589
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:21,742
- Yeah, right.
- You don't believe me?

590
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:24,179
How about the depressed florist

591
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,356
who you figured out
just had Addison's?

592
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:30,055
The lawyer couple

593
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:33,232
who were intent on murdering
each other until you...

594
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:34,407
Wait.

595
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:37,758
Could Ariel have Addison's?

596
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,500
Sodium levels are a big
red flag for Addison's,

597
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:42,197
and hers... hers were normal.

598
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,373
Yes, but she's been
craving salty foods.

599
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:46,854
Maybe because her body
is trying to correct

600
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:49,465
its low sodium levels?

601
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:54,035
I mean, Addison's and
depression certainly fits.

602
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:57,822
Why don't we do a
ACTH stimulation,

603
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:03,088
and if we're right, put her
on prednisone right away?

604
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,226
Sharon's going to be OK.

605
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,193
- Maggie?
- Yeah.

606
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,155
Wait.

607
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:33,075
She's going to live.

608
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,818
She's strong.

609
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:41,691
Stronger than you'll ever be.

610
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:43,824
Remember that.

611
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:10,764
How'd you get the best
room in the house?

612
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,074
Peter Kalmick, close
personal friend.

613
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:19,686
Oh, yeah? I know him too.

614
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:20,819
Hey.

615
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:27,433
I really thought we
were going to lose her.

616
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,783
Oh, man. Tell me about it.

617
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:32,568
You're not going to get rid
of me for a good long time.

618
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:34,483
Good.

619
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:38,923
Because I need you
more than you know.

620
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,141
Mm-hmm.

621
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,230
- You know what?
- Mm?

622
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:45,539
I actually have a
little surprise for you.

623
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:50,630
Wait a minute.

624
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:53,415
How much morphine
are they giving me?

625
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:56,201
Sarah Reese?

626
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:58,159
It's good to see
you, Ms. Goodwin.

627
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,988
I'm so glad you're here.

628
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:04,035
So who's next, Will Halstead?

629
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:13,305
Why are you looking at
me like that, Daniel?

630
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,307
You scared the crap out of me.

631
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:18,310
Please don't do it again.

632
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:21,400
I don't intend to.

633
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:25,230
Anything you need,
anything I can get you?

634
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:28,189
Yeah, could you
tell Dr. Archer

635
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,889
that I'd like to
see him, please?

636
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:38,852
I'm, like, fixed?

637
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:40,854
No more surgeries?

638
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,464
No more surgeries.

639
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:44,684
That's wonderful news.

640
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,860
And Dr. Abrams knocked
it out of the park.

641
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:49,384
I'm so glad you
think so, Dr. Frost,

642
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:53,345
but I do hope the
queen is also pleased?

643
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:55,825
It depends.

644
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,653
Did you cut my hair off?

645
00:31:57,654 --> 00:32:00,396
Of course I did.
I'm a professional.

646
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:09,230
Then you better get
your hair buzzer ready.

647
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:11,929
A promise is a promise, right?

648
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,887
All right, let's
skip the bonding.

649
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:16,455
I got a surgery, and I need
to check these incisions.

650
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:51,447
Looks like your freak
days are done, huh?

651
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:56,234
You look lovely.

652
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:58,453
So...

653
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:00,890
I didn't cut your hair at all.

654
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:05,765
I used the braids to part
it along the incision lines,

655
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:07,985
so it'll take about
a week to heal,

656
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,552
but when it does, you
can let your hair down

657
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:14,513
and no one will be the wiser.

658
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:16,863
It was your idea?

659
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:19,126
Well, it was Dr. Frost's idea.

660
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:23,001
A safe, but ridiculous solution.

661
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:36,404
Nice braiding.

662
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,363
Do you have a daughter?

663
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:39,973
I do.

664
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:43,020
And I also have three
older sisters who

665
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,980
forced me to braid their
hair when I was growing up.

666
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:50,810
Do you think they sometimes
wish they were related

667
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:53,378
to the number one
neurosurgeon in the country

668
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,859
instead of just you?

669
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:04,128
But fourth place isn't bad.

670
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,920
Can you tell him
thank you for me?

671
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,487
You just did.

672
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:27,543
Well, one Sharon Goodwin was
certainly happy to see you.

673
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:33,418
Look, I didn't mean
everything I said earlier.

674
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,507
Well, you meant some of it.

675
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:38,466
I mean, at least I hope you did.

676
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,773
I needed to hear it.

677
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:43,428
Listen,

678
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:46,126
you're an excellent
psychiatrist,

679
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:49,608
and if I ever did anything
to make you feel otherwise,

680
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:52,001
I sincerely apologize.

681
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:54,352
I'm so glad that you
set me on this path,

682
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:57,050
and I will be forever grateful.

683
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,965
Want to come work for me again?

684
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,532
Absolutely not.

685
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,534
Want to grab a couple dogs
at Gene and Jude's someday?

686
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,927
- Absolutely.
- Excellent.

687
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,516
Yeah?

688
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,214
Hey.

689
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:31,955
Oh, hi.

690
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,567
How you doing?

691
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:37,395
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

692
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:41,529
I am so sorry that I spaced
out on our appointment.

693
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,618
Oh.

694
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,186
Anyway, I cannot
believe that Carl, what,

695
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:49,537
he played hooky for
your first session?

696
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,278
Shrinks.

697
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,193
They're unbelievable.

698
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,542
How do you mean?

699
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:57,806
Well, you had this
incredibly crazy day.

700
00:35:57,807 --> 00:35:59,243
I mean, I know that
you and Ms. Goodwin,

701
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:00,940
you're really tight.

702
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:03,508
Oh, yeah.

703
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,379
Well, at least she's
going to be OK.

704
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,252
That's good, but, you
know, you don't have to be.

705
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:10,210
This... it's a lot.

706
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:12,865
You know, I really
appreciate you saying that.

707
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:16,129
And, yeah, man, upsetting.

708
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,959
But look, her physical
injuries are one thing, right?

709
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,788
But it's, like, the
emotional trauma, that's...

710
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,442
that's going to be
the tricky part.

711
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,139
Mm.

712
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,967
Well, and on top
of everything else,

713
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:31,231
there's that rumor
that's going around.

714
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,973
What rumor?

715
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:37,019
Well, apparently your
curly-haired protégé

716
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,674
dragged you in front
of a military tribunal.

717
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,981
A military tribunal?

718
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:44,941
We figured it out.
Yeah, it's fine.

719
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:50,250
Look, this may be incredibly
presumptuous of me,

720
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:54,036
but I think that if the person
you normally download to

721
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:58,258
is currently in intensive care,

722
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:02,349
maybe I can be the one
to check in on you?

723
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:06,310
You know, like, how friends do?

724
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:07,876
You know what?

725
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:13,230
That is incredibly
thoughtful of you, really.

726
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,754
I just think that what I need
to do right now is I just,

727
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:18,322
I don't know, I need a little...

728
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,628
quiet time to process
all this crap, you know?

729
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:23,240
I totally get it.

730
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,676
I appreciate your understanding,

731
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:26,199
and it's so nice of
you to come down here.

732
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,507
- I'm here if you need me.
- Thank you.

733
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:31,335
Thank you so much.

734
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:39,604
Wait, Jackie?

735
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,736
Do you mind just before you go

736
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:44,871
saying a quick hello to
another friend of mine?

737
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,746
Oh, that guy?

738
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:54,749
Yeah, we go way back.

739
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:04,716
You think I'd be
a better patient,

740
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:08,850
but I just cannot
stand sitting around.

741
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:11,026
Well, you did almost just die,

742
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:14,596
so maybe give yourself
a little break.

743
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:19,774
Where is everybody?

744
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:24,997
Well, Dr. Asher here
is babysitting me

745
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:29,958
while Tara and Dennis grab
some dinner downstairs.

746
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:32,047
Mm.

747
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:33,745
I'll give you two a minute.

748
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:36,749
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

749
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:43,581
Whew.

750
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:47,411
The VIP presidential suite.

751
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:50,588
Man, Kalmick is... he's
really treating you right.

752
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,808
Yeah, he is.

753
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:59,988
So, be honest with me...

754
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,078
how close did I come?

755
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:09,347
Candidly, I'd say you had
one foot firmly in the grave.

756
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,958
Whew.

757
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:16,310
Thank you for your candor.

758
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:21,706
I don't know how
much you remember.

759
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:25,666
Everything.

760
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:28,626
But, mostly, I
remember your voice

761
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:32,107
over me as I was drifting away,

762
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:36,764
so I knew I still had a chance.

763
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:40,028
I'm just glad I got
there when I did.

764
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:44,424
You not only saved my life,

765
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:49,387
but you saved my ability to
live it the way I want to.

766
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,565
You deserve that, Ms. Goodwin.

767
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:57,655
Oh, we are so beyond that.

768
00:39:57,656 --> 00:40:01,485
Sharon, please.

769
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:04,967
OK, Sharon.

770
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:08,883
You know what else I deserve?

771
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:13,018
You tearing up your resignation.

772
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:18,023
Yes, Tara found your
letter in my office.

773
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:20,678
Yeah, that's a conversation
for another day.

774
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:23,420
No, no, it's a
conversation for now.

775
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,864
Boy.

776
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:38,217
I want you to promise
me that you'll stay.

777
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:40,567
This is highly manipulative,

778
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:43,788
given you just narrowly
escaped death and all.

779
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:46,748
Highly manipulative.

780
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:52,797
But Gaffney needs you, Dean.

781
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:58,280
So do I.
