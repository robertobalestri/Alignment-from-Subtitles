1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:07,350
Did you ever think maybe
that I had misdiagnosed you?

2
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:08,398
No.

3
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:09,965
There was something wrong with me.

4
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:12,228
I'm grateful for what you did.

5
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:15,405
You know, I really appreciate
your saying that.

6
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:17,668
We knew this was coming.

7
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:20,758
And, honestly, the fact
that I got any time at all,

8
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,847
you gave me that.

9
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:25,589
They said he had a blood clot,

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,505
and it happened so fast,
they couldn't save him.

11
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:34,685
- That song.
- I love that song!

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,124
Oh. Sorry.

13
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,386
- Thank you.
- Oh.

14
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:40,648
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,171
You got to partake.

16
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:44,521
The Chicago Handshake
was Sully's favorite.

17
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,871
It's a shot of Malort
with an Old Style chaser.

18
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,525
Ooh, yeah. I'm... I'm good.

19
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:49,961
Oh, no, no, come on. Just one round.

20
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,006
Just one round, please.

21
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,094
Hey, how about that toast, yeah?

22
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,836
- I don't drink.
- Why? You religious?

23
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:56,403
Uh, recovering addict.

24
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:58,883
Well, I'm a drunk, but you
don't see that stopping me.

25
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:00,711
Jake, Jake, quit harassing my girlfriend

26
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:02,452
and make your damn toast already, yeah?

27
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,193
All right, all right, all right.

28
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:06,587
- I wanted... whoa.
- Whoa! You OK?

29
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:09,111
Yeah. Thank you, sweetheart.

30
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,113
- He's harmless, I promise.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

31
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:14,247
I once saw my man
put back a dozen of these

32
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,249
and still walk out of here upright.

33
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,556
Now, none of you wusses could ever.

34
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:21,993
But you damn well better try
in his honor.

35
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:23,212
- To Sully!
- To Sully!

36
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,649
I wasn't done. But to Sully.

37
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,738
Miss you, buddy.

38
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,917
Oh, man.

39
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,138
You, uh... you ready to bail?

40
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,835
Uh, yeah.

41
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:41,143
Early morning tomorrow.

42
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:43,145
I appreciate you coming out.

43
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,799
I know these guys can be a lot.

44
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,105
No.

45
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,802
No, it's been fun.

46
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:50,631
It's nice finally meeting
more of your past.

47
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:52,415
Yeah.

48
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,070
I'll call you an Uber.

49
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,637
Wait, are you not...

50
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:57,855
you're not coming?

51
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,118
I thought you were working tomorrow too.

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,249
Yeah, yeah, I'm just...

53
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,556
I'm just gonna finish this round.

54
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:03,731
All right.

55
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,776
I'll be right behind you, I promise.

56
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:08,170
Just, um, maybe leave
the key under the mat.

57
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,345
Sure.

58
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:10,564
You know what time it is, right?

59
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:13,567
Yeah, I think so. And... shots on Rip!

60
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:14,698
Shots on Rip!

61
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,266
Shots on Rip! Shots on Rip!

62
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,789
- Shots on Rip!
- Another round.

63
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,320
Hey!

64
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:23,925
- Dr. Charles, good morning.
- Good morning.

65
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:25,970
This is my daughter, Penny.

66
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,624
- Hello, Penny.
- Yo.

67
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,973
Yo.

68
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,787
Can you solve the area
of this green triangle.

69
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:33,195
The area of the green triangle?

70
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:35,110
Oh, yeah, that's easy.

71
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,634
You just take that number right there,

72
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:39,810
and then you do it with that number,

73
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,203
and then something else.

74
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:43,640
- Really helpful, thanks.
- You're welcome.

75
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,076
Penny, don't. Don't be rude.

76
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:46,295
- What?
- He thought it was funny.

77
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:47,601
He was being polite.

78
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:48,732
- Were you being polite?
- It was really funny.

79
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,053
Or did you really think it was funny?

80
00:02:50,078 --> 00:02:51,213
It was really funny.

81
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:53,302
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Carl.

82
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:55,086
Uh, this is my colleague.

83
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:57,001
Dan Charles. Nice to meet you.

84
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,787
- The famous Dr. Charles.
- Uh-oh.

85
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,526
Uh, Jackie, can we talk for a minute?

86
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:02,551
Sure.

87
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:03,837
I'll see you later,

88
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:05,951
and it was nice to meet you both.

89
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:09,189
Penny, honey, get your stuff together.

90
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,103
No.

91
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,453
I've been trying to admit a patient

92
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:16,630
into the Med Surg Unit
for the past two hours.

93
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,111
No, do not put me on hold.

94
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:21,548
Man.

95
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,506
Place is jumping
for a Wednesday morning.

96
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:26,683
Jackson-Monroe closure,
the gift that keeps on giving.

97
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,685
Pharmacy dropped off our restock.

98
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,165
I noticed.

99
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,123
When are they sending a tech
to scan into the Pyxis?

100
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,951
Well, they're understaffed,
so they can't send someone

101
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,170
till this afternoon.

102
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,519
We're not gonna last that long.

103
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,042
I'm already running low
on Zofran and Tylenol.

104
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,871
My concern exactly,
which is why I was hoping...

105
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,699
No. No.

106
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,180
RNs are not responsible
for stocking the Pyxis.

107
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:47,400
- That's the pharmacy's job.
- Yes.

108
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,576
And believe me,
I already gave them an earful.

109
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:52,361
But despite said earful,
they can't send someone

110
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:53,576
till this afternoon.

111
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,060
I'll get to it as soon as possible.

112
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:58,019
Or make someone else do it.
You're the boss.

113
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,500
Delegate.

114
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,068
Everything OK?

115
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,461
No.

116
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,898
Carl filed a petition to relocate

117
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:10,988
- and to take Penny with him.
- What? Where?

118
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,774
Wyoming. It's where his folks live.

119
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,384
I was just getting my brain
around the fact

120
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:16,733
that we're divorcing, and now he wants

121
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,561
to take my kid 1,000 miles away.

122
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:20,171
You want to go grab a cup of coffee?

123
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,390
I can't. My shift is starting.

124
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,522
- I'll take the heat.
- I mean...

125
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:24,437
- I can't lose it.
- OK, OK.

126
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:25,916
- OK, we'll talk later.
- I'm around.

127
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,267
OK.

128
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,881
- Hey.
- Hey.

129
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,274
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

130
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,407
- No, no.
- It's time.

131
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:41,932
So what happened?

132
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:45,849
You never made it back
to my place last night.

133
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,329
Yeah, yeah.

134
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,113
Um,

135
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:52,769
I guess I stayed at the bar
a little later than I expected.

136
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,163
Figured I should head straight in here

137
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:57,383
and try and get a few hours
of sleep before my shift,

138
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,689
- you know?
- Yeah, sure.

139
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,127
But a text would have been cool.

140
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:04,172
Right, yeah.

141
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:08,829
Uh, I... I think...

142
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,702
I think I left my phone at the bar.

143
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,227
I'll, uh... I'll go back
at lunch and pick it up.

144
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:19,187
Maybe take a personal day.

145
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:21,276
Why? I'm already here.

146
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:22,799
You've got to be exhausted.

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,149
As somebody who has worked hungover,

148
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,022
I don't recommend it.

149
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,938
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just...

150
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,027
I just need a shot
of espresso to wake up.

151
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:34,985
OK?

152
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:36,813
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
take a run to the coffee truck.

153
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:39,224
- You want anything?
- Uh, no, I'm good.

154
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,035
But...

155
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,516
you might want this.

156
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:45,166
Thanks.

157
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:46,715
Mm-hmm.

158
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:53,439
Dr. Asher, we have a pregnant
Jane Doe coming in from a fall.

159
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:59,488
Any idea how old she is
or how far along?

160
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:01,098
No identification, no purse.

161
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:03,666
CPD's investigating it
as a suspected robbery.

162
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,059
Wait, so someone pushed a pregnant woman

163
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,453
off of a pedestrian bridge
just to steal her purse?

164
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,368
- How far was the drop?
- About 10 feet.

165
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,195
Thank goodness she landed
on her side and not her belly.

166
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:12,849
OK, everybody, nice and gentle.

167
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,199
Let's maintain the C-spine
and secure the ET tube.

168
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,376
Come on.

169
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,855
All right, on my count.

170
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:22,250
One, two, three. Nice and gentle.

171
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,426
Let's get a fetal Doppler.
Prep the ultrasound.

172
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:29,431
OK.

173
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,216
Clear breath sounds bilaterally.

174
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,566
She's wearing a wedding ring.

175
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,524
Let's hope her spouse
is looking for her.

176
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:37,439
Baby's heart rate's dropping.

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,136
Baby's measuring about 23 weeks,

178
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:41,704
but that could be off by as much
as two weeks either direction.

179
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,097
If the baby's less than 21 weeks...

180
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:45,055
- It won't be viable.
- Heart rate's down to 85.

181
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,057
OK, I have to do a crash C-section.

182
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:49,059
Call the OR. Come on.

183
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,844
Let's go.

184
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,150
We have 20 minutes, tops,
to get this baby out.

185
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:59,109

- <font color="#0080ff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

186
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:04,611
Left, right. Good.

187
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:09,382
Now, follow this all the way
over here and here.

188
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,518
Well, your extraocular
movements are intact,

189
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,477
your pupils are equal,
round, and reactive,

190
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,827
and I reviewed your post-op head CT,

191
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,525
and there's absolutely no evidence

192
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:20,830
of any traumatic injury,

193
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,224
and you haven't had a fall since then.

194
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,530
- Correct?
- No.

195
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,445
Right, well, that's all good news,

196
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,664
but still doesn't explain your concern.

197
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:30,579
So I'd like to refer you to a colleague

198
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,189
for further evaluation.

199
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,365
An ophthalmologist?

200
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:37,247
A neuropsychiatrist, one
of the best in the business.

201
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:40,197
- Dr. Eleanor Hess.
- A psychiatrist?

202
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:43,679
Yeah, hey, look, Dr. Hess
isn't some quack shrink

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,725
like your pal Dr. Charles.
She's a real doctor.

204
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,509
Right.

205
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,035
Well, I appreciate
your concern, Dr. Abrams,

206
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,690
but, you know, honestly,
I think I just need more sleep.

207
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:58,520
Thanks again for seeing me
on such short notice.

208
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,871
For you, Ms. Goodwin, of course.

209
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,526
It's OK, honey. It's OK.

210
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:05,658
Doctor's almost done.

211
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,748
- You're almost done, right?
- All done.

212
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:11,533
Sorry about that, Abby,
but the good news is

213
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,230
I don't think it's appendicitis.

214
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:16,625
Abby's pain isn't confined
to the lower right quadrant.

215
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,540
We read that pain from appendicitis

216
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,629
can be generalized in infants and kids.

217
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,501
True, but Abby doesn't have a fever.

218
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,112
Yet. She doesn't have a fever yet.

219
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:28,419
Look, I know we're being
those obnoxious parents, but...

220
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,204
It's fine. It's fine.

221
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,423
Doris, let's do
a full appendicitis workup...

222
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,731
CBC, BMP, urinalysis,
and ultrasound of the appendix.

223
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:38,473
And, uh, let's give IV fluids,

224
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,127
two of morphine and two of Zofran.

225
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:42,477
- Thank you, Dr. Ripley.
- Yeah, sure thing.

226
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:47,917
Don't you want to order CRP
to test for inflammation?

227
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,266
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

228
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,442
Just making sure you're
paying attention, Doris.

229
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:52,531
Right.

230
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,749
Hey.

231
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,578
I hate to ask, but I'm gonna need you

232
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:57,840
to restock the Pyxis.

233
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:00,190
No, that's the pharmacy's job.

234
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:02,712
Yes, I know, but they can't
send anyone until this afternoon.

235
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:04,562
I'm juggling four patients,
including one critical.

236
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,761
That's still four to one.

237
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:07,371
Critical patient counts as two.

238
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:09,025
I almost never pull rank, Doris.

239
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,374
You know that.

240
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,074
But I am not asking you
to restock the Pyxis.

241
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:19,296
Don't forget this.

242
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,385
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

243
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,563
- OK?
- Thank you so much.

244
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,565
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

245
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,002
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:32,309
Hey, what's... what's
Dr. Collins doing here?

247
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,529
Uh, my patient, Rosie,
lives in a sober living

248
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,922
residence for teens.

249
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:37,488
Dr. Collins is the
clinical director there.

250
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:38,577
That's right.

251
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,926
She was considering taking that job.

252
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,781
So what's going on with the kid?

253
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:43,059
Is it a relapse?

254
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,063
Uh, no. Drugs aren't involved.

255
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:50,458
Rolled her ankle
coming down from a layup.

256
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,807
Oh.

257
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:55,289
Uh, so we're just getting some X-rays.

258
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,727
Well, sounds like a plan.

259
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:04,080
- OK, well...
- So did she ask for me at all?

260
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,953
Did she ask if I was working today?

261
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,563
- She didn't, no.
- Oh.

262
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,820
- Bad breakup?
- Bad?

263
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,263
No, no, no, no.

264
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,309
It wasn't bad.
I didn't think it was bad.

265
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,225
- What happened?
- What happened?

266
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,488
We had a fight and, uh,

267
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:23,665
you know, it was my fault, admittedly.

268
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,362
Shocking.

269
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:28,017
I texted her to apologize,
see if she wanted

270
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:30,890
to have a drink, and she just said that

271
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:34,415
she needed some time to think.

272
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,938
- That's understandable.
- Yeah.

273
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,072
So... well, you know, that was that.

274
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:41,901
Wait, you... you just didn't respond?

275
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,729
The writing was on the wall.

276
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,904
What writing?

277
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:46,993
You...

278
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,778
I mean, she asked for a minute,
and then you just disappeared.

279
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,477
- No.
- Yes.

280
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:57,657
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but, um, you ghosted her.

281
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,099
Ghosted her.

282
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:10,669
Dr. Asher, this is William Tompkins.

283
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,148
You just delivered his wife, Vivian.

284
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,196
Hi.

285
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:14,872
Please tell me Vivian
and the baby are OK.

286
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,593
She wasn't due for another four months.

287
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,720
Both mom and baby pulled through.

288
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,896
Oh, thank God.

289
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,898
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

290
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,684
Now your baby girl is
intubated to help her breathe,

291
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,555
but she's already trying
to fight the tube

292
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,557
- and breathe on her own.
- OK.

293
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,602
And Viv, how's Viv?

294
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:33,300
Vivian will be OK.

295
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,476
She did start to hemorrhage
after delivery.

296
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:38,044
Ultimately, I needed
to perform a hysterectomy.

297
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,306
No.

298
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,614
We needed to do it to save her life.

299
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,966
I'm gonna kill the son of a bitch

300
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,445
who did this to her. I swear to God.

301
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:51,057
Mr. Tompkins,
I understand your rage, I do.

302
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,712
But when your wife wakes up,
she may remember what happened,

303
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,322
and she may not.

304
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:58,107
I need you to be calm when you see her.

305
00:11:58,108 --> 00:11:59,761
Can you do that?

306
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,459
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

307
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,331
Of course.

308
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,811
This way.

309
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:13,297
Viv, honey?

310
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,692
- Will?
- Hey.

311
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:18,502
Hi.

312
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:23,872
The baby, where... where is she?

313
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:26,440
The baby is here. OK, Cora is here.

314
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,094
Dr. Asher delivered her, and...

315
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,182
Is she...

316
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,967
She's small, but she's a fighter.

317
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,144
I can tell already.

318
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:41,107
I'm sorry.

319
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,023
Why are you apologizing?

320
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,808
It happened so fast.

321
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,679
This was not your fault, Viv.

322
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,638
I was looking over the railing.

323
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,640
Someone attacked you, honey.

324
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,686
And the cops are gonna find
whoever did this, and...

325
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,385
No one attacked me.

326
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,388
I don't understand.

327
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,875
I heard this voice telling me...

328
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,529
T-telling you what?

329
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,712
I'm so sorry, honey.

330
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:25,326
I just... I couldn't take it anymore.

331
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:28,981
Vivian, did you jump?

332
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,855
I'm so sorry.

333
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,291
She's tachycardic.

334
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:37,132
Vivian, I need you to stop talking

335
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:38,729
and take a few deep breaths, OK?

336
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,035
She needs to rest now. I need you...

337
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,341
Viv, you almost
killed our baby and yourself?

338
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:42,559
- You need... you need to leave.
- Viv?

339
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,734
- Please.
- No, wait.

340
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:44,866
Come on. Come on. You need to leave.

341
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,346
Look at me. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

342
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:48,261
Take a deep breath.

343
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,959
And breathe out.

344
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,396
Breathe in. Breathe out.

345
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:54,920
It's OK.

346
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:58,098
Good job. It's OK.

347
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,103
Oh, Dr. Ripley.

348
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,322
Abby Campbell's labs
and imaging just posted.

349
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:07,628
- What's the headline?
- What do you think?

350
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,847
Everything was normal. It's...

351
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,978
Norovirus.

352
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,894
Her parents are probably gonna
want a stool sample to confirm.

353
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,114
Yeah, well, they can go to
their primary care for that.

354
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,550
Prepare a discharge, and I'll...

355
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:17,943
I'll sign off when I'm back in an hour.

356
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,205
I'm taking my lunch.

357
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:21,425
An hour for lunch, must be nice.

358
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:27,420
Sharon, good morning.

359
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:28,663
Good morning.

360
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:30,477
It is so good to see you
looking so well.

361
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:32,871
- I appreciate that, Debbie.
- Good. Well, shall we?

362
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,961
Actually, Peter, I was gonna
suggest that we relocate

363
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,397
the meeting to your office.

364
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:38,746
Yeah, sure. I'll get...

365
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,226
I'm afraid I have a time crunch.

366
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:41,749
Got a plane to catch.

367
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,359
Meeting won't take long, right, Peter?

368
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,884
- Uh, it shouldn't.
- Of course not.

369
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,929
Please.

370
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:54,414
Would you like something
to drink, Debbie?

371
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,590
- Water would be great.
- I'll get it.

372
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,592
Where are you flying off to?

373
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:01,073
We're visiting our oldest
and the grandbabies.

374
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,118
- Here you go, Sharon.
- Thank you.

375
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,467
So, how old are those grandkids now?

376
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:07,340
Izzy's four and Penny's seven.

377
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,429
- No, no.
- Please.

378
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,692
Please, please, please!

379
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,087
Oh, my. Oh, oh.

380
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:16,740
- Careful there, Sharon.
- Just leave it.

381
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,218
- I'll call housekeeping.
- Let me get you a tissue.

382
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:19,439
- Oh.
- OK.

383
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,657
Uh, you know, forget that.
I'm calling a doctor.

384
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,877
No, no, no, it... I don't need a doctor.

385
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,792
I need a Band-Aid.

386
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,315
Look, I'm fine.

387
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,796
Really, really. I'm... I'm fine.

388
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,801
Hey.

389
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,672
Dr. Archer, got a minute?

390
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:37,761
It's about my patient
from Dr. Collins' facility.

391
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,024
OK, what's up?

392
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,635
I was reviewing Rosie's chart,
and I saw she had stitches

393
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,593
about a month ago for
a 3-centimeter laceration

394
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,813
- over her right eyebrow.
- OK.

395
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,641
But when I was wrapping Rosie's ankle,

396
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:50,296
I couldn't help but notice
there's no scar.

397
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:52,298
- What?
- It's like it never happened.

398
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:53,473
There's nothing there.

399
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,562
Well, then, it's not possible.

400
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,303
It wouldn't heal that fast.

401
00:15:57,304 --> 00:16:00,393
And when I asked Rosie
about it, she got very cagey.

402
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,178
She said she had a minor fall,
and Dr. Collins stitched her up.

403
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,963
Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

404
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,922
Margo doesn't do sutures.
She's an addiction specialist.

405
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,663
Yeah, you understand my confusion.

406
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:13,537
Maybe you want to talk
to Dr. Collins about it?

407
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:22,067
So, Dr. Asher told me that
you reported hearing a voice

408
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,459
right before you jumped.

409
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,113
Can you remember what it said?

410
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,594
That...

411
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,206
everyone would be better off if...

412
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:35,733
I wasn't here.

413
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,564
Had you heard the voice before?

414
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:45,046
Not a voice.

415
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,135
No, more of a...

416
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:50,356
a feeling, like a sinking feeling

417
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:53,228
in the pit of my stomach.

418
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,578
And when did that start?

419
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,800
A few months into the pregnancy.

420
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:03,151
This...

421
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,719
feeling that...

422
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,984
that she's doomed with me as her mom.

423
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:12,509
Did you share these concerns
with anyone?

424
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,425
Will.

425
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:20,951
He was really supportive

426
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,736
and patient.

427
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:25,391
And, of course, you know,
the feelings didn't go away.

428
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,436
No, they got worse.

429
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:30,526
I tried talking to my OB,
but she just said

430
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,572
it was the baby blues.

431
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,182
I'm sorry, Vivian.

432
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:36,445
Your feelings never should
have been discounted like that.

433
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:39,449
I wasn't trying to hurt my baby.

434
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,148
I-I swear.

435
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:46,325
I...

436
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,588
I thought

437
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:51,025
I was sparing her somehow.

438
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,333
I believe you.

439
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,769
I do.

440
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,380
Can I see her?

441
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,948
Can I see Cora, please?

442
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:09,954
I... I really need to make sure
that she's here.

443
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:11,524
You know what?

444
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:15,136
We, um... we will...

445
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,835
we will arrange a visit
as soon as we possibly can.

446
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,103
We tried to wake her up to
tell her it was time to go.

447
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,495
- She can hardly open her eyes.
- Stethoscope.

448
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:27,975
She just keeps falling back asleep.

449
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:29,629
And she's barely responding
when we call her name.

450
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,849
- Abby.
- Abby!

451
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,015
Abby.

452
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,027
Breathing's shallow. Abby.

453
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,042
Abby, wake up for me.

454
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,378
- Where am I?
- Abby, honey.

455
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:40,553
- Oh, Abby.
- Please open your eyes.

456
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,815
Doris, let's get a head CT stat

457
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,382
- and put her on a monitor.
- OK.

458
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:44,644
Head? You think there's
something wrong with her brain?

459
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,124
I thought you said
this was a stomach bug.

460
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,604
That was my belief, but now
she's had a change in mental status.

461
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,476
Why are you so behind
the eight ball here?

462
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:51,477
You were ready to discharge her,

463
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:52,826
and now she can't open her eyes.

464
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,132
Mr. Campbell,
I understand your frustration.

465
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:55,959
No, no, I don't think you do.

466
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,309
I want you off my daughter's case.

467
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,181
I want a different doctor.
Who do I speak to about that?

468
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,661
I'll, um...

469
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:03,184
I'll get Dr. Lenox.

470
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,882
OK?

471
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,057
You're done.

472
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:13,789
I don't get it.

473
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:16,130
She came in with stomach cramps
and vomiting.

474
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,807
Her ultrasound was normal.
Labs are normal.

475
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:19,960
And now it looks like
she might have stroked.

476
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:21,242
She's too young for that.

477
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,551
Did she appear jaundiced on intake?

478
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:24,684
Jaundiced? No.

479
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,903
And you checked her eyes too?

480
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,514
I would have noticed
if she was jaundiced, Hannah.

481
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:31,734
OK, I'm just trying to think
if there's any visual clues

482
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,781
you might have missed, you know?

483
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,957
You think I screwed up
because of last night?

484
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:37,962
Mitch.

485
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:39,718
I wouldn't be working
if I was in any way impaired.

486
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:41,527
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Look, I...

487
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,529
- It's not.
- I didn't miss anything.

488
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,747
All the puzzle pieces are there.

489
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,662
I just... they don't make sense.

490
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,708
OK.

491
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,840
Excuse me.

492
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,233
Dr. Lenox, hey.

493
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,453
Uh, did Abby's head CT come back yet?

494
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,498
I think it's best,
given the family's wishes,

495
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,517
if you step away from this.

496
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:00,850
Please.

497
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,678
Her head CT...

498
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,594
Completely normal.

499
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,161
What if it's meningitis?

500
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,685
It's my next thought as well.

501
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,948
I just talked to the family about an LP.

502
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:13,398
I'll keep you posted.

503
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:14,603
Thank you.

504
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:30,445
- Hey.
- Hey.

505
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,011
Figured I might run into you.

506
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:34,561
- Receipt in the bag?
- Yes, thank you.

507
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,671
So Dr. Tanaka-Reed asked me to consult

508
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:41,456
- on Rosie Peters' case.
- Why?

509
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:43,023
I thought it was just a sprain.

510
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,678
It is, but it has nothing
to do with her injury today.

511
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,070
- OK.
- Yeah.

512
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:50,552
So he noticed that Rosie
had recently had stitches.

513
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,598
Right. That's right.

514
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,164
She sustained a minor, just very minor,

515
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:57,385
fall at the residence,
and, uh, it was late.

516
00:20:57,386 --> 00:21:00,301
Urgent care was closed,
so I just stitched her up.

517
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,129
You sutured her?

518
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,391
Yes, Dean.

519
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:06,394
I am board certified
in internal medicine.

520
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:07,917
I can suture.

521
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:11,486
Extraordinarily well, apparently.
There's no scar.

522
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,271
Look, I... I don't know
why you're involving

523
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,794
yourself in this.

524
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:16,230
You're lucky that I'm involved, Margo,

525
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:18,101
because if you had gone
to any other attending,

526
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:20,060
then you wouldn't have this
opportunity to explain

527
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:22,323
what the hell is going on here.

528
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,325
She had a slip up
a few weeks ago, all right?

529
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,545
It was during a particularly
stressful moment.

530
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:29,896
She took two Percocet,
and she was distraught.

531
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,332
She is subjected
regularly to drug testing,

532
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,855
and she was gonna lose her scholarship

533
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,335
- when she tested positive.
- Right.

534
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,598
So you falsified
the procedure to justify

535
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,079
the drugs in her system.

536
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,517
You have no idea
what losing that scholarship

537
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:44,040
would have done to Rosie.

538
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,129
It would have sent her into a spiral,

539
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,784
truly jeopardizing her sobriety.

540
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,046
It's funny because I distinctly

541
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:51,700
remember making a similar argument

542
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:54,703
to you when you fired my son.

543
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:56,226
So it's all about you, then?

544
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:57,663
Uh, that's not what I'm saying.

545
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:58,925
Oh, really?

546
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:00,405
Because it seems like the only reason

547
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,536
you're upset is because
I didn't break the rules

548
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:02,624
when you wanted me to.

549
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,712
Now you're twisting my words.

550
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:06,411
Look, Sean isn't a kid.

551
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,238
I gave him plenty of chances
to change his behavior,

552
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,979
more than I should have, frankly,

553
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,024
and that is because of you.

554
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,547
- Oh, is that right?
- Yep.

555
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,288
And you know what?

556
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:16,377
You want to report me to the
medical board, go right ahead.

557
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,901
All I ask is that you just
leave Rosie out of it.

558
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:27,736
I appreciate you seeing me
on such short notice

559
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:30,217
and making the trip to Med.

560
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:33,916
Well, I am mostly retired.

561
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:36,266
I haven't found a hobby yet,

562
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:39,139
so my time is predominantly free.

563
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,011
And Dr. Abrams mentioned that you were

564
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,797
at Stanford previously.

565
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,451
What brings you to Chicago?

566
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,889
I wanted to be closer to family.

567
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,807
Sam's my nephew.

568
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,766
He didn't mention it?

569
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,202
Uh, he did not, no.

570
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:00,552
Well, it's only by marriage.

571
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:02,510
So don't think less of me.

572
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:08,517
Well, enough chit chat.

573
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,476
So, what's going on?

574
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:15,262
Why did you seek out Sam's opinion?

575
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:20,398
Lately, my peripheral vision seems off.

576
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,226
Like, um,

577
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:25,620
I'm not seeing accurately.

578
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,493
A blind spot?

579
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:30,625
No, not exactly.

580
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,143
A distortion?

581
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:33,953
I guess.

582
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,980
Are you seeing something
that's not there?

583
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,641
Yes.

584
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:49,339
Um...

585
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,734
Are you familiar with what
happened to me recently?

586
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:55,041
I am, yes.

587
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:57,391
I'm seeing her.

588
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:58,653
Her?

589
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,612
My attacker.

590
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:04,224
Her name is Cassidy.

591
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:08,010
I'm seeing visions of her

592
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,449
whenever I'm in my office.

593
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:13,539
Does she say anything to you?

594
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,978
No, she hasn't.

595
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:22,895
She just watches me.

596
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:26,507
That is deeply unsettling.

597
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,553
I'm so sorry.

598
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:37,823
- Hey.
- Hey.

599
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:39,389
I was just visiting Vivian Tompkins,

600
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,914
and she said that she's been
asking to see her baby.

601
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,393
Yeah, she did.

602
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,091
Was there an issue when you called NICU?

603
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:48,311
Didn't call the NICU
because, unfortunately,

604
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:51,184
her husband has just filed an
order of emergency protection

605
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:53,882
- on behalf of the kid.
- That seems extreme.

606
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,623
I think, from his perspective,

607
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:58,104
what Vivian did was extreme.

608
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:00,541
Do you think she's a threat
to her baby still?

609
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,065
Because she's expressed nothing
but remorse and regret.

610
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,545
We can't really do
anything until a judge

611
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,068
makes a ruling, right?

612
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:08,203
Well, what if the court
rules in her husband's favor?

613
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:10,246
Then what? She just
never gets to see her child?

614
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,132
I really don't think
that that's gonna happen.

615
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,641
I hope not.

616
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:19,038
I just attempted to put a splint

617
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,083
on the displaced fracture in 5,

618
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:22,911
and the patient was in so much pain

619
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,391
that I had to stop.

620
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,175
I administered morphine
prior to you getting there.

621
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:27,437
2 milligrams.

622
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:29,962
I found this on the Mayo stand.

623
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:32,094
You gave a grown man a child's dose.

624
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,748
No wonder he was in pain.

625
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,228
No, that's impossible.

626
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:38,753
I know that I drew up
8 milligrams for Mr. Billings.

627
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:41,843
What?

628
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:45,281
- Oh, my God.
- Um... oh, my God.

629
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,588
I was supposed to give
2 milligrams of morphine

630
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,850
to Abby Campbell.

631
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:52,288
- You mixed up their orders?
- Um, I'm sorry.

632
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,029
I-I don't know what happened.

633
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,770
Well, that explains Abby's symptoms.

634
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:57,076
She's got morphine toxicity.

635
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,208
Tracy, prepare 0.25 milligrams Narcan

636
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:00,775
- and meet me in Treatment 3.
- Wait, no, no, no.

637
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,429
I'll do it. I can do it.

638
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,257
No, you won't. Take a walk.

639
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,780
- You're off the floor.
- Doris?

640
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:07,434
What happened?

641
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:09,131
Doris accidentally gave Abby Campbell

642
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,220
- 8 milligrams of morphine.
- Wait, what?

643
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:14,397
Dr. Lenox, that was obviously a mistake.

644
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:17,096
It was a never event,
as in it can never happen.

645
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:18,793
- Doris has to go.
- Wait. Wait a second.

646
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:19,794
No.

647
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:23,102
Either you fire her, or I'm
taking this up the chain.

648
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,201
I believe you're suffering from PTSI.

649
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:37,072
It's post-traumatic stress injury.

650
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:40,249
It's an anxiety response

651
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,513
that can develop after a trauma,

652
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:46,516
and I'd like to refer you to a colleague

653
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,388
for cognitive behavioral therapy.

654
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:49,824
Another referral?

655
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,348
Well, I don't do long-term therapy.

656
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,611
Well, I was hoping this wouldn't be

657
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,438
a long-term problem.

658
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,831
You've been through a terrible trauma,

659
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:59,094
and it's gonna take
some time to work through it

660
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,705
on the cognitive level.

661
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:04,752
But there must be something
that can help my brain along,

662
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:05,927
like medication.

663
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:09,714
Well, we can certainly discuss SSRIs,

664
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:13,369
but I'd like to temper
your expectations.

665
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,111
These visual intrusions,

666
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:18,287
they don't just disappear,

667
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:20,334
even with medication.

668
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,423
Thank you for your time.

669
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,033
Oh, but our time's not up yet.

670
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:27,122
I'm afraid I have a meeting
I have to get to.

671
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:29,430
I hope you understand.

672
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:33,999
Uh,

673
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,957
do with this what you will,

674
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,917
but in my experience, when you try

675
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:41,660
to run away from your demons,
they chase you.

676
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:48,230
It was lovely meeting you, Dr. Hess.

677
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:51,494
- Eleanor.
- Eleanor.

678
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,322
Margo, can I speak
with you for a minute?

679
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:54,846
Uh, yeah.

680
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:56,369
Hey, why don't you guys
wait for me in the lobby,

681
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,372
and I'll bring the car around, OK?

682
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,766
OK, so, uh...

683
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,856
I'm not gonna report you, obviously.

684
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:06,118
Oh, thank you.

685
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,817
Bringing Sean up
was not only unnecessary,

686
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:12,690
but it was irrelevant.

687
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,779
But if I make our whole breakup

688
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,215
about what you did, then I...

689
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:19,784
Oh, you didn't make
our breakup about anything.

690
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:21,699
I only realized that after the fact.

691
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,396
I'm sorry if I ghosted you.

692
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:24,919
You absolutely ghosted me.

693
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,008
Well, that was not my intention.

694
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,923
Well, then what was your intention?

695
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,883
To...

696
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:37,716
To pull away from you
before you pulled away from me.

697
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:43,503
That's... that's very
self-aware of you, Dean.

698
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,157
Yeah.

699
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:48,595
And that's not meant
to be an excuse, by the way.

700
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:50,205
Well, what is it meant to be?

701
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:52,120
An apology.

702
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:54,340
Well, I...

703
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:56,559
I appreciate that. I do.

704
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,736
All right.

705
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:00,868
So what are you doing later?

706
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:05,220
You want to maybe
take a walk by the river

707
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:07,745
and talk some more?

708
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,356
I mean, just as friends.

709
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:14,273
Oh, well, I think

710
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:15,491
I have enough friends.

711
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,189
Oh, I get it. Oh, I get it.

712
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,234
No, I got a handful friends,

713
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:20,888
and it's already way too much.

714
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:25,458
Well, um... yeah, I should get going.

715
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,025
- I don't want...
- Yeah, I get it.

716
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,941
- To keep Rosie waiting.
- All right.

717
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:32,509
- Bye, Dean.
- Bye, Margo.

718
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,816
Hannah and I just got off the phone

719
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:39,341
with Judge Minkowski,
who is the judge, you know,

720
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:40,908
assigned to Vivian's case.

721
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,389
We both advocated that she
should have supervised visits

722
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,958
with her daughter,
and given the time sensitivity,

723
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:50,613
she's gonna issue a ruling
by the end of the day,

724
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,529
or that's what she says.

725
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:57,316
You know, Vivian made
a terrible mistake.

726
00:29:57,317 --> 00:30:00,058
She did, but I don't think
she should have to spend

727
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,668
the rest of her life paying for it.

728
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:05,150
Of course not. And neither should you.

729
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:06,847
Oh. I'm afraid I might.

730
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,895
Hey, look, just because Carl
is going for full custody

731
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:12,157
does not mean he's gonna get it.

732
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:14,028
He's gonna use my psych hold against me.

733
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,508
I know it.

734
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,543
He's already set up
a custody hearing for tomorrow.

735
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:21,514
And my lawyer...
I'm not confident in my lawyer.

736
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:23,733
You know what?

737
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,953
I want to set you up
with this guy, Larry Dale.

738
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:29,435
He's probably the best
family attorney in Chicago.

739
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,263
I can't afford the best anything.

740
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:32,917
Let me worry about that, OK?

741
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:36,094
Larry is a very soft touch with
friends and family discount,

742
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,400
not to mention I basically
put a wing on his house

743
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,838
with my troubles. So you know what?

744
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,491
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

745
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:45,668
That would be, um...

746
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:47,801
that would be amazing.

747
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:51,283
Look, man, I have, uh...

748
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:54,721
I've been where you are,
you know, like, a bunch.

749
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:57,680
It's just... it's really important

750
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:01,336
to just feel like you have
somebody in your corner.

751
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:02,991
You know?

752
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,214
You in here?

753
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:12,131
Hey.

754
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,225
We need to talk.

755
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,228
I know.

756
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:25,491
I could have seriously
hurt someone today.

757
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,188
You didn't.

758
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,973
That little girl's guzzling apple juice

759
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,237
and watching cartoons as we speak.

760
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:37,024
All of my years of nursing,

761
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,939
I have never made a mistake like that.

762
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,594
I know, Doris.

763
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:43,944
I know.

764
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,555
I just... I don't know what happened.

765
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,038
I do.

766
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,693
You're juggling too many patients.

767
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:55,782
And when you advised me
that you couldn't handle

768
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:57,785
any additional tasks, I...

769
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,832
I didn't listen.

770
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,312
Maggie, this is not on you.

771
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:06,925
It is. It is.

772
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,581
Listen,

773
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:13,931
I know you have to let me go.

774
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,758
I don't have to do anything.

775
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,326
What about Lenox?

776
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:23,244
Leave Lenox to me. OK?

777
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:30,860
So maintenance said it's not as big

778
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:33,428
- as your current office, but...
- No, it isn't.

779
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:36,954
You can't beat the location.

780
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,347
Of course, they'll clear all this out,

781
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:42,568
bring in your furniture,
hang your artwork.

782
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,874
Yeah, yeah.

783
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:47,399
And how long will it take?

784
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,228
They said it could be
move-in ready by Friday.

785
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:52,666
- Friday?
- Friday.

786
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:56,625
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

787
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:02,631
Sharon?

788
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:05,286
You OK?

789
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:08,594
I don't think this office will work.

790
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:28,744
Judge denied the husband's petition.

791
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:30,094
Yeah.

792
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,921
Vivian Corrigan will be allowed
supervised visits

793
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,467
while they're still in the hospital.

794
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:34,972
I'm so glad to hear that.

795
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,059
You know, maybe I'm being unfair,

796
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,453
but I just...

797
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:44,064
I just don't buy that no one
noticed she was in such a bad spot,

798
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,066
you know?

799
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:49,939
Not her friends, not her
husband, not her doctor?

800
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,245
I don't know.

801
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:55,206
I mean, human beings are
just endlessly inventive

802
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,077
in coming up with ways to not look

803
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,168
- at difficult stuff, right?
- Mm.

804
00:34:01,387 --> 00:34:03,041
Yeah.

805
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,086
Dr. Lenox.

806
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,566
How'd it go with Doris?

807
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,612
If Doris goes, I go.

808
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:12,049
Excuse me?

809
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,528
Dolores Perez has been
a nurse at Gaffney

810
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:15,791
for over 15 years,
and she's been nominated

811
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,185
for the Daisy Award
for Excellence in Nursing

812
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:20,144
three times in a row.

813
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:22,863
I understand. Today was
a particularly stressful day.

814
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:25,105
It's not just today, Dr. Lenox.

815
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:27,412
My nurses are regularly missing breaks,

816
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:29,936
balancing unsafe
patient-to-nurse ratios,

817
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,546
and being asked to perform duties

818
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:34,115
that are outside of our job description.

819
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:36,902
Like restocking the Pyxis.

820
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,364
Like that.

821
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,340
Well, I certainly can't afford to lose

822
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:44,777
two senior members of
the nursing staff right now.

823
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:46,213
I didn't think so.

824
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:49,695
And beyond that,
the situation you're describing

825
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:52,132
is unsafe and untenable.

826
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,135
I'm giving my State of the ED
address to the board next week.

827
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:57,703
I'll make it a top action item.

828
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:59,661
What's an action item?

829
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:03,143
It's code for I will
hound you until it gets done.

830
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,928
So either agree to it now or...

831
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:07,582
Face the wrath of Lenox.

832
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,770
You'll be shocked to hear this,

833
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:13,022
but it's not a pleasant wrath.

834
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,856
Oh.

835
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:23,163
Come in.

836
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,339
- Hey.
- Hey.

837
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,645
Just wanted to let you know,

838
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:27,950
maintenance will have another office

839
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,127
for us to look at tomorrow.

840
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,174
You know, I think I'm gonna stay put.

841
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,959
I'm sorry you went to all that trouble.

842
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,222
There's no trouble.

843
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,875
And I hope you're not regretting

844
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,747
coming back to work for me.

845
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:43,227
Never, Sharon.

846
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,794
After everything that's happened,

847
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:49,058
it's just a real comfort
having you back with me.

848
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,364
Stop, stop, stop.

849
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:51,931
You're gonna make me emotional.

850
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:59,547
OK, well, I'm really glad
you're not moving,

851
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,897
'cause I always loved this office.

852
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:03,856
- Yeah.
- Me too.

853
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:06,206
All right.

854
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,643
- Well, I will see you tomorrow.
- OK.

855
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:10,864
- Have a good night.
- You too.

856
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,420
Hey.

857
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,465
Hey.

858
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,728
So what's going on
with your patient's parents?

859
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,686
They gonna sue?

860
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:54,080
Surprisingly, no.

861
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:56,952
It turns out what they preach
in those legal meetings

862
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,825
is true.

863
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:02,176
You know, owning a mistake right away

864
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:07,136
and apologizing immediately,
it, uh, goes a long way.

865
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:08,313
Good.

866
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,318
On that note...

867
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:19,540
I'm sorry I made you worry last night.

868
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:22,630
And, um, that's the first thing

869
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:24,966
I should have said this morning.

870
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:28,201
Sorry if I got in your head today.

871
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:31,204
I didn't mean to do that,

872
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:33,773
make you second guess yourself.

873
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,005
How about a cozy night on the couch?

874
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:54,793
Take-out and reality television.

875
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:57,535
Tell you what, how about
you get things started?

876
00:37:57,536 --> 00:38:00,215
I'm gonna grab a drink with the guys.

877
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,633
I won't be long.

878
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:07,982
What?

879
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,636
That's what you said last night.

880
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:13,507
Scout's honor.

881
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:15,204
And the night before that

882
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,946
and the night before that.

883
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:19,774
Didn't realize you were keeping count.

884
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:22,037
Trust me, I don't want to be, but...

885
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:23,431
But what?

886
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,391
I'm worried... maybe we should wait

887
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:28,827
until we get to my place to have this...

888
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:32,047
What are you worried
about, Hannah? Just say it.

889
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:33,788
I'm worried you're trying
to numb your grief.

890
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,400
With alcohol?

891
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,663
Look, I don't want you to go down...

892
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:40,012
I think you got us confused, Hannah.

893
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:42,057
That's your issue, not mine.

894
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,539
- Wow.
- I... I just mean that...

895
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,280
No, I know what you mean.

896
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,586
Do whatever you want tonight.

897
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:03,863
Yes?

898
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,040
- Hey.
- Hello.

899
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,824
I just wanted to grab the number of that

900
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:11,913
child custody attorney from you.

901
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:13,437
Already called him.

902
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:16,178
Yeah, he should be reaching out
by the end of the night.

903
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,224
Of course, you did that.

904
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:21,706
Hey, for the record,
I'm really glad to have you

905
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:23,795
- in my corner, Daniel.
- Oh, come on.

906
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:26,712
No, it means more than you know.

907
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:31,890
It's all gonna work out.

908
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,597
You're gonna really like this guy.

909
00:39:46,622 --> 00:39:47,926
You're gonna love him,
as a matter of fact.

910
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:49,429
I bet.

911
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,257
Yeah.

912
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,651
OK.

913
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:56,436
Anyway, um, good night.

914
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,526
Good night.

915
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,015
- Hey!
- Hey.

916
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:13,018
You're up. Rip!

917
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,149
You're up.

918
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:20,025
Take my spot.

919
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,548
I'll join next game.

920
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:23,899
Come on. Where you going?

921
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:28,034
For a walk.

922
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:33,821
Watch where you're going.

923
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:36,520
Hey! Hey, you... you hear me?

924
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:39,348
- Hey.
- Yeah, I heard you.

925
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:41,655
And you got something to say?

926
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:43,352
- Leave it alone, man.
- No, no.

927
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:45,180
You ran into me.

928
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:49,141
Get out of my face.

929
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:51,317
Make me.
