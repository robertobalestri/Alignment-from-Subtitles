1
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:08,137
<i>A few days ago, I
received a death threat.</i>

2
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:09,704
Well, did they find
out who sent it?

3
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:14,448
Not yet, but working theory
is a disgruntled employee.

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,841
I thought you looked familiar.

5
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:20,410
Think maybe people will
forget about this soon?

6
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:22,151
It's not every day you
find out your colleague

7
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:24,849
<i>was a teen heartthrob.</i>

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,591
<i>Most emergency departments
don't have an OB specialist,</i>

9
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,941
<i>so I'm curious if you find
your position essential.</i>

10
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:32,292
I just thought, as a woman,
you'd appreciate having someone

11
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:34,250
who specializes
in women's health.

12
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,644
As a woman, I do appreciate it.

13
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,350
Are you dancing?

14
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:50,092
No, I had a cramp in my calf.

15
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:56,403
Okay, listen up, everybody.
I just got confirmation.

16
00:00:56,404 --> 00:01:00,059
We've got a code orange coming
in in T-minus ten minutes.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,364
Are we ready for that?

18
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:03,105
Let me tell you
something. We better be.

19
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:06,195
Halloween night can be one
of the busiest of the year.

20
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:08,545
Be smart about triage
and resource management,

21
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:10,852
and don't get too caught
up in the pageantry.

22
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:12,723
I expect the highest
level of decorum.

23
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,638
Hey, stop right there!

24
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,081
It's gonna be a long night.

25
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,082
Almost there, bud.

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,431
Almost there, Coop.

27
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:27,608
Hang in there, Superman.
Hang in there, buddy.

28
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:30,132
All right, Coop.
Almost, buddy.

29
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,440
You're good, you're
good, you're good.

30
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,094
Whoa.

31
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,139
How did he even get it in there?

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,838
I... no... mm.

33
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,276
- Does that taste good, bud?
- Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:45,974
Two birds, one
lollipop. Right on.

35
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:48,411
Ow, Superman!

36
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:50,674
You're so strong.
You're so strong.

37
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,459
Wow. Excellent costume choice.

38
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,764
But this tracks, right?

39
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,418
I mean, you never
just see one minion.

40
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:56,724
Facts.

41
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,204
Hey, Dr. Frost.

42
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,814
Oh, no.

43
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,949
Both: That was a close one.

44
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,429
What do you think?

45
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,430
I think you should watch
higher-quality television.

46
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:12,131
You're kind of low-key famous.

47
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,306
Very low-key.

48
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,438
Among millennial females
of a certain age.

49
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,484
I've never seen "Nick
of Time!" Sorry.

50
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,138
Thank God. We'll get along.

51
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,444
Yeah, we will.

52
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:24,839
Oh, I'm guessing
this was coordinated.

53
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,798
I wanted to be an astronaut.

54
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,714
Yes, but every hero
needs a sidekick.

55
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,151
Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,282
Well, I'm gonna hit the head.

57
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,242
Well, make it
quick. We need you.

58
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:38,809
Things are going well, I see.

59
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,160
Yeah, he's really been
showing up lately.

60
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,683
Showing up?

61
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,884
The man literally dressed
like a Ken doll to please you.

62
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,209
Sweetie, he's head over heels.

63
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,472
Mm.

64
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:52,388
Okay, the prenatal
clinic head count

65
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:55,217
is three patients in five days.

66
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,305
Lenox is gonna pull the plug

67
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:57,741
if we don't get
those numbers up.

68
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,221
Doesn't help that she
keeps us on a tight leash.

69
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,310
All we need is to
get the word out.

70
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,444
- Yeah, I hope you're right.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:07,751
Jackie, weren't you supposed to

72
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,840
go to a Halloween party
with your daughter tonight?

73
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:12,278
There was a change of plans,
so I picked up a shift.

74
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,497
Oh, good. We got a
code orange on its way.

75
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:16,325
Oh, well, I should get
changed quickly, then.

76
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,500
No, it's gonna have to wait.

77
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,198
I need you on the floor.

78
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,985
Everybody, timeline's moved
up. Battle stations now!

79
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:25,116
- You ready?
- Come on!

80
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,683
- Let's do it.
- All right.

81
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:27,771
All right.

82
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,512
Make sure you have enough candy.

83
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,471
Make sure you have enough.

84
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:35,344
Thank you.

85
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,520
All: Trick or treat!

86
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:40,393
- Happy Halloween!
- Happy Halloween, guys!

87
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:49,184
Happy Halloween. There you go.

88
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:50,533
Yeah.

89
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,969
Yeah, I understand,

90
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,362
but we have to work with

91
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:57,236
the resources that
we have available.

92
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,715
Well, yeah, that's a good point.

93
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:01,762
But let's keep that in
mind when we have to,

94
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:04,547
uh, tackle that
fourth quarter budget.

95
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,422
Yeah, okay.

96
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,468
Yeah. Yeah.

97
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,297
Well, you know,

98
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:20,084
for now, why don't we
just stay the course?

99
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:27,614
Um...

100
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:30,094
let's pick this
up in the morning.

101
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:31,445
O-Okay.

102
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,326
Who's there?

103
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,678
I've already called the police!

104
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:57,426
Ah!

105
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:59,210
That stings!

106
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:00,342
Kyle!

107
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:03,127
Oh, Kyle! Oh,
no, I'm so sorry.

108
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:04,433
Are you okay?

109
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,217
Come on, let's go
get your mother.

110
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,262
Come on.

111
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,229
All right, Kyle, we're gonna
hold this over your eyes.

112
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,361
Can you do that for me?
- Yeah.

113
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,363
Great. He'll be fine.

114
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,409
We irrigated his eyes, no
sign of corneal damage.

115
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,628
Just need to manage
the swelling now.

116
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,195
Thank you, Dr. Frost.

117
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,196
Of course.

118
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:35,246
Helen, I am so sorry about this.

119
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:39,295
Is there anything I could do
to make it up to both of you?

120
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:44,734
Can I have all your
peanut butter cups?

121
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,519
Mom, don't guilt-trip
Ms. Goodwin.

122
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,085
It was an accident.

123
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:50,261
No worries, Kyle.

124
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:51,698
It's a deal.

125
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,178
But seriously, Sharon,

126
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,963
someone was in your house?

127
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:58,052
That's terrifying.
- Well, I think it was.

128
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:01,185
But honestly, I've been
a little keyed up lately.

129
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:05,755
CPD is doing a full
sweep of the house, so.

130
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,757
Hopefully it's nothing.
- Yeah.

131
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:13,241
I saw your flyer at
the community center

132
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:15,069
about prenatal screenings.

133
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,810
Yes. Yes, that's right.

134
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,202
Um, unfortunately, though,

135
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:20,117
our clinic hours are
over for the day.

136
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,554
When... when are they?

137
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:25,122
Weekdays from 11:00
a.m. to 4:00 p.m.

138
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:28,691
Um, I work then. Just
about everybody does.

139
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:33,479
Yeah, I... can you come in
on one of your days off?

140
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,484
Um, yeah, it's been a while
since I've had one of those.

141
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,965
Is... is there any way
that you can see me now?

142
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:44,577
I mean, something just...
it doesn't feel right.

143
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,846
Yeah, you know, let me...
let me see what I can do.

144
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,196
Okay, thank you.

145
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:58,939
So he escaped from
the psych ward?

146
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,984
Yep. Name's Ted Kachler.

147
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,551
He's got a pretty
nasty gash on his arm

148
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:05,293
after security tackled
him at the front entrance.

149
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,687
We're waiting on X-rays
before sending him back up.

150
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:10,298
And why did Dr. Cuevas hold
him in the first place?

151
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:12,822
Well, the police brought
him in for erratic behavior

152
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,476
during a domestic dispute.

153
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:18,001
He was pretty unhinged and
paranoid during intake.

154
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,395
Thank you.

155
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,266
This is all a huge
misunderstanding.

156
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,225
Ted, how are you
doing? I'm Dr. Charles.

157
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:27,924
Um, Jackie has been
telling me that, uh,

158
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:30,753
you were involved in
an incident at home?

159
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:36,019
Yeah, which Becca has totally
blown out of proportion

160
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,412
for her advantage.
- Okay.

161
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,066
So Becca is your...
your partner?

162
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,502
Your... your wife?

163
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,025
Not for long.

164
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:44,898
Um, we're in the middle
of a nasty divorce,

165
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,117
and she is... she's
trying to sue me

166
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:48,467
for full custody of
our daughter, Ella.

167
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,817
Oh, well, I'm really
sorry to hear that.

168
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,079
I mean, divorce...

169
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,952
Divorce, uh, sucks.

170
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:58,955
Yeah, uh... um, the thing is,

171
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,523
the custody hearing
is tomorrow morning,

172
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,873
and I'm... I'm stuck in here.
- Uh-huh.

173
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:06,223
So that's why you were trying
to get out of the hospital?

174
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,357
I can't lose my
little girl, doc.

175
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,448
I hear you. Really, I do.

176
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:17,191
Um, the thing is Dr. Cuevas
probably wouldn't have

177
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,975
put you on a psych hold
without a pretty good reason.

178
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,064
So if you don't mind, can you
just tell me a little bit more

179
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,762
about what happened?

180
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,285
Look, I...

181
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:26,243
I lost my temper, okay?

182
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:29,769
I... I was... I was
tired, I was stressed.

183
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,205
I don't know.

184
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:36,036
Um, my... my... my brain,
it just suddenly glitched.

185
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:39,387
Okay, so when you say that
your brain suddenly glitched,

186
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,737
can you get a little
more specific about that?

187
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:44,740
I mean, was it... did you see
something or hear something

188
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,394
out of the ordinary, or...

189
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:47,961
No, I...

190
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,618
I just lost control, okay?

191
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,750
But I feel totally fine now.

192
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,926
But I'm thinking that
it's actually probably

193
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,276
in all of our best interests
to drill down and figure out

194
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:01,235
what's going on
with this glitch.

195
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:03,585
I don't... I don't know
what to say, you know?

196
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,152
I... I freaked out,

197
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:08,242
and now I find myself
suddenly in a psych ward.

198
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:10,940
- Right.
- Which I do not belong in.

199
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,376
Okay.

200
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,030
Look, I want you to try
and relax a little bit,

201
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,511
'cause we gotta wait
for your X-ray anyway.

202
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:19,470
But, um, we are gonna get
to the bottom of this, okay?

203
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,951
And I want you to
trust me on that.

204
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:24,040
- Okay.
- Good. Thank you.

205
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,955
Um, we'll check back in a bit.

206
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,221
I did Ted's intake.

207
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:33,484
He's got IBS,
asthma, hypertension,

208
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:36,662
but absolutely no history
of mental illness.

209
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,315
So you're thinking that

210
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:40,535
this <i>is</i> just a legal tactic
on the part of the wife?

211
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,929
It's worth considering, yeah.

212
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,062
If his wife uses this psych
hold against him in court,

213
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,282
he might not ever
see his kid again.

214
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:49,631
Yeah, but I mean,

215
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,198
clearly there's something
going on here, right?

216
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,679
I mean, Ted himself
brought up this glitch.

217
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,333
Sometimes people
crack under pressure.

218
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:58,988
Doesn't make them mentally ill.
- Very true.

219
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,511
But, uh, you know what?

220
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:01,861
I just need a
better understanding

221
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,123
of what's going on here

222
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,472
before I release him
in good conscience.

223
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:08,607
So you know, let's, um,
let's figure it out.

224
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,999
<i>We already talked about this.</i>

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,566
Tonight's gonna be a madhouse.

226
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,176
I don't have the space for
the prenatal lab after hours.

227
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,657
Dr. Lenox, she took three
buses across town to be here.

228
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,617
Does she have an
acute medical need?

229
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,835
- No, but...
- Then please send her home.

230
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:20,836
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,185
All I'm asking for

232
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,360
are a few prenatal
labs and an ultrasound.

233
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:26,015
How long do you
need, Dr. Asher?

234
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,843
Hour, tops.

235
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,584
Dr. Lenox, given the extremes

236
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,978
the woman went
through to get here,

237
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,242
perhaps we can
make an exception.

238
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,680
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you, both of you.

239
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:42,684
You know, bending
isn't always breaking.

240
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,122
Bending means more
expectation to bend.

241
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
Excuse me. Can someone
please help me?

242
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,302
There's something
really wrong with him.

243
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:54,304
Dr. Frost, we need help here.

244
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:57,743
Hey. Let me take a look.

245
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:02,399
It's okay, it's okay.
Let's take a little look.

246
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,097
Baby's slightly cyanotic.

247
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,707
Can we get a cot crib, please?

248
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,056
- You're going to Trauma 1.
- All right.

249
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,275
Just follow me and tell
me what happened, okay?

250
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,711
I don't know. He just
started wheezing.

251
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,408
Okay, was he exposed
to cigarette smoke?

252
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,323
- No, I don't smoke or vape.
- Okay.

253
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:14,585
Was he sleeping near a vent?

254
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,805
No. He was fine
and then he wasn't.

255
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,416
Okay. Let's set him down.

256
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:22,855
Hey, buddy. You're
okay, you're okay.

257
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,726
All right.

258
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,383
Let's see what we got.

259
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,950
Okay, crackles bilaterally.

260
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:33,648
Let's get a CBC, BNP,
blood culture, X-ray,

261
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,390
and then swabs for COVID,
influenza, and RSV, all right?

262
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,391
- Copy.
- Thank you.

263
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:38,871
What's his name?
- Nate.

264
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,611
Hey, Nate. How are you
doing? Are you his mother?

265
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,352
Uh, no, I'm the
babysitter, Whitney.

266
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,745
Okay, well, Whitney,
I'm gonna want you

267
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,268
to call his mother for me, okay?

268
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,096
I already did.
She's on her way.

269
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:48,619
Will he be okay?

270
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,536
I'm gonna take very good
care of him, I promise.

271
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:57,803
Good evening. I'm Dr. Ripley.

272
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,282
Nice to meet you.

273
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,458
I'm Mary Katherine, but
people call me MK for short.

274
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,287
So the, uh, triage nurse
says that you've been

275
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,985
experiencing some
abdominal pain.

276
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:07,116
That's right.

277
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,727
Any chance you just, uh,

278
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,599
had too much to drink at
a Halloween party, sister?

279
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,341
I haven't had a
drink in 20 years.

280
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:16,430
And the only party I'm attending

281
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,780
is my weekly sewing circle.

282
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:21,609
At the rectory.

283
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,481
I... I am so sorry, sister.

284
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:27,093
Oh, don't be. It's...
it's Halloween night.

285
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,485
I get it.

286
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:31,488
So how long have you
been experiencing pain?

287
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,664
Off and on for about a month.

288
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:37,190
Any, uh... any dietary
changes lately?

289
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:40,062
Halloween candy is my weakness.

290
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,672
Well, sugar can impact health,

291
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:44,240
but, uh, it's unlikely to
cause an acute episode.

292
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,155
Uh, would you mind
sitting back for me?

293
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,505
Of course.

294
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:51,726
- May I?
- Yeah.

295
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:04,695
I think we're looking
at diverticulitis.

296
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,523
It's an inflammation
of the large intestine.

297
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,264
We usually treat it
with antibiotics.

298
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:09,875
Mm.

299
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,094
So how about we start with a
CT scan to get a closer look,

300
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:13,269
and uh, we'll take
it from there?

301
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,880
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

302
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,360
<i>Uh, his name is Nate Sullivan.</i>

303
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:19,362
He's three months old.
Uh, my babysitter...

304
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,451
- Lynne.
- Whitney... oh, Rip.

305
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,889
Uh, Nate was brought
in with a fever?

306
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,412
Oh, I'm... I'm
sorry to hear that.

307
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:27,631
He's in Trauma 1
with Dr. Frost.

308
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:28,850
Okay.

309
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,069
I'll walk over with
you so I can see him.

310
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,940
- Okay.
- You've... you've been drinking?

311
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,551
Yeah, I had a few at a
bar with some friends.

312
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:37,032
Wait, you... you
took Nate to a bar?

313
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,425
No, I got him a babysitter.

314
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,427
That's... that's
who brought him in.

315
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:41,863
Has he been sick?

316
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,865
No, he...

317
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,519
he has a little cough.

318
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,390
So you left a sick baby
to go get hammered?

319
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,436
Do... I'm... I'm not hammered.

320
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:52,918
I went out for a little
Halloween celebration.

321
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,310
Unbelievable.

322
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:57,531
Screw you and your
judgment, Saint Rip.

323
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,533
I don't need this.

324
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,719
I just got Nate's X-rays back.

325
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,199
It looks like a mild
case of pneumonia,

326
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,983
but I think a course
of IV antibiotics

327
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,028
will clear it right up.

328
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,813
Thank you.

329
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:21,598
So... sorry, he's gonna be okay?

330
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,470
I'd like to keep him
overnight in the PICU

331
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:27,778
for observation, but I
expect him to be just fine.

332
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,258
I already requested
the transfer.

333
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:30,912
They'll be down in ten minutes.

334
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,481
Thank you so much.

335
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:36,700
You got it.

336
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:48,103
What? You got
something to say?

337
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,584
Honestly, I'm not
sure what to say.

338
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,325
Yeah?

339
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,196
Well, if you're so damn worried,

340
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,807
why don't you come over and
help me out once in a while?

341
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,117
I'm all alone with him.

342
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,424
When he doesn't
sleep, I don't sleep,

343
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:05,904
so I'm going crazy.

344
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,170
<i>Look at me.</i>

345
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:12,519
Look at Mommy, look at Mommy.

346
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,650
Shh, shh. Hey, hey.
Please just sit for Mommy.

347
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:14,738
I just need you to sit.

348
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,175
I just need you
to sit for Mommy.

349
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,872
Look what I found, Leo.

350
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,441
- Look what I found.
- Hey, hey, hey.

351
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,227
Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

352
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,882
Just play your game, okay?

353
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,667
Okay.

354
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:35,455
Sorry, it's, um... it's
been a long day for him.

355
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,500
No, no, it's...

356
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:41,635
it's totally fine. I
should have asked first.

357
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,293
The day I... I found out
I was pregnant with Leo,

358
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,425
I just about emptied
the Amazon warehouse

359
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:53,125
of every baby toy and
onesie they had in stock.

360
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,996
I just couldn't wait.

361
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:58,304
Now you get to spoil this one.

362
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:01,350
Yeah.

363
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,178
I didn't, um...

364
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,268
I didn't take proper
care of myself.

365
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,053
And I've always wondered if...

366
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:12,318
if that's why Leo has
the issue that he has.

367
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,712
No, Olivia. Don't
put that on yourself.

368
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,367
This wasn't your fault.

369
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,414
I swore I... I...

370
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:22,893
if I ever got pregnant,
I'd do better.

371
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:25,158
I mean, that's why I'm here.

372
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,683
I'm on my own and
got rent to pay,

373
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,337
and times are hard to come by.

374
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,992
And I'm just... I'm
terrified that...

375
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,343
I'm terrified that the, um...

376
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:40,607
I just want this baby
to get proper care.

377
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:44,045
Okay. It's okay.

378
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,704
Dr. Charles.

379
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,272
What was so important that
I had to leave my brother

380
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:56,057
and six-year-old nephew in the
middle of trick-or-treating?

381
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,189
I don't understand.

382
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,625
Nurse Nelson called
and said that you

383
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:03,151
needed an immediate
consult for Ted Kachler.

384
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,414
Oh, right, right.

385
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:08,591
That's because, um, I do have
some significant questions

386
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:11,551
about his intake and I
could be on the verge

387
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,248
of... of releasing him.

388
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:16,208
And I just wanted to, you
know, consult with you first.

389
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,644
But you're my boss.

390
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,081
In what world do you
need me to sign off?

391
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,343
Oh, I don't know,
professional courtesy.

392
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,605
You know, it's your patient.

393
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:23,824
I appreciate that,

394
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:26,957
but maybe next time,
just give me a call.

395
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,611
Noted.

396
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,440
I think we might have
crossed our wires.

397
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:33,399
But look, while I have you here,

398
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,227
do you mind going into
a little more detail

399
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,620
about what you
observed on intake

400
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,013
that led you to hold him?

401
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,623
Yeah, he was erratic and violent

402
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,408
when the cops brought him in,
and he was screaming threats

403
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:44,410
at his wife, who was
clearly terrified.

404
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:45,889
Got it, got it.

405
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,413
You do whatever
you feel is right,

406
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:50,764
but I would fix his arm
and send him back upstairs.

407
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:52,461
Okay.

408
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,768
Well, thank you, Nellie, and
I'm sorry about the mix-up.

409
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,900
No problem.

410
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:02,950
Are you kidding me?
What were you thinking?

411
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,125
I just thought you
could talk to her.

412
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,518
That's not the way
it works, Jackie.

413
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,346
You can't just
summon another doctor

414
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:10,131
to the hospital in my name
without my permission.

415
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,306
I really have to
explain that to you?

416
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,481
I just can't stop thinking about

417
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:13,874
a little girl losing her dad.
- Okay.

418
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,267
Well, you heard Dr. Cuevas.

419
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:16,833
Whatever this glitch
is, it ain't good.

420
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:19,098
So for now, anyway, he's
exactly where he needs to be.

421
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,971
Dr. Ripley, this is
my sister, Connie.

422
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,451
Nice to meet you.

423
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:27,017
Thank you so much for
taking such good care of MK.

424
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:28,802
She needs to slow down.

425
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:30,717
Please stop, Con.

426
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:33,503
Are you ready to go up
to radiology for a CT?

427
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,204
Are you okay? You seem sad.

428
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:43,947
I'm... I'm great.

429
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:46,080
Why?

430
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,256
You just lied to
a nun, Dr. Ripley.

431
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:51,303
My big sis has a sixth
sense about human emotion.

432
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:53,000
You should just confess now.

433
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,176
Uh, can I confess after the CT?

434
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,571
Only priests take confession.

435
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,703
But you and I will
definitely have a chat.

436
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,401
Deal.

437
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:04,490
Okay, Olivia, I have great news.

438
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,231
Your red count is
within a healthy range,

439
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,450
your liver and kidney
function is normal,

440
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,713
and you are negative
for Rh protein.

441
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,715
That's such a
relief. Thank you.

442
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:14,326
Okay, let's just get
a quick look at baby

443
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,892
and you should be good to go.

444
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,678
- Sounds good, Dr. Asher.
- Okay.

445
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,334
Here we go.

446
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,210
Do you not know the
sex of your baby?

447
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,343
No, uh, I didn't do it with Leo.

448
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,736
Kind of old-school.

449
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,217
That works for me.

450
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,920
Is there something wrong?

451
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,400
No. No, nothing's wrong.

452
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,707
But if you're okay
with it, Olivia,

453
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,231
I would like to run
a few more tests.

454
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,493
Something <i>is</i> wrong.

455
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:52,494
I just wanna be extra thorough

456
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:54,236
since you came all this way.

457
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:58,196
Okay. Um, do whatever
you need to do.

458
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,719
Okay.

459
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,200
I'll put those work orders
in and check back shortly.

460
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,207
Mags, Olivia's baby's
heart rate's low.

461
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,165
- How low?
- 125.

462
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,776
That's the low side of normal.

463
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:16,736
Bradycardia in a fetus can
have a number of explanations.

464
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,607
Yeah, but in rare instances
it can also indicate

465
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,435
a fetal heart block,
so I wanna get

466
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,872
an SSA antibody test
just to rule it out.

467
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,918
Well, we told Lenox that
it was gonna be an hour,

468
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,267
and it's been two hours.

469
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,921
If she catches wind of
Olivia even being here...

470
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,488
I get it.

471
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:30,620
Okay.

472
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:35,102
So you were bitten by a bat?

473
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:36,625
No, dude.

474
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,237
I told the nurse I had a close
encounter with a few bats

475
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,587
and my mom insisted I
get a rabies vaccine.

476
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,590
Okay, and where did you
encounter these bats?

477
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,809
Kevin's house.

478
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,071
Educate me.

479
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,856
It's a haunted house in Uptown.

480
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:52,772
Back in the early
'90s, Kevin was my age.

481
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,513
Liked to sass the 'rents,

482
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,819
so eventually they chained his
mouthy ass up in the basement

483
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,995
and let him starve to death.

484
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:01,434
Still haven't found his body.

485
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:05,306
Okay. Looks like
you did get bit.

486
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,612
I didn't feel a thing.

487
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,048
Yeah, well, bat teeth are tiny,

488
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,484
so the bites can
sometimes go undetected.

489
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,007
But we'll vaccinate
you for rabies

490
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,095
just to be safe, all right?

491
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:13,793
Am I gonna die?

492
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:17,623
Well, it's almost 100% fatal
if you start showing symptoms,

493
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:18,667
but I got you.

494
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:19,842
It's okay.

495
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:22,628
Dude, my friends
are gonna be shook.

496
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:23,455
Excuse me?

497
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:26,109
My bros, over there.

498
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,288
Right. Okay.

499
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,116
Well, looks like your bros are
gonna need a jab, too, then.

500
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,339
Hey, uh, can I get
your eyes on something?

501
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,949
Yeah, sure.

502
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,082
It's my patient in T3.

503
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,650
- The nun?
- Yeah.

504
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,173
Are my eyes playing
tricks on me,

505
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,741
or is that what I think it is?

506
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,177
It's a baby, right?

507
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:53,136
Yeah, at least...

508
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,530
it was.

509
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,105
I've never been pregnant.

510
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:07,237
Well, even though you may not
have realized it at the time,

511
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:09,109
this image shows
us that you were

512
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,025
until sometime in
the second trimester.

513
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:15,898
Clearly, the fetus
did not survive.

514
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:18,858
But that's a miscarriage.

515
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:22,905
You're telling me there's
a baby in me right now?

516
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,994
Normally, the body
would expel the fetus,

517
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:30,086
but in very rare cases it
can be retained by the uterus

518
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:33,089
and the body launches an immune
response that calcifies it.

519
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,746
It's called a lithopedion.
Um, a stone baby.

520
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,275
But why now?

521
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:49,454
Uh, after all these years of
having no idea it was there?

522
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,847
Well, your body's entered
a premenopausal phase,

523
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:54,459
so the hormone changes
likely caused your uterus

524
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,940
to contract, which resulted
in your abdominal pain.

525
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,768
And sometimes this condition

526
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:04,469
can remain asymptomatic
for a lifetime.

527
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,646
So what happens now?

528
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:10,823
We remove it surgically.

529
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,128
Sooner the better.

530
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:15,610
I'd like to get you
into surgery tonight.

531
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,307
But, um, we can...

532
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:21,268
we can wait a day or two
if you need some time.

533
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:28,493
Tonight is fine.

534
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,713
I'm ready.

535
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,195
CPD called.

536
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:38,503
My house was completely cleared.

537
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,113
- Total sweep?
- Y-yeah.

538
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:43,116
I mean, they didn't find
any evidence of forced entry

539
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:45,292
or that anyone had been there.

540
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:46,598
Okay. So what now?

541
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,947
I mean, better not be trying

542
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,470
to tell you you imagined
the whole thing.

543
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:53,343
Well, who knows? But I
know how I felt, Daniel.

544
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,258
Someone was in my house.
- Okay.

545
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:56,346
Well, that's easy.

546
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:57,652
You're gonna sleep
somewhere else,

547
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:58,871
you know, until we figure
out what's going on.

548
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,003
Well, they offered a
patrol car out front.

549
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,831
I said yes.
- That ain't nothing.

550
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:05,094
I mean, will it make
you feel better?

551
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:07,575
At least it might help me sleep.

552
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,885
Where is the real injury?

553
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:16,497
The cut over my right eye.

554
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,672
The skin tore pretty deeply.

555
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:20,458
You are definitely
gonna need stitches.

556
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,895
I got clocked in the
face by a customer.

557
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,331
Customer?

558
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,811
Yeah.

559
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:28,814
I'm a performer at the Fun
Farm Halloween Night Show.

560
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:31,251
It sounds like you're
too good at your job.

561
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:32,382
Who goes to a Halloween show

562
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,515
if they don't want
a few jump scares?

563
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,256
It's what he paid for.

564
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,127
I'd take it as a compliment.

565
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:39,694
Really?

566
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:42,828
Well, yeah, it means you gave
an authentic performance.

567
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:44,090
Mm.

568
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,571
- Thank you.
- A small pinch here.

569
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,660
Next.

570
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:50,357
All right. You okay?

571
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,751
Hey, thank you
for your patience.

572
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,928
Can you lift your sleeve up
over your shoulder, please?

573
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,286
I need you to calm
down, all right?

574
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:07,548
Take a seat for me now!

575
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,550
Oh!

576
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,726
Relax!

577
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,339
He's biting me!

578
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,907
God!

579
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:21,041
Relax!

580
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,130
What's up with your friend, man?

581
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,045
- We don't know him.
- You don't?

582
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:27,786
He escaped the psych
unit a few hours ago.

583
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:30,049
He must have slipped out during
that other guy's attempt.

584
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,137
Come on, Kevin.

585
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:33,574
Whoa, it's Kevin.

586
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:34,836
Kevin's alive!
- Whoa!

587
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:36,621
Kev... what is
going on tonight?

588
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:37,926
Mm-mm.

589
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,408
God! Ouch!

590
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,105
Wait, so you're saying

591
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,107
that there's something
wrong with my baby's heart?

592
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,631
Your test shows
what I believe to be

593
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,197
an atrioventricular block.

594
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:49,677
What does that mean?

595
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:50,852
It means that your body

596
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,767
has developed a rare
set of antibodies

597
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:55,901
and has disrupted your
baby's cardiac development.

598
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:56,989
Oh, my God.

599
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,556
- Just listen.
- Okay.

600
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,470
We've already given you
a course of steroids

601
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,690
to help root out the
dangerous antigens

602
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,953
and now have started an IV drip

603
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:06,999
to help replace them
with the healthy ones.

604
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,957
So my baby's gonna be okay?

605
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,525
She's gonna be just fine.

606
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,745
Wait, she?

607
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:15,442
Sounds like someone let
the cat out of the bag.

608
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:16,748
I cannot believe
I just did that.

609
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:19,098
- Oh, my gosh. No, Olivia!
- No worries.

610
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:21,013
I'm so... I've
never... oh, my God.

611
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,406
I'm glad that you told me.

612
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:24,930
Thank you. Thank
you for helping me.

613
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,279
No, thank yourself.

614
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,541
Dr. Asher only caught this

615
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:30,022
because you decided
to come in early.

616
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,894
It could have been a lot worse
had you decided to wait longer.

617
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:35,462
Leo, you're gonna have...

618
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:36,855
wait, where did...
where did Leo go?

619
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,508
Wait, where did he go?

620
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:39,553
Okay, no worries.

621
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,424
I'll go track him down.
- Okay.

622
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:45,472
Leo.

623
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,952
Leo.

624
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,562
- Stop trying to hurt me.
- Leo, are you okay, honey?

625
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:49,998
- I will not let you hurt me!
- No, Ted, we're trying to...

626
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,826
- Stop it!
- We just...

627
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,001
It's okay, Leo.

628
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:54,613
They're just trying to help him.

629
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,658
Leo, it's okay.

630
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,878
They're just trying to help him.

631
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:01,880
It's okay, Leo.

632
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:04,012
It's okay, Leo.

633
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:06,841
Okay, Leo...

634
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:21,682
What's going on here?

635
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,249
Leo's autistic, and
he wandered out here

636
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,946
and just melted down,

637
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:27,384
and he screams any
time I get near him.

638
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,170
Okay.

639
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,612
Hey, is she mad that
Olivia's still here?

640
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,527
No, she ju...

641
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:42,094
I don't know what
she is right now.

642
00:27:56,849 --> 00:28:00,112
All those people are scary, huh?

643
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:02,419
And it's really loud in here.

644
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:06,335
You're safe, Leo.

645
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:46,245
We can stay here as
long as you want, Leo.

646
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,651
What, um, what happened?

647
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:02,914
After his X-ray cleared him,

648
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:04,611
a guard came to take
him back to psych

649
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:07,527
and he had a full-blown
asthma attack.

650
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:09,572
His oxygen saturation
was down to 90

651
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:10,660
and he didn't have his inhaler,

652
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,010
so we treated the asthma attack.

653
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:13,838
And a few minutes
later, he just...

654
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,709
he completely freaked out.

655
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,711
What... what meds did he get?

656
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:20,714
An albuterol nebulizer
and fluticasone.

657
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,194
- Fluticasone.
- Mm-hmm.

658
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,587
The, um... the nasal spray.

659
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:25,763
Yeah, you were right.

660
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,504
You've been right
this whole time.

661
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:29,592
He, um...

662
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,683
He is mentally ill.

663
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:35,468
You know what?

664
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,949
I am not so sure about that.

665
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,485
Excuse me, MK.

666
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:53,834
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

667
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,706
but we need to get
you into surgery.

668
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:59,318
Please pray with me.

669
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,233
Okay.

670
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:10,242
Now, tell me what's
been bothering you.

671
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:13,941
Me?
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:16,857
It shouldn't be about me.
It should be about you.

673
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:20,339
I can sense sadness.

674
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,167
That's my gift.

675
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:29,348
Please.

676
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:40,925
My, uh...

677
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:44,319
my best friend's
dying of cancer.

678
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,019
I'm so sorry to hear
that, Dr. Ripley.

679
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,239
And tonight his little boy
was brought in with pneumonia.

680
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,068
Actually, a babysitter brought
him in because his mother,

681
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:58,029
my friend's girlfriend,
Lynne, ignored his symptoms

682
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:02,076
and decided to party
the night away instead.

683
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:10,084
I'm not sad.

684
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,216
I'm angry.

685
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:13,261
Mm.

686
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:15,786
Sometimes, they're
the same thing.

687
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:22,792
I met my baby's father

688
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:25,230
when I was 19.

689
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,927
He was a few years older than me

690
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:31,628
and he had the most
piercing blue eyes.

691
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:37,938
They melted my heart.

692
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:41,463
We fell head over heels in love.

693
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:45,424
And like magic,

694
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:50,952
I could suddenly picture
our entire lives together.

695
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:57,436
Marriage, travel, kids,

696
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,786
everything.

697
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:01,353
What happened?

698
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:06,271
He fell in love
with someone else.

699
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:14,279
And that whole life I saw...

700
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,325
vanished.

701
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:21,852
I'm so sorry, MK.

702
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:27,901
I think Lynne pictures a life

703
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:31,992
which is now slowly
vanishing before her eyes,

704
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:35,388
which might be the most
painful goodbye of all.

705
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:41,002
Be patient with
her, Dr. Ripley.

706
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,745
I will.

707
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:47,486
And I hope that beautiful
baby boy of hers

708
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,227
feels better soon.

709
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:52,491
He'll be fine, MK.

710
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:55,450
I like when you call me that.

711
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,757
Believe me, Sister gets old.

712
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:14,904
What did you say her name was?

713
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:16,384
Dr. Lenox.

714
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:19,039
She knew exactly what to
do when Leo melted down.

715
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,823
No one ever does.

716
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:22,956
She clearly has a kind soul.

717
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:24,437
Yes, she does.

718
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:26,960
Okay, Olivia.

719
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:29,093
So you are just about
done with your infusion,

720
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:31,617
and your baby's
heart rate is strong.

721
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:33,880
So I'll need you to follow
up here every few weeks,

722
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:37,275
but I expect that your
baby will be just fine.

723
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:38,885
I'm just so glad you're
doing this clinic.

724
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:40,321
It's not usually an option.

725
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:41,888
We're really glad
you came, Olivia.

726
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:44,064
Yeah. And spread the word.

727
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,676
I'm feeling much better.

728
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,591
Uh...

729
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:51,245
but I don't know why this
keeps happening to me.

730
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:55,249
Uh, I don't know. Maybe...
maybe my ex is right.

731
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,511
Maybe I am crazy.

732
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:59,427
Mm, I'm not so sure about that.

733
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:00,863
Do you mind me asking,

734
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:03,214
did you happen to
have an asthma attack

735
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,825
when you were arguing
with your wife?

736
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:09,220
Uh, I did, actually, yeah.

737
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:12,136
And do you always
combine fluticasone spray

738
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,964
with your inhaler to
manage your attacks?

739
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:17,793
Actually, no. Rarely.

740
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:23,495
But, uh, she... she really
got me worked up this time.

741
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,932
It was... it was a doozy.

742
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,499
Okay.

743
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,806
Can you remember roughly how
many pumps you used per side?

744
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,808
Oh, I don't know.

745
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,549
Five?

746
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,073
I think that what we're
talking about here, Ted,

747
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,772
is something very simply known
as a medication overdose.

748
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:42,862
You know, fluticasone,
it's a corticosteroid,

749
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:46,300
which is a class of steroid
that has absolutely been known

750
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:47,910
to induce psychosis in people

751
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:51,131
with, you know, a
certain vulnerability.

752
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,442
W-wait. I'm...
so I'm not crazy?

753
00:34:57,443 --> 00:34:59,574
That's what was
causing your glitch.

754
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,750
And we think that the reason
maybe it happened again today

755
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:04,057
is even if we gave
you the right dose,

756
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:06,625
right, that that overload
is still in your system

757
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:09,628
and it just triggered
another episode.

758
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:13,849
If it's okay with you, I'd like
to keep you till the morning

759
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,503
just to make absolutely
sure that all this stuff

760
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:17,201
is out of your system.

761
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:18,550
But you will still
have plenty of time

762
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:21,422
- to make the custody hearing.
- Oh.

763
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,642
Thank you.

764
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:27,603
Thank you so much. Uh...

765
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:31,867
You were pretty amazing
with Leo tonight.

766
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:36,176
Yeah, her mom wanted us
to thank you for her.

767
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,875
Well... and...

768
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:42,879
Happy Halloween.

769
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:48,449
Dr. Lenox is a mystery.

770
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,364
- Even possibly to herself.
- Mm-hmm.

771
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:53,237
Hey, great job with
the clinic patient.

772
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:56,283
I heard it was very
lucky that she came in.

773
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:57,806
Yes, an atrioventricular block.

774
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:00,983
I am very glad
that we caught it.

775
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:03,595
But overall, your
prenatal clinic

776
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:08,382
has not been particularly
well-attended.

777
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:09,557
What are you saying?

778
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:13,126
That maybe we should pivot.

779
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:18,436
I spoke to Violet Mikami
last week, from Firehouse 51.

780
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:20,568
She delivered a baby

781
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:22,875
mere minutes after
the mother's death,

782
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,703
a death that could
have been avoided

783
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,446
by a standard
prenatal examination.

784
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:31,362
It made me think
of Elise Thompson.

785
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:34,756
So I'm proposing a mobile unit

786
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:38,369
that could visit
communities most at risk,

787
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,460
'cause listen, if the
patients can't get to us,

788
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:44,853
we gotta go to them.

789
00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:47,116
That would be incredible.

790
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:50,424
We need to do better by the
pregnant women that need us.

791
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,991
And we will.

792
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,167
Good. Let's talk
details tomorrow.

793
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:05,875
Oh.

794
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:13,099
I know I overstepped today.

795
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,015
Yeah, you did.

796
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,976
I'm sorry.

797
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:22,631
It will not happen again.

798
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,373
Mm.

799
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:39,299
I'm just still trying to figure
out what you were thinking.

800
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,997
Totally get on the
face of it, like,

801
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:45,479
why you wouldn't want
Ted to be misdiagnosed.

802
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,873
I mean, I understand...
- I've been there.

803
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:49,178
As you well know.

804
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:52,007
And, um, here's the
thing about a psych ward.

805
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:55,881
It's... it's scary.

806
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:59,145
It's heavy and it
sticks with you.

807
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,541
Every Halloween, I...

808
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:05,325
I take my daughter
to this big bash

809
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:06,544
with all the neighborhood kids

810
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:08,589
and I was supposed to
go with her tonight,

811
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:13,072
but Carl changed his
mind at the last minute.

812
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:15,030
Yeah, he says he's
worried about me.

813
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:17,032
Um...

814
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:20,688
but the truth is, he doesn't
want me to be alone with her.

815
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:23,212
There's always that fear that,

816
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:25,738
you know, that I'm gonna
go to that place again.

817
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:31,873
Do you, uh... do you mind
me asking, did you...

818
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:34,789
did you ever think maybe
that I had misdiagnosed you?

819
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,878
No.

820
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,098
No, there was something
wrong with me.

821
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:42,058
And I'm... I'm grateful
for what you did.

822
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,019
Otherwise, I don't know
if I would be here today.

823
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,370
Mm.

824
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,864
That's great.

825
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:07,126
Nate's breathing is improving.

826
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,780
That means the antibiotics
are working well.

827
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,129
When can I take him home?

828
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,826
I'd like to keep him
overnight for observation

829
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:14,568
just to make sure his
oxygen levels remain normal.

830
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:16,091
- Can I stay with him?
- Sure, yeah, yeah.

831
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:18,093
We'll set up a cot for
you so you're comfortable.

832
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:19,356
Thank you.

833
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,315
Need some company?

834
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:23,882
That depends.

835
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:27,668
Will that involve judgment and
thinly veiled condescension?

836
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,193
I'll leave you to it.

837
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:32,630
Thank you for
everything, Dr. Frost.

838
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:33,980
Of course. Yeah, yeah.

839
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:46,383
I'm sorry.

840
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,081
For how I treated you and...

841
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:52,520
For what you're going through.

842
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:55,522
And you were right.

843
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:58,699
I haven't been
there like I should.

844
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,919
But that changes now.

845
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,792
Whatever you need, I'm game.

846
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:08,666
Mitchell Ripley,
taking the high road?

847
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,494
Taking my head out
of my ass, actually.

848
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:12,626
- Oh.
- Yeah.

849
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:20,329
Does Sully know I'm here?

850
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,505
No.

851
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:24,204
And he won't, not from me.

852
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:32,603
Helen, I come bearing peanut
butter cups, as promised.

853
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:35,214
Who says guilt isn't useful?

854
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,259
Not me.

855
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,565
How's Kyle?

856
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:40,959
Milking the photos
of his red eyes

857
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,483
for full sympathetic
impact on Instagram.

858
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:45,703
Good for him.

859
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:48,662
Well, if there's
anything I can do.

860
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:51,448
You know, actually, there is.

861
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,452
I just noticed that you
have a doorbell camera.

862
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,018
Can I see the footage?

863
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:58,846
Of course you can.
I'll send you a file.

864
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:01,022
- Great, thank you.
- Yeah.

865
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:02,589
- Good night.
- Good night.
