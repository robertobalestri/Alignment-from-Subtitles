00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,441
<i>What brings you in here?</i>

2
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:09,225
<i>I'm running out of places to go.</i>

3
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:11,053
At times like this,

4
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:14,448
it's important to
have community.

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,058
You're about to
throw your life away,

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,017
your medical license.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,802
It's like I'm reverting back
to this old version of me,

8
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:22,064
and I can't stop it.

9
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:26,068
I'm sorry. I... I
didn't mean to do that.

10
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:27,374
I'm...
- It's okay. It's okay.

11
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,680
Um, I should probably go.

12
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:33,641
I can't be the one
to save you, Mitch.

13
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:35,034
I love you.

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,992
It's not enough.

23
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,100
Hello?

24
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,234
Hello?

25
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,107
Can anyone hear me?

26
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:51,632
Help!

27
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:54,462
Help!

28
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,643
Keep talking so I can find you.

29
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:03,644
Over here!

30
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:05,907
Can you hear me?

31
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,169
Where?

32
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,345
Over here!

33
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:14,220
Why can't I see you?

34
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,311
We're down here, in the hole.

35
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,182
Oh, no.

36
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:26,319
Hello?

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,321
Oh, thank God.

38
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,974
I can see you.

39
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,585
Thank you for finding us.

40
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:32,716
Thank you.

41
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:33,804
What's your name?

42
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:35,545
Sadie. Sadie Smith.

43
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:37,156
Hi, Sadie. I'm Mitch.

44
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,332
Uh, I'm a doctor, and...

45
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,724
A doctor?

46
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,945
Well, that's lucky
on an unlucky night.

47
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,903
I'm scared, Mommy.

48
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:47,209
I know, baby.

49
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,994
But I'm right here.

50
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,387
How long you been down there?

51
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:54,216
Uh, less than an hour, I think.

52
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:57,263
I pulled over 'cause
Emelia had to pee.

53
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,178
I was looking for a spot.

54
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,309
She fell in first?

55
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,224
And me right after.

56
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,095
How far below you is Emelia?

57
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,620
Sounds like 2 or 3 feet.

58
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:09,013
She's really, really scared.

59
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,363
She says her arm hurts.

60
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,191
Okay, which one?

61
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,583
I don't know.

62
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,846
Emelia doesn't know her
right from her left yet.

63
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:17,196
What about you?

64
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,849
Your leg's twisted
up pretty bad.

65
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,200
How much pain are you in
on a scale of 1 to 10?

66
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,984
A 7 or 8.

67
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:25,508
But it's better than before.

68
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:28,251
It's starting to
feel a little numb.

69
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:33,908
Okay, we gotta get
you out of there.

70
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:36,127
I'm gonna call 911.

71
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,694
Mommy?

72
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,348
Everything's okay, sweetheart.

73
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,785
There's a man here to help us.

74
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:50,533
Uh, I'm not getting any
reception here, so I'm...

75
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,274
I'm gonna try walking
back toward the road.

76
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,449
No, no, no, no, no.

77
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,146
Please don't leave us.

78
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,191
Sadie?

79
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:57,714
Sadie, listen to me.

80
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,629
I'm just going a
few feet that way.

81
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,544
I will not leave you, okay?

82
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:02,763
I won't.

83
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,243
You have my word.

84
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,680
Do you trust me?

85
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:09,596
Yes.

86
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:11,947
What's happening, Mommy?

87
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:17,038
You see the nice man, Emelia?

88
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,782
He's gonna call more
people to come help us.

89
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:25,307
And we're gonna trust him, okay?

90
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,745
Yes, we trust the nice man.

91
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:31,400
I will be right back.

92
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:42,891
Emelia?

93
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:49,505
Mommy, I can't reach you.

94
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:52,029
It's gonna be okay, baby.

95
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,249
Help is on the way.

96
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:14,835
Dr. Ripley?

97
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:18,273
I'm Chief Annabelle
Jennings, Firehouse 128.

98
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,275
I'm Dr. Mitch Ripley,
Gaffney Chicago Med.

99
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,320
Nice to meet you.

100
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,190
Here.

101
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,626
I already paired it for you.

102
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:26,107
I know you've already
formed a rapport with Sadie,

103
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,414
so I think it best to keep
you as our point person.

104
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:29,545
Yeah.

105
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:31,721
Hopefully I can
keep her spirits up.

106
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:33,462
So what's the rescue plan?

107
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:34,769
Come with me.

108
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:38,337
Keep up the rope bag, raise
the aerial 30 degrees.

109
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,165
Lieutenant, this is
Dr. Mitch Ripley.

110
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,428
Mouch.

111
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,038
Good to see you, Ripley.

112
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:44,995
You two know each other?

113
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,301
We do, Chief.

114
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:48,390
Dr. Ripley and I
have got history...

115
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,696
very recent history.

116
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,045
How's Trudy? How's her
recovery been going?

117
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:52,089
It came and went.

118
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,700
She had no patience for it,

119
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,702
wanted to get right back to
kicking ass and taking names.

120
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:56,833
Good.

121
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:57,878
Hey, I didn't know you left 51.

122
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,009
No, I didn't.

123
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,271
I passed the lieutenant's exam,

124
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,230
so I'm picking up
shifts for experience

125
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,058
till a spot opens
up at home base.

126
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,799
Dr. Ripley agreed to
be our point person

127
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,496
with Sadie and Emelia.

128
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:09,280
What kind of injuries
are we looking at?

129
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:10,934
Well, Sadie's got a broken leg.

130
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:12,240
Emelia says her arm hurts.

131
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:14,024
I'm guessing it's fractured.

132
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,591
What's the plan to
get them out of there?

133
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:19,073
Well, our best bet is
building an H rescue system.

134
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:22,337
We dig a vertical rescue
hole parallel to the well.

135
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:25,471
Then we dig a horizontal
rescue tunnel to connect them.

136
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,603
The well's been out of
service for 50 years.

137
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,823
Its walls are made out
of old powdered cement

138
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,302
that doesn't age well.

139
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,392
A brick hammer will
easily break through.

140
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,958
I'm guessing you
would break through

141
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,830
about chest level with Sadie?
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,135
Once we see what
we're dealing with

143
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:40,311
in terms of injuries,
we'll figure out

144
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:43,576
how and when to
bring the victims up.

145
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,404
You mean patients.

146
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,495
They're victims until we
get them up to the surface.

147
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:50,844
Dr. Ripley?

148
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,106
Sadie's asking for you.

149
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,110
Sadie?

150
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:57,720
What's going on down there?

151
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,330
Emelia won't stop crying.

152
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,375
She's terrified.

153
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,420
Okay, Sadie...

154
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,986
Please get us out now.

155
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,248
I need you to relax.

156
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:06,207
How? We can't move down here.

157
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,774
We can barely breathe.

158
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,166
I know.

159
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,255
I know this is
stressful and scary,

160
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:14,476
but you have to focus on one
thing and one thing only...

161
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,304
keeping Emelia calm.

162
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,088
And that means you staying calm

163
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,221
because she takes her
cues from you, okay?

164
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:22,789
Can you do that for me?

165
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:31,014
Yeah.

166
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:33,669
Yeah, I can do that.

167
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,410
Okay.

168
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,804
You have kids?

169
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:39,196
No.

170
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,024
Then maybe keep the
parenting advice

171
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,679
to yourself.

172
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,337
Fair enough.

173
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,601
Excuse me. Hi. Sorry.

174
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,516
I'm looking for Dr. Frost.

175
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,475
Yeah, you have to sign
in at the front desk

176
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,693
in the waiting room.

177
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,347
Oh, no. I'm not
a patient. I'm...

178
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,523
- Wait. Ainsley?
- Jonathan.

179
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,133
Hi. Hi.

180
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:04,744
Oh, my God. What's it been?

181
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,223
Like, 15 years?

182
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,835
Uh, 17, I think, if
you can believe it.

183
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:10,359
Crazy, right?

184
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:15,537
Maggie, this is Ainsley Towne.

185
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,539
I'm an old friend of
his from his TV days.

186
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,932
Wait.

187
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,891
You played his mom
in "Nick of Time."

188
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:23,545
Yes, I did.

189
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,721
What are you doing in Chicago?

190
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,506
Oh, work, obviously.

191
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,073
I'm downtown, shooting a movie
for the Hearts of Fire Network.

192
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,510
Oh, another holiday movie?

193
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,554
No. Oh, gosh, no.

194
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:33,773
You can only make
so many sequels

195
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,557
to "Heartbreak in a Pear Tree."

196
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:36,993
I love that movie.

197
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:38,994
When you taught that puppy
how to ice skate, and...

198
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:41,998
I was bawling.

199
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,478
Thank you.

200
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,567
Um, no, actually, this
is a dramatic role,

201
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:48,178
something I think I can
kind of sink my teeth into.

202
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,138
Oh, please, do... do tell.

203
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:54,750
Well, I play a nurse who's
trapped in an elevator

204
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,926
with her soul mate who
has a heart attack,

205
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:58,580
and I have to save his life.

206
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,451
- Yeah.
- You have to shadow me.

207
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:02,105
I'll give you a crash
course in nursing.

208
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,585
No, I don't wanna
be any trouble.

209
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,587
I just came here to
say hi to Jonathan.

210
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,675
- Oh.
- No, no.

211
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,068
I'll make some time.

212
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:09,156
Are you okay with that?

213
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:10,331
Absolutely.

214
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:11,724
I mean, Maggie is the best,

215
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:12,812
so you'll have a great time.

216
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,030
Jonathan will give
you my number.

217
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,336
Text me, and we'll make a plan.

218
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:16,642
Thank you. I look
forward to it.

219
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,166
Thanks, Maggie.

220
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,561
What?

221
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,605
It's great to see you.

222
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:24,606
Same.

223
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:25,607
You... you look amazing.

224
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,478
Thank you.

225
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,132
How about a catch-up
dinner at Gibson's?

226
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,438
- Yes, yeah.
- Yeah?

227
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,005
Let's... let's steak it up.

228
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,267
My shift ends at 5:00, so...

229
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:34,877
Okay, then I'll
circle back then.

230
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,836
Yeah. Okay, great.

231
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,656
As you can see behind me,

232
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,137
these brave men and women
have been working tirelessly

233
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:18,355
for 12 hours.

234
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:20,531
I am at the rescue tunnel,

235
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,969
switching on the helmet
light and camera now.

236
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,710
Stand by.

237
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,235
On the move.

238
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,810
<i>We got a clear visual?</i>

239
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,246
We do.

240
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,900
If we did our math
right, Sadie should be

241
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,685
on the other side of that
wall, and Emelia just below.

242
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,556
<i>Copy that.</i>

243
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:47,734
Okay.

244
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,391
<i>Here goes nothing.</i>

245
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,222
They're coming.

246
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,399
Too much noise.

247
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,618
You're okay, honey.

248
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:04,619
Help is here.

249
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,014
<i>All right.</i>

250
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,276
I'm gonna go easy now

251
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:10,886
so I don't bury the
poor kid in rubble.

252
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,411
She's got enough to deal with.

253
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:20,288
I can see you.

254
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,728
<i>I busted through.</i>

255
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,209
Copy that.

256
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:34,997
You look like an angel.

257
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:38,087
Oh, that's a lot
of pressure, Sadie.

258
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,436
You just call me Randall.

259
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:42,222
Thanks for dropping in, Randall.

260
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,919
I'm so glad to see you.

261
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Oh, are you kidding?

262
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,575
I wouldn't miss this party.

263
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:48,750
Mommy?

264
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,839
Oh, hey.

265
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,841
Hello, kiddo.

266
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,408
What's your name?

267
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:55,931
Emelia with an E.

268
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:59,674
Well, it is nice to meet
you, Emelia with an E.

269
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,372
I'm here to help you and your
mom get back up to the surface.

270
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,287
How's that sound?
- Good.

271
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,288
All right.

272
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,728
Kid's alert, not critical.

273
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:11,599
How's your leg?

274
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,601
I can't feel it anymore.

275
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:16,647
My heart's beating really fast,

276
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:20,086
and I'm just
really, really cold.

277
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,348
Okay.

278
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,220
Let's take a look at it.

279
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,833
Yeah, okay.

280
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,661
She's pretty shocky.

281
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,664
<i>I'll put on a tourniquet
and get her in a girth wrap</i>

282
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:35,841
<i>so she doesn't slide
down any further.</i>

283
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,103
Copy that.

284
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:38,844
<i>Looks like, as Sadie fell,</i>

285
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:42,021
<i>her right calf got
impaled on a metal shard,</i>

286
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,980
which stopped her with enough
force to snap the femur.

287
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:49,202
But the silver lining...
it also prevented her

288
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,725
from falling any further.

289
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,075
Mouch, does she have
any pulsatile bleeding?

290
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,338
Uh... nah.

291
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:58,559
Just a slow ooze
from the raw surface.

292
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,517
Well, a tourniquet will help
with the muscular bleed,

293
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:05,348
but she's clearly
already lost circulation.

294
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:06,960
She's gonna lose the leg.

295
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,398
It won't be easy to extract
her from the metal rod

296
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,443
to bring her up.

297
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,273
The leg needs to
be amputated first.

298
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,016
You wanna go down there
and do it yourself.

299
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,018
It's her best chance.

300
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,628
The leg's already
mostly torn off.

301
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,196
I'd just be finishing the job
so we can get her up safely.

302
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:29,242
You're not trained
to be down there.

303
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,852
And Mouch isn't
trained to amputate.

304
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:34,116
Sending you down is a liability.

305
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,814
We're running out of time.

306
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,641
So what do you wanna do?

307
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,252
<i>I'll vouch for him, Chief.</i>

308
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:42,168
Ripley can seem over his skis,

309
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,213
but he knows exactly
what he's doing.

310
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,566
Okay.

311
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:53,005
Let's hope you're covered
by the Good Samaritan Act.

312
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,180
Thanks, Mouch.

313
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,420
10 feet. Keep him coming.

314
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,162
Lower.

315
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,469
Easy. We got it.

316
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,385
Oh.

317
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:26,429
Yes.

318
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,084
Nicely done.

319
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,825
You claustrophobic, Ripley?

320
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,522
Well, not that I know of.

321
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:33,741
Well, trust me.

322
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:35,177
You'll find out pretty fast.

323
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:37,092
It's a... it's a tight squeeze.

324
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:40,095
- Good?
- Yeah.

325
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,705
Okay.

326
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:55,676
Well, you're not ugly, are you?

327
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:57,939
I wish I were more presentable.

328
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,247
Mangled leg's not a good look.

329
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:02,726
Don't sell yourself short.

330
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,033
You wear it well.

331
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:08,819
Hey, sweetie.

332
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,734
How you doing?

333
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,171
Let's take a look at you first.

334
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,912
Oh, don't worry about me.

335
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,217
Get my baby out.

336
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:16,740
But your condition
is more serious.

337
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,918
Emelia first.

338
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,921
Okay.

339
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,447
Hey, Emelia.

340
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,929
Can I take a look at your arm?

341
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:33,845
Okay.

342
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:39,198
Ow!

343
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,764
Oh.

344
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:41,852
I'm sorry.

345
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,811
I'm sorry that hurt.

346
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,856
You got a broken arm there.

347
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,249
But don't worry.

348
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,077
We'll fix that right up
on the surface, okay?

349
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:51,079
- Okay.
- Good.

350
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,908
Do your legs hurt or your tummy?

351
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:57,216
Okay.

352
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,261
So she's okay?

353
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:03,571
She is remarkably unharmed,
considering how far she fell.

354
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,269
Kids bounce, adults crack.

355
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,402
I keep thinking
about how she missed

356
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:12,100
getting caught by one of
these metal bars as she fell.

357
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,059
It could have killed her.

358
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,451
What if it had?

359
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:16,583
But it didn't.

360
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,150
And you know what else?

361
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:21,240
It's lucky that it snagged
you, because if you'd landed

362
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,983
on Emelia, you might
have crushed her.

363
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,899
Life is a game of inches.

364
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:33,905
Now, let's get
Emelia out of here.

365
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:38,126
So you haven't spoken
to Mitch since?

366
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,824
We haven't seen
each other since.

367
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:44,828
He's suspended and
might not come back.

368
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,265
Sounds like a train wreck.

369
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,918
Yeah.

370
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,357
But as you know,
I've been one myself.

371
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:57,841
I mean, I ended things
because I was afraid of...

372
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:59,366
going back there again.

373
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,629
I totally get that.

374
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,634
You've gotta put your own
oxygen mask on first, right?

375
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,375
Yeah.

376
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:10,637
I should let you
get back to work.

377
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:11,681
No, no.

378
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,944
You... you wanted to talk.

379
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,033
No, no, it can wait.

380
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,339
Is something wrong?

381
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,688
No.

382
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,126
Nothing's wrong at all.

383
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,091
Oh!

384
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,179
You're pregnant!

385
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,704
Oh, my God!

386
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,054
Oh.

387
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,925
You're the first
person I've told.

388
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,144
I was too scared
to tell anyone else

389
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,320
until I graduated
from my IVF doctor.

390
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,583
But I am past 10 weeks, so...

391
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:44,584
Oh, my gosh.

392
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:45,759
Lizzie, I...

393
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,153
I know. Me too.

394
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:50,111
But this is all because of you.

395
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,071
And I'm so, so grateful.

396
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,900
Mommy, I wanna get out of here.

397
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,380
Emelia, I need you to calm down.

398
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,165
I don't want you to
hurt yourself worse.

399
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,384
No. Mommy comes too.

400
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:05,561
Sweet girl, you need
to go with Mitch first.

401
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:06,736
I'll join you soon.

402
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:07,911
No.

403
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:11,264
I'm not leaving
without you, Mommy!

404
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:17,051
Hey, Emelia, I
understand you're scared,

405
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,835
but we need to get you out first

406
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,141
so that I can help your mom.

407
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,056
And I can't do
that with you here.

408
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:24,014
Hey.

409
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,407
What do we do when we're scared?

410
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,757
Sing the "Winnie the Pooh" song.

411
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,237
That's right.

412
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:31,892
Can we sing it together?

413
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,199

is about to be brought

This is Matt Rodriguez,

451
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,536
reporting for "NBC
News Chicago."

452
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:35,624
Bring them up.

453
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:10,138
Emelia just made
it to the surface.

454
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:14,925
Oh, thank you so much.

455
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:20,626
Sadie, we need to talk.

456
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:22,105
I know.

457
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,933
I feel it too.

458
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,631
And this was one
hell of a meet cute,

459
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:30,897
but I'm just not sure I'm ready
for a relationship right now.

460
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:34,118
And you should know
I also have a kid.

461
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:39,167
I, uh, totally hear you.

462
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,084
But it's the other thing.

463
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:47,174
You need to cut off my leg.

464
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,396
I'm afraid there's
no other option.

465
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:57,706
Will it hurt?

466
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,621
No. I'll sedate
you with ketamine.

467
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,449
You won't feel a thing.

468
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,887
When you wake up, you'll
be back with Emelia.

469
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:11,851
That little girl
is my whole world.

470
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:17,639
I was lost in my
life for a long time.

471
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,077
I never quite knew
what I was living for.

472
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:24,168
I felt so alone.

473
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,391
I know the feeling.

474
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,310
But then I met my little girl.

475
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:41,010
And I just knew that no
matter what happened,

476
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:46,146
I would always find a way
forward because I had to.

477
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,106
She is very lucky to have you.

478
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:56,200
But, I mean, you're okay too.

479
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,118
Well, I'm not sure
you'll feel that way

480
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:06,776
when I tell you about your car.

481
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:10,431
What about my car?

482
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,129
I may have crashed into it.

483
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,916
That might be how I found you.

484
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:20,354
A small price to pay.

485
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,449
Are you ready?

486
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,673
Yeah.

487
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,677
Okay.

488
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:51,516
Now, you'll just feel
a little pinch, okay?

489
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,444
That's not feeling bad.

490
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,547
Hey, Mouch.

491
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,853
What's Emelia's status?

492
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,507
<i>On her way to Med as we speak.</i>

493
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,510
<i>Other than the broken
arm, she's one lucky kid.</i>

494
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:30,642
<i>You good?</i>

495
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:33,209
Yeah.

496
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,082
Just about to start
cutting through.

497
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:39,826
I wish I had a scalpel,
but I'll make do.

498
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:49,095
<i>We promise to update you
on further developments</i>

499
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:51,227
<i>just as soon as
we have them here.</i>

500
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:52,751
- You heard about this?
- Yeah.

501
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,536
Kid's on her way here now.

502
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:58,887
Ainsley... she's
great, by the way.

503
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:01,063
Yeah, she is great.

504
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:03,326
And I owe her a lot.

505
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:05,285
How so?

506
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:08,418
When you are a teen
superstar on a hit TV show,

507
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:09,898
there tends to be
a lot of people

508
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:11,465
who want things from you...

509
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:15,382
people who don't always have
your best interests in mind.

510
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,906
Sometimes you're
shocked to find that

511
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,778
it's, you know, the
ones closest to you.

512
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:25,435
But I was afraid at
the time to say no.

513
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:28,569
I didn't wanna interrupt
the gravy train for anyone.

514
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,095
But Ainsley... I mean,
she always had my back.

515
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,837
Wasn't that your
parents' job, though?

516
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,492
Oh, my parents liked gravy too.

517
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,628
It's the kid from the well.

518
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,369
All right, let's do it.

519
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:53,289
Just give me the word, Ripley.

520
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,031
This may be a bumpy ride.

521
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:59,600
You want me to sing you
the "Winnie the Pooh" song?

522
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,560
I mean, I'm not saying no.

523
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:06,956
You don't wanna hear
me sing. Trust me.

524
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:12,961
Look, Mitch, I, um...

525
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,619
I will see you up top, Sadie.

526
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,968
Yeah.

527
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:24,103
Bring her up, Annabelle.

528
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:26,627
Roger that.

529
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,020
Here we go.

530
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,681
<i>All right, Ripley, get
your ass out of there.</i>

531
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:37,900
On my way.

532
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,556
Hold!

533
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:45,515
What happened?

534
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,343
I'm stuck.

535
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:48,736
Okay.

536
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,660
Okay, I got you.

537
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,068
Okay.

538
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,113
She's all clear!

539
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:19,419
Roger that.

540
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,463
Here we go.

541
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:32,650
Ripley!

542
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,653
Get out of there now!

543
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:38,134
Mitch!

544
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:44,400
What's going on?

545
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:47,316
Listen, I've got
some alarming news.

546
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:49,536
You've heard about the
mother and daughter trapped

547
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:50,842
in the abandoned water well.

548
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:54,672
I just got a call from
Lieutenant McHolland.

549
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,064
- Mouch?
- Yes.

550
00:27:56,065 --> 00:28:00,112
And he informed me
that it was Dr. Ripley

551
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:02,114
who discovered the
mother and daughter

552
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,638
and called CFD.

553
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:10,339
But the tunnel that
Dr. Ripley was in...

554
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,558
collapsed.

555
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:16,302
Sharon, what... what...

556
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,390
is he alive?

557
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:19,522
Radio contact was lost.

558
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:23,048
So Dr. Ripley's condition
is currently unknown.

559
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:26,878
But CFD is attempting
to reestablish contact

560
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:30,751
while they work to dig him out.

561
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,797
- I'm going out there.
- Yeah, I'll join you.

562
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:33,711
Listen.

563
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,886
I can't spare either of you.

564
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,235
He needs to see a friendly face

565
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,933
when they dig him out of there.

566
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,152
Where's Hannah?

567
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:42,458
She needs to know.

568
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,243
Are you there, Ripley?

569
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:47,159
Please respond.

570
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,597
Ripley, if you can
hear me, just hang on.

571
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:54,166
We need some time to
stabilize this tunnel.

572
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:03,610
Yeah.

573
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:04,916
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

574
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:08,659
Oh, man, it is good
to hear your voice.

575
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,139
Did Sadie get out?

576
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,708
<i>Yeah, she's safe and sound
and on her way to Med.</i>

577
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,492
Good.

578
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:17,624
That's good.

579
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,452
<i>Yeah, you did good, brother.</i>

580
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:21,672
What's your situation in there?

581
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:24,675
Uh...

582
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:32,204
Well, I'm in an air pocket.

583
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:34,685
<i>Both ends of the
tunnel are caved in.</i>

584
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:41,474
And yeah, I'm thinking I might
be a little claustrophobic.

585
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:43,606
Are you injured?

586
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:46,000
Just some mild pain
in my right ankle.

587
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,525
Can you move the ankle
around, see if it's broken?

588
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:53,138
Well, I'm buried up
to my chest, so...

589
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:59,232
I can't feel my legs,
but I don't think it is.

590
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,669
I'm gonna try and
dig myself out.

591
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,713
<i>No.</i>

592
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:04,758
<i>Ripley, do not.</i>

593
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,890
<i>Leave that to us.</i>

594
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:07,848
Do not overexert yourself.

595
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,415
You have limited air.

596
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:12,244
You need to breathe slowly
and save your strength.

597
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:14,769
<i>We need some time
to dig you out.</i>

598
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,861
More time than I have?

599
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,690
Not if you keep
your wits about you.

600
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:24,691
Oh, come on.

601
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:27,041
You don't even like me.

602
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:30,697
But I dislike you much less now.

603
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:39,532
Thanks for that.

604
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:41,013
Conserve your air, brother.

605
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,799
Yeah.

606
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,889
Will do, Mouch.

607
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:57,158
- Hey.
- How'd it go in there?

608
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,726
Perfectly.

609
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,731
What?

610
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:07,516
What is it?

611
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:09,345
It's Ripley.

612
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:16,743
<i>Hey, how's your breathing?</i>

613
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:21,095
Oh, not... not great.

614
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:22,618
<i>All right.</i>

615
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:25,665
<i>You just need to hang on a
little longer, all right?</i>

616
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:30,583
It doesn't really matter.

617
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:33,892
<i>Mitchell, can you hear me?</i>

618
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:41,507
Dr. Charles, is that you?

619
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,683
First of all, all this
attention-seeking behavior

620
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:45,685
got a little out of hand, okay?

621
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:48,862
But look, we really do need you
to slow your breathing down.

622
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:51,691
You're just consuming too
much oxygen too quickly.

623
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:57,740
Well, I appreciate that, but...

624
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:00,482
whatever happens,

625
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,007
I'm okay with it.

626
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:06,271
Uh, agree to disagree.

627
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:09,274
This is probably what I deserve.

628
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:11,058
Huh.

629
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,538
How so?

630
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,844
I let people down.

631
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:16,934
I always have.

632
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,111
You just... you just
saved two people's lives.

633
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,330
That's not enough.

634
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:23,331
<i>Okay.</i>

635
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,593
New plan.

636
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,769
I talk, you listen. Deal?

637
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,727
Sure.

638
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:28,947
Why not?

639
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:35,039
I know that, um, way back when,

640
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,738
when we, you know, met at
that juvenile facility,

641
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:42,829
you thought that
I gave up on you.

642
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,615
<i>And that kills me, right?</i>

643
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:48,008
I mean, I'd do almost anything

644
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,879
to turn back the
clock on that one.

645
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,143
But the thing about
you, Mitch... and I...

646
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:54,493
I think about this
all the time...

647
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:57,322
you never gave up on yourself.

648
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:59,063
<i>I mean, with the hand
that you got dealt?</i>

649
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:02,109
<i>It's like... you survived juvie.</i>

650
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,503
You make it to medical
school all by yourself,

651
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:05,808
no help from anyone.

652
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,897
And then you survive
that insane gauntlet?

653
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:09,421
I mean, it's nuts.

654
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:12,815
Look, I know that you're...
you're going through

655
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,426
a rough patch right now.

656
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,732
I mean, Sully?

657
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:19,387
<i>I know how much he meant to you.</i>

658
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,780
But me?

659
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,434
When I'm in a bad
spot, I don't know,

660
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:24,697
I start to see the world in
a different way, you know?

661
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:25,915
I start to make assumptions,

662
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,830
maybe about the way
the world sees me.

663
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:28,875
<i>It's weird.</i>

664
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:30,920
<i>I become unkind to myself.</i>

665
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:32,357
<i>But you know what
started to happen</i>

666
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,794
<i>ever since you showed up
and I'm having a bad day?</i>

667
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:36,404
I just...

668
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,145
I just look across the room,

669
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:39,712
and I see you doing your thing.

670
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:44,717
And all that, it
just, um, evaporates.

671
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:46,675
<i>So just real selfishly here,</i>

672
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:49,417
<i>pal, I gotta ask you
to bear down, okay?</i>

673
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:52,942
Because, um, I need that.

674
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:57,077
I need you because that...

675
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,820
that, it makes my life better.

676
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:04,911
And, um, trust me.

677
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:06,217
I am not the only one.

678
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:09,568
<i>Okay?</i>

679
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,398
Well, I...

680
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:16,488
<i>You what? Sorry, buddy.</i>

681
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,576
<i>I didn't catch that.</i>

682
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:20,231
Mitch?

683
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:21,841
Mitch, can you speak a
little louder, buddy?

684
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:24,061
I can't... God damn it.

685
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,411
<i>Mitch, talk to me.</i>

686
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:29,415
<i>Mitch!</i>

687
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,117
<i>These men and women have
been working tirelessly</i>

688
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,293
<i>in a race against time,
as we just received word</i>

689
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,513
<i>the rescue tunnel has collapsed.</i>

690
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,123
- Jonathan?
- Ainsley. Hey.

691
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,125
I have to cancel dinner tonight.

692
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:48,520
Oh, yeah, no, please,
don't even worry about it.

693
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:49,782
Maggie told me
about your friend.

694
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,393
I'm really sorry.

695
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:55,875
Is there anything I can do?

696
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:56,919
No.

697
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,835
No, I'm good.

698
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:02,055
I know you.

699
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:03,710
Hmm?

700
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:07,409
You're not good.

701
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:11,195
I just wish that there was
something that I could do.

702
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,240
I know. I know.

703
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,504
There's nothing you
can do but wait.

704
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,084
I'm so sorry.

705
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,216
No, it's fine.

706
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,521
Don't... don't apologize.

707
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:36,002
I just really miss you.

708
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,612
Yeah, no, me too.

709
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:40,093
I, um... I really do think
I should get back to work.

710
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,147
How you holding up?

711
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,409
I don't feel great.

712
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,976
Cold, but happy to
be above ground.

713
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:55,195
I don't blame you.

714
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,501
Let's give 100 of fentanyl

715
00:35:56,502 --> 00:36:00,069
and two units emergency
release blood.

716
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,332
Where's my daughter?

717
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,550
Where's Emelia?

718
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:04,291
Sadie, Emelia is here.
She's doing great.

719
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,901
Can I see her, please?

720
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:07,686
I'll feel better if
I can see my baby.

721
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:09,122
Mommy!

722
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:11,516
Oh.

723
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:15,607
Emelia wanted to show
you that she was okay.

724
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:18,350
Oh, am I glad to see you, baby.

725
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:22,570
She's a resilient little girl.

726
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,572
Always has been.

727
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,183
I wonder where she got that.

728
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,275
What about Dr. Ripley?

729
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:33,494
Did he make it?

730
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,800
He's alive.

731
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:36,323
They're still working
on getting him out.

732
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:37,803
We'll see.

733
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:44,636
He saved us.

734
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,682
I didn't get to say thank you.

735
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,295
Mitch, are you there, buddy?

736
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:52,296
I just... I need
to hear from you.

737
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:54,342
Anything. A grunt.

738
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:56,952
Anything?

739
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,172
Five minutes was his
last communication.

740
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:01,000
Damn it.

741
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,436
Mouch says they're close,

742
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:04,003
but there's just
too much rubble.

743
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:05,222
Buddy, listen.

744
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,875
We need help finding you, okay?

745
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:07,920
We are very close,

746
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:09,182
but you need to make some noise.

747
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:10,314
<i>Hit some rocks together.</i>

748
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:11,315
<i>Yell.</i>

749
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:12,621
<i>Anything.</i>

750
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,539
Well, well, well, look at you.

751
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,108
Aren't you a sorry sight?

752
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,328
Sully.

753
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:26,243
I'm serious.

754
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,461
You look pathetic.

755
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:30,334
It's kind of bumming me out.

756
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:31,335
Screw you.

757
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:32,901
Oh, screw me?

758
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:34,077
The dead guy?

759
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:38,080
That's low.

760
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:39,995
Just let me go, man.

761
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:41,301
Guess what?

762
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:44,696
You don't get to die.

763
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:47,002
Lynne and Nate need you.

764
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:48,308
You owe me that.

765
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,745
And you know why?

766
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:55,750
Because I deserted you
when I got out of juvie.

767
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:57,143
Wrong.

768
00:37:57,144 --> 00:38:00,538
You're still torturing
yourself about that?

769
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,540
Well, stop wasting your time.

770
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:04,324
You had to save yourself.

771
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:08,676
I was circling the drain and
pulling you right down with me.

772
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:10,635
I'm not gonna lie, I was pissed.

773
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,985
Didn't even wanna hear
your name for a few years.

774
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:15,553
But you know what
happened when I heard

775
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:17,817
that you were in med school?

776
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:22,648
I couldn't stop smiling.

777
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,957
I owe you because I let you die.

778
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,394
Wrong again.

779
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,873
You lifted me up.

780
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:34,094
You were there
for me at the end.

781
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:38,097
Full stop.

782
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:40,491
And I love you for it.

783
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:45,191
No, you owe me because
despite all that...

784
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:46,498
we're brothers.

785
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:52,285
And that doesn't change
because I'm gone.

786
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:04,166
I miss you.

787
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,255
Why wouldn't you?

788
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:09,302
But I get it.

789
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:11,173
You wanna be angry.

790
00:39:11,174 --> 00:39:16,788
That's your thing...
stewing and brewing.

791
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:19,443
So why don't you
channel all that anger

792
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:22,968
into something positive for once

793
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:28,670
instead of just giving
up like a little bitch?

794
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:31,586
Fight!

795
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,327
No.

796
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:35,982
I'm telling you to fight.

797
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:38,897
No.

798
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,464
<i>We hear you, Ripley!</i>

799
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:41,900
<i>Keep it up!</i>

800
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:42,770
Come on!

801
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:44,511
You can do better than that!

802
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:45,556
Fight!

803
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:46,644
No!

804
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:47,732
<i>I hear him.</i>

805
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:50,430
<i>He's right here.</i>

806
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:52,693
Okay.

807
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:53,781
Get in there.

808
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:55,697
I got you, Ripley.

809
00:39:57,786 --> 00:39:59,527
Good for you, Rip.

810
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:28,686
He lost consciousness?

811
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:31,558
Yeah, just as I was
pulling him out.

812
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,255
- Mitch!
- I can't hear him breathing.

813
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:34,735
He's in hypoxic shock arrest.
Bag him and start compressions.

814
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:35,997
Mitch, buddy, you
gotta stay with me.

815
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:37,129
We're almost there,
pal. We're almost there.

816
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,306
Excuse me. Excuse
me, Dr. Charles.

817
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:41,699
Come on.

818
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:49,533
No. No!

819
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:50,708
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

820
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:51,665
Let them work. Let them work.

821
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,537
Mitch? Hey.

822
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:54,929
Come on.

823
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,236
Hey.

824
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:58,238
Can you hear me?

825
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:03,112
I love you too.

826
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:06,725
I love you too.
