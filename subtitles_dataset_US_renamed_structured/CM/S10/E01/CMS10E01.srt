1
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:06,273
<i>This is a teaching hospital.</i>

2
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:07,507
<i>I'm not a therapist.</i>

3
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:09,577
I'm here to make her
into a doctor.

4
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:11,648
<i>Our job is to nurture,</i>

5
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:13,867
not to cull the herd.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,132
Said he'd been assaulted
by a masked assailant.

7
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:19,375
He did this.

8
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,478
I've been advocating for you
ever since you got here.

9
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:23,896
And you know what?
I'm done.

10
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:25,340
How are things at home?

11
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,000
<i>Honestly,
it's a little strained.</i>

12
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:30,296
The job is to be there
for your patient

13
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,148
<i>throughout their care.</i>

14
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,542
<i>It's a hard rotation for anyone,</i>

15
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:38,813
but it's the burden we bear.

16
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,976
Yeah, me too.

17
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,054
I don't want to be sad anymore.

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,123
So I just want to be clear.
You're saying you don't think

19
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:02,062
- there's any way that...
- Goodbye, Daniel.

20
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:08,772
Everything OK?

21
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:10,187
She just got herself transferred

22
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:11,734
to another hospital.

23
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,630
A little extreme,
don't you think?

24
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:17,089
Wow, I'm sorry you two
couldn't work it out.

25
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,804
Don't know what to tell you,
you know?

26
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,873
She still thinks
that Ripley attacked Pawel,

27
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:25,687
and it infuriates her
that I don't.

28
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,687
You miss her?

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,781
Been a little quiet
around the house

30
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:32,415
since she moved out.
Not gonna lie.

31
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:34,625
- Do I have to worry about you?
- No.

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,252
You've got to get ready
to address your troops.

33
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:37,232
I'm ready, I ...

34
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:39,195
don't know if
they're ready to hear it.

35
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,140
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:43,648
Hey, you up for
a celebratory beer?

37
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:45,031
Oh, yeah.
What are you celebrating?

38
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:46,218
I'm done with chemo.

39
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:48,418
I've got a good feeling
about this PET scan.

40
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,705
Hopefully, I can start
helping Lynne with the baby.

41
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,382
Well, I'm digging
this new attitude,

42
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:55,496
but a beer and chemo is not a...
not a great combo.

43
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:58,546
Maybe it's the perfect combo.
Hey -

44
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:01,546
you hear anything more
about our other situation

45
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,267
with, uh, Pawel?

46
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,271
It's been quiet.

47
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:07,281
You see?
What'd I tell you?

48
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:10,983
Cops don't care about
small time stuff.

49
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,187
- See you.
- Yeah.

50
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:16,664
Excuse me.

51
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:18,789
Uh, you were
a no-show last night

52
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,976
at Crockett's goodbye party.

53
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:22,671
He's sleeping it off on
a plane to Boston about now.

54
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:24,906
Yeah, sorry.
I, uh, got held up here.

55
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,889
- What's going on?
- Oh, you haven't heard?

56
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,609
Ms. Goodman's about to make
a very big announcement

57
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,069
to the entire ED.

58
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:32,664
Well, that can't be good.

59
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,562
Maybe we'll get a new hot tub
in the staff lounge.

60
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:47,131
Did it just get colder in here?

61
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:48,554
We're on a break.

62
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,773
Like a Ross and Rachel break
or a Brad and Angelina break?

63
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:52,460
I don't know,
but I'm not gonna let it

64
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:53,920
ruin my good mood.

65
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,650
Have either of you
seen the Brick?

66
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:58,031
- No.
- No, I haven't.

67
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:59,148
It's just so strange.

68
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:01,656
The night nurse normally
leaves it at my desk, and...

69
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,984
- So everyone's here?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:05,679
Good morning, everyone.

71
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:10,012
I know that you've all heard
that Jackson Monroe Hospital

72
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:12,386
is closing its doors next week.

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,141
Gaffney will absorb
the overflow.

74
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,834
Daily patient numbers
will double.

75
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,105
We need to rethink
how this ED operates.

76
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,193
So changes are on the horizon,

77
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:26,983
and I just ask for your patience

78
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,421
as we navigate
this thing together.

79
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:32,413
And thank you in advance.

80
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:35,468
Dr. Archer, we should talk.

81
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:37,668
Dr. Archer?
Trauma 2 needs you.

82
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,687
Uh, let's talk later, OK?

83
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:42,796
Uh, don't be concerned
about the ED.

84
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,476
I'm ready for whatever's coming.

85
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:51,264
Excuse me.
Hi.

86
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:53,788
- Can I have that?
- Yeah.

87
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,053
Thank you.

88
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:03,878
Oh, my God.

89
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:06,741
<i>The commuter ship was struck
by a smaller vessel.</i>

90
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:07,749
<i>Water flooded the hull,</i>

91
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:09,437
<i>and it capsized within minutes.</i>

92
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:11,765
<i>Rescue operations are underway.</i>

93
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:14,812
That's right.

94
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,358
A mass casualty incident
is en route for Gaffney ASAP.

95
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,568
70 or 80 victims,
nearly half critical.

96
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,164
Most of them are coming to us.

97
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:23,905
Full MCI protocol.
Yes.

98
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,552
What's the ETA
for the first arrival?

99
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:26,299
Two minutes out.

100
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,349
Trauma suites have been cleared?

101
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:28,187
Treatment rooms too.

102
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:29,501
Have you locked down
the walk-in entrance?

103
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:30,452
Done, the ambulance bay's

104
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:31,882
the only point of entry
into the ED.

105
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,405
Chaos control.

106
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,284
Trigger the all hazards
disaster plan.

107
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,537
Every on-call doctor,
nurse, and otherwise

108
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:39,773
hightails it in here ASAP.

109
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,257
- All hands on deck.
- Look at you.

110
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,654
That's why I keep
my RN license active

111
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,841
for emergencies like this.

112
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,544
Take intake and triage.

113
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:49,701
- It's all set up.
- Got it.

114
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:50,802
Thank you.

115
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:52,523
Thought it was gonna be
a quiet morning.

116
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:54,418
That's when
the universe gets you.

117
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,579
Coming in behind you!

118
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,665
Paramedics say she was impaled

119
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,636
by deck railing
in a small explosion.

120
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:27,359
Please!
Please save my baby girl.

121
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,362
All right, baby's 39 weeks.
Let's make mom comfortable.

122
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,103
- 20 of Etomidate, 80 of roc...
- Kelsey, I'm Dr. Asher.

123
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:33,104
We're gonna give you something

124
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:34,844
to help you go to sleep, OK?

125
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:37,108
Can someone find my husband?

126
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:38,196
Was he on the ship
with you, Kelsey?

127
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:40,328
Yeah.
Finn Gallicano.

128
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:41,460
What does he look like?

129
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,939
Etomidate and roc going in.

130
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,334
Thin, dark hair,
lots of tattoos.

131
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:48,815
- Black.
- We're gonna find him.

132
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,947
Is my baby gonna be OK?

133
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:52,514
She's in good hands.

134
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:53,994
Do you have a name for her yet?

135
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,431
It's Darby.

136
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:59,521
Darby.
OK.

137
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,480
I'll let you know
when I track down the husband.

138
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:02,742
She's under.

139
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:05,440
Intubating now.

140
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:07,094
All right, carry on.

141
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:08,748
OK, baby's in distress.

142
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:10,402
Fetal heart tones are slow.

143
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,056
The metal shard is
penetrating the placenta.

144
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:14,884
The baby's unharmed,
but the placenta is abrupting.

145
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:16,321
We need to deliver right now.

146
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:18,584
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chest X-ray first.

147
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:20,455
- Mike?
- You got her?

148
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,927
X-ray.

149
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:25,428
All right,
ET placement confirmed.

150
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,627
Look, see?
Free air.

151
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,631
Yeah, but no free fluid.

152
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:29,918
She likely perforated her bowel.

153
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:32,414
Who knows what else.

154
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:34,852
Mom could bleed to death
all over the table.

155
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:38,333
How do you repair the damage
if the baby is on the way?

156
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,031
The only option that we have...

157
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,207
Remove the debris and deliver
the baby at the same time.

158
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,774
Pretty risky.

159
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,253
What other choice do we have?

160
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:53,392
Oh, we can't take any
overflow from Jackson Monroe.

161
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:54,741
She's not overflow.

162
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:56,525
She's a patient of mine
who needs an MRI.

163
00:06:56,526 --> 00:06:58,353
Well, your hospital
has its own MRI.

164
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:00,225
The hospital sold
all of its radiology machines

165
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:03,097
because of the closure,
so I was hoping that...

166
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:04,882
No, it's not gonna happen.
Look around.

167
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,101
We're underwater,
and more are coming.

168
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:08,886
I get that, OK?

169
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,626
But just because this kid
wasn't on that ship

170
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:12,672
does not mean
she isn't in danger.

171
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:15,153
Look, Maggie?

172
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:19,113
You're a capable, intelligent
woman with a big heart.

173
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:20,549
I can tell.

174
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,032
Well, thank you for
really seeing me, Dr. Frost.

175
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:29,210
I'm sure you can
figure this out if you try.

176
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:30,981
Does this usually work?

177
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,615
Does what usually work?

178
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,250
The charm assault and the
smile and the puppy dog eyes.

179
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:38,263
Uh, yeah, it does,

180
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:39,568
most of the time.

181
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:41,418
- OK.
- This is Zoey.

182
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:44,209
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hello.

183
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:47,684
How are...

184
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:49,896
are you?

185
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:54,729
Where are her parents?

186
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,368
She's been in the system since

187
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:58,371
she was four years old
when her mom abandoned her.

188
00:07:58,408 --> 00:07:59,402
She's never met her dad.

189
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:01,479
I'm sorry to hear that,
but who gave you permission

190
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:02,896
to bring her here now?

191
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:05,899
Her DCFS rep.
I have the paperwork.

192
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,945
Zoey's been in and out
of my ED the past couple

193
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,164
weeks with headaches, and today,

194
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:11,473
she got roughed up
by some older kids

195
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:12,760
because of her speech issues.

196
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,655
My hospital wants
to discharge her

197
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,768
without any further assessment.

198
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:20,100
OK, I'll call upstairs
and see if we can get her in.

199
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,918
You're an angel.

200
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:24,049
And you're trouble.

201
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:30,281
You know, it becomes endearing
once you get to know me.

202
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,832
It becomes less annoying
when you get to...

203
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,641
I'll just quit while I'm ahead.
Yep.

204
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:38,628
Nice to meet you, Maggie.

205
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:43,676
Hey, Ellis.

206
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:45,591
How you doing?

207
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,504
Where's, um...
where's Mom and Dad?

208
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,486
- Fighting, I think.
- You know what?

209
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:52,599
Sometimes my parents would fight

210
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:54,643
when they were worried about me.

211
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:55,754
So I don't know.

212
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,214
I mean, a lot of stuff
happened today.

213
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,004
You got hurt.

214
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,629
I think your parents are
a little worried about you,

215
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:00,872
right?
And your leg.

216
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:03,681
- My leg hurts.
- Huh.

217
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:06,685
Let me take a quick look, OK?

218
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,972
OK.
Um, you know what?

219
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:16,833
I think it's time
for Dr. Johnson

220
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:19,685
to check up on you anyway, so
I'm gonna go find him, OK?

221
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,016
Be right back.

222
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,728
OK, just try to stay off the leg

223
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,928
as much as possible
for the next few weeks.

224
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:29,426
Dr. Ripley?

225
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,704
Hey, Rosado.
How's it looking out there?

226
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:33,469
Still a lot of people
missing inside that ship,

227
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:36,511
but I want to give you
a heads up.

228
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:37,691
About what?

229
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:40,899
- The Pawel Wapniarski case.
- OK.

230
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:43,504
A witness just came forward
who puts you at the scene.

231
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:45,607
Claims he saw you at the bar
where Wapniarski was beaten

232
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:49,156
moments after it happened.

233
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:50,654
Look, I appreciate the heads up,

234
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,158
but I got nothing to hide.

235
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:53,531
I'd get a lawyer.

236
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:55,601
An arrest is not
out of the question.

237
00:09:56,926 --> 00:10:00,973
Dr. Ripley,
Code Blue, Trauma 2.

238
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:04,231
He's unresponsive.

239
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:06,736
One moment, he was fine,
the next moment, not.

240
00:10:07,136 --> 00:10:09,176
Mr. Harley?
Mr. Harley, can you hear me?

241
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:11,855
Heart rate 140.
Pulse ox 92.

242
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,622
Respiratory rate 30.
Blood pressure 78 over 40.

243
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:17,520
Abdomen's distended.

244
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:19,764
He's in hemorrhagic shock
and bleeding into the abdomen.

245
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,964
Could be a splenic laceration.
Page Archer.

246
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:23,599
Surgery's slammed.

247
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,996
Hybrid OR is the only
available option.

248
00:10:25,997 --> 00:10:28,259
OK, he needs blood.
Let's give him two by two.

249
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,348
Hang a liter of LR on
a pressure bag while we wait.

250
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:32,002
- Let's move.
- OK.

251
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:33,655
Ellis's leg
has a tissue infection

252
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:35,918
called necrotizing fasciitis.

253
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,095
The bacteria's point of entry
was the cut he sustained

254
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,879
during the accident,
and then it quickly

255
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,272
spread through the fascia.

256
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,969
So this is like
a flesh-eating bacteria?

257
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,058
What it also is
is a scary name for

258
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:46,842
an often
very treatable condition.

259
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,453
I... I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

260
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:50,107
Was the bacteria in the water?

261
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,978
Maybe, or it was on the object

262
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:52,979
that he scraped his leg against,

263
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,633
but that is just a guess.

264
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,069
And it's spreading so quickly.

265
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,723
Jeanine, Ellis is gonna be OK.

266
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,551
Good news,
we caught it fast, so,

267
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:01,292
- you know, we got options.
- Right.

268
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,468
I'd recommend antibiotics
and debridement.

269
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:05,818
We remove all the dead tissue,
irrigate the wound,

270
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:07,733
and then we leave it open
for a couple of days,

271
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,996
- clear out the infection.
- Surgery?

272
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,824
What about his hemophilia?

273
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:13,086
It's totally manageable
with meds.

274
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:14,827
My son almost bled out
an hour ago.

275
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:16,829
Now you want to fillet his leg?
No way!

276
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,570
What are the other options?

277
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:23,096
W... uh, well, we could
try stronger antibiotics.

278
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,750
Great.
Let's do that.

279
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,491
OK, but that's...
that's a risk.

280
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:29,711
His infection's too severe
for antibiotics alone.

281
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:31,061
You just said
that we caught it early.

282
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:32,888
To save his life, not his leg.

283
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:35,282
If the antibiotics fail, I mean,

284
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:37,328
amputation's gonna be
the only option.

285
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,113
We can't gamble his leg.
Let's do the surgery on Ellis.

286
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:41,767
Enough.

287
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,030
Tell them what you did, Seth.

288
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,771
- Jeanine, please don't.
- What?

289
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,294
What's the matter?

290
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:50,776
You don't want to talk
about it now?

291
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,344
We were below deck
when the ship capsized.

292
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,390
Water was rushing in
faster than we could swim.

293
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:58,349
Ellis was trapped
in a tangle of chairs

294
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,482
pressed against a wall,
and he was screaming to us

295
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:04,006
- for help.
- Please stop.

296
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,357
I turn around and Seth is gone.

297
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,360
So even though we almost
drowned several times over,

298
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,362
I pulled Ellis out alone.

299
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,278
- You don't understand...
- I understand perfectly, Seth.

300
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,062
You abandoned us.

301
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:18,934
You were gonna let our son die
to save yourself.

302
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:20,893
So, no, you don't get a vote.

303
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,851
I'm sorry.

304
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:24,244
I'm so sorry...

305
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:27,029
Stay the hell away from us.
No surgery, period.

306
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,430
- Ready?
- Ready.

307
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:39,129
On three.
One, two, three.

308
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,180
Ah, trigger the MTP.

309
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:49,269
- OK.
- Bolus. Start pressors.

310
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,488
We're in trouble.

311
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:53,012
Baby's blue.

312
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,275
Let's go.
She's apneic.

313
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,624
- Where's the neonatologist?
- Yes, doctor?

314
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,366
OK, I'll resuscitate.
Let's go.

315
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,109
Starting CPR.

316
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,241
We've got to get
her heart rate up.

317
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,677
Come on.

318
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:07,200
Show me how strong you are,
baby girl.

319
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,419
- Come on.
- V-fib.

320
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,203
Ah, damn it.
We need to shock.

321
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:11,987
Paddles.

322
00:13:11,988 --> 00:13:14,729
Charge to 120.
Clear.

323
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:18,733
Still in V-fib.

324
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,737
There you are!

325
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:25,697
All right.
Again, 200 this time.

326
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,786
Clear!

327
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:32,051
Ah, Mom's back.

328
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,444
OK.

329
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,880
Strange timing.

330
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,534
It's almost like
she heard her baby cry.

331
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:40,886
Or it's the electrical current.

332
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:50,025
Can I help, Ms. Howard?

333
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:51,853
No matter how tight
I make the tourniquet,

334
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:53,464
the bleeding won't stop.

335
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,076
Well, it's hard to compress
a blood vessel at the elbow,

336
00:13:57,077 --> 00:14:00,427
so just slide the tourniquet
above the elbow,

337
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:01,777
and then tighten it.

338
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:06,216
There you go.

339
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:09,567
This job is a lot of things,
but boring isn't one of them.

340
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:11,177
Want to know a secret?

341
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:13,484
I miss the hell out of it.

342
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,487
Not the suffering, mind you,
but being able to help

343
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,271
in an immediate way?

344
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:20,795
That adrenaline is a drug.

345
00:14:20,796 --> 00:14:22,493
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

346
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,104
Why'd you stop?

347
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,976
Being a clinical nurse, I mean.

348
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:30,718
I realized there are other
ways of being of service.

349
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:34,244
So I went back to school,
got my MBA.

350
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:37,247
Administration
was a natural fit.

351
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:38,944
So it's a trade-off.

352
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,077
Yeah, like most things
in life, Ms. Howard.

353
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:49,137
Dr. Archer?

354
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:49,823
Huh?

355
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,401
I have a second wave
of ship accident victims

356
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,775
coming in, but I'm out of space.

357
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:56,884
Bypass them to Jackson Monroe.

358
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:59,887
Is that really necessary?

359
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:02,237
We're getting slammed, huh?

360
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:03,487
Soon we'll hit
a tipping point where

361
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:06,035
we will be unable to maintain
a proper level of care.

362
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,026
So why don't we pivot?

363
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,985
Find empty ICU beds
and move the beds to...

364
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:13,901
- what's that room?
- The consultation room?

365
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:15,773
That is a tremendous
waste of space.

366
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:17,688
Your first day here and you...

367
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:18,924
you know everything, right?

368
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:21,151
Diverting patients
could cost red tag victims

369
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:23,365
precious time that they
can't afford to lose.

370
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,913
That also falls below
a proper level of care.

371
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:28,437
You're military.

372
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:29,700
Army.

373
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:31,440
Well, I guess that counts.

374
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:33,486
You?

375
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,575
Navy.

376
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:37,011
OK.

377
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:40,754
This is fun,
but I need a decision.

378
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:43,149
Yeah, what she said.

379
00:15:45,673 --> 00:15:47,674
Isaac?
Talk to me.

380
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,763
Late 20s adult female.
Critical.

381
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:51,330
Heart rate 133.

382
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:52,766
BP 94 over 59.

383
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,289
Intubated at the scene.

384
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,248
Frontal scalp wound, bleeding
controlled with dressing.

385
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:58,772
We've got an 18-gauge IV
on the left AC.

386
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,687
Her name is Wendy.
I'm her wife.

387
00:16:00,688 --> 00:16:02,036
Please just help her.

388
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:03,777
Let's go to
the consultation room.

389
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:06,127
Dr. Lenox,
the room is not prepped.

390
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:07,955
Walk and chew gum
at the same time.

391
00:16:07,956 --> 00:16:10,131
Dr. Hudgins, you're with me.

392
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:12,307
Get ready to rotate.
Let's go.

393
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:13,656
Let's go.

394
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:15,571
Let's flip this.

395
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,923
Put the bed here.

396
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:22,511
You OK?

397
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:24,972
Dr. Hudgins, you OK?

398
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:27,835
Yeah, I'll be fine.

399
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:34,416
Dr. Uh, Frost, I presume?

400
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,767
Dr. Abrams,
pleasure to meet you.

401
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,203
Uh, I imagine so.

402
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:40,422
- Can we talk in private?
- Yeah.

403
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:42,033
Be right back.

404
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,512
So I reviewed
the MRI brain imaging,

405
00:16:43,513 --> 00:16:44,687
and you're right.

406
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:46,472
Your patient has
a large 6-by-4-centimeter

407
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,517
glioma tumor
in her Broca's area.

408
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:51,303
Well, that explains the
sudden onset of speech issues.

409
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,696
Yes, that's why
I said you were right.

410
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:55,960
I can say it again if you like.

411
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:58,179
No, I'm good.

412
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,834
So, um, what happens now?

413
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:03,010
I get the kid on my table
ASAP so I can remove the tumor

414
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:04,620
before it does any more damage,

415
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:07,233
but there are some
significant risks.

416
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:15,066
What kind of risks?

417
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,111
Well, there's a chance
that you could completely

418
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:19,158
lose your ability to speak.

419
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:23,597
How... for...

420
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,513
For how long?

421
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,124
Permanently.

422
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,171
And if I don't...

423
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,434
don't do the surgery?

424
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:38,567
Well, pediatric brain tumors
are tricky to predict.

425
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:41,527
Your speech difficulties
might keep getting worse,

426
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,791
or they might stay
the same for a while.

427
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:48,708
But the tumor will likely
continue to grow and eventually

428
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:53,147
start to affect other functions
of the brain, like strength.

429
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:55,193
And by that time,
it'll be harder to remove,

430
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:59,327
and it might even progress
to Stage 4 brain cancer.

431
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:04,637
And by then,
I'm afraid it'll be too late.

432
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:06,987
Will you do the surgery?

433
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:09,903
I wish I could, but I...

434
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:12,079
I'm not a brain surgeon.

435
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,212
Not smart enough?

436
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:16,083
Wow.
That...

437
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:17,606
That was a good one.

438
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:22,655
Look, Dr. Abrams is the best

439
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:24,352
neurosurgeon in the country.

440
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,659
I mean, just ask him.
He'll tell you himself.

441
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:36,103
Look, Zoey,

442
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:38,758
I want you in the world.

443
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,283
OK, it's a better world
with you in it.

444
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:44,938
You're scared.
I get that.

445
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:49,987
But if you can embrace
that fear and move through it,

446
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:52,250
you will be shocked
how much stronger

447
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:54,643
you are on the other side.

448
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:56,732
So what do you say?

449
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,953
Y... you talk too much.

450
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,001
Well, guess what?

451
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:05,916
So will you,

452
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:08,962
very, very soon.

453
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,485
We got this, right?

454
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,096
We got this?
Yeah, come on.

455
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:13,967
We got it.

456
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:19,146
- Hey, Dale.
- Hey.

457
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:21,279
John Does are
in the back corner there.

458
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,413
OK.
Thanks.

459
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,788
Damn it.

460
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:57,010
OK, looks like
we're about done here.

461
00:19:57,011 --> 00:19:58,707
Bleeding's stopped.

462
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,840
Spleen's in the bucket.
Let's close.

463
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,711
Oh, what the hell is this?

464
00:20:02,712 --> 00:20:05,976
He's seizing again,
just like he did on his ship.

465
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,542
Whoa, ah!

466
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:09,588
Ah, damn it,
I lacerated the liver.

467
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,155
Heart rate increasing to 180.

468
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,634
Don't your paralytics
prevent seizures?

469
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:14,027
Yes, this shouldn't
be happening.

470
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:15,289
He's eating through
the paralytic.

471
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,117
I'll recheck my train of fours.

472
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:18,771
Get these seizures
under control.

473
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:20,164
I can't repair his liver
if he's bucking

474
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:21,643
like a damn bronco.

475
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:23,297
I've started an Ativan drip
to break the seizure,

476
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:24,907
and I'll re-bolus
so we can get out of here.

477
00:20:25,953 --> 00:20:27,214
Now what?

478
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:28,781
Pressure dropping, 90 over 40.

479
00:20:28,782 --> 00:20:30,000
He's bleeding
all over the place.

480
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:31,131
Where the hell's his O-Neg?

481
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:32,219
He's not gonna make it
without it.

482
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,742
I'll get it myself.

483
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,127
At a certain point,
I think if Dr. Ripley's

484
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,842
- not here and I am...
- What's holding up my O-Neg?

485
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,237
My patient's circling the drain.

486
00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:45,096
We've got a situation,
Dr. Ripley.

487
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,721
The MCI depleted
our supply of O-Neg.

488
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,260
These are the last five units.

489
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:50,838
And my patient
won't survive without it.

490
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:52,821
Yeah, neither will mine.

491
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,008
- You must be Dr. Lenox.
- Correct.

492
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,010
Run down your patients
for me, please.

493
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:59,088
28-year-old female,
severe head trauma.

494
00:20:59,113 --> 00:20:59,901
GCS is 6.

495
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,556
Intubated with
right flank stab wound.

496
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:02,929
She's in hemorrhagic shock.

497
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,948
Probably
a retroperitoneal bleed.

498
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:06,405
43-year-old male,
chest and abdominal trauma.

499
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,996
Grade 5 splenic laceration.

500
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,282
Possible late onset of epilepsy.

501
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:10,785
But didn't he cause
the whole accident?

502
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:12,713
No moral judgments.

503
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,071
We favor the patient
who has a better chance

504
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:18,031
for a positive outcome, period.

505
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:19,946
Prognosis for recovery?

506
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,861
If he makes it
through surgery, excellent.

507
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:24,472
He's bleeding out
in the OR as we speak?

508
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:25,821
We removed the spleen.

509
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:26,822
We're working on
a small liver lac now.

510
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:28,259
We just need blood.

511
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,173
My patient is only 28.
She's younger and stronger.

512
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,914
But her GCS was only 6, right?

513
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,176
Does she have a bleed?

514
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:34,526
- Was she anoxic?
- We don't know yet.

515
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,962
- No CT.
- Mm-hmm.

516
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,920
She needs the blood
and surgery first.

517
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,357
And what are the chances
of all that working out?

518
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:42,098
Or is your only argument
that my 43-year-old patient

519
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,101
- is too old?
- All right, that's enough.

520
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:47,843
The blood goes to Dr. Ripley.

521
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:49,628
Thank you.

522
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,717
I'm sorry, Dr. Lenox.

523
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:52,892
I would have made the same call.

524
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:54,416
Protocol demands it.

525
00:21:58,072 --> 00:21:59,551
Hannah?
Hannah.

526
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:02,031
- Hey.
- Hey.

527
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:03,337
Baby and mom
are both doing great.

528
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,904
I heard.

529
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:06,906
That's wonderful.
Um...

530
00:22:06,907 --> 00:22:07,994
What's going on?

531
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,822
I have some sad news.

532
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:13,000
I found Kelsey's husband
in the morgue.

533
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:25,925
Finn showed up
about five minutes ago.

534
00:22:25,926 --> 00:22:28,754
He was at another hospital.

535
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:30,669
Are you OK?

536
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,628
Yeah, uh,

537
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:34,673
guess I didn't realize

538
00:22:34,674 --> 00:22:36,850
how much I needed
good news today.

539
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:41,289
Me too.

540
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:47,555
Jeanine, there you are.

541
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:49,427
Oh, no, Ellis is fine.

542
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:54,432
I just wanted to
let you know that the, um...

543
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:58,958
the antibiotics are going in,
and fingers crossed.

544
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,916
Did my husband send you
to convince me

545
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,265
to let Ellis have surgery?

546
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:05,617
No, I have not discussed the...

547
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,141
the surgery with your husband.

548
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:10,143
But you do think
I said no to spite him.

549
00:23:10,144 --> 00:23:12,188
I absolutely do not.

550
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:15,148
I don't think you'd ever do
anything to hurt your child.

551
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:16,628
I mean, come on.
You saved his life today.

552
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:17,933
Enough said.

553
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:19,979
I mean, look,
you've had an unimaginably

554
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,633
horrible day today.

555
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,331
I... I mean...

556
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:27,421
I don't know why
Seth did what he did.

557
00:23:27,422 --> 00:23:30,511
That's Ellis's father, his hero.

558
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:32,165
He was our world.

559
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,254
I don't want to sound
for a second

560
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:37,779
like I'm trying to minimize
what he did or didn't do,

561
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,913
but human behavior, I mean,
it's just endlessly mysterious.

562
00:23:40,914 --> 00:23:42,871
And my sense,
for what it's worth,

563
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:46,832
is that he was just as shocked

564
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,052
by what he did today
as you were.

565
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:54,361
I keep replaying it in my head.

566
00:23:54,362 --> 00:23:56,972
I was holding Ellis's hand
with all the strength

567
00:23:56,973 --> 00:24:00,019
that I have because
I knew if I let it go,

568
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,977
the water would suck him
right under.

569
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:06,982
And for two minutes, I felt the
terror of losing him forever.

570
00:24:06,983 --> 00:24:11,030
And I will never forget
the way he looked at me.

571
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:15,077
I'm supposed to protect him,
and I was failing.

572
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,298
I was so tired.

573
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:22,650
But I just kept thinking,
"Do not let go of his hand.

574
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:25,349
Do not let go of his hand."

575
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:32,312
So maybe letting Ellis
have the surgery

576
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:35,446
would be letting go of his hand?

577
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:38,058
Yes.

578
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,498
Am I making a mistake,
Dr. Charles?

579
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:48,937
You know, that's not
really for me to say.

580
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:51,157
But I think if it were me,
I would just want to make sure

581
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:54,247
that this decision,
whatever it might be,

582
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:58,120
wasn't being driven
by my own fear

583
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,558
when it's my child
who might be suffering

584
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,039
the consequences, right?

585
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,612
Still in V-tach.

586
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:13,527
No pulse.

587
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:14,660
Dr. Hudgins?

588
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:18,227
Dr. Hudgins!

589
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:21,796
120.
Clear.

590
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:26,584
Oh, Dr. Hudgins,
it's worse now.

591
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:28,630
V-fib.

592
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:31,459
Dr. Hudgins.

593
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,332
Dr. Hudgins!

594
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:39,640
Zach!

595
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:41,599
Come back here!

596
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,905
- Maggie?
- Yes?

597
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:45,690
We need a doctor in here now!

598
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:46,648
I'll get someone.

599
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:50,304
200.

600
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:53,175
Clear.

601
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,445
You brought him back?

602
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:05,710
I'm certified in critical care.

603
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:07,363
It's been a while.

604
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:09,931
Where's Dr. Hudgins?
This is his patient.

605
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:13,195
He walked.

606
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,633
He abandoned his patient
and walked out on you?

607
00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:17,766
I'm afraid he did.

608
00:26:27,646 --> 00:26:31,563
No, no, no, no, no!

609
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:36,611
Wendy!

610
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:44,057
Oh, I am so sorry.
Are you OK?

611
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:46,132
That was a close one!

612
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,725
Yep.

613
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,394
- That was weird.
- People are weird.

614
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,309
How's Zoey's surgery going?

615
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,137
Oh, just got
an update from the OR.

616
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,269
Abrams should be done
within the hour.

617
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,489
Good.
All right, that's good.

618
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,230
You really care about her.

619
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:07,059
Yeah, I do.

620
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,756
What are you gonna do
when Jackson Monroe

621
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,846
- closes next week?
- I don't know.

622
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:14,327
Beg someone to let me
finish my residency?

623
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:15,763
You know what?

624
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:17,634
Maybe I'll find
a sugar mama and retire.

625
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,114
Yeah.

626
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:20,986
I can spend my days
drinking Pabst

627
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:24,076
and my savings getting
bleacher seats to Cubs games.

628
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,861
Well, as a White Sox fan,
I can't support that.

629
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:29,429
You like disappointment.
OK.

630
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,519
I'm learning so much about you.

631
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,912
Admit it.

632
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:35,348
I am more endearing
once you get to know me.

633
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,002
Uh-uh.
Just slightly less annoying.

634
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:38,743
- Mm, OK.
- Yeah.

635
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,922
Hey, that was a compliment,
whether you know it or not.

636
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:49,536
Dr. Johnson says
Ellis will be fine,

637
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:53,409
but the parents, not so much?

638
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,368
Mm, they got a lot of stuff
to work through.

639
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:58,806
Do you think they've got
a shot at staying together?

640
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,852
I don't know.

641
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:03,550
Sometimes you know, you, uh,

642
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,466
hit a point of no return.

643
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,426
How are you holding up?

644
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,994
Oh, you trying to get all up
in my business, Ms. Goodwin?

645
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:15,518
All up in your business.

646
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,653
I learned from the master.
So stop deflecting.

647
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,698
Breakups suck.

648
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,222
What are you gonna do?

649
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:25,790
I hear it helps
to talk to your shrink.

650
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:31,317
<i>Today's tragic events
recall another sad day</i>

651
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:34,407
<i>in Chicago history when
the SS "Eastland" capsized</i>

652
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:39,064
<i>109 years ago...</i>

653
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:41,196
You almost died
on the table today.

654
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,719
What?

655
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,374
You had a near fatal seizure,

656
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,985
which should not
have been possible with

657
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:48,943
the paralytics given
at the start of your surgery.

658
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,727
It didn't make sense
until we tested

659
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:51,903
your blood
for common seizure meds

660
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,208
and found Dilantin.

661
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:56,603
How long have you known
you had epilepsy?

662
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,605
How long?

663
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:00,825
Six years.

664
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,524
You should not have been
behind the wheel of that ship.

665
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:06,961
Not today, not ever.

666
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,485
If I told the company
about my diagnosis,

667
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:12,358
I'd have lost my job.
My family depends on me.

668
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,448
You had a responsibility
to disclose your condition.

669
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:17,841
And I was responsible.

670
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:21,280
I did everything
I could to manage it.

671
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:23,456
I took the medication,
changed my diet,

672
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:27,025
I exercised, I avoided alcohol,
and it worked for years...

673
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,853
Until today.

674
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:33,596
I thought
if anyone ever found out,

675
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:36,600
I'd just get fired,
and that'd be the end of it.

676
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,867
Never thought
I might hurt anyone else.

677
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:48,873
It was just one little lie.

678
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:53,617
One little lie.

679
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:57,578
Yeah.

680
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:07,848
Hey, Zoey.
You made it.

681
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,720
Hey, sweetie.

682
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,852
How are you feeling?

683
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:20,687
Hey, it's OK.

684
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,645
Just take a deep breath
and try again, all right?

685
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:23,864
No rush.

686
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:36,529
Did my surgery go OK?

687
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,487
Um...

688
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,924
You rocked it, Zoey,

689
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:42,927
just like we knew you would.

690
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,477
Dr. Hudgins?

691
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:02,528
I know you just met me,

692
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:05,164
but I'm not usually like this.

693
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,212
I'm so sorry.

694
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:09,426
What happened in there?

695
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,410
The day, it just got to me.

696
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:14,057
You're a resident.

697
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:16,866
I'm sure you've seen your
fair share of unpleasantness.

698
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:19,372
Not like today.
So much blood.

699
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,879
I froze up,

700
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:25,732
and I knew the patient
would be better off

701
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:27,215
if I wasn't there.

702
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:30,420
That's a normal human reaction.

703
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,501
But a doctor can't afford
to be normal.

704
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:37,242
We take an oath
to be more than that

705
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:39,113
so our patients
can have faith in us.

706
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:42,117
I know. I'm sorry.

707
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:47,034
You don't belong here,

708
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,253
and I don't think
there's any reason

709
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,777
for you to come back here
tomorrow.

710
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,779
What?

711
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,911
You're fired, Zach.

712
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,104
- Hey.
- Hey.

713
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:15,410
I was just coming down
to see you.

714
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:18,500
I hear congratulations
are in order.

715
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,112
You found me.

716
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:36,736
Sully called me that day
to tell me that he and his boys

717
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:40,000
had followed Pawel
to a bar in Lincoln Park.

718
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,089
He told me that they were about
to give him a proper beatdown

719
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,265
on my behalf,
and he was offering me

720
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:47,312
a chance to get my licks in.

721
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:50,489
I tried to talk him out of it,
but no one talks Sully

722
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,839
out of anything
once his mind is made up.

723
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,233
So I rushed over there
to try and stop it.

724
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,191
I was too late.

725
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,324
I found Pawel lying unconscious
in the alley,

726
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:02,327
just as Sully and his boys
were walking away.

727
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:04,764
He assured me that Pawel
couldn't ID any of them

728
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:09,638
because they all were
wearing face masks.

729
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:12,424
Why are you telling me this now?

730
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:14,208
'Cause you don't always
get a chance to apologize

731
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,646
to the people you hurt.

732
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:23,478
I shut you out, and I let
that jeopardize what we had,

733
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,568
and what we had was really good.

734
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,993
And for that, I'm sorry.

735
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:40,060
You fired Dr. Hudgins?

736
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,235
I made a judgment call.

737
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:42,976
You made a jud...

738
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:45,239
listen, you just got here.

739
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,720
You don't have the right
to make a judgment call.

740
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:49,678
You have no knowledge of
the way this place operates

741
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,071
or the chain of command.

742
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,725
He walked away from a patient.

743
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:55,249
I'm aware of that,
and I do not condone that,

744
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,947
but you should have
consulted with me first.

745
00:33:57,948 --> 00:33:59,645
I didn't see the need.

746
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:02,604
Goodwin signed off
on Zach's termination.

747
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:03,779
Chain of command.

748
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,433
Are you worried I'm here
because Goodwin's

749
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:07,392
lost confidence in your
ability to lead alone?

750
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:09,611
What I'm worried about
is your effect on morale

751
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:12,353
and making snap judgments
without consulting me.

752
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:14,921
I've run this ED just fine
before you came here.

753
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:18,577
Dr. Archer, your department
nearly came apart today.

754
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:21,797
No plan for overflow,
misuses of space,

755
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:24,757
blood shortages,
and a doctor who walked away

756
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:26,454
and nearly cost a patient
their life.

757
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:27,934
I wouldn't call
any of that just fine.

758
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:30,458
We were in the middle
of a mass casualty incident.

759
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:32,895
And in a few short days,
Jackson Monroe will close

760
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,638
and nearly double the patients
will come through those doors.

761
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,293
Today could become every day.

762
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,426
I'm here for a reason,

763
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:43,950
and it's not to keep
the status quo.
