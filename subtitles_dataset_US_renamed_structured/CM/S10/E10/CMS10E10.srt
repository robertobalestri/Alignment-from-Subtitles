1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,353
Stop!

2
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:07,571
- I need help.
- Maggie?

3
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:08,703
Right now. She's
lost a lot of blood.

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,704
We're going to trauma 1.

5
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:10,792
Pulse ox is dropping. Damn it.

6
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:11,923
Come on, Ms. Goodwin.

7
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:13,621
<i>You saved my life.</i>

8
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:15,927
I want you to promise
me that you'll

9
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:18,278
tear up your resignation.

10
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,498
Gaffney needs you, Dean.

11
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:23,370
After I got sober,
it took my family

12
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,762
a while to trust me again.

13
00:00:24,763 --> 00:00:27,113
But they did, except
my sister, Lizzie.

14
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:29,158
Hey, I know you really
don't want to talk to me,

15
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,726
but love you.

16
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:35,208
<i>Your spleen has been lacerated.</i>

17
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,079
I can't, in good
conscience, release you

18
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,081
<i>back into police custody.</i>

19
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:40,213
<i>Thank you.</i>

20
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,568
Who wants to be a doctor
like his Uncle Rip?

21
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,743
He's a natural.

22
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:50,266
Yeah.

23
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,051
Who would have thought
he'd like babies so much?

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,053
I don't like babies.

25
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,316
Just this one. Just you.

26
00:00:57,535 --> 00:01:00,059
- Dr. Stano.
- Dr. Ripley. Can we chat?

27
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,584
Yeah.

28
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,239
Your friend's injuries
seem to be healing up.

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,588
Yeah. Yeah.

30
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:09,459
He's giving me
hell all the time,

31
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,070
which is usually a good sign.

32
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,856
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
it also presents a problem.

33
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:18,077
If the injuries he sustained
from the fight are healed,

34
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,557
we have to discharge him.

35
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:22,646
You're going to send
him back to jail?

36
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,170
Tomorrow.

37
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:26,650
Tomorrow?

38
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:27,999
Sorry, that's just...

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,740
I understand his situation,

40
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:31,916
but I can't hold him any longer.

41
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,614
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,576
There's got to be
something we can do.

43
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:42,536
Hey, Sully had a splenic
lac when he came in, right?

44
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:43,624
Yeah.

45
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,105
OK, well, technically,
whoever was

46
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,584
the ED surgeon when
he was admitted

47
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:49,804
is still a consult
on Sully's care team.

48
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:51,762
Which means they'd
have a say in his care.

49
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,460
If you can convince them
to have a different opinion

50
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,852
than Stano's, then
they can mandate

51
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,158
Sully stay in the hospital.

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,420
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

53
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:59,074
Hey, can I take a look at that?

54
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,945
Thanks.

55
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,254
Lenox.

56
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,695
What is that?

57
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:13,262
It's Goodwin's get
well card. You sign?

58
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:14,481
Oh, thank you.

59
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:15,569
How about you, Mags?

60
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,136
I bought the card, Doris.

61
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,354
Really? You sure?

62
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,269
Because I've been
telling people I did.

63
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,314
Yeah, I heard her.

64
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:22,967
She sounded pretty confident.

65
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:26,623
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:28,451
So listen, about dinner tonight,

67
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:31,541
thought we'd go someplace
special, Le Manchot Ivre.

68
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,282
Oh, that's pretty fancy.

69
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:34,762
OK, true.

70
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,546
But I thought we could
reenact our first date.

71
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,200
I'll even spill
wine on my shirt.

72
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,506
Mispronounce coq au vin.

73
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:40,333
Hmm?

74
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:41,812
Sounds good.

75
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:43,379
Great.

76
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,166
Incoming!

77
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,431
What do we got?

78
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:52,432
- No.
- Sloan Hunter,

79
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,216
experiencing upper back pain.

80
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,305
- Lucas...
- BP 130 over 80.

81
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:58,002
- No, no.
- O2 is good.

82
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,656
She called 911 for back pain?

83
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:00,918
Yep.

84
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,050
You are only saying
that because you are

85
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,530
lousy at your job.

86
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:04,705
The thing is, her on-call
doctor is in the Maldives.

87
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:05,923
And Sloan doesn't
like to wait in line.

88
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:07,186
Plus dividends.

89
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,709
And that's not even
including dividends.

90
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,841
So, Ms. Hunter, could you
describe your pain for us?

91
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,626
Lucas, I swear to God, if you
get your group to divest...

92
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:13,931
All right, Ms. Hunter,
we need you to listen...

93
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,019
I'm going to come to
your house personally,

94
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,195
and I'm going to
give you an enema...

95
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,718
All right, she'll call you back.

96
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,416
All right, let's try this again.

97
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:24,246
So where exactly are you
experiencing discomfort?

98
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,074
I have back pain.

99
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,294
It started this morning,
and it's only getting worse,

100
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:30,600
which is why I'm here
for you to give me drugs

101
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:34,038
so that I can feel better.

102
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,823
Is that enough info?

103
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,129
Well, it's not really the
way things work around here.

104
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,914
When you come in with
pain, we try to figure out

105
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,263
what's causing it.

106
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,266
CAT scan, 1,500
milligrams of Robaxin.

107
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,268
Fine.

108
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,922
When can I have my phone back?

109
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:50,360
When I leave the room.

110
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:00,239
Dr. Lenox, hey, do
you have a minute?

111
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,892
Ripley, good. Come with me.

112
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,546
We have twins in the
ambo bay, and one of them

113
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,374
is having trouble breathing.

114
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,420
Why are they in the ambo bay?

115
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,073
All right, what have we got?

116
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:11,424
Powell and Elijah Hughes, 34.

117
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,077
Elijah had difficulty breathing.

118
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,949
He said it felt like
someone was sitting on him.

119
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,646
They were able to get
into the ambulance.

120
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:17,952
- But on the way here...
- Elijah collapsed.

121
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,301
He can't stand.

122
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,389
And we don't have
a gurney big enough

123
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,390
to get them inside the hospital.

124
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,739
Scissors.

125
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,394
Average run-of-the-mill case.

126
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,048
Transpo's working on a gurney.

127
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,658
- Vitals?
- For which one?

128
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,486
Why don't we start with
the one who can't breathe?

129
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,489
BP 85 over 43, O2 87%.

130
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,969
This ever happen before?

131
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,102
No, but Elijah has
cancer, angiosarcoma.

132
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,322
We're supposed to have surgery
here in three weeks at Gaffney.

133
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,280
There's no breath sounds
in the bottom half

134
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,455
of the right lung.

135
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:43,586
We have a large
pleural effusion.

136
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,458
Run and get 40
milligrams of Lasix.

137
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,155
- What's that mean?
- Fluid in the chest.

138
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,417
Do you guys share lungs?

139
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:49,766
No. Two sets of everything.

140
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,246
It's just our hearts
that are fused.

141
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,813
It's worse.

142
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:53,814
Can't breathe.

143
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:55,424
Elijah, look at me. It's OK.

144
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,425
Don't panic.

145
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:57,861
They're going to fix you.

146
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm always looking
at you. No choice.

147
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,561
Look, no more jokes, all right?

148
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,866
Save your energy.

149
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:03,998
I'll have to put
in a chest tube.

150
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,347
We don't have a kit,
only an OB pack.

151
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:06,479
That'll work.

152
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,436
We have to relieve
the pressure now.

153
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:08,568
We'll do a finger thoracostomy.

154
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:09,699
They're joined at the chest.

155
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,787
How do we even
know where to cut?

156
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,267
Figure it out.

157
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:14,095
We get it wrong, we puncture
a lung or hit the heart.

158
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:15,662
We can't risk waiting.

159
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:18,142
His respiratory system
is going to collapse.

160
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,018
We need a scalpel.

161
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,106
We'll do this together.

162
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:26,107
I'll listen.

163
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:27,848
You cut.

164
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:28,892
OK.

165
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:30,285
Now move the blade
a little higher.

166
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,895
Remember fourth
intercostal space.

167
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,506
OK, a little over.

168
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:34,637
Over again.

169
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:35,986
Hurry, please. He's choking.

170
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:36,987
You have to do something.

171
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:38,162
OK, stay above the rib.

172
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,339
- Please.
- There. Go.

173
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,145
Any chance you can
turn that way a little?

174
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,276
I guess I could try to...

175
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,539
No, you don't need to move.

176
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,975
You just almost died.

177
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,498
I think I had a
few more minutes.

178
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,544
Sorry, did you call Dr. Hayes?

179
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:12,719
Dr. Hayes?

180
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,024
You know him?

181
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,504
By reputation.

182
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:18,159
Yeah, he's kind of a rock star.

183
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,422
Well, he's the one
sawing us apart.

184
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,903
Wait, he's separating you two?

185
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:25,558
It's the only way to be able
to access Elijah's tumor.

186
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,125
X-ray.

187
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,218
Well, how do we look?

188
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,265
Let us touch base
with Dr. Hayes.

189
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,745
He's much more familiar
with your case.

190
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:39,746
And we'll talk again.

191
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,928
- Fresh from Taipei.
- Yes!

192
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,147
Did your grandma send these
for the Lunar New Year?

193
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,366
Let me get one.

194
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,323
Oh, I dream about
these every year.

195
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,456
- Thank you.
- Mags?

196
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,544
No, thanks.

197
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,459
- OK.
- Turning down free sweets?

198
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,461
I feel like I don't
even know you.

199
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,245
She got to save her
appetite for Le Manchot Ivre

200
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,508
tonight, right?

201
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,770
Hey, I just remembered
I have to run some

202
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:07,469
blood cultures over to the lab.

203
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,602
She seems a little
off today, right?

204
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:10,951
Hmm?

205
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:13,301
Maybe, but the nurses
have been working hard.

206
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:15,042
Might just be tired.

207
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,696
Yeah.

208
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:18,481
Hey, Han.

209
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:26,096
Hi.

210
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:27,271
What are you doing here?

211
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:28,708
- Is everything OK?
- Oh, yeah.

212
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,144
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

213
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,017
I... I came here to see you.

214
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:36,280
Hey, I'm Hannah's
sister, Lizzie.

215
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,934
- Oh.
- Hi. John.

216
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:39,414
Hey.

217
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,894
Wait, are... are
you the boyfriend?

218
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:41,895
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no, no.

219
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:42,983
- No.
- No, no.

220
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:45,028
- Just like regular friends.
- No.

221
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,029
- Got it.
- Yeah.

222
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,466
OK.

223
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,423
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- You too.

224
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:49,555
OK. Yeah. I'll see you.

225
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,687
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

226
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:58,085
I got your message, and I
was hoping we could talk.

227
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:59,521
Yeah, of course.

228
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,523
You know, I just need to
finish up with a patient,

229
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:05,092
and we can have
coffee in the café.

230
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:07,137
Sure. OK. Yeah.
I'll grab us a spot.

231
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,749
OK.

232
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,667
Well, he said he'd be down
momentarily, so... yeah.

233
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:15,972
You OK?

234
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,974
You seem nervous.

235
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:19,019
Oh, no.

236
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,368
No.

237
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:23,589
Just suddenly very
aware of my hands.

238
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,591
Right.

239
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:28,550
Well, while we have a
moment, I wanted to...

240
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,551
Oh, Dr. Hayes.

241
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:30,378
I'm Dr. Lenox.

242
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,597
This is Dr. Ripley.

243
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,076
Nice to meet you.

244
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:34,643
I heard you had a fun
morning with my favorite duo.

245
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,427
Which room are they in?

246
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:39,648
Actually, before we go in, we
wanted to discuss something.

247
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:43,304
We did an X-ray
and an updated CT.

248
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,654
The sarcoma has
grown exponentially.

249
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,787
The tumor has invaded
the vena cava and spine.

250
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,137
Caused the pleural
effusion in his right lung.

251
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,573
It's still a local invasion now,

252
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:52,792
but if it keeps
growing at this rate,

253
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,228
it'll be to the heart
in a matter of days,

254
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,446
and they'll be dead.

255
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,057
You'll need to move
up the surgery.

256
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,145
To when?

257
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,363
To now.

258
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:01,452
Are you serious?

259
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,759
Do you have any idea the
scope of this procedure?

260
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,283
We've been planning it
for nearly six months.

261
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,937
So then you should be prepared.

262
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,591
We'd need to gather
the team immediately.

263
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,506
I'm not even sure who's
in town right now.

264
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,334
I took the liberty
of making a few calls

265
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,727
while we were waiting
for you to arrive.

266
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:17,164
Most people are able to
make themselves available.

267
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,600
What did you say
your name was again?

268
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,123
Dr. Lenox.

269
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:22,604
And do you have a first name?

270
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,563
Caitlin.

271
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,217
OK, then, let's
update the twins.

272
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:29,307
And then we'll
gather the troops.

273
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,703
- Dr. Archer?
- That's me.

274
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:37,010
Sloan was asking, and I
know this is going to sound

275
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:40,143
absurdly privileged and
insane, if you have any kind of

276
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:44,104
protein wrap or... charcuterie.

277
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,671
Not since we changed chefs.

278
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:48,761
I know, dumb question,
but had to ask so I don't

279
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,501
get freaking
murdered in my sleep.

280
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,721
Mm. Tough boss, huh?

281
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:55,463
- Oh, she's a lunatic.
- Ah.

282
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:58,509
Well, then, you know, why stay?

283
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,340
That barracuda in there
has real influence, power.

284
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,255
I want that.

285
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:07,127
And if I hold my
nose for a few years,

286
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,303
I'll be on the path.

287
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:10,870
I mean, why should these
bastards get to make

288
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,436
all the important decisions?

289
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,351
I often ask that myself.

290
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:19,226
Speak of the devil.

291
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:21,968
Hello.

292
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:24,971
Sloan? Sloan?

293
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,803
Sloan? Sloan!

294
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:31,847
BP 68 over 38.

295
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:32,892
She's in V-tach.

296
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,023
Wait, what's going on?

297
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,329
I don't feel a pulse.

298
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,635
All right, get the crash cart.

299
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,202
What's happening? Is
she going to be OK?

300
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,987
Charge to 120.

301
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:41,988
Clear.

302
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,253
Still no pulse.

303
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:47,994
All right, get lidocaine 100.

304
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,560
Charge 200.

305
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,301
- Oh, my God.
- Clear.

306
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,394
She's back to sinus rhythm.

307
00:10:57,395 --> 00:11:00,006
Blood pressure coming up.

308
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,226
What the hell was that?

309
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,883
You're saying once
they're separated,

310
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:09,319
you want to go in
through his side?

311
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,669
Yeah, to remove the tumor
and repair the spine.

312
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,671
If I go in through the
abdomen, I'm going in blind.

313
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,759
Well, the problem is the tumor

314
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,456
has invaded the vena cava.

315
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,284
If we go in through
the side for you,

316
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:20,026
we could cause catastrophic
bleeding that we can't control.

317
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,332
You ever seen this many
alphas in a room at once?

318
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,551
What if we prepare for bleeding

319
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,509
with endovascular access?

320
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,815
How do you mean?

321
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:29,383
Occlude the aorta to
staunch any acute bleeds.

322
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:31,515
Get vascular control
from the inside out.

323
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:33,387
And then repair the vessel.

324
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:36,433
And where have you
ever seen that work?

325
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,175
The Helmand River
Valley in Afghanistan.

326
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:41,308
We got pretty good at finding
ways to stop bleeding.

327
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,613
Creative.

328
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:43,919
But if we leave it too long,

329
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,269
we get distal ischemia
or thrombosis,

330
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,923
end up with heart
attack or stroke.

331
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,882
So we only use it
intermittently.

332
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:53,146
Take it down periodically
to allow blood flow.

333
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:54,408
Sam?

334
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,715
Yeah, that could work.

335
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,282
Look, we can troubleshoot
the procedure all we want,

336
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,544
but what about numbers?

337
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:02,590
We're short doctors.

338
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,462
What's your
specialty, Dr. Lenox?

339
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,073
General surgery.

340
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,857
But as I mentioned, I did
a fair amount of vascular

341
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,772
- when I was deployed.
- Great.

342
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,949
Would you be available to
scrub in this afternoon?

343
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,211
Absolutely.

344
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,517
There's one.

345
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,172
I'm sure we can find others.

346
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,393
Still two creams?

347
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:26,179
Thanks.

348
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,095
It's been a while, I guess.

349
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,358
Yeah.

350
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,534
So how are you?

351
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:37,190
Dad said you've been
temping at a law firm?

352
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,235
Oh, no, that...

353
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,628
that ended.

354
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:44,066
I'm back waitressing
now at Cozy Corner.

355
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,765
Where Matt and I used to
take hot pepper flakes

356
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,767
and crush them up
and put them...

357
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,420
And put them in the
salt shakers and then

358
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,988
watch people freak out when
they put it on their food.

359
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,599
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, we were terrible.

360
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,864
You lost me a lot of tips.

361
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,955
You know, I'm really
glad you came by.

362
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,000
Me too.

363
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,916
I told him not to buy
illegal fireworks.

364
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,876
Luckily, it looks like you
jumped back just in time.

365
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:13,095
These look like second-degree
burns, so with proper care,

366
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:15,054
should heal up in
a couple weeks.

367
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,098
And the eyebrows?

368
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,796
They should grow back.

369
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,363
But I'm not going to lie, it
might be a tough few months.

370
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:22,278
My girlfriend's
going to kill me.

371
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:24,672
Look, I'll check back
with you guys in a few.

372
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,369
All right? Thanks.

373
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,718
- Hey, Maggie.
- Mm-hmm?

374
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,155
Let's get him dressed
with Xeroform, please.

375
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,286
Yeah.

376
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:33,115
I hate holidays with fireworks.

377
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:36,031
So your heart issues
and your back pain

378
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,904
both stem from an
underlying issue...

379
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:41,297
an aortic aneurysm
with a dissection.

380
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:44,953
And that means your
aorta is ballooning out

381
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,347
and tearing right
near your heart.

382
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,784
We'll need to get you in
for surgery to repair it.

383
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,177
But then she'll be OK?

384
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:53,657
Provided the surgery
is successful, yeah.

385
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,007
What does that even mean?

386
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,661
It means that while
it's the best option,

387
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,141
it's a serious procedure.

388
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:02,971
The aneurysm is affecting
the coronary arteries.

389
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:05,147
And that means that there's
a high risk of heart attack

390
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,847
in the operating room.

391
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:16,855
So you're saying I could
just die either way?

392
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,813
I'm not trying to
scare you, Ms. Hunter.

393
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:21,294
I just want to make
you aware of the risks

394
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,600
going into surgery.

395
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,167
OK.

396
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,041
Hand me my phone.

397
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,526
If you're telling me
that I might only have

398
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,878
a few hours left on this Earth,

399
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,055
then there are some people
that I would like to talk to.

400
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:43,969
Of course.

401
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,146
I'll leave you to it, then.

402
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:48,190
Good news.

403
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,496
We've coordinated
with your team,

404
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,280
and we can move up the surgery.

405
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:52,368
That's amazing.

406
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:53,717
To when?

407
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:54,893
We're still finalizing
some things,

408
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,069
but hopefully by this afternoon.

409
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,767
However, there are some
added complications.

410
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:00,942
The progression of the sarcoma

411
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,509
means we'll have to
resect the tissue

412
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,859
around Elijah's
spine and the vein

413
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,079
bringing blood to his heart.

414
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,559
Powell's chances of
survival are unchanged.

415
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,866
But Elijah's...

416
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:14,738
What... what are my chances?

417
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:17,089
I would say less than 50%.

418
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,052
Then we're not doing it.

419
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:26,228
Powell, I know you
don't think we should...

420
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,448
We're not doing a surgery
where the likeliest

421
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:29,971
outcome is you dying.

422
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,234
If the cancer is
untreated, it will spread.

423
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:33,583
It will kill you both.

424
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,411
So we'll do chemo or radiation.

425
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,936
I know that this is scary,
but we've been over this.

426
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,460
Angiosarcoma doesn't respond
to that kind of treatment.

427
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,115
It would take a miracle.

428
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:46,205
Well, that's just fine.

429
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,598
The fact that Elijah and
I are alive to begin with

430
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,165
is a miracle.

431
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,776
Right?

432
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,477
So we'll just bet on one more.

433
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,963
Well, what about you?

434
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,573
Are you... are you
seeing anybody?

435
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:07,791
No.

436
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,055
No, I was...

437
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,100
I was kind of seeing
this woman for a while,

438
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:17,062
but I broke it off because
she doesn't want kids,

439
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,411
and I really do.

440
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,803
Mm.

441
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:21,109
In fact, that's
actually something

442
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,893
I've been working on
for the last year or so,

443
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:25,287
doing IUI and then IVF.

444
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:26,636
Lizzie, that's amazing.

445
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:27,942
You're going to be the best mom.

446
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:31,772
Yeah, except it hasn't worked.

447
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:36,298
I was actually sort
of hoping that maybe

448
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,867
you could help me out
with some medical stuff.

449
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:40,868
Yeah, of course.

450
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:44,176
What do you need?

451
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:49,050
I need you to diagnose me with
polycystic ovary syndrome.

452
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,270
Wait, you... you have PCOS?

453
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:56,275
No, but... but my
insurance won't cover IVF.

454
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:59,017
And after the last
cycle, my savings are

455
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,454
just pretty much wiped out.

456
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:05,327
But PCOS patients apparently
get the same drugs.

457
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:08,287
So if... if you
diagnose me and then

458
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,636
- you write me the script...
- Lizzie...

459
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:10,854
Then I can afford another round.

460
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:13,292
And I really feel like
I know some things

461
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,858
that I did wrong before.

462
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,860
So I think that this
time, it'll take.

463
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,863
What you're asking for
is... is medical fraud.

464
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:23,519
Are you going to
lecture me about rules?

465
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,694
I'm not.

466
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:27,349
I'm sorry.

467
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,525
I don't want to... I don't
want to take us back there.

468
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:32,789
It's just... it's just,

469
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,097
you know how much I've
always wanted this.

470
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,620
And I want you to have this.

471
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,753
I do.

472
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:42,321
I can't jeopardize my career.

473
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:49,937
Sure, yeah, I get it.

474
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:55,899
It was a long shot.

475
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,118
Listen, I should get going.

476
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,337
No, Lizzie, there's...

477
00:17:58,338 --> 00:17:59,860
I had something I
had to get to anyway,

478
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:02,819
but it was so nice to see you.

479
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,605
And I'm so glad things are
going so well for you, really.

480
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,694
Lizzie, that's...

481
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:16,311
So I may be completely
off base here,

482
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:19,662
but I feel like something
maybe is bothering you.

483
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,055
Why would you say that?

484
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:24,276
Well, I guess normally,
we have a certain witty

485
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:27,148
repartee between us, a
light banter, if you will,

486
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,368
which I've always kind
of considered our thing.

487
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:32,371
But today, you don't seem to
be enjoying it quite as much.

488
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,938
Well, maybe you
need better jokes.

489
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:37,854
See, now, that can't be it.

490
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,465
Come on. What's going on?

491
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,293
I'm sorry.

492
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,642
I just... it has
nothing to do with you.

493
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:44,340
It's just that, uh...

494
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,865
I'm breaking up
with Loren tonight.

495
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,606
Wait, you're breaking
up over dinner?

496
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,347
That's a terrible idea.

497
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:54,262
Why?

498
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:56,612
No, I... I want to
end on good terms.

499
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:59,267
And I want to give him a
chance to say what he needs to.

500
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:01,182
And we have to work together.

501
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,705
Mm-hmm.

502
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,185
I don't want it to be weird.

503
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,882
Oh, it's going to be weird...

504
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,102
for you, for him, for all of us,

505
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,321
no matter what he says.

506
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:10,670
All right, so skip the dinner.

507
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,193
Just get it done fast.

508
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,152
You know, I'm regretting
talking to you.

509
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,197
I'm just saying, all right,
it's like a Band-Aid.

510
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,894
- Mm.
- Get in. You break his heart.

511
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:18,982
Get out.

512
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,333
All right?

513
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,208
Frustrating, everyone
moves heaven and Earth

514
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,124
and then the patients
decline surgery.

515
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,387
Did you need something?

516
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,389
Yeah, actually, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

517
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,217
I was trying to
find a better time,

518
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,088
which this obviously isn't.

519
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,351
What is it?

520
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,396
I want to discuss
my friend Sully.

521
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,442
- Up on the seventh floor?
- Right.

522
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,139
Well, he's being
discharged tomorrow,

523
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,228
but I'm not sure I agree
with Dr. Stano's assessment.

524
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,230
I feel we could do
another CAT scan,

525
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,711
make sure he didn't
develop a splenic artery,

526
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:52,755
pseudo aneurysm.

527
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:54,757
Feels like a reach.

528
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,542
But you know that.

529
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,935
Your friend goes back to jail
if he gets discharged, right?

530
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,245
Look, he's like a brother to me.

531
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,813
And I can't just sit here
and watch him get ripped

532
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:08,118
away from his family again.

533
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,078
So if you could
just talk to Stano.

534
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,819
Sorry, the answer's no.

535
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,256
You're letting your emotions
cloud your judgment.

536
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:18,085
OK, I get emotion
is a vice for you.

537
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:20,348
So take emotion out of it.

538
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,350
Make it about standard of care.

539
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:23,786
Where do you think Sully's
going to get better treatment,

540
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,440
here or Cook County?

541
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,616
The care he receives in
jail isn't my purview.

542
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,139
I can't solve all
the world's problems.

543
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,315
I'm not asking you to.

544
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:32,708
Just this one.

545
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:36,103
Look, I'm just saying,
if you at least suggested

546
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:39,715
they run more tests,
it would pause things,

547
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:42,065
buy him a little more time.

548
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,111
Because there'd be no consensus.

549
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,286
Exactly.

550
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,506
If nobody agrees, they
can't discharge him.

551
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,377
We need to talk to
the twins again.

552
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,988
What?

553
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:53,773
Goodness.

554
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:54,904
Look at the time.

555
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,210
What is that?

556
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:58,212
It's a Patek Philippe Twenty-4.

557
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,779
- I just looked it up.
- It's diamonds?

558
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,955
- Yes.
- Looked it up.

559
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:03,609
Where... where did you get that?

560
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,393
Well, I went in to
check on that lady,

561
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:08,267
and she just gave it to me.

562
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,314
And I apologize.

563
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,273
I never should have said that.

564
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,839
Now, your son goes
to DePaul, right?

565
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,884
OK, that's it.

566
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:18,928
That's it.

567
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:20,147
Everybody out.

568
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,542
I need to speak to the patient.

569
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:35,554
You're supposed to
rest before surgery.

570
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:37,338
I am trying to tie up loose ends

571
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,209
before I go under the knife.

572
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,255
I might not have
enough time left.

573
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,039
And there are things
that I need to say.

574
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,389
To all of Chicago?

575
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,782
I know it may seem hectic.

576
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:52,353
But when my heart stopped,
I had an experience.

577
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,313
So you saw God and you
want to spread the word,

578
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,705
the pearly gates and such?

579
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:58,272
No.

580
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:00,143
I didn't see God.

581
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,232
But I did see where I was going.

582
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:05,497
And there was no white light.

583
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:06,802
Oh, you mean...

584
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,022
I'm going to hell when
I die, Dr. Archer.

585
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:10,371
Hell?

586
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,156
Unless I can buy it back

587
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,942
with whatever time I have left.

588
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:18,553
Sloan's asked me to reach
out to everyone she's wronged

589
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:20,686
to make amends.

590
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:22,209
Turns out, it's...

591
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,560
it's quite an extensive list.

592
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,390
Mind if we speak
with you a minute?

593
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,783
If you're coming to talk to us

594
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,481
about seeing me socially
outside of the hospital,

595
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:34,439
I accept.

596
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,702
Are we being discharged soon?

597
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:38,138
Not yet.

598
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,053
There's something we
need to find first...

599
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:41,446
a consensus.

600
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,186
Like with the other doctors?

601
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:44,231
No.

602
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:46,538
Between the two of you.

603
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,583
I think we were pretty clear.

604
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:52,065
I think you were pretty clear.

605
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,763
You were mostly quiet.

606
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,340
I don't understand
emotion very well.

607
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:09,648
So when I was a kid,

608
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:12,912
I would just say what
I knew to be true,

609
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,696
no matter the consequences.

610
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:18,308
And there was a price
to be paid for honesty.

611
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:19,571
My teachers hated it.

612
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:22,095
And other kids made fun of me.

613
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:25,272
And my parents,
you know, begged me

614
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:27,753
to keep my mouth shut.

615
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:30,886
But when I tried that, it
just made things worse,

616
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:33,193
because I was still ostracized.

617
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:37,589
And I just had this
pit in my stomach

618
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,461
of all the things
that I hadn't said.

619
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:44,857
Then I found medicine, this
world where speaking up

620
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:48,469
is essential, where
patients' lives depend on it.

621
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,472
And even if people
still said mean things,

622
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:55,650
I was fine, because I realized
that the price for honesty

623
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:58,174
is worth every penny
because you get to live

624
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:59,612
a life without regrets.

625
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:08,049
Elijah, this right now is
the most important decision

626
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:11,231
you will ever make.

627
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:14,496
And after today, you
can't take it back.

628
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,327
Don't you want a say in it?

629
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:27,677
Listen, I'm happy you found
your spirit animal or whatever.

630
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,076
But this is our life.

631
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,774
And we've made a decision.

632
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,428
So finish the papers
to discharge us...

633
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:37,126
- Powell...
- So we...

634
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,301
She's right.

635
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:45,004
We don't have a consensus.

636
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:46,875
What are you talking about?

637
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,879
You're opinionated,

638
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,533
and I go along with it

639
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:56,711
because you're
strong and selfless.

640
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:59,671
And I never know what to
say except to make a joke.

641
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,107
Elijah, we can't agree to this.

642
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,239
But...

643
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,720
I can't be the
reason that you die.

644
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:11,770
I can't just sit here beside you

645
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:13,902
knowing that I'm
slowly killing you.

646
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,081
We need to do the surgery.

647
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:27,568
It's just...

648
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,788
I don't know how to
live without you.

649
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:35,228
I know.

650
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:38,492
I'm awesome.

651
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:40,233
But you know I'm right.

652
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:57,337
OK.

653
00:25:57,338 --> 00:25:59,295
What he said.

654
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:07,042
Excuse me.

655
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:08,914
Quite the crowd.
Have they started?

656
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:10,393
No, they're still setting up.

657
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:13,222
The red caps are Powell's
team, yellow are Elijah.

658
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:16,008
Hey, any luck with Lenox?

659
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:19,011
Trying to build up the
courage to tell Sully.

660
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:21,622
Hey, how was coffee with Lizzie?

661
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:24,364
Well, she wants me to
diagnose her with a disorder

662
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:26,366
she doesn't have so I can
prescribe her medication

663
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:29,021
she doesn't need so
she can get pregnant.

664
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,023
I say don't do it.

665
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:32,807
She doesn't talk to you
for, what, five years,

666
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,461
and then shows up
just to use you?

667
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,289
- Screw that.
- I don't know.

668
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,464
It's like, I can't be her doctor

669
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,509
and her sister at the same time.

670
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,207
So then don't.

671
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,512
What do you mean?

672
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:43,862
I mean don't.

673
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,385
Forget about being her doctor.

674
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:49,258
Just be the best
version of her sister.

675
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,827
And if that's not good
enough, then that's on her.

676
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,744
Ladies, gentlemen.

677
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,662
All right, I think we're ready.

678
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:05,579
What about you two?

679
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,885
Ready?

680
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:15,763
Well, I guess it'll be good
to finally get some privacy.

681
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:30,996
See you on the other side.

682
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:34,434
Yeah.

683
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:36,088
See you.

684
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,934
Hi.

685
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:58,458
OK, so the surgery
was a success.

686
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,068
She should make a full recovery.

687
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,940
And you'll be able to
see her in a few hours.

688
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,681
Oh, my God, I was so nervous.

689
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,118
I'm so glad, especially
after all the smack

690
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,249
I talked about her earlier.

691
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,469
- And then she was so nice.
- Mm.

692
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,210
I felt like the worst
person in the world.

693
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:12,428
Well, you're not.

694
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,257
And now you don't have to worry.

695
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:18,739
Hey, can I ask you something?

696
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,567
Yeah.

697
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:23,962
Do you think it matters
why people change?

698
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:28,706
Like if they're only doing
the right thing out of fear?

699
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,360
I... I think that if...

700
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,536
if you have a moment of clarity

701
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:37,889
and you see a better
version of your life,

702
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,064
don't ask too many questions.

703
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:43,068
Just run at it, and
don't look back.

704
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:50,771
Yep.

705
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:51,729
Hey, you got a second?

706
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,860
Mm-hmm.

707
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,035
Oh, I'll give you a minute.

708
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,994
I didn't realize
that you were...

709
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:58,170
It's nothing you
haven't seen before.

710
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,867
Going to get changed for dinner?

711
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:05,699
I was thinking that
maybe we could skip it.

712
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,788
OK.

713
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:12,532
You know, you're
amazing, um, obviously.

714
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:15,056
I mean, just going
back to the restaurant

715
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:18,407
where we had our first
date, and I appreciate

716
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:22,063
how thoughtful and
romantic you are.

717
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:25,066
I think we should break up too.

718
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,720
Wait, you want to break up?

719
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,027
No.

720
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:30,855
But I can tell you're
not feeling this.

721
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,423
You know, I told myself that

722
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:37,122
maybe it was stress
or something, but...

723
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:40,125
but it's been
evident for a while.

724
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:43,215
I'm not wrong, am I?

725
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,870
No, you're not wrong.

726
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,743
Yeah.

727
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:53,138
I really wanted it to
work, to be right and...

728
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,446
Wait, you're leaving?

729
00:29:57,447 --> 00:30:00,319
You don't want to
talk about this?

730
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,799
I can't change how you feel.

731
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,286
It did have its moments, though.

732
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:26,693
I hope you find what
you're looking for, Mags.

733
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:28,303
You too.

734
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,060
They blacked out the Bulls game.

735
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,409
You think I can
call the station?

736
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,933
Do, like, a Make-A-Wish thing?

737
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,325
Get them to air it?

738
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,895
Don't love that look.

739
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,898
Guessing no luck buying
me some more time here.

740
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,904
Look, I was...

741
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:06,907
I was trying to talk to
a colleague, but that...

742
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,213
that didn't pan out.

743
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:09,823
But I have... I have a
call in with a lawyer.

744
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,477
And there's another
colleague I can...

745
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:13,131
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slugger.

746
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:15,351
We knew this was coming.

747
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:21,835
And honestly, the fact
that I got any time at all,

748
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:24,664
I mean...

749
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:30,665
I got to hold my
kid, sit with Lynne.

750
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:33,412
You gave me that.

751
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:36,154
So stop feeling guilty.

752
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:38,156
And today isn't tomorrow, right?

753
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:43,726
So might as well enjoy it.

754
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:45,250
Yeah.

755
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:47,339
You know, Lynne's
coming by later

756
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,037
with something I've been
meaning to give you.

757
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,910
You should... you
should come up.

758
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,172
Yeah.

759
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:55,870
Sounds good.

760
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:00,874
Arterial cannulas in
on both, venous in.

761
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,441
Everything looks good.

762
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:05,487
Start bypass.

763
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:08,012
Let's get cross-clamps ready.

764
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,364
Amazing, isn't it?

765
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:13,582
Yeah, their hearts
beat in unison.

766
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,845
See that band of scar tissue?

767
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:17,543
It conducts electricity
between them.

768
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:21,155
Powell's heart acts as a
pacemaker for Elijah's.

769
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:24,854
It's hard to imagine being
that close to somebody.

770
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:28,032
Something to shoot for, though.

771
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,120
We're on bypass.

772
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,774
Ready to cross-clamp.

773
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,041
Arterial cross-clamp in.

774
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,435
Administer cardioplegia
and stop the heart.

775
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,835
What's happening?

776
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,402
Powell's pressures are steady.

777
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:51,707
The venous flow is decreased.

778
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,405
Venous pressure still dropping.

779
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,233
The sarcoma must be
invading the vena cava

780
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,495
more than we thought.

781
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:57,887
Flow still stable on Powell.

782
00:32:57,888 --> 00:32:59,237
We need to recannulate
the venous line,

783
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,065
- go around the tumor.
- It'll take too much time.

784
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,936
And the risk of stroke
will be through the roof.

785
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:04,416
It doesn't matter.

786
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:05,330
If we don't do this now,
Elijah's not going to make it.

787
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:06,896
Scalpel.

788
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:34,186
So what's up?

789
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:39,538
So I thought about
what you said.

790
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:44,064
I can't diagnose you with
something you don't have.

791
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:48,722
But I wanted to give you this.

792
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,899
25 grand?

793
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,943
I can't accept it.

794
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,164
Yes... yes, you can.

795
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:03,127
You know, growing up
without Mom was...

796
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,954
I mean, it was
hard on all of us.

797
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:08,915
But secretly, I always
felt a little guilty

798
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:12,962
because it wasn't as hard on me.

799
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:18,229
Not because I didn't know
her, but because I had you.

800
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:23,190
You always took care of
me, made me feel safe.

801
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:27,847
It would be a tragedy if
you never got to be a mom.

802
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:33,113
So I will do everything
I can to support you,

803
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,985
because you taught me that
that's what sisters do.

804
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,642
Thank you.

805
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:00,315
Oh, my God.

806
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:05,059
Look at that.

807
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:09,149
What? What?

808
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,586
Why are you looking like that?

809
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,762
Did you not get all the cancer?

810
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:16,156
No, it's not that.

811
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:19,464
Powell.

812
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:23,511
Though the initial
separation was successful,

813
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,034
when he came off bypass,

814
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:27,820
your brother suffered
a massive stroke.

815
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,518
His brain swelled and herniated.

816
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:33,086
No, no.

817
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:36,350
We did everything we could,
but he lost all function.

818
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:37,743
Powell!

819
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:39,179
He's on life support now.

820
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,528
Powell!

821
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:42,748
Elijah...

822
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:45,185
he's gone.

823
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,404
Sorry.

824
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:50,364
No.

825
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:52,584
No.

826
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:58,720
Bring me to him.

827
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,335
I don't want to be alone.

828
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:54,341
I don't want to be.

829
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:07,963
Hey, you did the right thing.

830
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:12,141
If it weren't for you,
they'd both be dead.

831
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:14,056
I was thinking about
your friend Sully,

832
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:15,232
and you were right.

833
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,059
We... we should run more tests.

834
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,496
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

835
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:21,194
A CT angio should get us
a bit more information.

836
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:22,630
And he'll just have to
stay in the hospital

837
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:24,632
a little longer.

838
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,639
Thank you.

839
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:37,819
OK, now you're just
making excuses.

840
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,212
Where is that cap table?

841
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:40,953
Sorry, I'm looking.

842
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:42,302
Ah, what is going on?

843
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,130
I was giving post-op
instructions, but...

844
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,175
I'm going to have
to call you back.

845
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,742
I'm not going to let
you end my call again.

846
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:48,787
I learned my lesson.

847
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:49,875
Oh, did you?

848
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,442
What happened to making amends?

849
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,095
I figured you'd just given
me a new lease on life.

850
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,662
I have 40 years to atone.

851
00:37:54,663 --> 00:37:57,012
But my shareholders'
meeting is next week.

852
00:37:57,013 --> 00:38:00,190
We got to keep our eye
on the prize, right, Meg?

853
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:04,281
Yeah.

854
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,326
All right, then, so
regarding your recovery,

855
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:08,633
there's a few important
rules for the first few days.

856
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:11,505
No lifting, no pushing or
pulling over 10 pounds.

857
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:12,767
Hey.

858
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,029
Meg.

859
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,205
Are you writing this down?

860
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:18,034
- Meg?
- Yeah.

861
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:22,951
I... I mean, no,
actually, no, I'm not.

862
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:25,693
What?

863
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:27,956
Sorry, it's... just I...

864
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:29,394
I quit.

865
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:37,705
You almost died today.

866
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:41,100
And now you're back to being
the same horrible person.

867
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:42,536
And that's not even
why I'm quitting.

868
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,756
I'm quitting because
out of everyone

869
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,888
you tried to buy back
today, I was the only one

870
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,542
in the waiting room.

871
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:52,894
Yeah, for all your money and
your power and influence,

872
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:57,029
no one would have cared if you
died on that operating table.

873
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:01,250
And I thought I
wanted what you have,

874
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:03,427
but you have nothing.

875
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,871
I think I found a
moment of clarity.

876
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,272
I think you might need
to write this down.

877
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:27,059
It's freezing up here.

878
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,582
It'll be worth it.

879
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,845
Just saying it's supposed
to start, like, soon, right?

880
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:35,459
Hey.

881
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,416
Hey.

882
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,852
What are you doing up here?

883
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:40,072
Don't you have a
dinner to go to?

884
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:42,901
I ripped off the Band-Aid.

885
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:45,773
Ah, that's tough.

886
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:47,209
Sorry.

887
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,300
Hey, all right.

888
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:59,221
Told you it'd be worth it.

889
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:05,619
I thought you hated any
holiday that had fireworks.

890
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,581
Yeah, well, I guess I'm
turning over a new leaf.

891
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:15,934
Kind of perfect
with the New Year.

892
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:17,805
Yeah.

893
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:19,981
New Year, new you.

894
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,071
Mm.

895
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,339
Hey, I got good news.

896
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,082
I think we bought...

897
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:40,828
I wasn't here.

898
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:42,874
They said he had
a... a blood clot,

899
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:46,878
and... and it happened so
fast, they couldn't save him.

900
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,183
- Hey.
- And I wasn't here.

901
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:50,055
- Hey.
- I wasn't here.

902
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:52,013
Yeah. It's OK.

903
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,102
I wasn't here.

904
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:55,800
It's OK.
