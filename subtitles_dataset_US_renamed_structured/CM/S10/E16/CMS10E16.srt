1
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:06,222
Hey, Catie.

2
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:08,442
I told you never to come here.

3
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:10,313
<i>He loved her so much.</i>

4
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:12,534
I just wish he
loved us that much.

5
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:17,016
You played his mom
in "Nick of Time."

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,887
It's great to see you.

7
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:23,674
Hello!

8
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:25,067
Please don't leave us.

9
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,155
I will not leave you.

10
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,549
Ripley, get out of there now!

11
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,857
Whatever happens,
I'm OK with it.

12
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,946
<i>I need you.</i>

13
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:36,513
Trust me, I am not the only one.

14
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:37,862
No! Mitch?

15
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,821
I love you too.

16
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,739
Dr. Lenox, we've
got an intake.

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,046
Josephine Tucker,
38-year-old female.

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,525
Suffered a seizure
30 minutes ago

19
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,049
and treated with
Ativan at the scene.

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,139
Heart rate's 110, BP's 131/77.

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,228
Respiratory rate and
efforts all over the map.

22
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,491
She's been in a coma
for the past 20 years.

23
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,579
22 years.

24
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,320
That's her mother,
Angela Tucker.

25
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:03,105
We're gonna take good
care of your daughter.

26
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:04,498
On my count.

27
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,674
One, two, three.

28
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:07,805
Call respiratory.

29
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:08,980
Let's get her hooked
up on high-flow

30
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,547
and order ABG analysis too.

31
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:12,158
On it.

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,681
Her urine output has been
less the last couple of days.

33
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:14,899
Darker too.

34
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,597
That's helpful. Thanks.

35
00:01:16,598 --> 00:01:19,208
Sunset sign and
Cheyne-Stokes respirations.

36
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:20,601
What... what does that mean?

37
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:22,211
Mrs. Tucker, your
daughter's symptoms

38
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,778
are indicative of hydrocephalus.

39
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:25,214
A build-up of
fluid in the brain.

40
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:26,346
She's bradying.

41
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:27,521
Heart rate's in the 30s.

42
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,131
She's having another seizure?

43
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:30,567
Page neurosurgery?

44
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:32,613
There's no time. 1
milligram atropine IV.

45
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,397
Prep and drape her
right frontal scalp.

46
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:36,225
We need to place
an emergent EVD.

47
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:37,922
What is that? What's an EVD?

48
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:40,099
Dr. Lenox will drill a small
hole in Josephine's skull

49
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,491
and insert a tube
to drain the fluid.

50
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:43,145
It's the only way
to save her life.

51
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,669
Do we have your consent?

52
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,802
Yes. Do it.

53
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:49,283
Scalpel.

54
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,634
Drill.

55
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:57,942
Catheter.

56
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:07,648
Now page neurosurg.

57
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,607
Let's get labs and
a head CT, stat.

58
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:14,437
Is she gonna be OK, Dr. Lenox?

59
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:16,787
She's stable now, and
her breathing's improved.

60
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:18,834
We'll know more soon.

61
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,792
I'll wait with Mrs. Tucker
until neurosurgery gets here.

62
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,272
Good. Wait.

63
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:25,100
Aren't they handing out
Match Day envelopes soon?

64
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,145
You should go.

65
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,234
Oh, is that happening today?

66
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:29,365
Why are you stalling?

67
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,453
No, I'm not stalling.

68
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,847
I'm just avoiding the crowd.

69
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,284
Mm.

70
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,157
Cardiothoracic at Gaffney
is impossible to get into,

71
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,723
and for some insane reason

72
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,377
I put the University
of North Dakota

73
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:44,206
as my second choice because
it seemed realistic.

74
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:46,252
Which it is, because
it's a frozen hellscape.

75
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:49,734
Naomi, go get your envelope.

76
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,997
Hi.

77
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,347
Hey.

78
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:56,044
Thank you so much for
setting this up for me.

79
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,828
Of course. Yeah.

80
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,222
Let's just find Maggie
for you, get you started.

81
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,571
Yeah.

82
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:03,573
Hey, how's your
friend, uh, Dr. Ripley?

83
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:05,445
They were talking about him
on the news this morning.

84
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,229
Yeah, no, he's gonna be OK.

85
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,622
Oh, good. I'm so glad.

86
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:09,753
Yeah.

87
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:11,233
Listen, if you're
still up to it,

88
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,192
maybe we can have
that dinner tonight.

89
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,455
Um, yeah.

90
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,152
No, that'd be great.
- OK.

91
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:19,198
Maggie. Hey, look who it is.

92
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,503
- Ainsley.
- Hi.

93
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,244
It's so good to see you again.

94
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,854
Thank you so much for
letting me shadow.

95
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:25,465
Absolutely.

96
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,511
Gonna be learning from the
best charge nurse around, so...

97
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:30,557
Does he always lay
it on this thick?

98
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,298
Mm, you have no idea.

99
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,647
Ah.

100
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,649
All right, let's go
find you some scrubs.

101
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,954
OK.

102
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,347
Did you bring a
comfortable pair of shoes?

103
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,349
Uh, no, I didn't. But, um...

104
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:46,008
I love you.

105
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,228
Mom's here, Josie.

106
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,708
I'm right here.

107
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,539
Is that Nurse Goodwin?

108
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,454
Uh, that's Ms. Goodwin, yeah.

109
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,239
She's our chief of
patient services.

110
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,892
Chief?

111
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,285
She's the boss now?

112
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,461
She's my boss, certainly.

113
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,158
You know Ms. Goodwin?

114
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:17,256
Mrs. Tucker, Josephine's
hand is moving.

115
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,387
Is that normal?

116
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,171
Oh, my God.

117
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:23,305
No, I've never seen her do that.

118
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,786
Never.

119
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,701
What does it mean?

120
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,920
We will have to do
some tests to confirm,

121
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:33,795
but it indicates an
increased neuroplasticity.

122
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,188
She might be waking up?

123
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,755
Yes, it's possible.

124
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,603
Isn't this against
some kind of rule?

125
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,344
You're a hero, man.

126
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,745
What do you think you're going
to do, break your other ankle?

127
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:09,352
So, uh, what's going
on with Hannah?

128
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:13,050
Uh, we're, uh,
saving the big talk

129
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,618
till I'm back on my feet.

130
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,664
OK.

131
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,666
Doris asked me to
bring these up.

132
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:23,800
Man, you have got quite the
flock of admirers down there.

133
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,715
Oh, God. More flowers.

134
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,545
All right, that is my cue.

135
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:31,025
Oh.

136
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:32,287
Feel better, man.

137
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,376
Thanks, man.

138
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,465
How you feeling?

139
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,815
Other than the bum leg,

140
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,775
better than I have in
a really long time.

141
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,951
How are Sadie and Emilia?

142
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,256
Well, you know, I mean,

143
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,911
Sadie's got some adjusting
to do, obviously.

144
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,435
But you know, they're safe.

145
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,827
They're together.

146
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,828
I think they're gonna be
discharged this afternoon.

147
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,398
Wow, that's great.

148
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:00,881
Any word from the board
yet about your suspension?

149
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:01,795
No.

150
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,449
No decision yet.

151
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,276
Last thing I want
to do is set you up,

152
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:07,670
but I just can't imagine
that your heroics

153
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,151
aren't gonna spin this
in the right direction.

154
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:13,502
I mean, God knows I think
you deserve a second chance.

155
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,156
I don't know about deserve.

156
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:19,988
But, um, if I'm given one,
I don't intend to waste it.

157
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,254
I didn't really think I was
gonna make it out of there,

158
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:30,301
when things started
to go sideways,

159
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:32,435
till I heard your
voice on the walkie.

160
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,397
I know I haven't always made
it easy to care about me.

161
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,486
Caring about you, pal,

162
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:43,925
never been the,
uh... the hard part.

163
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:48,537
You know, you hear stories
about people waking up

164
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,583
from comas decades later,

165
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:55,283
but I've never actually
seen it happen.

166
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:58,112
Well, once she's out of CT,

167
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,244
maybe you'd like to say
hello to her mother.

168
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:04,511
Well, uh, I'm not so sure
Angela would want that.

169
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,125
What caused Josephine's coma?

170
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,909
What was the initial trauma?

171
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,175
It was a... a
terrible car accident.

172
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,004
As I recall, the roads were wet.

173
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:24,486
It had been pouring all morning.

174
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,402
Josephine's father was
driving her to school

175
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:31,101
when the car skidded and
flipped over into a ditch.

176
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:34,017
He died on impact.

177
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:36,498
Josephine's brain
was hemorrhaging

178
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:39,370
when the paramedics
brought her in.

179
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,590
Did she go straight to the OR?

180
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:44,811
Well, there was a
difference of opinion

181
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,726
amongst the doctors...

182
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:50,730
surgery or trying to
decrease the swelling with...

183
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,296
with medication.

184
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,516
What did Mrs. Tucker decide?

185
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,779
She couldn't decide.

186
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,391
She was paralyzed with grief.

187
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:05,048
I advocated strongly
for surgery,

188
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:09,226
perhaps too strongly.

189
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,098
They fixed the bleed,

190
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,058
but Josephine never
regained consciousness.

191
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:19,498
Angela couldn't possibly
blame you for that.

192
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,719
She was heartbroken
and distraught.

193
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:28,898
Well, I didn't
take it personally.

194
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,033
There you go.

195
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,948
You're OK, man. You're OK.

196
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,906
Mm-hmm.

197
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:38,255
Breathing is shallow.

198
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,996
What was his blood pressure?

199
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,042
88/58.

200
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,826
Liam. Hey, bud.

201
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:46,263
Is there any dietary
changes you've had recently?

202
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:48,483
Maybe something you ate
that didn't sit right?

203
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,485
Uh, I do all of the cooking,

204
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,052
and we don't really
eat out much.

205
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,575
OK.

206
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,446
Was anyone else in the
house feeling ill, or...

207
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:56,622
No.

208
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:57,927
No, Jessica and I are fine.

209
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,320
So are his older brothers.

210
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,889
Doris, let's get a
CBC, BMP, a tox screen,

211
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,325
a urine analysis,
and then call GI

212
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,892
for an endoscopy, please.

213
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,023
OK.

214
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,764
Hey, buddy.

215
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:09,896
I'll be back soon, all right?

216
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:12,159
Try to get some rest, OK?

217
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,988
- Thank you.
- Of course.

218
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,904
Really? Cheese curls?

219
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,601
Like many others, I've found

220
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,342
that high-sodium
snacks lift my energy

221
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,952
during mid-morning slumps.

222
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,215
You know, it's these kind
of oddities I look forward

223
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,130
to learning more about.

224
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:28,523
Does that mean...

225
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:30,003
I've been accepted
into Gaffney's

226
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,135
cardiothoracic
residency program.

227
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:35,225
North Dakota's loss
is Chicago's gain.

228
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,618
I couldn't have done
this without you.

229
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,228
You know that, right?

230
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:39,708
You're about to
become a surgeon.

231
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:40,970
Lose the humility.

232
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,146
Student Dr. Howard.

233
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:44,321
Dr. Hayes.

234
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:45,671
I hope you've heard
the good news.

235
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:46,976
Hot off the press.

236
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,282
I wanted to come down in person

237
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:49,675
to congratulate you
and welcome you aboard.

238
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,894
I am incredibly excited
for this opportunity.

239
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:53,243
I also wanted to invite you

240
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,897
to an informal
gathering tonight.

241
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:56,899
The cardiothoracic department
does a weekly get-together

242
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,946
at Bar La Rue, end of shift.

243
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,164
Blow off some steam.

244
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:02,209
I'll be there.

245
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,645
Cheesy curls.

246
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,125
- Mm.
- You?

247
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,084
Mind if I...

248
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:11,000
You're so generous
with your snacks.

249
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:13,176
- Oh, I'll take it back.
- No.

250
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,178
Your very detailed
email about Naomi

251
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:16,919
factored significantly
in our deliberations.

252
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,618
I just thought you should know.

253
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,663
There you are.

254
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,405
I just reviewed Josephine
Tucker's head CT.

255
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:26,929
- And?
- It's not good.

256
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,673
A brain tumor?

257
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,415
That's what's waking her up?

258
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,374
The neuronal progenitor
cells within the tumor are

259
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,986
firing electrical impulses
into the thalamus,

260
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,684
so it's almost like jumper
cables for her brain.

261
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,556
Uh, how long before
she's fully awake?

262
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:47,950
It can take weeks, even months,

263
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,691
if it happens at all.

264
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,215
Time that we
unfortunately don't have.

265
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,521
What do you mean?

266
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:55,828
The neurocytoma is 6
centimeters in size,

267
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,699
so it's disrupting CSF flow,

268
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,745
which caused Josephine's
hydrocephalus

269
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,355
and subsequent seizures.

270
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,183
So we need to resect
it as soon as possible.

271
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:04,706
Is that dangerous?

272
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,316
Uh, yes.

273
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,711
The tumor is in a very
challenging place to reach.

274
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:11,931
Will she survive the surgery?

275
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,584
We don't know.

276
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:16,587
But without the procedure,
there is no uncertainty...

277
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:17,937
she will die.

278
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:27,076
So the thing that's
waking her up

279
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,688
is also killing her.

280
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,916
Do you happen to know where
I could find Caitlin Lenox?

281
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,658
I think Dr. Lenox is
in with a patient.

282
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:46,792
Oh, speak of the
devil, literally.

283
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,489
Damn, you working out?

284
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,925
That's quite a firm
grip you've got.

285
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:52,101
What did I say
about coming here?

286
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:54,625
I wouldn't have to if someone
would stop ignoring my texts.

287
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:55,975
I'm working.

288
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,324
Plus, I found that
it's harder for you

289
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,629
to say no in person.

290
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,196
What did you do, Kip?

291
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:02,285
Upstairs neighbor
left a faucet running

292
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:03,547
and flooded my apartment.

293
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:05,332
I was hoping maybe
I could stay...

294
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,247
- No.
- Come on.

295
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:08,857
Look, it will be fun.

296
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,685
We will order takeout.

297
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,470
We'll watch "Newsies"
for the hundredth time.

298
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:15,516
A dancing Christian
Bale with some ramen?

299
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:16,691
Huh?

300
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:18,519
Fine. One night.

301
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,563
Totally.

302
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:20,782
Two or three at most.

303
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,828
I'll be super
low-maintenance, I promise.

304
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,699
I'm gonna go get my key.

305
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,180
Do not move.

306
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,270
Oh, hey, thanks, Catie-Cat!

307
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,362
Hey, you got a minute?

308
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,929
Shoot.

309
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,714
I've got a 12-year-old in
Treatment 4, Liam Russell.

310
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,324
He came in vomiting
blood this morning.

311
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,804
Oh, that's not good.

312
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,024
Pretty unusual for a
12-year-old too, right?

313
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,722
His labs came back and
his tox found traces

314
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:49,332
of ipecac in his system.

315
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,770
Oh, man.

316
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:53,641
Well, what are you thinking?

317
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,861
Maybe bulimia?

318
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:58,037
I mean, maybe, but it's unlikely

319
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:00,213
a kid his age would
know about ipecac.

320
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,388
GI scope him yet?

321
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,868
Yeah.

322
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,652
They found several small
tears in his lower esophagus.

323
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,219
Well, caused by
repeated vomiting.

324
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,829
So it's been going
on for a while.

325
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,396
It appears so, yeah.

326
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:11,746
Why don't I wait till Liam
wakes up, have a little chat,

327
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,835
see what I can suss out?

328
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,402
Yeah, that'd be
great. Thank you.

329
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:16,708
You bet.

330
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,407
Angela.

331
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:21,538
Hello.

332
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:27,283
Nurse Goodwin.

333
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:29,808
Sharon, please.

334
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,462
I understand Josephine's
surgery has been

335
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:34,725
scheduled for later today.

336
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:37,076
Well, she's in very good
hands with Dr. Abrams.

337
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,947
He's one of the best
neurosurgeons in...

338
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:41,951
Well, you'll forgive me if I
don't take your word for it.

339
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:47,347
I'm sorry.

340
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,566
It's been a...

341
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,612
it's been a day.

342
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:53,614
Uh, no, it's OK.

343
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,921
I understand.

344
00:13:55,922 --> 00:14:00,099
I've waited 22 years
for her to wake up,

345
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,755
and now, just as
it's happening...

346
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,366
Well, I'll, um...

347
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,238
I'll let you be
alone with Josephine.

348
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,548
Ms. Goodwin, how's
Mrs. Tucker doing?

349
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,679
Every time I go in there,

350
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,290
she's just trying
to will Josephine

351
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,379
to open her eyes or
squeeze her hand.

352
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,381
Oh, I can't imagine it...

353
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,818
all these years waiting
for her to wake up,

354
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:25,689
dreaming of this moment.

355
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:31,478
You know, if only the tumor
had worked a little faster.

356
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:34,698
I mean, jump-started things

357
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:37,788
before it got so bad.

358
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,660
You mean if it was accelerated?

359
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,749
Yeah.

360
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,272
Why?

361
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,409
Liam, how are you doing?

362
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,845
I'm Dr. Charles.

363
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:53,500
Your, uh... your mom and
dad are doing some paperwork

364
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:56,111
with Dr. Frost
right now, I think.

365
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,547
OK.

366
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:00,724
So, um, this has
happened before?

367
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,422
This, uh... this vomiting?

368
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,032
Wait, why?

369
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,860
Why do you think
it happened before?

370
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,427
Well, because the doc who...

371
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,037
who checked out your throat,

372
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:12,214
he found some lesions
on your esophagus,

373
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:16,653
which usually, you know,
happens with repeated vomiting.

374
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:18,525
I threw up a lot today.

375
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:21,223
The thing is, you're not
gonna get multiple lesions

376
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,791
from just a single day,
you know, of vomiting.

377
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,445
Like I say, it...

378
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:29,231
it just suggests a
history of it, you know?

379
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:34,367
Sometimes I have to
throw up after I eat.

380
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:38,023
I just have a weak
stomach or something.

381
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,372
It's not a big deal.

382
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,548
You don't have to tell
my parents or anything.

383
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,898
OK, OK.

384
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,337
Um, so you are in seventh grade.

385
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,905
How's that, uh... how's
that going for you?

386
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,211
You like it?

387
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,516
It's fine.

388
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:54,996
Yeah.

389
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,216
You know, my daughter really
struggled in junior high.

390
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:00,523
I did, too, come to think of it.

391
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:03,004
There's so much pressure to
look a certain way, you know.

392
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,572
By the way, total myth
that only girls struggle

393
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,008
with that kind of thing.

394
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,967
I'm not bulimic.

395
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,448
Well, then, um, why are you...

396
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:15,060
why are you making
yourself throw up, buddy?

397
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,323
How do you know
I'm making myself?

398
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,934
Because we found a
drug in your system

399
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:23,459
that's, you know, used
to induce vomiting.

400
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,766
I am not here to
get you in trouble.

401
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,072
Not my job, OK?

402
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,769
I promise you, I just
want to figure out

403
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,379
what's going on so I can...

404
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,121
so I can help you.

405
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,820
There's something wrong with me.

406
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,824
I'm fixing it.

407
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:45,394
Oh.

408
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:48,267
I'm not stalking you, I promise.

409
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:51,574
Maggie asked me to
bring her some gauze.

410
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:52,793
Yeah, it's all good.

411
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,100
Gauze is right there.

412
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:01,715
It's a real trip seeing
you in doctor mode today.

413
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:06,373
Can't have been easy
for you to get here.

414
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,767
I'm... I'm sure your
parents didn't help.

415
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,074
Yeah, no.

416
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,642
But you did it.

417
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,644
I'm really proud of you.

418
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:24,129
You know, you were the
only person in my life

419
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,913
who encouraged me
to quit acting,

420
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,394
figure out what I
really wanted to do

421
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:31,092
instead of, you know,
what everyone else was

422
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,833
telling me I wanted to do.

423
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,270
Yeah.

424
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:37,838
I could just see your
heart wasn't in it.

425
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,101
Yeah.

426
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:43,496
I was always...

427
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,846
I used to feel like
you were the only one

428
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,978
who ever really
saw me, you know?

429
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:51,417
Like, past the veneer.

430
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,595
Used to?

431
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,166
I still see you, Jonathan.

432
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,698
Ainsley, I, um...

433
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,482
Oh.

434
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,180
I thought you wanted...

435
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:19,402
I... I don't really
know what I, um...

436
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,274
- I'm so sorry.
- No, that's OK.

437
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,928
Look, if you need any more
help, just get Maggie, OK?

438
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,539
- Of course.
- All right.

439
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:46,341
Similar to the neurocytoma's
progenitor cells,

440
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,517
the medicine that I'm
injecting, baclofen,

441
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:51,520
could theoretically
restore neurotransmission

442
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:52,826
between wakefulness
and awareness.

443
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,393
In other words, it's mimicking

444
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:56,438
what the tumor's
doing, only faster.

445
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,179
It's a long shot.

446
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,183
But it could allow Josephine
to wake up before surgery.

447
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,011
Emphasis on long shot.

448
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,883
There's a good chance
this won't work.

449
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:09,756
And as we've discussed,
introducing any substance

450
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,758
into the brain
intrathecally can increase

451
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,194
intracranial pressure,

452
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:17,198
so if Josephine's ICP
level rises above 40,

453
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,940
we need to take her to
surgery immediately.

454
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,769
I understand.

455
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,946
Mom's here, Josie.

456
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:27,295
I'm right here.

457
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,215
So you're saying that
Liam is feeling the need

458
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,739
to harm himself because
he's attracted to boys,

459
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,524
and this was his
attempt at, like,

460
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:41,744
some DIY conversion therapy?

461
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,269
He read about a form of
aversion therapy online where

462
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,142
they administer nausea-inducing
inducing medications to people,

463
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,927
then show them
same-sex materials,

464
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:53,887
idea being to condition
them to feel sick

465
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:55,454
when those attractions come on.

466
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:56,498
OK.

467
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,934
Well, what do we do now?

468
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:00,676
I mean, Liam's intentionally
harming himself.

469
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,243
Do we put him on a
psych hold, or...

470
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,593
The problem is he didn't
really see it that way, right?

471
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:06,291
He thinks he's fixing himself.

472
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,553
Those are his words, you know?

473
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,032
Not... not hurting himself.

474
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,774
And I mean, honestly,
5150 wouldn't be

475
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,167
the top of my list anyway.

476
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,038
It'll just reinforce this
idea that he's somehow,

477
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,258
you know, deserving
of punishment.

478
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,652
I mean, in a perfect world,
we'd find him a good shrink.

479
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,131
But, you know...

480
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,133
Yeah, which we would need
the parents' consent for.

481
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:26,659
But look, I can only
imagine Liam begged you

482
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,182
not to say anything
to his parents,

483
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,966
but at this point, uh...

484
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,620
We've got to tell them
about the ipecac, right?

485
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,100
I mean, it's on the blood test.

486
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,798
But there's no way I'm gonna
tell them why he took it.

487
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,931
It would be immensely damaging,

488
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:40,063
not to mention unethical,
to out the kid,

489
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:42,022
you know, without
his permission.

490
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,589
OK.

491
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,113
Then how do we tell his parents
that their son needs help

492
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:49,769
without explaining to
them the actual problem?

493
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,901
Very, very carefully.

494
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,599
<i>I don't understand.</i>

495
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,861
Liam's a happy kid.

496
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,993
Why was he doing this?

497
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:59,300
You know, I haven't quite
gotten that out of him yet.

498
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:02,303
Um, which is why, with
your permission, of course,

499
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,175
I would really like to
keep him here another day,

500
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,351
maybe two, you know, to...

501
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,830
Sorry, I'm confused.

502
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,136
You want to keep him here,

503
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:11,225
but you don't know
what's wrong with him?

504
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,574
I mean, do you
think it's some kind

505
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,272
of a suicide attempt
or something?

506
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,752
I mean, I know he got picked on
at school for a little while,

507
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:18,537
got teased a little
bit, but he's got

508
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,321
a solid group of friends now.
- No, OK?

509
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,844
That is not it.

510
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,585
We are not at all suggesting
that Liam is intentionally

511
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:25,195
hurting himself in a...
- Well...

512
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,719
In a traditional sense.

513
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,677
Traditional?

514
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:30,244
What are we talking about here?

515
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,855
We brought him in today because
he was vomiting up blood.

516
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,379
You really don't know why?

517
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,120
I'm sorry, we, uh... we don't.

518
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,601
But if I had to
guess at this point,

519
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:42,865
I would say that it might have
something to do with Liam,

520
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:45,825
I don't know, somehow
not feeling safe.

521
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,870
Are you saying he doesn't
feel safe at home?

522
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:50,090
Not necessarily, because...
because I don't know yet.

523
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,048
Well, I'm honestly not sure what

524
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,442
you're suggesting, other than
committing my 12-year-old son...

525
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,183
We are not committing...

526
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:58,228
When you have no idea
what's wrong with him.

527
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,795
If Liam needs to
talk to someone,

528
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,101
he can always talk to us.

529
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,668
He knows that.

530
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:05,366
We'll handle this as a family.

531
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,889
When can we take Liam home?

532
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,587
He needs to do another
round of fluids

533
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:10,458
to address his dehydration.

534
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,330
How long will that take?

535
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,462
A couple hours.

536
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:15,768
Fine.

537
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,639
As soon as that's
done, we're leaving.

538
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:31,392
Josie?

539
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,785
Please, baby.

540
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,264
Come on, Josie.

541
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:37,442
What is that?

542
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,618
Her ICP level is over 40.

543
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,316
50 grams of mannitol IV.

544
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,365
Come on, baby.

545
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,150
It's OK, baby.

546
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,153
Just give it a second.

547
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,330
It's not coming down.

548
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:57,636
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tucker.

549
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,289
We have to take
Josephine to surgery.

550
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,334
No.

551
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,335
Just another second, please.

552
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:03,468
Come on, baby.

553
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:07,908
I love you.

554
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,476
Angela, it's time.

555
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,836
I'll be waiting for you, honey.

556
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:28,318
I can take you to a
private waiting area...

557
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:36,849
Mr. Russell, how
are you doing?

558
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,416
Hey. Fine.

559
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,853
You mind if I sit for a second?

560
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,290
OK.

561
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:51,864
I just want to say that, from
my own experience, anyway,

562
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:54,432
like, watching your...
your kid suffer is

563
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,782
the worst pain
imaginable, right?

564
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:59,263
I mean, especially when
you don't know how to help.

565
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:04,138
I think, um...

566
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:08,968
I think Liam might be confused.

567
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:13,233
Confused, um, how?

568
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:17,280
Just about who he's,
you know, attracted to.

569
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:19,282
Growing up in today's world,

570
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,459
you're inundated with
all these images,

571
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,810
and you can't even turn
on the Olympics anymore

572
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:26,899
without it being shoved
in your face, right?

573
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,161
Yeah.

574
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:30,468
So I...

575
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,472
I just think he's
a little mixed up.

576
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,865
You know, Jessica and
I, we don't hate anyone.

577
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:39,477
It's just not a...

578
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,609
lifestyle that we condone.

579
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,482
Science, it... it actually,
it just doesn't support

580
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,442
this idea that, you know,
television or social media,

581
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:51,706
or anything, for that
matter, can, you know,

582
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:54,317
turn somebody gay,
can make them gay.

583
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:56,058
You know, it actually
tells us the opposite,

584
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,105
that, uh, when it comes
to sexual orientation,

585
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:02,804
there's just actually no degree
of choice involved whatsoever.

586
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,589
It's just... it's...

587
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,199
it's how we're born, you know?

588
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,810
It's just an innate part
of... of who we are.

589
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:12,640
I'll also tell you
that for a kid to feel

590
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:16,296
like their parents...
whose approval they seek

591
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:18,690
more than anything
in the world...

592
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:24,391
that their parents can't
accept who they are...

593
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:29,048
it can lead them to take
some pretty drastic action.

594
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,616
I don't want that.

595
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:34,923
I just love him
so much, you know?

596
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:37,840
That is very clear.

597
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:40,799
So then how do we help?

598
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,931
- Henry.
- Hey.

599
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:44,019
What's going on?

600
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,543
Uh, nothing.

601
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,675
I was just talking to
Dr. Charles here about

602
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:52,245
what else we need to sign to
take Liam home today, right?

603
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,638
Good.

604
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,509
Well, Liam's finished
with his fluids,

605
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,858
so we're ready to go.

606
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:57,947
Great.

607
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:07,870
Hey.

608
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,700
Would you mind some company?

609
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,106
You know, 22 years
ago, we sat together

610
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:30,718
in a waiting room
a lot like this.

611
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,721
I remember telling you
if it were my daughter,

612
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:36,595
I'd choose surgery, no question.

613
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:40,989
But I wasn't your doctor,

614
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,731
and it wasn't my child,

615
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:46,473
and I wouldn't have to
live with the consequences

616
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:48,997
of that decision for
the rest of my life.

617
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:55,614
I'm sorry, Angela.

618
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:01,227
I should not have
weighed in on a decision

619
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:04,318
that was yours alone to make.

620
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:11,629
Is she...

621
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,065
Josephine made it.

622
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,240
She's alive.

623
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,770
You know, I'm...

624
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:26,034
I'm not a conspiracy
theorist, but if I were,

625
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:29,211
I might suggest it seemed
like you all were trying

626
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:31,910
to collect a little extra
money from our insurance,

627
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:33,172
keeping Liam here.

628
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:35,304
I can promise you
that is not the case.

629
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:36,566
Well, anyway.

630
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,700
Liam, come on, let's get going.

631
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:41,615
Bye, Dr. Charles.

632
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:43,096
Great meeting you, Liam.

633
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:49,668
Jessica, stop.

634
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:56,238
Maybe we need to rethink this.

635
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,979
What are you talking about?

636
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,808
I'm just saying maybe we
should listen to the doctors.

637
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,810
Henry, you know why they
want to keep him here.

638
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,638
They want to fill his
head with ideas that

639
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,422
whatever he's feeling is OK.

640
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:07,728
Did you know that
he was doing this

641
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,512
to himself the entire time?
- No.

642
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,036
No, of course I didn't know.

643
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,341
I just knew that he was...

644
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:13,691
he was working
through some issues.

645
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,301
Of course I don't want
him to be in danger.

646
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:16,781
He's my baby.

647
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:21,829
But I am so proud of
how strong you are.

648
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,180
You knew something was wrong,
and you were trying to fix it,

649
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:29,010
and we're gonna get
you the help you need.

650
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:31,186
But it's not in here.

651
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:32,535
Now let's go.

652
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:34,582
He's not going anywhere.

653
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:36,844
What?

654
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:39,238
How could you let
our son hurt himself?

655
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,935
I... I told you,
I didn't know.

656
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:42,415
You knew.

657
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,678
I didn't know he was gonna
end up in the hospital.

658
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:46,201
You need to leave.

659
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:47,768
Not without my son.

660
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:51,077
Yes, without our son.

661
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:55,036
Now, what happens next, we'll
handle it when the time comes.

662
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:57,952
But right now, you
really need to leave.

663
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:02,435
Oh, right, OK.

664
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:04,829
Well, um, I'm... I'm
just gonna go home

665
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,093
and get started on dinner, then.

666
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,747
I'm your mom.

667
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,750
I know what's best for you.

668
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,800
I'm sorry.

669
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,062
I tried.

670
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:22,585
No.

671
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,065
Hey, buddy.

672
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,459
Hey.

673
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:29,288
There is nothing
to apologize for.

674
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,943
I love you, no matter what.

675
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:38,514
Nothing will ever change
that, do you hear me?

676
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:39,602
Yeah?

677
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:45,521
Man.

678
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,620
There you are.

679
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:06,107
Ainsley, she was stellar today.

680
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:09,458
She acclimated to
the chaos like a pro.

681
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:12,157
That's great to hear.

682
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:13,636
And I, um...

683
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:16,162
I appreciate you
letting her shadow you.

684
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,513
Of course.

685
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:24,691
So what's the real story there?

686
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:26,649
There's no story.

687
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,436
We're just old friends.

688
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,527
I saw your face when you
came out of the supply room.

689
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,836
You're not gonna
let it go, are you?

690
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,795
- I'm not.
- OK.

691
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,712
We had a thing.

692
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:49,107
A thing?

693
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:51,457
We were involved,

694
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,068
a long time ago.

695
00:30:58,204 --> 00:30:59,900
How long ago?

696
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,511
Towards the end
of "Nick of Time."

697
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:03,861
Weren't you 15?

698
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,864
Almost 17 when the show ended.

699
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,866
And what was she, in her 30s?

700
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,868
God, Mags, I knew you
were gonna make this

701
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,739
a bigger deal than it was.

702
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,916
But look, I was not a
typical teenager, all right?

703
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,266
I was already living on my
own, working a full-time job.

704
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:19,615
I mean...
- OK.

705
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:22,096
That still doesn't make
it OK for a grown woman

706
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,924
to start a relationship
with a minor.

707
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,883
I don't need the
lecture, all right?

708
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,275
I know what the
textbooks say about it,

709
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:29,016
and I know technically,
it was wrong.

710
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:31,366
- Technically?
- Yeah.

711
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:34,892
OK? But having lived it,
it was not like that.

712
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,242
Maybe it wasn't
the best decision,

713
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,721
but it was my decision.

714
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:40,158
I knew what I was doing.

715
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,074
And whatever it was, it's
well in the past now.

716
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:44,859
I've moved on.

717
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,123
That is not what I saw today.

718
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:50,908
OK.

719
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,257
You're not being
honest with yourself.

720
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:55,651
Maggie, I'm not a
victim here, all right?

721
00:31:58,612 --> 00:31:59,829
I'm just trying to be a friend.

722
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,353
No, no. Stop, stop.

723
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:03,746
You and I may joke
around at work,

724
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:05,705
and that's fun and all,
but it does not mean

725
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,490
that you know me, or her.

726
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,536
Drop it. It's not
your business.

727
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,270
Hey.

728
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:53,840
I'm supposed to tell you
that visiting hours are over.

729
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,842
Can't the boss bend
the rules a little?

730
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:59,759
Well, unfortunately,
ICU rules are ironclad.

731
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,418
I don't want her to be alone.

732
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,682
Oh, then I'll sit with her.

733
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:11,379
Don't you need to
be getting home?

734
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,120
Well, I live here anyway.

735
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:16,254
OK.

736
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:17,429
If you don't mind.

737
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,171
It'd be my pleasure.

738
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:28,962
Josephine, my name is Sharon.

739
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:32,314
I met you long time ago.

740
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:42,584
I did blame you for years.

741
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:45,500
But I also blamed the rain,

742
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:47,459
and Josie for oversleeping

743
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,635
and missing the
bus that morning,

744
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:51,637
and... so that her dad had
to drive her to school,

745
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,900
and I blamed her dad for not
getting the tires checked

746
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:56,555
after I reminded him to.

747
00:33:56,556 --> 00:34:01,951
And when the pain
became unbearable,

748
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:05,303
anger was the only thing
that kept me going.

749
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,479
I understand.

750
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,482
But sitting in that
waiting room today,

751
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:14,573
the possibility of losing
Josie as real and as terrifying

752
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:18,185
as it was 22 years ago,

753
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:22,668
I realized I am so grateful

754
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,672
for every moment I've
had with my daughter.

755
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:29,153
And I have you to
thank for that.

756
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:34,288
I'll see you tomorrow?

757
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:36,160
I'll be here.

758
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,645
Uh, Angela!

759
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:46,866
Josie?

760
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,172
Mom's here, baby.

761
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,653
I'm right here.

762
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,529
She's squeezing my hand.

763
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:00,097
Three times.

764
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,273
That's right.

765
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:05,277
I love you too, Josie.

766
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,939
Hey, Catie.

767
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:21,901
Oh, hey, no way.

768
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:23,337
Gyuro?

769
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:25,687
Well, you said ramen,
so I got ramen.

770
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,907
And the DVD's in the
case under the soundbar,

771
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:30,606
and we're doing the singalong
version, so you know.

772
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:33,695
You made plans.
- I kind of made plans.

773
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:36,220
But we could put the
ramen in the fridge

774
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:39,136
and watch "Newsies"
when I get back.

775
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,876
When's that?

776
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:42,008
Not too late.

777
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:43,531
By midnight.

778
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:44,880
I'll be sleeping.

779
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:47,666
Mind if I hold on
to your key, then?

780
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,058
Here.

781
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,930
Uh, you should take the spare.

782
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:53,672
I think you should have it
anyways, for emergencies.

783
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,719
What's going on?

784
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,765
You're the only
family I have left.

785
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:01,855
We should take
care of each other.

786
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,945
It's what Mom would have wanted.

787
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:08,165
Oh, you big softie.

788
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,992
Shut up.

789
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,430
What was that?

790
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:13,605
Uh, nothing, Catie.

791
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:14,954
How long has that
been happening?

792
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:16,434
It's nothing, OK?

793
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:20,133
I just had a few too many
espressos today, that's all.

794
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:21,743
Kip.

795
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:24,790
Look, it's not like I
would do anything about it.

796
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,531
We promised.

797
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,185
I know, but if this...

798
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,621
But what, Catie?

799
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,231
Look, whatever time I have left,

800
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:34,322
I'm not gonna spend it worrying.

801
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:38,238
I'm gonna have fun.

802
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,848
You should try it sometime.

803
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,633
I have fun.

804
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,939
Oh, tough love, sis,
but when's the last time

805
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,724
you had plans on a Friday night?

806
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:47,204
OK.

807
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,770
You want to spend your time
partying, fine, go ahead.

808
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,772
I want to spend
mine being useful.

809
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,731
Doesn't mean that you
have to be miserable.

810
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:54,776
- I'm not.
- OK, fine.

811
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:56,648
But will you just
do something tonight

812
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:59,999
that involves you
leaving your apartment,

813
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,656
and maybe putting on pants
that aren't scrubs or sweats?

814
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:08,790
Or maybe taking them off
for somebody special.

815
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:11,445
Or not so special, you know.

816
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:14,840
Just somebody, anybody.

817
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,677
Thanks.

818
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:34,990
Dr. Ripley, how's your ankle?

819
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:38,472
Dr. Stano says I can
start PT next week.

820
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:40,518
Should be upright in
less than a month.

821
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:43,390
Well, I'm pleased to hear that.

822
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,740
The board convened today.

823
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:48,569
Turns out becoming
an overnight hero can

824
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,094
buy you some goodwill.

825
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:55,054
You've been reinstated.

826
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,668
Which I know you
recommended against.

827
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:08,197
Look, talk is cheap,
so let me just say

828
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:11,331
I'm gonna prove to you that
I've changed, Ms. Goodwin.

829
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:15,161
Well, after the day I've had,

830
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:18,556
I'd be remiss not
to acknowledge that

831
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:21,951
patience can be rewarded.

832
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:24,649
Rest up, Dr. Ripley.

833
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,651
We'll see you back in
the ED when you're ready.

I... I didn't know
you were coming.

840
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:56,289
Well, here I am.

841
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,291
You look... wow, um...

842
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:01,120
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No, no, no.

843
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,643
It's your accomplishment
we're celebrating.

844
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:03,818

00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,276
Ahh.

852
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:28,539
Come say hi to everyone.

853
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,670
Oh, yes.

854
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:31,237
Social time. Fun.

855
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:34,719
Glad you could
join us, Catie-Cat.

856
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,329
Oh, oh, no.

857
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,461
Do not ever call me that.

858
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,637
Who was the guy?

859
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:41,204
It was my brother.

860
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,164
What a relief.

861
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:49,168
Hey.

862
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:50,517
There he is.

863
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:52,563
Sorry, I was just
finishing up a few things.

864
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:54,826
Yeah. You ready for dinner?

865
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:56,654
Yeah, you know,
actually, I don't think

866
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,092
I'm gonna be able
to make it tonight.

867
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:02,790
This is about earlier.

868
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,272
Listen, I... I know that
was a little presumptuous.

869
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,970
I just... old feelings, I...

870
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,103
I got carried away.
- Right.

871
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:14,454
Yeah, it's just I
think maybe they should

872
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:17,457
stay old feelings, you know?

873
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,937
Like, forever?

874
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:21,723
For now, at least, yeah.

875
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:25,073
Are you mad at me?

876
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:26,205
No.

877
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:28,642
Uh...

878
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:32,385
Ainsley, whatever we had,

879
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:35,083
whatever it was, it...

880
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,694
Whatever it was?

881
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:38,043
You know what I mean.

882
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:40,524
Jonathan, what we had,
that wasn't a fling.

883
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,395
It was more than that.

884
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:43,483
I know.

885
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:45,137
Do you?

886
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:46,791
I listened to you.

887
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,270
We cried together.

888
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:50,098
You said it yourself... you
wouldn't even be here now

889
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,926
if it wasn't for
me, for what we had.

890
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:54,059
So listen, you can
leave it in the past.

891
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,495
That's fine.

892
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:59,543
But don't dismiss it like
it didn't mean anything.

893
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,678
You loved me.

894
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:09,117
I did love you.

895
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:14,427
And I loved you.

896
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:15,776
And I still love you...

897
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:17,430
OK, Ainsley. Hey, hey.

898
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:20,869
Just... I wish you a lot of
luck on your movie, all right?

899
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:25,613
That's it?

900
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:28,310
That's it.

901
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:37,233
OK.
