1
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:19,193
- Who's there?

2
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,152
I've already called the police!

3
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:47,133
- Mr. Sullivan, you were
sentenced to three years

4
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,744
for a class IV felony
aggravated battery

5
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:52,834
of one Pawel Wapniarski.

6
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:55,402
We're here to consider
a compassionate release

7
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,839
based on a new diagnosis?

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,450
- My client's physician,
Dr. Mitchell Ripley,

9
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,148
would like to address
the board.

10
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,324
- Dr. Ripley?

11
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:08,545
- Mr. Sullivan's
latest PET scan

12
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:11,374
indicates that his cancer
has metastasized

13
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,202
to his lymph nodes
and adrenal glands.

14
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:15,813
- Given this new diagnosis,

15
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:18,555
how much time does
Mr. Sullivan have,

16
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:19,948
in your opinion?

17
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:25,171
- Less than three months.

18
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,912
- Thank you, Dr. Ripley.

19
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:34,876
- Mr. Sullivan
has a new family.

20
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:38,793
This is his girlfriend, Lynne,
and his son, Nate,

21
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:41,665
who he's barely
got a chance to hold.

22
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,407
I've known Mr. Sullivan
most of my life.

23
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,801
He's not perfect.

24
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,977
Far from it.

25
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:52,285
But he's a good man, and...

26
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,679
I believe his son
would be better off

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,855
knowing his father

28
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,468
during the short amount
of time he has left.

29
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,603
Thank you.

30
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:12,567
- Thanks, man.

31
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,789
- Ta-da.

32
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,837
My first attempt at Ma's
sweet potato pie recipe.

33
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,186
- I'm sure you nailed it.

34
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,492
Mmm.

35
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:27,494
- Well, you can be
the judge tomorrow.

36
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,060
- Yeah.
- Hey. Sorry.

37
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,584
Uh, where's Hannah?

38
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,847
Got two cans of cranberry sauce
with her name on it.

39
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,458
- She's decorating the doctor's
lounge for Friendsgiving.

40
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,244
You remembered the potluck.

41
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,506
- Best thing about a demotion

42
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,160
is the freedom to do
grocery store errands.

43
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,813
- Is that self-pity I hear?

44
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:45,990
- On the contrary,
it's just a more well-rested,

45
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,688
more relaxed disposition.

46
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,080
- Hmm.

47
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,778
- Your sister call you back?

48
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,301
- Nope.
- Sorry.

49
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,782
- No, you know,
I made a peace offering.

50
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:57,220
Ball's in her court now.
- Yeah.

51
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:06,010
- Good morning, Dr. Archer.

52
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:09,318
- Good morning, Dr. Lenox.

53
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,887
I promise not to
make this awkward.

54
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,410
- I'm glad to hear that.

55
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,847
I know a change like this
could be difficult to process.

56
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,109
- It's good, actually.

57
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,329
It feels like a huge
weight's been lifted.

58
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,026
- You sound like you mean that.

59
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:23,680
- That's because I do.

60
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,074
You're the boss,
and I respect that.

61
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,945
And I'm gonna make sure
that everybody else

62
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,599
around here does too.

63
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,948
I appreciate that. Thank you.

64
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:33,212
- Overdose just pulling up
in five, Dr. Lenox.

65
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,952
- On it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

66
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,781
No worries. I got this.
I just gotta change first.

67
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:44,440
- Is he really okay?

68
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,268
- He thinks he is.

69
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,618
Just go with it.

70
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:02,024
- Hey.
- Hi.

71
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,987
The board rejected Sully's
compassionate release request.

72
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:14,253
- I'm so sorry, Mitch.

73
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,299
I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:21,912
- The chairwoman said that

75
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:23,566
if he was well enough
to commit battery,

76
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,221
he was well enough
to serve out his sentence.

77
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:33,272
He should be with
Lynne and Nate.

78
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,884
I know.

79
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,584
- Sully screwed up. I--he did.

80
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,457
But he doesn't deserve
to die alone in jail.

81
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:48,374
- Hey. Come here.

82
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:55,772
- Going to treatment five.
Talk to me, Corey.

83
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:59,298
- Ariel Sparkman, 24-year-old
female, possible drug overdose.

84
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,779
Heart rate 122, BP 130/70.

85
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,433
Her roommate found her
passed out on the floor

86
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,435
next to a nearly empty
bottle of pills.

87
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,045
- What did she take
and how much?

88
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,569
- Antidepressants.

89
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,048
Ariel probably took
around 10 to 15 pills,

90
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:13,094
but she's only supposed
to take one per day.

91
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,965
I called her psychiatrist.
She's on her way.

92
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:17,490
- All right, on my count.
One, two, three.

93
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:22,103
- Struggling to breathe.

94
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,585
Okay.

95
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:27,238
- Heart rate is
climbing at 165.

96
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,589
- You experience chest pain?

97
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,982
Let's bolus her a liter of LR

98
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:33,810
and get her an EKG

99
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:36,509
and a tox order set
for a possible overdose.

100
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,337
- You got it.
- Morning, Dean.

101
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,382
I have the bullet points,
but do we know what she took?

102
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:42,123
- Antidepressants,
but her heart rate's

103
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:43,385
just shot through the roof.

104
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,256
This is her roommate.

105
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,607
- Savannah.
- Hi, Savannah.

106
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:48,999
Do you happen to know the name
of the antidepressant

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,305
she's been taking?

108
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:51,437
- No.

109
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:52,916
We left so fast. I'm sorry.

110
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,091
- It's okay.

111
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:55,702
- Her breathing is worsening.

112
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,007
- Ariel, how are you doing?

113
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:58,792
I'm Dr. Charles.
I want you to do me a favor.

114
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,184
Take a deep breath with me, okay?

115
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,577
Ready?

116
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,362
In through the nose...

117
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,102
And out through the mouth.

118
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,669
Beautiful. One more time.

119
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,846
In through the nose
and out through the mouth.

120
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:11,326
Excellent.

121
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,374
- Ariel's not overdosing.
She's having a panic attack.

122
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,201
- Sarah?

123
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:19,203
- Hello, Dr. Charles.
It's nice to see you.

124
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,944
- And you are?

125
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:23,382
- I'm Ariel's psychiatrist,
Dr. Reese.

126
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,122
I used to work here.

127
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,613
- Tachycardia is improving.

128
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:38,484
Should I still run those labs?

129
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,094
- No need, Doris.

130
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:42,966
- You still have privileges
at Gaffney, Dr. Reese?

131
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,446
- I don't, but I was hoping

132
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,014
Dr. Charles might grant them
while Ariel's here.

133
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:49,495
- Of course.
- Cancel those labs, Doris.

134
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,018
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,541
- I promise this
physical reaction

136
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,152
was not brought on
by the drug itself.

137
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:57,198
It was fear, your fear.

138
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,809
And now you are
taking back control.

139
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,768
Deep breaths.

140
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:05,249
Good.

141
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,078
I'm gonna go call
your parents, Ariel, okay?

142
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,297
I'll be right back.

143
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:11,518
- Thank you, Dr. Reese.

144
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,782
- Hey, Daniel.

145
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,697
Some history there?

146
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:21,657
- Yeah, Sarah interned
under me when she was here.

147
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,399
Can't say we parted
under the best of terms.

148
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,748
It was complicated.
But let me tell you something.

149
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:28,229
She's so talented.

150
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,274
I haven't seen her
in six years.

151
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,015
- A May-December thing?

152
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,669
- No, Dean.

153
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,542
It was a people thing.

154
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:39,371
- Okay.

155
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:46,073
- Dr. Archer, aren't you
joining the festivities?

156
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:47,378
- Oh, you bet.

157
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,077
I can't miss out on
Doris's Jell-O salad.

158
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,513
It's even better
than her cookies.

159
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:52,993
How about you?

160
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:55,735
- Well, I wish I could,
but I'm meeting Dennis in--

161
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:56,910
oh, jeez.

162
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,260
I forgot to charge my watch.

163
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,567
Anyway, I'm gonna grab
some things from my office,

164
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:02,698
and then I'm out.

165
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,744
- Oh, sounds lovely.

166
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,441
- How are you holding up?

167
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:09,096
Letting go of the reins
isn't always easy.

168
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:12,142
- Mm, I got in my head
about it at first,

169
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,536
but frankly,
it's been liberating

170
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,277
to focus on just
being a doctor again.

171
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,408
Feels good.
- I'm glad.

172
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:18,845
You're an excellent doctor.

173
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,977
- Oh, don't blow smoke
up my lab coat, please.

174
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:23,458
- Oh, no smoke,
just simple fact.

175
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,068
- All right.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

176
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,506
- You too.

177
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,945
- Hey, Catie?

178
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,077
- Kip.

179
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,515
- Can we talk?

180
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,132
Oh, why don't you
close the blinds too?

181
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,351
Hide me from your
terrified minions, right?

182
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,745
- I told you never
to come here.

183
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,442
- Why?

184
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,444
Are you afraid I'll tell them
you're not actually scary?

185
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,536
What do you want, Kip?

186
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:03,280
- I can't go tonight.

187
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,457
- What? Well, why not?

188
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,982
- Something came up.

189
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,940
- I don't believe you.

190
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,420
- Kudos to
the human lie detector.

191
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,162
Nothing came up.
I just simply don't wanna go.

192
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,819
- What happened to your face?
Looks like--

193
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,864
Nothing.

194
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,257
Just fell.

195
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:25,172
- Oh, you fell?

196
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,740
'Cause it looks like
you got punched.

197
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,263
- Right again, Catie.

198
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:31,526
I got into a bar fight
because I was drunk.

199
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,180
It was a night
of irresponsible choices.

200
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,877
- Are you ever gonna grow up?
- Oh, God.

201
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:37,010
You know, Mom would hate
the way that you treat me.

202
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,620
- Mom overindulged you.

203
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,231
- Well, that's why
I am the way I am.

204
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:43,669
- You know, if you're
really gonna bail tonight,

205
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,498
you obviously don't care about
Mom as much as you claim to.

206
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:51,241
- All right.
- Have a good day, Catie.

207
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:59,119
- I gotta tell you.
It really is--

208
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,295
I don't know.
It's a nice surprise.

209
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:02,426
- Good to see you, too,
Dr. Charles.

210
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,037
- How long have you been back?

211
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:07,127
- I finished Baylor
four years ago.

212
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,477
- Four years?

213
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:12,480
- Sorry, just,
the time got away from me.

214
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,134
- I totally get it.
I really do.

215
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:16,571
What--are you in--
in private practice now?

216
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,138
- Yeah, I joined the
Ananke Center last year.

217
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:20,096
- Really?

218
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:23,056
So Ananke, Greek,
mother of fate?

219
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,623
- And necessity.

220
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,713
I focus on a holistic,
by-any-means-necessary approach.

221
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:30,585
- Well, anyway,
hear it's a really cool place.

222
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,805
- Thank you for extending me
temporary privileges

223
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,328
so I can care for Ariel.

224
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,677
- Of course.
Are you kidding me?

225
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,201
Oh, by the way,
speaking of Ariel,

226
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:40,247
how were you so sure that

227
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:42,597
she wasn't overdosing
on an antidepressant?

228
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:45,034
- Because she's not taking one.

229
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,645
She's on a placebo.

230
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,909
- Oh, so she's in, like,
a double-blind clinical trial?

231
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,519
- No, no, no.

232
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,261
She thinks she's taking an
antidepressant, citalopram.

233
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,566
- She's unaware?

234
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:56,872
- She thinks she needs
the citalopram

235
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,352
to manage her depression,

236
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,702
but I see it as
an unnecessary crutch.

237
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,356
There will come a time,
however,

238
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:05,272
where I disclose that truth
to illustrate that point.

239
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:06,621
- Well, good,
because I mean,

240
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,275
there is the ethical piece, right?

241
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,755
- What do you mean?

242
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,670
- I guess I mean the
ethics of prescribing

243
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,630
a placebo to somebody
who's suicidally depressed.

244
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,676
- This wasn't a suicide
attempt, Dr. Charles.

245
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,287
I'd actually appreciate it
if you'd discharge her.

246
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,462
- Of course.

247
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:23,072
I mean, I'd feel
a little more comfortable

248
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:24,595
if I could just get--

249
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,163
- You know, I totally understand
your cause for concern.

250
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:31,864
But I want to assure you, I do
actually know what I'm doing.

251
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,300
I had an excellent teacher.

252
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,084
- Oh, okay.

253
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,652
Very good.

254
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,786
- Aaron Decembly, 36,
traffic accident.

255
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,092
Passenger side got
T-boned by a huge SUV.

256
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,311
Seat belt was on.

257
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:47,053
Heart rate 95, BP 123/82.

258
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,315
Facial airbag contusions,

259
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:49,664
also complained of neck pain
at the scene.

260
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:51,753
- Wipe that goofy grin
off your face.

261
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,624
- Why? I'm the happiest guy
in the world.

262
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,496
But you are,
and I say this with love,

263
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,541
a remarkably bad driver.

264
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,501
- That car did come out of
nowhere, but I'm so sorry.

265
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:02,111
- Are you his girlfriend?

266
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:04,287
- I don't know, Krista,
are you my girlfriend?

267
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:07,508
- I--yeah, I think I am.

268
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:08,988
Finally.

269
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:12,469
- All right, carefully
on my count, one, two, three.

270
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,999
- Normal respirations.

271
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,696
Lungs are clear.

272
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:23,698
- Thanks.

273
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,005
- I'm getting first date vibes.
- Yeah, you're right.

274
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:28,268
We've secretly been in love
with each other for 18 years.

275
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,878
- We met in our college dorm.

276
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,314
- We were never single
at the same time

277
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,360
or geographically compatible--

278
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,928
both: Until now.

279
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,800
- Well, there's no sign
of free fluid.

280
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,193
CT's backed up.

281
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,282
Let's do a lateral
C-spine X-ray.

282
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:44,763
- My company just
transferred me to Chicago.

283
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,503
Krista literally just picked
me up from the airport,

284
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,027
and this happens.
- X-ray up.

285
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,210
- Spine's been torn in half.

286
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,689
- It's hanging by a thread.

287
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,735
One wrong move
from paralysis or death.

288
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,999
- I mean, how did he even
survive the accident?

289
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,871
- Luck.

290
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:08,438
That neck brace is the only
thing keeping him alive.

291
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,789
We have to get him to surgery.

292
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,894
- Scream, and I'll
cut your damn throat.

293
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:37,424
- Where's your phone?

294
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,078
- In my car.

295
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:41,776
I just ran up here to grab
that bottle of whiskey.

296
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,647
- Stand up. Empty your pockets.

297
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:45,693
- What?
What can I help you with?

298
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,826
- Just sit back down.

299
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,399
I already cut the line.
- Look.

300
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,098
You should know my friend
is waiting for me in my car.

301
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:02,014
And if I don't show up soon,
he's gonna come looking for me.

302
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,885
- Nice try,
but I watched you park

303
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,845
and walk in today, alone.

304
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,587
- Do we know each other?

305
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:13,547
- I don't know.

306
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:14,896
Do we?

307
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,420
- Were you a patient?

308
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:19,379
- You'll figure it out.

309
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,603
- Wait. My spine is severed?

310
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,301
- It's fractured and dislocated

311
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,607
between the C2
and C3 vertebrae.

312
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:33,393
- Miraculously, your spinal cord
is still functioning.

313
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:36,613
But any sudden movement
or trauma could change that

314
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:38,006
and leave you a quadriplegic.

315
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:39,878
- And surgery could fix him?

316
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,880
- Surgery is our best chance
to fix it,

317
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,533
but it's still
a very risky procedure.

318
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:46,058
- Why is this surgery
so dangerous?

319
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:49,626
- Well, his CTA showed that
both vertebral arteries

320
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,454
are occluded, blocked.

321
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:55,110
- Usually, all four arteries
supply blood to your brain.

322
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,938
But right now,
your carotid arteries

323
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,592
are shouldering
the entire burden.

324
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,028
So we need to restore
regular blood flow

325
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,508
back to your brain stem.

326
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,162
- Until then,
any dip in blood pressure

327
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,077
could cause a massive stroke.

328
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:07,079
- So it's a ticking time bomb.

329
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,471
- We need to get you
upstairs ASAP.

330
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:09,777
- With your permission.

331
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,170
One of the best neurosurgeons
in the country

332
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:12,911
is on his way here now.

333
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,217
Are you game?

334
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:17,393
- Damn right, I'm game.

335
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:19,656
Krista and I have
a life to live together.

336
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:22,659
Let's do this.

337
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,575
- Okay.

338
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,361
- Savannah?

339
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,232
- Hi.

340
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:33,105
Just getting some chips
for Ariel.

341
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,976
- How's she doing?
- Good.

342
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,586
She's definitely ready
to go home.

343
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:37,718
- Oh, I bet.

344
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,199
You know that, um,

345
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,203
Sarah was probably the most
emotionally intuitive resident

346
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,596
I've ever worked with, ever.

347
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,685
- She's made a huge
difference for Ariel.

348
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,165
- Oh, clearly.

349
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,212
Do you happen to know
how they--

350
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,257
how they found each other?

351
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,564
- Ariel and I have been
roommates for two years.

352
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,784
The first year was epic.
We became like sisters.

353
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:03,004
But that all changed last year.

354
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,876
Ariel began to withdraw.

355
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:08,575
She stopped taking care
of herself,

356
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,011
never wanted to go out.

357
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,926
Some days, she wouldn't
even get out of bed.

358
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:14,363
- Was there, like, a, um,
I don't know,

359
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:17,584
a specific event,
like a trigger?

360
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:20,761
- No.
That's what made it so weird.

361
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:25,461
- Sometimes depression
will come out of nowhere.

362
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:28,203
- She tried
a ton of therapists

363
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,901
who prescribed
a ton of antidepressants,

364
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:33,643
but nothing worked.

365
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:35,558
But then she found Dr. Reese.

366
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,649
And within a month,
Ariel was her old self again.

367
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,565
I didn't have to live in fear.

368
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:45,177
- How do you mean,
live in fear?

369
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,748
- Ariel swallowed up
a bottle of--of aspirin

370
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:54,403
around eight months ago.

371
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,057
We took her to
Jackson Monroe ED,

372
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:59,060
and they pumped her stomach.

373
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:02,194
- Of course, I mean,
Dr. Reese knows all this?

374
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,283
- Yeah, that's why
Ariel started

375
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:06,024
seeing her a few weeks later.

376
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,417
- Right.

377
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,638
- Look, I don't know
what your plans are,

378
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:17,600
but you haven't done anything
that can't be undone.

379
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:21,169
So why don't you just
put the knife down,

380
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,303
and then you can go home
to your family.

381
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:26,435
- But that's the thing.

382
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:30,309
I don't have a family
anymore because of you.

383
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,877
- Okay, I get that
you're angry with me.

384
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,532
But if I don't know why,

385
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:39,405
I can't very well
apologize for it.

386
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,015
Can I?
- My name is Cassidy.

387
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,799
- Okay.

388
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,020
- And do you wanna know why
you don't remember me?

389
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:49,110
Because I don't matter to you.

390
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,895
My wife certainly
did not matter to you.

391
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,941
- Your wife?

392
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:56,291
- Wendy.

393
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,511
We were on the ship
that capsized.

394
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:01,818
And you let her die.
You let her die.

395
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,560
- Okay. Okay.

396
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:07,128
- The NCI depleted
our supply of O-neg.

397
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,999
These are the last five units.

398
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,963
Your wife was
Dr. Lenox's patient.

399
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:19,662
She needed blood, and it was
given to another patient.

400
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:22,448
- No, <i>you</i> gave it
to another patient,

401
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:25,538
to the man who caused
the entire accident,

402
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,324
who is the reason
Wendy got crushed under debris.

403
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,719
- It was an impossible choice
to make.

404
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,114
- You know what I can't
stop thinking about?

405
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,333
That blood would have
saved her.

406
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:41,162
It was no long shot.
If you would have chosen Wendy,

407
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,512
she would be here right now.

408
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:46,167
You knew it was
a death sentence.

409
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,474
- Cassidy--
- Don't.

410
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,997
- All right.

411
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,955
I regret that Wendy died.

412
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:57,570
I followed a protocol that
saves more lives than it loses.

413
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,964
It's not perfect,
but it tries to be fair.

414
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,618
- Fair?

415
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,272
Fair?

416
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:07,362
- Look, I totally
understand how you feel--

417
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,059
- You understand nothing!

418
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:24,466
Please. Please.

419
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,042
- What's his neuro exam?

420
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:36,870
- He's still intact,
with full motor strength

421
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,220
and normal sensation
in both arms and legs.

422
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,961
- Great.

423
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:42,441
Dr. Abrams should be here soon,
and we'll get you up to the OR.

424
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,182
- Look,

425
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,403
you said earlier that
the surgery was dangerous.

426
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:49,884
But how dangerous?

427
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:53,843
I wanna know.

428
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:59,371
- It's not a very
common procedure,

429
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,242
so there's not a lot of data.

430
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:06,116
But in my experience,
more than half don't make it.

431
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:13,036
- Well, that certainly
puts things in perspective.

432
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,560
Wow.

433
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,910
You know, for a couple that
specializes in bad timing,

434
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,913
this really takes the cake.

435
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,436
This morning,
I was the happiest

436
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:24,178
I'd ever been in my life.

437
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,398
- No one knows
what's gonna happen.

438
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,749
- Yeah, well, fate certainly
seems to be against me.

439
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:41,369
- When did you plan on
asking her?

440
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,243
- Today.

441
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,548
- So what's stopping you?

442
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:49,072
- Are you serious?

443
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,944
- Any of us could die today.

444
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:54,121
Some of us know it's coming.
Some of us don't.

445
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:57,734
But fate is boring.
Live your life.

446
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,700
- Good for you.

447
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,745
- He is nice to look at.

448
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:12,444
- But?

449
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,707
- I don't know.

450
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,971
Loren's great,
but I feel like I'm 15,

451
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:19,799
you know,
and everything's going great.

452
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,932
I get bored.

453
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,543
Maybe I just need to grow up

454
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:27,285
and accept it's not all
butterflies and fireworks.

455
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,808
- You're not bored.

456
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,244
You just don't feel it.

457
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,898
Those are two entirely
different things.

458
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,292
- You think?
- I know.

459
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,252
- Butterflies and fireworks
are worth waiting for.

460
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,689
- Oh, so you found
someone special?

461
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,170
- Mm, not yet,
but I'm a patient woman.

462
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:47,435
And I gotta be honest.
You should be too.

463
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:50,830
- "I gotta be honest"?
Do you know who you sound like?

464
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,832
How dare you.

465
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,399
- Speaking of which,

466
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,924
can we see if he's finally
discharged Ariel Sparkman?

467
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:01,842
- Ariel still hasn't
been discharged.

468
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,857
- Um, please.

469
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:22,122
Can you grab me
an orange juice?

470
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:23,471
- What?

471
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:27,301
- I'm diabetic, and my
blood sugar's crashing.

472
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:28,781
- It doesn't matter.

473
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,827
- Well, it should matter
to you.

474
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:35,396
This--

475
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,878
This glucose monitor
is programmed

476
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:42,403
to notify my children
of my location

477
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:46,015
the moment my blood sugar
falls below 70.

478
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,453
They'll know
something is wrong.

479
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:51,238
- Okay. Okay. Where are they?

480
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,935
- In the fridge.

481
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:07,386
They're in the bottom drawer.

482
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,439
Well, I had to sit up to drink.

483
00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:25,838
Thank you.

484
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:39,155
It's harder than
you thought, huh?

485
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:40,722
- What?

486
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:44,465
- Trying to kill
another person.

487
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:48,426
You never pictured yourself
doing something like this.

488
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,992
But would Wendy want--

489
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,864
- Don't say her name.

490
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:55,781
- But if she were here
right now,

491
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:58,827
would she want to see you

492
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:02,048
throw your entire life away?

493
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:04,877
No.

494
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,922
She was a better person.

495
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:09,969
- And if she were here,

496
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,059
what would she tell you
right now?

497
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,672
- What was that?

498
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,459
- You lying bitch.

499
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,334
<i>- Sharon.</i>

500
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:29,336
Yeah, just calling
with a quick question,

501
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:32,034
but you're probably already out
celebrating with the family.

502
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:35,385
So don't worry about
calling me back.

503
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:38,084
I'll sort it out.

504
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:40,390
Hey, it looks like
somebody said yes.

505
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:41,435
- Uh-huh.

506
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:43,393
Rumor has it that
Dr. Lenox here

507
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,700
talked Aaron into
proposing today.

508
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:48,486
- Oh, you going soft on us?

509
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,618
- I've read several studies
that indicate

510
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:53,534
a patient's odds for survival
rise exponentially

511
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,538
when they have hope,
so happiness heals.

512
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,714
- That sounds on brand.

513
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:01,282
- Sorry to disappoint.

514
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,200
- I have an idea.

515
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,466
- Hey, listen,
I looked into it,

516
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,600
and we can still appeal
the parole board's decision.

517
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,471
- No, man. It's done.

518
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:19,604
I'm done.

519
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,388
- The board never gave you
a chance today.

520
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:22,998
- Sure, they did.

521
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:25,697
They just decided
I didn't deserve one.

522
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,568
Can't say I blame them.

523
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,135
- What?

524
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:31,398
- I've had a lot of time
to reflect in here.

525
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:34,923
I make bad choices even
when I know they're bad,

526
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:37,447
because I somehow
thought it made me tough.

527
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,583
Turns out, I'm not.

528
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,717
No point in lying to myself
anymore, right?

529
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:47,675
- Don't talk like that.

530
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:50,635
Lynne and the baby need you,
whatever time you have left.

531
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,114
- I need them.

532
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:55,248
I just don't know how much
more fight I have in me.

533
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,772
- You got one more fight
in you?

534
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,913
- Do you want
more orange juice?

535
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:10,045
No, I'm good.

536
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,657
A doctor would be nice.

537
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,528
- I can't do that.

538
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:18,706
- Yeah, I figured.

539
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:21,709
- Why aren't you scared?

540
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,233
- Scared of what? Dying?

541
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,713
- Yeah.

542
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:28,237
- Well, I was a nurse.

543
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:34,417
I saw death every day.

544
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:38,030
I--I don't want to die,

545
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:41,599
but I don't regret

546
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,777
one moment of my life.

547
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:52,435
I have known love.

548
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:57,963
I have three amazing children.

549
00:26:57,964 --> 00:27:00,792
I'm a grandmother,

550
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:06,928
and I have lived
a life of purpose.

551
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:11,759
- What do you think happens
when you die?

552
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,937
- I hope that I'm reunited

553
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:19,201
with the people that I've lost.

554
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:24,903
And that my children

555
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:29,429
carry just a little piece
of me as they move on.

556
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:40,266
- I don't know how to
move on from Wendy.

557
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,659
I--I can't.

558
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,879
- Well, that's because

559
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,622
you're letting
your love for her

560
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:50,799
tear you apart.

561
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,631
I know.

562
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,290
- What's wrong?

563
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,727
- Nothing.
Everything's actually perfect.

564
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,686
- Okay, is that
the pain meds talking?

565
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:16,302
Wait.

566
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,869
Is this what I think it is?

567
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,392
- Are you okay with that?

568
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:20,828
- I'm more than okay.

569
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,743
This all seems
strangely appropriate,

570
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,311
given our history together.

571
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:27,356
- Look behind you, sweetie.

572
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:33,014
- Uh, I was recently
ordained online.

573
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:35,060
- About 15 minutes ago.
- Yeah, not by choice.

574
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,365
- Shh.

575
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:43,155
- We are gathered here today

576
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:46,027
for reasons
not entirely clear to me

577
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:48,421
to witness the joining
of two lives.

578
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:52,686
Do you, Aaron, take Krista
to be your partner in life,

579
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:56,385
to love and to cherish,
for better or for worse,

580
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:58,736
for richer, for poorer,

581
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,738
in sickness and in health,

582
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:05,046
from this day forward
until death do you part?

583
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:06,744
- I do.

584
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,746
- And do you, Krista,

585
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,749
take Aaron to be
your partner in life,

586
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,360
to love and to cherish,
for better or for worse,

587
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:18,059
for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and in health,

588
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,411
from this day forward,
until death do you part?

589
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:24,805
- I do.

590
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,112
- You people do
have rings, right?

591
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:38,645
By the power vested in me
by some random website,

592
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:40,778
I now pronounce you married.

593
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,172
Now, kiss, and let's get
Aaron up to surgery.

594
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:52,398
- We're gonna spend more
years together than we wasted.

595
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,182
You hear me?

596
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:56,576
- You bet we will.

597
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:58,360
- It's time.

598
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,201
- You having a moment?

599
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:15,161
- Yeah.

600
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:22,384
- I'm sorry, Dr. Charles,

601
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:24,996
I'm just curious why you
haven't discharged Ariel yet?

602
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:26,998
- So I can fully assess her.

603
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,043
- Uh-huh.
Why would you need to do that?

604
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:31,741
- Because it's become
pretty clear to me, anyway,

605
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:33,221
that when she took
those pills this morning,

606
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:36,572
it was a second
suicide attempt.

607
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,226
- Oh, you spoke to Savannah?

608
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,881
- I don't understand why you'd
withhold that detail from me.

609
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:43,144
- You wanna know why
I chose not to tell you?

610
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:45,494
It's because I know you.
You analyze.

611
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:47,757
You second guess. You judge.

612
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:49,411
And here you are again,
right on time.

613
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:51,500
- Sarah, do you not realize
how serious this is?

614
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,241
- Ariel did not try
to kill herself today.

615
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:54,895
- All I can say is,
you're damn lucky

616
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,071
they were just sugar pills.
- It was an accident.

617
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:58,594
- Why do you keep saying that?

618
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:00,901
- I want her discharged now.
- Well, it's not happening

619
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,469
'cause she's on a 72-hour hold.

620
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,384
- Dr. Charles, you are wrong.

621
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:06,733
- How is it humanly possible

622
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,996
that someone could take
12 pills by accident?

623
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:10,998
- I'm still figuring it out.
- Okay, great.

624
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,565
So you want me to just
discharge a patient

625
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:15,263
who is a clear suicide risk
to your disturbingly

626
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:17,570
questionable care
so you can figure it out?

627
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,615
- You arrogant son of a bitch.

628
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:23,706
- I don't know, but you got too
close to your patient again,

629
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:26,231
lost all objectivity, again.

630
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:29,016
Let's face it--
been an issue before, Sarah.

631
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,713
- Call me Dr. Reese.

632
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:32,280
And this isn't about Ariel.

633
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:35,196
This is about you
and how you could never fathom

634
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:37,938
that you might possibly
be wrong.

635
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,331
And you know
just as well as I do

636
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,941
that that was
the reason I left.

637
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:44,031
- Okay, well, guess what,
Dr. Reese?

638
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:47,730
You're about to leave again.
Get the hell out of my unit.

639
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:55,913
Dr. Ripley, incoming.

640
00:31:55,914 --> 00:32:00,134
- Robert Sullivan, 36,
BP 120/80, O2 97.

641
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:01,744
Involved in an altercation.

642
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:02,963
They did a chest X-ray
at the jail.

643
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,052
Ribs 7 and 8 are broken,
but no pneumothorax.

644
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:07,272
- Sully.
- Gentle, Rip.

645
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:10,057
I'm very delicate.

646
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:11,537
- What happened exactly?

647
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:13,756
- Genius picked a fight
with someone twice his size.

648
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:14,888
- He was smack talking
the Bulls.

649
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,324
I couldn't just let that slide.

650
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:18,196
- Okay, let's get him
upstairs for a CT,

651
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:20,328
and I'll need his
cuffs off for that.

652
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:21,417
- Yes, sir.

653
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,249
- Hey, you missed
the festivities.

654
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,990
Look. I snagged the wishbone.

655
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:32,427
- Ah, yes, the beloved

656
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:35,430
tearing of the furcula
holiday tradition.

657
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:38,781
- I gotta say, Dean,
I'm proud of you.

658
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:40,653
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?

659
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:43,438
- This positive attitude.
- Ah.

660
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,005
- You know, I thought
your first day back

661
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:47,007
was gonna be
all doom and gloom.

662
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,531
- About that.

663
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,491
- What's this?

664
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:53,840
- It's a resignation letter.

665
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:56,625
I'm gonna slip it
under Goodwin's door.

666
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,758
- Wait. Are you serious?

667
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,238
- Yes, I am.

668
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,109
- You said you were relieved

669
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,981
to not have
the extra responsibility.

670
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,330
- I tried
to believe that today.

671
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:07,941
I really did.

672
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:11,466
But with Sean leaving Chicago
and Margo and I ending things,

673
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:12,902
why stay?

674
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,643
- Are you really
saying that to me?

675
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:19,997
- Of course,
you're a reason to stay.

676
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,129
But Goodwin's right.

677
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,305
Lenox is the future of the ED,

678
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:27,352
and it's time for me
to move on.

679
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:30,008
I don't wanna let anything
get in the way of that.

680
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:33,358
- Okay. Let's make a deal.

681
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,012
You win, you get to
slip this little letter

682
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,404
under Goodwin's door.

683
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,798
I win, there's a
24-hour cooldown period

684
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,234
where you need to reconsider.

685
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:42,628
Deal?
- Yeah, deal. Yeah.

686
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:45,326
- Three, two, one, pull.

687
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,372
- Oh.

688
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:48,851
Cheater.

689
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,551
- Sore loser.

690
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,382
Better start reconsidering.

691
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,437
- It's not exactly
wedding cake,

692
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,744
but it is homemade.

693
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:14,442
- Thanks.
I'm way too anxious to eat.

694
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:16,750
- Yeah. Okay.

695
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:24,757
- Thank you for today.

696
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:27,281
Dr. Asher said that you were
a secret wedding planner.

697
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,588
- Guilty.

698
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:32,156
And it was my pleasure.

699
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,418
- Thank you so much

700
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,855
for creating that
special memory for us.

701
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:38,118
- You and your husband
have a lifetime

702
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,903
of memories to make together.

703
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:45,473
- My husband.

704
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:48,563
I like the sound of that.

705
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:50,174
- She's here.

706
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:52,524
- Oh, my gosh.

707
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:55,831
- I'm right here, okay?

708
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:57,746
- Dr. Abrams is
just finishing up,

709
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,357
but you should start
planning that honeymoon.

710
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,493
- Thank you.

711
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,593
- Hey, buddy.

712
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:21,161
How you feeling?

713
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,294
- I'm a fan of the Percocet.

714
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:26,384
I haven't slept that good
in weeks.

715
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,907
I'll enjoy it while I can.

716
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:32,999
Well, that's what I need
to talk to you about.

717
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,348
- Uh-oh.

718
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,785
- Your spleen has
been lacerated.

719
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:38,526
- That doesn't sound good.

720
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:39,962
- Could be worse.

721
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:42,704
We'll need to keep an eye
on your hemoglobin levels.

722
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:47,187
But also, your
white blood cell count is low.

723
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:50,277
So I can't in good conscience

724
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:54,500
release you back into
police custody anytime soon.

725
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,633
- Hmm.

726
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:03,116
So this is a bad news,
good news scenario.

727
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:05,423
- Actually,
it's a bad news, good news,

728
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:08,122
more good news scenario.

729
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:15,520
- Lynne.

730
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:18,914
- No visitors.

731
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:21,265
- Come on, man.
Let him see his kid.

732
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,049
- No can do.

733
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,572
- It's Thanksgiving.

734
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:30,404
- Make it quick.

735
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:33,059
- Hi.

736
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,975
Hey.

737
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:39,239
There you go. Watch his head.

738
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,981
Oh, he missed his dad.

739
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:43,635
- Oh, yeah.

740
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,289
There he is.

741
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,725
There's my man.

742
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:48,684
- Hey, buddy.
- Whoa.

743
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:54,298
Thank you, Rip.

744
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:56,430
This is a gift.

745
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:03,525
- Hey.

746
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:23,893
- Why do you give him flowers?

747
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:28,724
You know he doesn't deserve it.

748
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:32,293
- You wanna do it?

749
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:48,482
I miss her.

750
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:51,224
- I know.

751
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:54,358
You loved her so much.

752
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:57,056
- Yeah.

753
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:59,363
I just wish he loved us
that much.

754
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,669
- Kip.

755
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:09,069
I just wish you
could forgive him.

756
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:16,467
- I can't.

757
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:18,818
It's not even a choice.
I just...

758
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:24,388
I--I can't.

759
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:34,354
I'm glad I came, Catie.

760
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:36,791
- Me too.

761
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:52,285
- Hey.

762
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,027
Wake up.

763
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,031
Wake up.

764
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:08,606
I'm sorry.

765
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:12,523
I'm--I'm so sorry.

766
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,985
Ugh!

767
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:37,521
- No, no. Please wait!

768
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:39,305
Wait, please!

769
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,916
Wait, wait!
