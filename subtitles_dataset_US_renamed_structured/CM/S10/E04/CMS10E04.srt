1
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:07,919
It's a death threat. I've
done this job a long time.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,399
I've pissed off a lot of people.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,835
I wouldn't take this lightly.

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,490
<i>I have determined that</i>

5
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,231
<i>you are a significant
danger to yourself.</i>

6
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:16,276
How dare you?

7
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:17,581
You're gonna sit there

8
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:18,930
and you're gonna tell me
what's inside my head?

9
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,151
<i>The only thing we wanna
do is to help you.</i>

10
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:24,110
You have a beautiful family.

11
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:26,503
<i>Thank you for taking
care of my girl.</i>

12
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:28,201
You are gonna see
her when you wake up.

13
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:29,637
It's gonna be OK.

14
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:32,205
- Oh, my God.
- She's flatlining.

15
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:35,034
- No. No!
- Time of death, 22:31.

16
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:40,256
<i>I need to see my baby.</i>

17
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:41,605
<i>Right now, we need to
get you into surgery.</i>

18
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:43,085
<i>- Am I gonna be OK?
- That's the priority.</i>

19
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:45,174
<i>I'm not going under
until I see Ruby, please.</i>

20
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:53,400
<i>Open a vaginal tray in the Jada.</i>

21
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,184
<i>- Hemabate is in.
- Give 2 grams of TSA.</i>

22
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:58,013
Hi, Ruby.

23
00:00:58,014 --> 00:00:59,449
I'm your mom.

24
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,800
I've loved you for so long.

25
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,064
I want so much for you.

26
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:08,284
<i>She's back in defib.</i>

27
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,807
- Charge to 120.
- Clear.

28
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:12,636
- Right angle retractor.
- No.

29
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:13,855
- Another milligram of epi.
- She's flatlining.

30
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:14,899
No, no.

31
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,423
Come on, come on, come on.

32
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,429
Time of death, 22:31.

33
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,562
Hey.

34
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,390
Uh, Ms. Wilson's
labs came back.

35
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:29,914
Everything looks good.
H2 blocker and discharge?

36
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:31,307
No.

37
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,830
No, not yet. That's...

38
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:35,920
You wanna run <i>another</i> test?

39
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:38,401
I'd like to get an MRI of
your chest and your abdomen.

40
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:39,576
Dr. Asher,

41
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:41,100
could I steal you for a moment?

42
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,144
Mm-hmm. I'll be right back.

43
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,364
All right.

44
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,802
Why has this patient been
in the ED over three hours

45
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:48,846
for heartburn?

46
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,196
Because heartburn in pregnancy

47
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,719
can be a sign of more
serious conditions.

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,982
All of which you've already
tested for and ruled out.

49
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:55,636
I haven't ruled out
an aortic dissection.

50
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:58,160
Her vitals are stable. Her
symptoms don't line up.

51
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,423
It could be an
unusual presentation.

52
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,947
You're reaching, Dr. Asher.

53
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:06,862
When was the last
time you went home?

54
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,260
Patient has reflux,

55
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:14,177
give an H2 blocker
and discharge.

56
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,572
What's up, guys?

57
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,661
I had nothing to do with it.

58
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:21,966
Me neither.

59
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,361
To be honest, I was a
way bigger Nick fan.

60
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:27,798
I just find your character
kind of annoying.

61
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,757
No offense.

62
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:32,194
None taken, Kai.

63
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:39,636
You think maybe people will
forget about this soon?

64
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:42,900
I think you gotta expect
a solid month of ribbing.

65
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,337
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

66
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,816
It's not every day you
find out your colleague

67
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,992
was a teen heartthrob.

68
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,603
Ah.

69
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,475
But hey, joke's on them, right?

70
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,216
How do you figure?

71
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,218
Well, according to Loren,

72
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,134
random women just throw
themselves at you.

73
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:00,614
Guilty. Yeah.

74
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:01,832
And I bet you're the
only resident here

75
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,661
not drowning in med school debt.

76
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,402
Right.

77
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:07,838
See you out there, Hollywood.

78
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:19,285
- Jackie!
- Hi.

79
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,764
Oh.

80
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,201
What are you doing here?

81
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,202
You don't know?

82
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,551
I'm working here.

83
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:26,248
- Wait, <i>you're</i> the new nurse!
- Yeah.

84
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,076
I realized I was onboarding

85
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:31,340
a new transfer today, but I
didn't realize it was you.

86
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:34,038
But that's great.
- Oh, OK.

87
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,823
Is this... it's... this is...

88
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,825
it's not lost on me that
this could be weird for you.

89
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,087
What do you mean?

90
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:40,828
Well, working with
me after you found me

91
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,046
bleeding on the bathroom floor.
- Stop it.

92
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,700
But no, not at all.

93
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,398
Maggie, where are we going?

94
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,660
OK, I gotta go.

95
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,101
Yeah, of course. Go.

96
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,968
Dr. Charles.

97
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,405
Jackie, hello.

98
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,755
Hi. I owe you an apology.

99
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:57,279
Uh, for my, uh...

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,977
colorful word choice
the last time I saw you.

101
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,849
If memory serves,

102
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,894
"condescending prick"
was a highlight.

103
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:04,895
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,462
Well, in my defense,

105
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,290
you were trying to commit me
to a psych ward at the time.

106
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,291
Totally fair.

107
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,336
Daniel.

108
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:12,251
I, uh, need an opinion.

109
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,556
I'm gonna go change
into my scrubs.

110
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:15,123
Great to see you again.

111
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:16,820
What do you got?

112
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:17,734
Headache.

113
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:20,737
I just hate this texting crap.

114
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,826
- Texting crap?
- Yeah.

115
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:26,352
It's... it's ruined the already
fragile art of communication.

116
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:27,875
Boy, I tell ya.

117
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:29,529
And, uh, how can I help
you with this one, Dean-o?

118
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,533
All right, so this is a
message from Margo, right?

119
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,274
"Got time for an
afternoon coffee.

120
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,971
We should talk."

121
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,407
I mean, I don't know.

122
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,888
Is she asking to
move in together,

123
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,064
or is she about to
break up with me?

124
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:44,805
You know, considering
that my girlfriend

125
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:47,590
just transferred to another
hospital to get away from me,

126
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:50,463
I'm not positive that I'm
the guy you should be asking.

127
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:52,160
Maybe, you know,

128
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:55,337
consult a member of the,
uh, the female persuasion?

129
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,858
Oh, look, there's
one right there, see.

130
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,473
Do you...

131
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,827
Hey, Hannah. I, uh...
I need an opinion.

132
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,004
Hannah? Earth to Hannah.

133
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,746
Sorry, what? What's up?

134
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,444
Are you getting any sleep?

135
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:16,358
No.

136
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,490
It wasn't your fault.

137
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,319
Please, don't. I don't want...

138
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,450
OK.

139
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:25,802
We're going to Trauma 1.

140
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:28,022
35-year-old female, Tessa Myers.

141
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:29,328
Appears to have experienced

142
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,981
some kind of blunt force
trauma to the eyes.

143
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,418
Neighbors heard screaming
from her apartment.

144
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,289
PD is investigating it
as a possible assault.

145
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,117
She was highly
combative at the scene.

146
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,641
Tried sedation, but, you
know, she wasn't responding,

147
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:39,990
so we intubated her for safety.

148
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,296
She couldn't see.

149
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,167
I think she was afraid
we were her attacker.

150
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,995
OK, folks, on my count.

151
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,389
One, two, three.

152
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,651
Let's get her on a vent.

153
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,479
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

154
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,828
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

155
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,482
- You need me to tap in?
- No, no, I got this one.

156
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,310
- You sure?
- No, go ahead.

157
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:58,922
Um, why don't you take the
ankle sprain in Treatment 3?

158
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,620
OK, yeah. Great.

159
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,058
Her eyeballs are
as hard as marbles.

160
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,451
Mm.

161
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:06,669
She must have
retrobulbar hemorrhages

162
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,368
and orbital
compartment syndrome.

163
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,369
I need to release the pressure.

164
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,587
Right, I'll page ophthalmology.

165
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:12,849
I mean I need to release
the pressure now.

166
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,460
Get Kai and grab a lac kit.
- Yeah.

167
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:16,070
You're gonna slice
open her eyelids?

168
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,855
I'm gonna cut lateral to her
eyelids, but yes, basically.

169
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,468
You ever do a
lateral canthotomy?

170
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,295
One. You?

171
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,471
This will be my second.

172
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,690
That's reassuring.

173
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,388
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

174
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,087
- You ready, Kai?
- Ready.

175
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,188
That isn't from
blunt force trauma.

176
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:48,319
No.

177
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,540
These are chemical burns.

178
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,934
Someone poured acid in her eyes.

179
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,643
Well, good morning, Ms.
Administrator of the Year.

180
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:09,993
Bow when you speak to me.

181
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:12,518
Picking up my suit at the
dry cleaner's at lunch.

182
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,651
Well, thank you again for
doing this for me, Daniel.

183
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,914
I'll be your arm candy
any day of the week.

184
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:20,700
But, uh, where's,
uh... where's Dennis?

185
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:23,485
Keynote speaker at an
oncology conference.

186
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,052
Oh.

187
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,880
What...

188
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:29,012
Where's my...

189
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:31,146
- What?
- Oh.

190
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,192
Hmm?

191
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:37,064
I wonder what, uh,
happened there.

192
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:38,500
I don't know.

193
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,763
Maybe it was housekeeping,

194
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:43,679
but it's odd they
didn't leave a note.

195
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,900
Hmm. We just gotta swap
out the glass, right?

196
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,597
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,686
No.

198
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,341
No, that's...

199
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,779
That's not what concerns me.

200
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,911
Listen, Daniel.

201
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,043
A few days ago,
something happened.

202
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,480
OK.

203
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,264
I received a letter,

204
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,744
a death threat.

205
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,441
What?

206
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,530
Sharon, you're just
telling me about this now?

207
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:12,316
Well, HR asked me to keep it
quiet while they investigate.

208
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,622
Well, did they find
out who sent it?

209
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:15,102
Not yet,

210
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,454
but working theory is a
disgruntled former employee.

211
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,588
So, like, maybe somebody
who got let go during the...

212
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,677
the Jackson-Monroe
bloodbath or something?

213
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,417
Well, they've been
interviewing everyone

214
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:29,072
who was fired, but so far,

215
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,727
they've just eliminated people.

216
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:35,296
It appears the sole
intent was to blind her.

217
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:36,340
Any suspects?

218
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:37,472
With crimes of this nature,

219
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,126
it's often intimate
partner violence.

220
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,737
There were no signs of forced
entry at Tessa's apartment.

221
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,783
- Does Tessa live with anyone?
- She did.

222
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,785
Neighbors reported hearing
arguing between Tessa

223
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:48,527
and her ex-boyfriend a
month ago when he moved out.

224
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,486
We're tracking him down
now to interview him.

225
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,183
She suffered significant second-

226
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,490
and third-degree corneal burns.

227
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,405
And can her vision be restored?

228
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,625
Once I surgically debride
the necrotic tissue,

229
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,975
I'll have a better idea
of how much is viable,

230
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,237
but I'm optimistic.

231
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,588
- Thanks, Dr. Baker.
- Of course.

232
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:08,634
Let's finish her trauma
workup with a panscan.

233
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:11,941
Continue to irrigate her eyes,
start topical and IV steroids,

234
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:14,378
and, uh, let's
wean her sedation.

235
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,379
Will do, Dr. Ripley.

236
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,946
Thanks, Maggie.

237
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,905
Ankle sprain is stable
and ready for discharge,

238
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:20,080
so where do you need me?

239
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:21,124
You know what would
be a huge help?

240
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,605
If you can restock
the supply room.

241
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,041
Do you not want me on the floor?

242
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,303
Oh, we're covered for now.

243
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:28,436
You'd be shocked
how fast we run out

244
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,003
of supplies on a busy morning.

245
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,271
Asher.

246
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,273
Hey.
- Hey.

247
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:40,580
Hi.

248
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,060
You ever gonna stop
dodging my calls?

249
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,541
I'm not dodging you.

250
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,196
I've just been
swamped with work.

251
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,285
Are you OK?

252
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:53,156
I know your case
last week was rough.

253
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,462
Can we not?

254
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,637
Yeah, I... I just...

255
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,857
Yeah, I know, but
I'm just, I'm...

256
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:58,858
fine.

257
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,295
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,910
Hannah, I need to apologize.

259
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:11,000
I never should have blown up
at you like that over Sully.

260
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:12,828
You were...

261
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,222
just trying to stop me
from imploding my life.

262
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,443
Sully, of all people,
set me straight.

263
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:22,055
You believe that?

264
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,186
Not really.

265
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,714
Can I take you out
to dinner tonight?

266
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,585
To catch up?

267
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:33,327
You know, I picked
the short straw

268
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:36,765
and I gotta work
the night shift.

269
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,247
But soon.

270
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:42,075
Soon.

271
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,822
All right, just tell
me how this feels, OK?

272
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:50,910
Hurts.

273
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,607
All right.

274
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:55,262
When were you diagnosed
with Crohn's, Laura?

275
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,830
Uh, when she was pretty young.

276
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,266
Five, I think?

277
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,615
Anything before the age of six

278
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,486
is considered to be
very early onset.

279
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:03,966
You know, my timeline
might be wrong.

280
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,099
She could have been
a little older.

281
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,146
Her mom was always better at
handling that kind of stuff.

282
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:11,365
I'm not great with details.

283
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:12,627
Well, it certainly
looks and sounds

284
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,281
like a Crohn's flare-up to me,

285
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:17,676
but I'd like to get a few
labs and then just afterwards,

286
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,287
take a CT of Laura's
abdomen just to be sure.

287
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,637
Uh, is that really necessary?

288
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:24,508
Laura already went
through all the testing

289
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,249
when she was first diagnosed.

290
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,209
Because Crohn's affects all
the layers of the intestines,

291
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,560
it can lead to complications
which present like flare-ups.

292
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,736
Things like fistulas,
which, if infected,

293
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,520
can lead to an abscess and...

294
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,740
Yeah, I just gotta be honest.

295
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,135
Kind of sounds like
a fishing expedition.

296
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,572
Like you're just trying
to pad my bill here.

297
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,530
Well, that's not the case.

298
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,271
But how about this?

299
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:49,838
We'll start with just the labs

300
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,492
and if Laura's white blood
cell count comes back normal,

301
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,668
we'll skip the CT, OK?

302
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,409
That's just taking
my blood, right?

303
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,672
Right.

304
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,850
I can handle that.

305
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,330
Is that OK?

306
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,766
Fine.

307
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:05,898
Doris, let's get a CBC, CMP,

308
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,857
CRP, ESR, a lipase,
and a UA, please.

309
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,947
- You got it.
- Thank you.

310
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,081
Sandra. Hey.

311
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,517
How's Ruby Thompson?

312
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:19,041
Oh, baby girl's doing great.

313
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:21,870
Maintaining her O2
sats off oxygen.

314
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:24,743
Just working on
coordinated feeds with Dad,

315
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,180
and she should be able
to go home tomorrow.

316
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,530
Dad? Elise's...

317
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,792
Elise's husband is here?

318
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,577
Got in late last
night from Turkey.

319
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,144
I'll let Mr. Thompson
know you're here.

320
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,363
I know he's eager to speak...

321
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,538
You know, I gotta
get back to the ED,

322
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,192
but I will check back later.

323
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:42,021
Oh, OK.

324
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,414
OK. You're OK, Tessa.

325
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,415
You're OK, Tessa.

326
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,590
We have you in restraints

327
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,723
to prevent you from
hurting yourself.

328
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,333
- Tessa, Tessa.
- OK.

329
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,508
I wanna remove
this tube for you,

330
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:53,249
but I need you to
calm down first.

331
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,860
Your heart rate and blood
pressure are too high.

332
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:56,470
Can you try and relax for me?

333
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,645
That's it.

334
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:00,082
Just take nice,
deep, slow breaths.

335
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,692
That's it.
- OK.

336
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:02,868
OK, Maggie, let's
get her more upright.

337
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,043
Yeah.

338
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:05,348
OK.

339
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,220
I'm gonna bring
you up now, Tessa.

340
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,699
There you go.

341
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,049
Tessa, on the count of three,

342
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,834
I want you to cough out
as hard as you can, OK?

343
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,880
One, two, three.

344
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:20,581
I can't be here!
I can't be here!

345
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,191
You're OK. You're safe, Tessa.

346
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,889
What's this? And what
are you giving me?

347
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,325
Just IV steroids to reduce
the swelling in your eyes.

348
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,500
Just stop.

349
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:27,980
- No, it's...
- Remove it now!

350
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,764
Tessa, it's to
restore your vision.

351
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:32,027
I don't want my vision restored!

352
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:33,289
I don't understand.

353
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,902
I did this to myself.
I don't wanna see!

354
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:40,557
Let me out! Just stop, please!

355
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,479
Tessa, I'm Dr. Charles.

356
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,567
I was, uh, hoping I could
get just a little more...

357
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:51,699
Let me guess.

358
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,310
You're a shrink.

359
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,442
In fact, I am.

360
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:56,835
Oh.

361
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,184
Happy day.

362
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:00,273
Not your first conversation
with a shrink...

363
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,274
- No.
- Is what I'm getting?

364
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,492
No.

365
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,842
My entire childhood,

366
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,975
I was dragged from one
psychiatrist to another,

367
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:10,326
medicated until I was a zombie,
long stays in the psych ward.

368
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,545
It was torture.

369
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:14,026
Well, I'm really
sorry to hear that.

370
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:16,898
Well, save your pity.

371
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,335
All that to say,
I know my rights.

372
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:20,859
OK.

373
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,425
You can't force treatment
on me against my will

374
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:23,600
without a court order.

375
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:25,733
Correct.

376
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:26,777
And the most you can do

377
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,083
is put me on a 72-hour hold

378
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:30,477
if you think I'm a
danger to myself.

379
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:32,174
Well, I mean,

380
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,654
do you think you're...
you're a danger to yourself?

381
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,482
No. I didn't drink the stuff.

382
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,528
I put it in an eyedropper,
so do the math.

383
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,182
I don't want to die.

384
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:42,750
I just don't want to see.

385
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,100
Why?

386
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,887
I don't have a clue.

387
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,018
But if you're gonna
put me on a hold,

388
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,238
please just do it now.

389
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,588
I really just wanted to talk.

390
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,982
Yeah, I'm done talking.

391
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,725
I learned so much shadowing
many of you last week.

392
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:03,075
It got me thinking

393
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,598
you all should have
the opportunity

394
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,513
to learn from each
other's cases,

395
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:10,125
so I'm instituting a
weekly ED case review.

396
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:12,606
I will choose a
recent case of note,

397
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:14,390
and we will discuss
how we arrived

398
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:16,915
at either a good or bad outcome.

399
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,134
What happened? What
did we get right?

400
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,396
What did we get wrong?

401
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:22,746
Any questions?

402
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,313
Are these mandatory?

403
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,620
They are an excellent
educational opportunity

404
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,927
that I hope everyone
will take advantage of.

405
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,103
But no, Doris, not mandatory.

406
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,934
I'd like us to look at
Elise Thompson's case today,

407
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,806
your maternal mortality
from last week.

408
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:42,070
Be prepared to present the
sequence of clinical events.

409
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,202
OK?

410
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,203
Mm-hmm.

411
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:46,770
I confirmed with Mirabelle

412
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,903
that no one from
housekeeping broke the frame.

413
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:51,166
As a precaution, we'll
change your locks

414
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,952
and install cameras inside
and outside your office.

415
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,128
OK, we're also gonna
need additional security

416
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,694
for the donor gala tonight.

417
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,783
Unfortunately, it's gonna
be impossible to get people

418
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,482
this close to the event.

419
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,484
Sharon...

420
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:05,920
Look, if you're concerned
about the hospital's

421
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:08,836
potential liability,
I'll sign a release, OK?

422
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:11,882
I was more concerned
about your safety.

423
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:16,976
I'm sorry.

424
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,456
Look, if the roles
were reversed...

425
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,241
I would ask you to stay home.

426
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,852
I know.

427
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,201
Look, I'll...

428
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:29,378
I'll ask Daniel to accept
the award on my behalf.

429
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,554
OK.

430
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:33,992
Hey.

431
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,645
Laura Finley's labs just posted.

432
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:36,908
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

433
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,563
I'm not seeing
anything concerning.

434
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,174
Mm.

435
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:43,784
Did you get the info on her
previous primary care doctor?

436
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:44,698
I wanna see what
they had her on.

437
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,047
Well, I asked her dad,

438
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,483
but he couldn't remember
the doctor's name.

439
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,137
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:51,313
Mr. Finley was able to tell me
Laura's medications and doses,

441
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,315
so I made a note in the chart.

442
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:54,882
Off the top of his head?

443
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,057
Mm-hmm.

444
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,537
That's pretty
impressive for a guy

445
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,452
who isn't good with details.

446
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:02,150
And I thought she hasn't
had an appetite for days.

447
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:04,152
Do me a favor,
Doris, and hold off

448
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:06,328
on uploading Laura's labs
to the patient portal.

449
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,808
If her dad asks...

450
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,331
I'll let him know that we're
waiting on the results.

451
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,159
Yeah.

452
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,032
This ain't my first rodeo, kid.

453
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,295
Noted.

454
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:20,212
So I didn't get much
out of her at all.

455
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:21,648
But if I were to guess,

456
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:24,042
I would say that she was
suffering from some form

457
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,045
of body integrity
identity disorder.

458
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,048
Isn't that people who want to
have a healthy limb amputated

459
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,745
or be paralyzed?

460
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:33,747
Those are the more common cases,

461
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,357
but there have been
reports in the literature

462
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:39,796
of people who, you know, wanna
be blind or visually impaired.

463
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:42,886
This condition is
excruciating to live with,

464
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,801
leading some
sufferers, you know,

465
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,847
to take drastic
action, as you can see.

466
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,109
If I don't operate soon,

467
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,198
Tessa can lose more
than just her eyesight.

468
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,766
If she develops
orbital cellulitis

469
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,247
and it travels to her
brain via the optic nerve,

470
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:58,250
she can develop a
cavernous sinus thrombosis

471
00:17:58,251 --> 00:17:59,338
or meningitis.

472
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:01,602
This could kill her.

473
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,434
Hey.

474
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,305
Ah, there you go.
- Hey.

475
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:11,437
So, uh, to what do I...

476
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:13,308
- Hey.
- Owe this...

477
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,397
Have you spoken to Sean?

478
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:17,617
Sean? No. No, not
for a couple of days.

479
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,097
Why?

480
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,969
I had to let him go
from the rehab facility.

481
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,406
- What? What... what happened?
- Right.

482
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,191
Well, Sean and I, we have
very different philosophies

483
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,149
when it comes to
addiction treatment.

484
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,064
I mean, you've
seen that yourself.

485
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:34,373
So... so what, you let him go
over a difference of opinion?

486
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:36,114
Of course not.

487
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,551
Sean was becoming
combative with patients.

488
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,596
Combative? How so?

489
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:42,424
Uh, it's his way or the highway.

490
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:44,426
And that's not how I operate.

491
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,602
You know, my patients,
they don't need lectures.

492
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:48,300
They need understanding.

493
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,649
It'd be nice if you
could afford some

494
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,173
of that understanding
to Sean, but, uh...

495
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,131
Excuse me?

496
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,263
Ugh. Margo, he's an ex-con.

497
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,612
- Uh-huh.
- Do you get it? All right?

498
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,701
It's not easy finding work.

499
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,660
This could be
incredibly destabilizing

500
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,270
to him and his sobriety.

501
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,881
I get that this is a
very difficult situation

502
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:08,450
and I know how much
you care about Sean.

503
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,800
But that is...

504
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:11,801
it's wildly unfair.

505
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,281
I care about Sean, too,

506
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,804
but I'm not gonna be held
responsible for his sobriety.

507
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,197
I'm not holding you responsible.

508
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,286
I'm just asking you to
give him another chance.

509
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,374
Or...

510
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,247
is this gonna be
a problem for us?

511
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,683
Margo, you... you...

512
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:26,425
You fired my kid.

513
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,775
Did you not think this
would have an effect on me?

514
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,777
Frankly, I...

515
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,735
I wasn't thinking
about you at all, Dean.

516
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:44,486
You think she's faking her
symptoms at her dad's behest?

517
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:47,228
I doubt she's ever been
diagnosed with Crohn's.

518
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,275
But since there's no definitive
test, it's easy to fake.

519
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,667
OK, but why?

520
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,539
You thinking
Munchausen by proxy?

521
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,149
Dad's looking for attention?

522
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,544
I think it's the
medication he's after.

523
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:00,633
All right, look.

524
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:01,764
These are the drugs
that Adam claims

525
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:03,592
his daughter was prescribed.

526
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:04,985
This immunosuppressant alone,

527
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,422
4,000 a month without insurance.

528
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,641
It was just in the news, right?

529
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,033
After the price skyrocketed...

530
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,296
People started selling
it on the black market.

531
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,123
This is, um...

532
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:15,125
this is a pretty
bold accusation.

533
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,779
We're talking not
only insurance fraud,

534
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,216
but faking a kid's illness.

535
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,175
That's... that's
medical child abuse.

536
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,003
You know I gotta
loop in DCFS, right?

537
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:25,179
That's why I came to you.

538
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,268
All right? I need an
attending to sign off.

539
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,488
Look, I agree there are
a lot of red flags here,

540
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:32,708
but once DCFS get involved,
it's out of our hands.

541
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,275
It becomes their investigation.

542
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,842
Look, I wouldn't be
ringing the alarm

543
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,670
if I didn't smell smoke.

544
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:41,500
All right, I'll make the call.

545
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,287
- Jackie.
- Hmm?

546
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,768
You did such a great job
with the supply closet.

547
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,639
Uh, I wanted to see
if you wouldn't mind

548
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,598
tackling the Pyxis next?

549
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,164
The narcotics need
to be verified...

550
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:56,558
If me working in the ED is
gonna be a problem for you...

551
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,038
- It's not.
- OK.

552
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,431
Then why am I being
relegated to softball cases

553
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:00,997
and restocking purgatory?

554
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:02,521
Oh, no. I'm just trying
to ease you back in,

555
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,174
let you get a lay
of the land, and...

556
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:05,741
I've worked plenty
of shifts at the ED.

557
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,047
I know where things are.

558
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:08,614
But, Jackie, it's
your first day back.

559
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,137
I just...

560
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:11,617
I just need to make
sure that you're...

561
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,401
Stable?

562
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,316
No, ac... acclimated.

563
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:19,451
You know, so much of this job is

564
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:22,236
seeing people through the
worst day of their life.

565
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,107
After what I just went through,

566
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:27,285
I have never been better
equipped to do that.

567
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,332
But if you don't trust me
with the patients, say so.

568
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:44,563
At that point, Dr. Lenox
and I rushed Elise to the OR

569
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,173
for an exam under anesthesia.

570
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:49,132
My initial assumption was
bleeding due to uterine atony,

571
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,397
however, there was no blood
found in the vaginal vault.

572
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:55,138
We opened the abdomen
and discovered

573
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:58,403
a ruptured subcapsular
hematoma of the liver.

574
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:01,884
Elise quickly went into
DIC and couldn't coagulate.

575
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:05,584
She exsanguinated
and then coded.

576
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,326
Thank you, Dr. Asher.

577
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:12,547
So how did we get here,
to a sentinel event,

578
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:16,421
something we never want,
a maternal mortality?

579
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,988
Is there anything Dr. Asher
could have done differently

580
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:20,817
to affect the outcome?

581
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:26,082
Obviously, hindsight is 20/20,

582
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,433
so this is absolutely not
a judgment on Dr. Asher.

583
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:29,825
We can do without
the sugar coating.

584
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,306
We're all adults here.

585
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,439
If an abdominal ultrasound
had been ordered

586
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,572
prior to delivery, the hematoma
might have been discovered

587
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:38,704
before it ruptured.

588
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:41,489
Sure, that's quite, um...

589
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,361
possible, but there
was no indication

590
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,929
to order an abdominal
ultrasound prior to delivery.

591
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,627
Didn't Mrs. Thompson's
liver function test

592
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:49,671
come back elevated?

593
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,412
Barely elevated.

594
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,588
Uh, but it was in line
with what you'd expect

595
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:54,807
to see in pre-eclampsia.

596
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,548
She also complained
of abdominal pain

597
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:57,636
when she was admitted.

598
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:58,854
Her abdominal pain was mild

599
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:00,465
and her belly was
soft and non-tender.

600
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,510
I realize it wouldn't be
anyone's first suspicion...

601
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:03,990
Or their 50th suspicion.

602
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:06,645
Nobody thinks
subcapsular hematoma

603
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:11,040
from mildly elevated LFTs and
abdominal pain in pregnancy.

604
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,172
I thought it.

605
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:13,434
Oh, give me a break.

606
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,653
You don't know what
you're talking about.

607
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,045
Excuse me?

608
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,482
Yeah, now you're just
running your mouth.

609
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:21,094
OK. Wow, uh, I thought this
was an open discussion.

610
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,748
I didn't realize we'd be
subject to personal attacks

611
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:24,184
for merely expressing an
opposing point of view.

612
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:25,141
Oh, I'm not attacking
you. Believe me.

613
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,360
But if that's the case...

614
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:27,579
You'll know when
I'm attacking you.

615
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,884
I can find better ways
to occupy my time.

616
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:32,453
Why don't we, um, pick
this up next week?

617
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,281
Hopefully, everyone can brush up

618
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:36,371
on their discussion
etiquette before then.

619
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,333
Hey. What is up with you?

620
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:44,770
What are you talking about?

621
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:45,727
I don't need you to fight
my battles for me, OK?

622
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:47,381
OK. Yeah, OK.

623
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:49,775
Dr. Lenox?

624
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:52,517
I want to respond
to your question.

625
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:55,824
If I missed anything in regards
to Elise Thompson's care.

626
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,130
OK.

627
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:59,872
I think I made a fair point.

628
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,526
I've been thinking
about this a lot.

629
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,572
N-nonstop, actually.

630
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:09,011
Why didn't I order an abdominal
ultrasound post-delivery?

631
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,578
Because you're not a psychic.

632
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,101
Archer was right.

633
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:13,886
No doctor would have suspected
a subcapsular hematoma.

634
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,540
She was cold after
her C-section.

635
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,671
She was shivering.

636
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,630
Completely normal
after childbirth.

637
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,109
Or it's a sign of shock.

638
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,155
I understand you are
hell-bent on finding something

639
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:23,504
you did wrong here.

640
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,724
But if you want to assign blame,

641
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:27,334
it lands squarely on the doctor

642
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:30,293
who examined Elise at her
checkup two weeks prior.

643
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:33,471
If Elise had been correctly
diagnosed with pre-eclampsia

644
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,256
at that appointment, she would
have been induced immediately,

645
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,432
and the hematoma never
would have developed.

646
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,913
I agree that Elise died
because of negligence,

647
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,392
but it wasn't yours.

648
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:45,265
And I don't know why I'm
explaining any of this to you.

649
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,484
You're too smart a doctor

650
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,617
to actually think
this is your fault.

651
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,970
Hey, Dr. Frost.

652
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:56,276
How much longer on
those test results?

653
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:57,669
I'd really like
to get Laura home.

654
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,845
Uh, let me go and check
with the lab, all right?

655
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,499
Well, maybe you could just

656
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,978
call us when the
results come in.

657
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,763
Like I said, we...
we know what this is,

658
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,852
and we know what
medication she needs, so...

659
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:08,375
Right.

660
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,116
See, but, uh, I can't
write the prescription

661
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,683
until I get the
lab results, so...

662
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:14,947
OK, yeah. Then I
think we're gonna go.

663
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:16,339
Uh, Mr. Finley, hi.

664
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,341
I'm Dr. Ripley. I'm an
attending here at Med.

665
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:19,865
How do you know my name?

666
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:22,563
Dr. Frost asked me to consult
on your daughter's case.

667
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,086
She's having a Crohn's flare-up.

668
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:26,350
That doesn't take two
doctors to diagnose.

669
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:30,266
Laura, baby, it's
time to go. Come on.

670
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:32,051
You're actually
not free to leave.

671
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:33,531
Get your stuff
together. Let's go now.

672
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,575
OK.

673
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:38,492
Hey, look, don't do this, OK?

674
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:40,407
Please don't cause a scene
in front of your daughter.

675
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:41,756
- All right.
- Oh.

676
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:44,063
Hey, stop! Hey, stop
it! Let go of him!

677
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:45,325
Let go of him! Let go of him!

678
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:46,587
Stop.
- OK, I can...

679
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,633
I can explain. OK, it's not...

680
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:51,636
- No, Dad!
- Seizing.

681
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:52,462
- Seizure!
- Dad!

682
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,160
I need backup over here.

683
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,335
Get a pillow for his head!

684
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:56,510
Grab an IV setup,

685
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,077
two of Ativan, and
the glucometer.

686
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,514
Please! Please
help him! Please!

687
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:02,821
We are, Laura, OK? I promise.

688
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:04,127
It's all right.

689
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:13,614
He has something
called neurosarcoi...

690
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,747
Neurosarcoidosis?

691
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:18,577
He hasn't been able to
get his meds for months.

692
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:23,276
Do you know what he's on?

693
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,671
Same ones he told the nurse.

694
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:31,501
They're his meds, not mine.

695
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,373
Neurosarcoidosis and
Crohn's are treated

696
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,941
with overlapping medications.

697
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,812
Why did your dad
go off his meds?

698
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:40,032
Couldn't afford them anymore.

699
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,339
He lost his health insurance.

700
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,994
Dr. Ripley, Dr. Frost,
Madeline Gastern is here.

701
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,474
Who's that?

702
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:49,650
Uh, show her to the
consultation room.

703
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,347
Yeah.

704
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:53,263
Hang tight. We'll
be right back, OK?

705
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,353
Madeline's with DCFS.

706
00:26:57,354 --> 00:27:00,095
Just, uh, follow my
lead in there, OK?

707
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:02,794
Can we just tell her the truth?

708
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:06,101
That Adam was using his kid
to commit insurance fraud?

709
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:07,799
That he couldn't
afford his medications

710
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,452
and obviously was desperate.

711
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,890
Means won't necessarily
justify the ends with DCFS.

712
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:14,633
The less we say, the better.

713
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,376
Nancy, have you seen Jackie?

714
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:21,943
Uh, I think she said she
was going to the bathroom,

715
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,642
but it was a while ago.

716
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:30,125
I got so bad, I was causing
a lot of blood loss.

717
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:33,999
And, you know, as a nurse, I
knew how dangerous that was.

718
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,217
I knew it could...

719
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:36,828
I knew it could kill me.

720
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:38,177
But I couldn't stop

721
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:41,049
because it was the only
time I felt any relief.

722
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,009
Living just felt unbearable.

723
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,575
Tessa, I don't...

724
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:48,056
I don't presume to know how
any of this feels for you.

725
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:49,667
It feels a lot like that.

726
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,711
Yeah.

727
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,408
Unbearable.

728
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:56,151
I can't focus my attention
anywhere, on anything.

729
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:59,198
It's just this...

730
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:01,243
constant barrage.

731
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,549
It's all coming at me at once.

732
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,203
It's like a waking nightmare.

733
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:06,727
You know, when you experience
a visual overload like that

734
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:09,295
when your brain is taking
in more information

735
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:11,384
than it can handle, it
becomes overwhelmed.

736
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:14,474
And a very real, tangible,

737
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,911
physiological
response is triggered.

738
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:19,566
You know, there have been
some really promising

739
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,742
therapeutic breakthroughs
in the last few years,

740
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:24,919
like, uh, using, you
know, neurofeedback

741
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,921
and brain-computer interfaces.

742
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,314
And...
- No, I...

743
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,011
I can't give up the
relief that I finally feel

744
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:35,582
just on the off-chance
that a therapy might help.

745
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,453
It took me a really long time

746
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:39,455
to build up the
courage to do this.

747
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,761
And I don't wanna die, but...

748
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,764
You can't go back
to living like that.

749
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,548
No.

750
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:48,377
Well, I'm not a doctor,
so I can't tell you

751
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:50,640
what the odds are of
these therapies working

752
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,121
or if you're gonna feel the
relief you feel right now.

753
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:57,778
But what I can tell you is
that about 2 1/2 months ago,

754
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,519
oh, I...

755
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,652
I was ready to choose
relief over everything else.

756
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:04,219
But I woke up this morning

757
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,310
so grateful to the people in
my life who intervened and...

758
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:13,968
And didn't let me do
something I couldn't undo.

759
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:19,801
And I know that living
right now is so painful.

760
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:23,673
But I promise you it's
worth fighting for.

761
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,819
So what's up?

762
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,778
I threw you under
the bus. I... I...

763
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,344
What?

764
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:43,650
I said you're a new resident,
still learning the ropes,

765
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:47,001
and you confused DCFS
with case management.

766
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:51,484
Did it work or, like...

767
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,268
Like a charm.

768
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:56,010
And it especially
helped that, uh...

769
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:57,578
well, yeah.

770
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,928
What's this?

771
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:04,105
My daughter just loved
your show growing up.

772
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:06,194
Uh, Dr. Ripley said

773
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:07,717
you wouldn't mind
taking a picture?

774
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:10,111
Yeah. Of... of course.

775
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:11,678
Let's do it.
- He'd love to.

776
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,985
Jenny is gonna freak.

777
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,859
OK. On the count of three.

778
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,165
Say "Nick of Time."

779
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,384
One, two, three.

780
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:24,386
"Nick of Time"!

781
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,396
Can I help you?

782
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:39,184
Ms. Goodwin, hi.

783
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:40,881
You know my name.

784
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,274
What's yours?

785
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,971
My name is Fred Murray.

786
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,451
I work with the HVAC crew.

787
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:47,583
And what are you
doing in my office?

788
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:50,369
Well, I came through last
night to clean the vents

789
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,980
and, um...

790
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,200
Gosh, I'm real sorry.

791
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:58,725
I... I knocked over your
picture with one of my tools.

792
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,074
Oh.

793
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,815
Spent all day trying
to find the same frame.

794
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:03,773
I went to, like, ten
different stores.

795
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:06,951
I know it's not
exactly the same.

796
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:09,301
It's close enough.

797
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:11,259
Thank you, Mr. Murray.

798
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,015
Yes.

799
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,930
Mr. Thompson?

800
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:33,934
I'm Dr. Hannah Asher.
We spoke on the phone.

801
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,457
Oh, you're, uh...

802
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,459
you were Elise's doctor.

803
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,461
Again, I can't begin to express

804
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,115
how sorry I am for your loss.

805
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:42,987
Thank you.

806
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,598
I wish with all my heart that
I could have saved Elise.

807
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,471
I only knew her for
a short time, but...

808
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,777
Ah.

809
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,387
But she makes an
impression, doesn't she?

810
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,128
Yeah.

811
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:58,654
And you, you made an
impression on her, too.

812
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:02,832
When she called me after
Ruby here was born,

813
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:06,619
she said she wished you were
her OB the whole pregnancy.

814
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,318
That you were the first doctor
to really listen to her.

815
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,407
Oh. Oh, that's OK.

816
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:15,323
OK. Yeah, I got you.

817
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,411
I got you. I got you.

818
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:17,935
Yeah.

819
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,937
Yeah.

820
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,027
Do you wanna hold her?

821
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:24,811
Oh, yeah, I'd love that. Yeah.

822
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,552
Yeah? OK.

823
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:27,857
Here you go.

824
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:30,338
Hi, baby.

825
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,339
Yeah, it's OK.

826
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,473
Hi, Ruby. Oh, oh.

827
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:35,910
Hi, Ruby.

828
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:41,001
Hi, Ruby.

829
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:43,003
Oh, boy. Let me put you...

830
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:47,007
She's so beautiful.

831
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,443
Just like her mama.

832
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,890
So looks like, uh,

833
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:03,763
Tessa's gonna let us
call her ex-boyfriend.

834
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:06,070
- That's a good sign, right?
- I think so.

835
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,245
Apparently, he broke up with her

836
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:09,160
over her refusal to get help.

837
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,031
And she cut her
family off years ago.

838
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:14,643
And I guess ultimately,
he just couldn't handle

839
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:16,080
feeling like he was the only one

840
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,516
responsible for her well-being.

841
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:19,909
If Tessa is willing
to reach out to him,

842
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,043
maybe it's a sign that
she's ready to get help.

843
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,871
That's my hope.

844
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,003
Yeah.

845
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,656
Listen, Mags, I just...

846
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:30,181
I just can't help wondering

847
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:32,531
wouldn't Jackie be of more use

848
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:33,880
if she was just
back on the floor

849
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:36,056
instead of stuck in
some supply closet?

850
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:38,841
It's not that I don't
trust Jackie with patients.

851
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:41,061
I think she's an
excellent nurse.

852
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:45,065
I just don't want anything to
throw her off and trigger her.

853
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,285
Maybe I feel...

854
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:49,200
feel responsible for her.

855
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:52,464
Jackie had to be cleared by
a whole team of psychiatrists

856
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,248
to come back to
work, and they knew

857
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:55,728
she would be returning
to an environment

858
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,252
where she was gonna
encounter trauma, right?

859
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:01,560
Emotional, physical
on a daily basis.

860
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:04,041
They clearly felt she was ready.

861
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,044
And I gotta tell you
based on my experience

862
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,394
of Jackie back at work today,

863
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,526
I have to agree.

864
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:14,442
So, uh, I don't know.

865
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:15,922
Think about it?

866
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:27,890
I asked someone from our
case management department

867
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:29,849
to come meet with you.

868
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,634
And they are going to
go over your options

869
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:36,769
and help you enroll in a local
medication assistance program.

870
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,945
In the meantime,
we'll send you home

871
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:40,729
with a month's supply of
everything that you need

872
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,558
to help get through the gap.

873
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,473
On the house, so to speak.

874
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,176
Yeah, sorry. It's just, uh...

875
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,961
It's... it's been so hard

876
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:57,485
trying to navigate this
after I lost my job.

877
00:34:57,486 --> 00:35:00,271
I probably spent over
50 hours on the phone.

878
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:03,143
Sent hundreds of emails,

879
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,450
you know, filled out one
application after another.

880
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:10,455
So when you tell me
you're gonna help...

881
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,852
Thank you.

882
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:24,164
- Dr. Lenox, hey. Hi.
- Hi.

883
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,167
Uh, any chance you can spare
Dr. Asher on the night shift?

884
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,864
Does Dr. Asher want that?

885
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,823
Who wants to work
the night shift?

886
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:31,998
Dr. Asher.

887
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:34,609
Wait, what?

888
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,612
She requested it.

889
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:41,965
Hey, man.

890
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,055
I-I really jumped the gun today.

891
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,535
Eh, you were right.

892
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:48,884
There was something
fishy going on.

893
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:51,887
Yeah, but I could have
saved everyone some grief

894
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:55,326
had I dug a little deeper
and not rushed to judgment.

895
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:56,718
I have a hard time giving people

896
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,329
the benefit of the
doubt, sometimes.

897
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,505
Parents especially.

898
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:03,029
Mm. Maybe, uh...

899
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,987
maybe a little projection
going on there?

900
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:06,859
Yeah, maybe.

901
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,948
Card-carrying member of the
Crappy Parents Club myself,

902
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,210
if it's any consolation.

903
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,516
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

904
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,082
What'd they do?

905
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,041
Just your run-of-the-mill
abandonment.

906
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,521
Yours?

907
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,349
They managed...

908
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,482
mismanaged my career.

909
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:23,092
Stole a lot of money from me.

910
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:25,530
I worked basically
my entire childhood,

911
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:29,055
and I have nothing
to show for it.

912
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,320
In fact, I'm very much drowning
in med school debt, so...

913
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:36,671
Oh, man. I'm... I'm sorry.

914
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,499
Hey, I'm not so hard up

915
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,154
I can't buy you a beer
for saving my ass today.

916
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,246
Another time.

917
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,509
Sure thing.

918
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:51,556
Hey.

919
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,300
Hey.

920
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:57,388
Hey, why haven't you responded

921
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:58,519
to any of my messages?

922
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,738
What?

923
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:02,828
Yeah, I left, like, 100 texts.

924
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,178
You're not
exaggerating. Sorry.

925
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:07,921
I've been listening to a
book on tape while I pack.

926
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:10,576
Pack?

927
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:19,627
All right.

928
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,586
I think you're being,

929
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:24,197
you know, a little
premature here.

930
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:26,591
I think if you just

931
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,070
sit down with Margo,

932
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:30,464
you apologize, you can
get your old job back.

933
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,553
I don't want my job back.
She was right to let me go.

934
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:33,902
All right, fine.

935
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,948
Then I'll... I'll meet with
the head of valet at Med

936
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,689
and we'll see if your
old job is available.

937
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,125
That's not necessary.

938
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:41,171
- Come on!
- Dad.

939
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm gonna be OK.

940
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,616
Yeah, I just don't wanna
see anything derail you.

941
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:53,444
You have come so far.

942
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:56,447
This is not gonna derail me.

943
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:59,667
I'm actually...

944
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:03,149
I'm actually looking
forward to a fresh start.

945
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,325
I'm gonna go down
to Florida for a bit

946
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:06,674
and stay with Mom.

947
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:12,332
Sorry, no, no, this... this...

948
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,466
This is me trying not to
have a knee-jerk response

949
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:18,077
to you going to live
with your mother.

950
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,470
How am I doing?

951
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,124
- Admirably.
- Mm.

952
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,648
Don't go, Son.

953
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:26,041
I'm not leaving today.

954
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,826
And actually,

955
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:29,001
if you could take the time off,

956
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:31,699
I was hoping that
maybe you'd want to...

957
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,440
drive down with me?

958
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:38,533
A little Archer
father-son road trip?

959
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,579
I wouldn't miss it.

960
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,413
Oh, Daniel.

961
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:50,718
Daniel, wait up.

962
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,198
I can't run in these high heels.

963
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,895
I thought I was
flying solo tonight.

964
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,375
Uh, change of plans.

965
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:56,550
Everything OK?

966
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,596
Better than OK. I'll
tell you in the car.

967
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:00,511
I'll ride with you?

968
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:03,209
Arm candy, chauffeur?

969
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,472
Damn, I'm a Renaissance man.

970
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,692
- Let's go.
- OK.

971
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:13,611
Hospital food for dinner
your first night back?

972
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:15,047
Way too soon.

973
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,614
You gotta work your
way back up to that.

974
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,398
I know. I'm
regretting it already.

975
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,921
But, you know,

976
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,793
the hubs and the
kid, they're, uh...

977
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:23,577
they're out of town.
They're visiting Carl's mom.

978
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:26,406
I didn't wanna cook for one.

979
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,887
I am so beat.

980
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:30,628
I forgot how much
it wears you out

981
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,978
being on your feet
all day like that.

982
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:36,068
Well, rest up. You've
got a big day tomorrow.

983
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,199
Check the board.

984
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,419
You're on trauma
service with Dr. Archer.

985
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,725
Good night.

986
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:42,422
Good night.

987
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:48,210
Hey. What are you
still doing here?

988
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:49,429
It's almost midnight.

989
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,083
I, uh...

990
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:54,129
I had a sudden urge to
work the night shift.

991
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,871
I hope that's OK.

992
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:00,222
Company will be nice.

993
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:01,789
I was about to, uh,

994
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,749
forage the vending machine
for some sustenance.

995
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,577
You wanna join?
- Absolutely.

996
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:14,759
So you're just gonna work
yourself into the ground?

997
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,763
You run, I work.

998
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:21,940
So that's your coping mechanism?

999
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:25,291
That and daily NA meetings.

1000
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:29,121
Been going every
morning before work.

1001
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,253
Did you...

1002
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:33,255
It's the first time
in almost four years

1003
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:36,215
that I thought about it.

1004
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:40,262
I thought about using.

1005
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:43,831
But I didn't.

1006
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,147
I know I haven't...

1007
00:40:55,148 --> 00:41:00,239
proven myself to be
very reliable, but...

1008
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,720
I really wanna be someone
you can lean on, Hannah.

1009
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:11,163
Way to be literal.
