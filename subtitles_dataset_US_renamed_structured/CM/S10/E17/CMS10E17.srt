1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,788
<i>I was not a typical teenager.</i>

2
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,312
<i>That doesn't make it
OK for a grown woman</i>

3
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,748
to start a relationship
with a minor.

4
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:12,489
I'm not a victim here.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,839
<i>You wouldn't even be here
now if it wasn't for me,</i>

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,971
<i>for what we had.</i>

7
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:17,146
You loved me.

8
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:19,802
I <i>did</i> love you.

9
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:21,759
<i>Today was a particularly
stressful day.</i>

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,978
It's not just today.

11
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,849
My nurses are regularly
missing breaks

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,722
and being asked to perform
duties that are outside

13
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,680
of our job description.

14
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,987
After I got sober, it
took my family a while

15
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,336
to trust me again, but they did.

16
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:35,382
Except my sister, Lizzie.

17
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:36,731
I got your message.

18
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:40,040
<i>And I was hoping we could talk?</i>

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,395

31
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,619
You're up early.

32
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,663
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

33
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,012
So how's Florida treating you?

34
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,884
Not... not good, I expect.

35
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:46,627
<i>Um, something's happened.</i>

36
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:47,976
Are you OK?

37
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:49,412
<i>I'm fine.</i>

38
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:51,414
<i>But I'm at the hospital.</i>

39
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:53,068
Why are you at the hospital?

40
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:55,158
The ambulance brought Mom here.

41
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,118
<i>She went on a bender,</i>

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,511
<i>tripped, and...</i>

43
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,645
<i>hit her head on the
kitchen counter.</i>

44
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,168
It caused a brain bleed.

45
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,649
Subdural or... or epidural?

46
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,129
Uh... never mind.

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,131
Just... just, uh, put me on
the phone with her doctor.

48
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,134
She's gone, Dad.

49
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:19,399
Uh... uh... uh...

50
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:32,238
I'm so sorry, Son.

51
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,675
Um...

52
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,459
<i>I will...</i>

53
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,159
<i>catch the next flight
down and, uh...</i>

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,422
I'll help you figure
everything out.

55
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:44,815
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

56
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:48,777
Mom didn't want a funeral and
she wanted to be cremated.

57
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,692
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry, I gotta go.

58
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,128
<i>They need me for something.</i>

59
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,870
Yeah, of course. All right.

60
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,796
Shoot, uh...

61
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,562
Oh, who's that handsome devil?

62
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:37,738
I assume that's a
rhetorical question,

63
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,870
since I obviously
haven't aged a day.

64
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,873
Is that Leanne?

65
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,310
In happier times, yeah.

66
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,225
Yeah, you said she'd
been struggling.

67
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,270
Is she doing better now?

68
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:49,880
Uh...

69
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,447
far as I know.

70
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:52,796
Oh, that's good to hear.

71
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,929
Look, I... I have a
favor to ask, Dean.

72
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,584
I need you to run the
ED today as chief.

73
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,977
Uh, you finally came to your
senses and demoted Lenox?

74
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,022
Huh?
- No... no.

75
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,719
She's taking a personal day.

76
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,504
Oh. Lenox and
personal are two words

77
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:05,766
I never thought I'd
hear the same sentence.

78
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:06,636
Be nice.

79
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:08,290
I'd be happy to fill in.

80
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,509
Thank you. Warning.

81
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,597
You're going to be short-staffed

82
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,425
without Lenox and Ripley.

83
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,644
That's what makes
it fun, Sharon.

84
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:19,867
Hey, I hear you're
back in charge today.

85
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,869
Mm. Head's already
heavy with the crown.

86
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,088
Stop. You love the crown.

87
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,220
Even a temporary one.

88
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,656
Mm. Oh, boy.

89
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,005
Someone's chipper today.
- Mm.

90
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:31,226
You and Ripley giving
it another go, are you?

91
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,575
Guess that's a no.

92
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,317
I <i>am</i> chipper today.

93
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,927
- Mm.
- Lizzie came over last night.

94
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,321
We went hard at
her baby registry,

95
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:42,193
and there might have
been some baking.

96
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:43,760
- Mm.
- It was really nice.

97
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:46,154
Ah, sounds like you
got your sister back.

98
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:48,287
Yeah.

99
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,114
I think so.

100
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:52,813
Best not let the past fester.

101
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:54,945
What's wrong?

102
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,599
What? Just...

103
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,340
just being my curmudgeonly self.

104
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,863
- Don't do that.
- Don't do <i>what?</i>

105
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,343
Just pretend that
everything's OK

106
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,344
when clearly it's not.

107
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,345
I don't have time
for this today.

108
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:04,781
Oh, fine. I... I... I...

109
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,087
Fine.

110
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:08,176
What?

111
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:09,743
Good timing, Chief.

112
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:12,049
We got a kid with cardiac issues

113
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,529
pulling into the ambo bay.

114
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,053
All right. What's, uh...
what's with all the new faces?

115
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,099
Oh, traveling nurses.

116
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,362
Lenox came through with my
request for reinforcements.

117
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,407
Excellent.

118
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:22,756
It's not a real solution.

119
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,105
They don't know our system.

120
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,063
A lot of time is wasted
just playing catch-up.

121
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:29,371
Well, can they draw
blood and empty bedpans?

122
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:30,981
Wow.

123
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:34,333
We do a lot more than
that, Dr. Archer.

124
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:38,815
You're going to trauma one.

125
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,340
Milo Perdera, 12-year-old male.

126
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,126
BP's 190 over 110,
heart rate 144.

127
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:47,781
Developed severe chest pains
while swimming at the Y.

128
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:50,697
My heart's beating so fast.

129
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,525
Get that off him.
Get transferred.

130
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:53,656
- It'll be OK, Milo.
- On my count.

131
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:54,875
Just got to stay calm.

132
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,920
One, two, three.

133
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,139
All right.

134
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,403
I'm going to lift this up, OK?

135
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:02,535
Is that heart surgery?

136
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,580
Transplant. Six months ago.

137
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,974
His EKG.
- All right.

138
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,802
I know what's wrong.
Tell them, Dad.

139
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,456
Just focus on your
breathing, Milo.

140
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,109
Let the doctors do their work.

141
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,328
All right. Lungs are clear,

142
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,678
but with labored
breathing and tachycardia.

143
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,637
Has this ever happened before?
- No.

144
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:19,987
This is Milo's first time in
the pool since the surgery.

145
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,162
Did you call Mom?

146
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,642
She just texted me back, Bud.

147
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:24,078
She's on her way now.

148
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,428
We recently separated.

149
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:29,388
BP's 202 over 120.

150
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,737
Take some slow, deep breaths.

151
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:31,738
OK?

152
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:36,220
Uh, this blood pressure could
put his new heart into failure.

153
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:39,049
We'll treat that, but I'm also
going to need to sedate him.

154
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,703
Is his body rejecting his heart?

155
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,009
- He's still within...
- Dad.

156
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,880
The time frame where
that's a possibility.

157
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,143
Hypertension isn't a
symptom of rejection.

158
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:47,841
But let's not jump
to any conclusions.

159
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,190
I'm going to run some tests.

160
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,583
Let's start an esmolol drip.

161
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,541
Let's get a transthoracic echo

162
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,369
and give him some
Ativan for his anxiety.

163
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,979
Why won't you listen to me?

164
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,199
I know what's wrong.

165
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,461
It doesn't want me.

166
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,898
What? What doesn't want you?

167
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,334
The heart.

168
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:06,294
It told me it wants
out of my body.

169
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:18,959
So Milo says his new
heart doesn't want him.

170
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,395
So he says, yeah.

171
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,745
I wonder if it's how he's
emotionally processing

172
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,486
his physical distress?

173
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,662
I mean, could he actually
be rejecting the heart?

174
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:29,012
Not likely. His echo
came back normal.

175
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:30,840
But his hypertension
is very real,

176
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,973
and a threat to his
heart long-term.

177
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,236
What anti-rejection
meds is he taking?

178
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:37,499
- Prednisone.
- Oh.

179
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,241
Well-known psychological
side effects there.

180
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:43,331
Uh, I... I'm happy to
have a chat with him.

181
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,594
Great.

182
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:49,119
Uh, what's, uh...

183
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,646
Why are the screens frozen?

184
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:55,169
EMR software is down.

185
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,344
Yeah, did you call IT?

186
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,998
Yeah. I'm on hold, honey.

187
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,303
There was a server
update last night,

188
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:01,001
now the whole
system's gone haywire.

189
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,872
Yeah, I'm still here.

190
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:03,917
Three hours.

191
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,962
OK.
- No, no, no. Come here.

192
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:07,268
Yeah.

193
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:08,487
Yeah, We don't have
three hours, Leonard.

194
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,532
We need these fixed
in ten minutes flat.

195
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:11,707
Unacceptable.

196
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,448
The emergency department
takes precedence.

197
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,146
It's... it's...
literally in the name.

198
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:19,193
Deal. <i>If</i> you come through.

199
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:21,412
IT is like an insurance company.

200
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,719
You never accept the first no.

201
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,374
What did you promise
him, Dr. Asher?

202
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,680
Archer.

203
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,159
Wait, you have a Dr. Asher

204
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,118
and Archer in the
same department?

205
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,469
Must be terribly confusing.

206
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,992
Where's my dad?

207
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:38,299
Outside waiting for your mom.

208
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,953
Milo, I'm Dr. Charles.

209
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,476
Um...

210
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,826
Dr. Archer was hoping that
we could have a little chat.

211
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,132
Would that be OK with you?

212
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,481
I guess.

213
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,962
Um, so...

214
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:51,355
he was telling me that your...

215
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,793
your new heart has
been talking to you.

216
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:56,839
Well, she talks to
me through her heart.

217
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,929
<i>Her</i> heart? Your
donor's, you mean?

218
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,930
Yeah.

219
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:01,975
Huh.

220
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,630
So you know who she was?

221
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,806
Who she is?

222
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,285
No.

223
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:10,636
I... I don't know her name.

224
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,376
OK. Well, I... I guess
I'm just curious.

225
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:15,249
How did you know that
your donor was a she?

226
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,121
I don't know.

227
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:19,166
I just know.

228
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:23,518
She doesn't want me to
have her heart anymore.

229
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,652
So when did she
start talking to you?

230
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,175
Today.

231
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:30,090
When I was swimming.

232
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,222
That's when my heart
started racing.

233
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,137
I couldn't breathe.

234
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:36,792
But I could feel

235
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:40,100
her anger.

236
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:43,364
I wonder why she'd
be angry at you.

237
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:46,976
Because I'm still
alive and she isn't.

238
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,151
OK.

239
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:57,683
"Nowadays most people die of a
sort of creeping common sense

240
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,989
"and discover when
it is too late

241
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,646
that the only things one never
regrets are one's mistakes."

242
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,648
Do you agree with Oscar Wilde?

243
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,824
I think it's an
interesting point.

244
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,478
Hey, uh...

245
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:14,177
does Dr. Lenox personally know
the patient in treatment five?

246
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,658
No, but she did her
intake last night.

247
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:20,009
The patient ingested
tetrodotoxin from a pufferfish.

248
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,795
She arrested in the ambulance,
arrived hypotensive,

249
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,710
and now she's in
fulminant liver failure.

250
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:28,104
Did she tried neostigmine
or monoclonal antibody?

251
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,584
They tried everything.

252
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:32,587
It's tragic, but Lenox
sees tragic on the regular.

253
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:35,677
Why'd she decide to read
to this particular patient?

254
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,723
All I know is that
Lenox went in there

255
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,855
last night after her shift
ended and she hasn't come out.

256
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,901
Mm.

257
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,250
Hey, do you want me

258
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,643
to take the Milo Perdera
case off your hands?

259
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,297
No, I'm gonna see it through.

260
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,386
All right.

261
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,302
Boomshakalaka!

262
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:54,565
Back online with two
minutes to spare.

263
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,219
Time to collect my reward.

264
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,091
Actually two minutes
late, Leonard.

265
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,223
But, uh, nice try.

266
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,921
Don't worry. I'm
still good for it.

267
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,662
Just come back at the
end of your shift.

268
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,011
Thanks, Dr. A.

269
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,403
Not as bad as everyone says.

270
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,753
Really? What do they say?

271
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:09,015
Grump, grouch.

272
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,277
"Pissy little bitch,"
gets tossed around.

273
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:11,365
Thank you, Leonard.

274
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,846
I just want to clear the air.

275
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:16,370
It's already forgotten.

276
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,024
It's not about me.

277
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,330
It's about work.
Trying to tell you.

278
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:21,767
Please, can we just
leave it in the past?

279
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,247
- Jonathan.
- No, I'm... we're good.

280
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:26,119
We're good.

281
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,775
Don't ask.

282
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:30,906
Don't worry.

283
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,474
Please can somebody
help my wife?

284
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:34,431
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got this, Wendy.

285
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:35,606
Hold it right there.

286
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:36,564
You're going to treatment three.

287
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:37,739
All right. What happened?

288
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,958
- She shocked herself.
- No, I'm fine.

289
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,394
We threw a breaker

290
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:41,961
and I got a tiny jolt when
I reset it in the garage.

291
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,049
This is all my fault.

292
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,311
And my husband,
he's overreacting.

293
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:45,486
Look, this is our first.

294
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,053
I should have had an electrician

295
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,489
rewire the house
before we moved in.

296
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,490
How far along are you?

297
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,100
- I'm 18 weeks.
- 18 weeks.

298
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:52,972
All right, well, your husband
was right to bring you in.

299
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,293
- I hate to say I told you so.
- I'll never live this down.

300
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:58,499
- Where does it hurt?
- My stomach.

301
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,543
Has this happened before?

302
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:00,936
- First time.
- No.

303
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:03,286
Maggie, will you page
Hannah, have her meet me?

304
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,331
- All right.
- Come on. Let's go in here.

305
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,550
Come on.

306
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,599
Laura, what's your
pain level now?

307
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,470
Mm, maybe a five.

308
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:14,907
OK, that's good, but
we could do better.

309
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:15,951
Another four of morphine?

310
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,127
Yeah, that should work.

311
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,347
Is the pain from being shocked?

312
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:21,827
Possibly.

313
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,785
The uterus is an
excellent conductor,

314
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,309
so even a small electric shock

315
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,355
could put significant
stress on the baby.

316
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,660
So it did hurt the baby?

317
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:30,836
Your baby looks just fine.

318
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:33,664
Maybe a little agitated, though.

319
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,848
Did you have a 12-week
checkup with your OB/GYN?

320
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,154
Yeah. Dr. Fisher did
a full ultrasound.

321
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:48,027
OK, I will give him a call,
let him know that you're here,

322
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:50,159
and ask to see those images.

323
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,161
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

324
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,252
I don't know how

325
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:59,603
her OB/GYN missed a mass
that big on her ovary.

326
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,909
I know.

327
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,913
I'll, uh. get the 12-week
ultrasound images.

328
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:09,265
The CEA and CA-125 tumor
markers in the meantime.

329
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,833
"Ah, Dorian, how happy you are.

330
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,793
"What an exquisite
life you have had.

331
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,317
"You have drunk
deeply of everything.

332
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:20,189
"You have crushed the
grapes against your palate.

333
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,757
"Nothing has been
hidden from you.

334
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:26,369
And"...
- Dr. Lenox?

335
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,981
Yes, Astrid?

336
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,245
Why are you here with me?

337
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:35,510
Shouldn't you be out
there saving lives?

338
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:39,296
I don't think you
should be alone.

339
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,168
Certainly I'm not your first

340
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,954
terminal patient with no family.

341
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:48,828
Why me?

342
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,441
I don't know.

343
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:58,314
Are you happy with
the life you lived?

344
00:13:58,315 --> 00:13:59,881
Oh.

345
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,842
Let's not waste time
talking about me.

346
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,324
I'm about to die.

347
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,112
What else are we
going to talk about?

348
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,726
You took him to the pool
without checking with me first?

349
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,075
Why would I?

350
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:21,511
His cardiologist said it
would be good for him.

351
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:22,599
Why would I?

352
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Because I'm his mother!

353
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:24,775
Barely.

354
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,560
When's the last
time you sat down

355
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:27,996
and ate a meal with our son?

356
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:28,954
Please stop fighting.

357
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:30,085
Yeah, please calm down.

358
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:35,090
All right, he's tachycardic,
hypertensive again.

359
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,222
What does that mean?

360
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,963
It means his heart's
beating too fast

361
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:41,618
and his blood pressure
is out of control.

362
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,185
All right, let's
increase his esmolol drip

363
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:44,883
and throw in nitroprusside.

364
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,188
You got it.

365
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:47,798
Gonna need you to take
some slow, deep breaths.

366
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,278
Can you do that for me?

367
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,498
My heart doesn't want me.
She's going to kill me!

368
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,630
All right. Doris, let's push
40 milligrams of ketamine.

369
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,675
I'm going to give you something

370
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:55,589
to calm your heart
down, all right?

371
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,547
- OK, OK.
- OK?

372
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,462
OK, count backward from 100.

373
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,463
Ketamine's on board.

374
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:01,508
100...

375
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,205
99...

376
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:04,815
9-98.

377
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,382
Oh, he's out.

378
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:09,472
What the hell is
going on with my son?

379
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:13,172
I think Milo's issues
might be psychological.

380
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:14,347
Why?

381
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,739
He thinks the heart
doesn't want him,

382
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,264
that the donor is speaking
to him through the heart.

383
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:21,658
How could you not tell me that?

384
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,139
Well, Jessie, when you
work 70 hours a week,

385
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,445
you're bound to miss something.

386
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,750
Enough! Enough.

387
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,796
I get that you two are
having marital issues,

388
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,058
but your son is sick.

389
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,886
You've got one
responsibility right now,

390
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,453
and that's to make
this kid feel safe!

391
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,367
You have no right!

392
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,716
Oh, please, just suck it up.

393
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,979
Dr. Archer, could I get
a quick word, please?

394
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,332
They are killing that kid.

395
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,333
Very possibly.

396
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,682
But you know, in my experience,

397
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,467
inside voice tends to be
a little more effective

398
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,904
when you're trying to impart
that kind of information.

399
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,253
Sure, sure, sure,
but I tell you,

400
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:53,212
it's very clear to me
that Milo's panic attacks

401
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,866
are being caused by his
parents' separation.

402
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:56,998
Look, I don't disagree.

403
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,479
But I think situation also

404
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,134
might have gotten a little
more complicated than that.

405
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:04,005
Yeah? Complicated how?

406
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,181
You ever heard of
cellular memory

407
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:08,183
in post-surgical
organ transplants?

408
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,577
Supposedly, transplanted
organs retain

409
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:11,970
the memory of the donors,

410
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,972
which the recipients
then experience, yeah.

411
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,235
Right. Evidence is
mostly anecdotal,

412
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:18,846
but there, you know, a
couple documented cases.

413
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:19,934
Yeah, yeah.

414
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,414
It sounds a little
magical to me.

415
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,372
You actually believe that's
what's happening to Milo?

416
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,852
I don't know. Point
is, he believes it.

417
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,681
So kind of got to meet him
where he lives, you know?

418
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,378
Yeah.

419
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,163
So what? We should just go
along with his delusion?

420
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:32,164
Uh, I don't know.

421
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:33,469
I can't help thinking that

422
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,863
if he were to learn
something about his donor,

423
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:39,084
it would just demystify the
situation for him, you know?

424
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,737
Dissipate his fear.
- So what?

425
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:44,176
You're suggesting that we
reach out to the donor family

426
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,004
and have them meet Milo?

427
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,483
If both sides were
open to it, yeah.

428
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,964
I mean, donor families
and recipients

429
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:53,141
are absolutely allowed to meet
if everyone's on the same page.

430
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,578
Your OB/GYN took
this ultrasound image

431
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,493
when you were 12 weeks pregnant.

432
00:16:57,494 --> 00:17:01,236
Here you can see a small mass
growing on your right ovary.

433
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,846
I know. It's a cyst.

434
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:05,066
Dr. Fisher said it was
nothing to worry about.

435
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,633
It's not a cyst.

436
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:09,331
Unfortunately, on
today's ultrasound image,

437
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,638
the mass has doubled in size

438
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,162
and increased significantly
in vascularity.

439
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,339
OK, so what does that mean?

440
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,994
I have cancer.

441
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:22,519
Your tumor markers
would signify that, yes.

442
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,262
OK.

443
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:30,831
What do I do to ensure I
deliver my baby safely?

444
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:33,442
Your best and first option

445
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:36,054
would be removing
the cyst surgically.

446
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,707
But isn't that a
risk for our baby?

447
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,882
As with any surgery,

448
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,232
there's always a
certain degree of risk.

449
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,234
But the second trimester

450
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:45,237
is actually the safest time
to perform this procedure.

451
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,239
I think we do it, Laurel.

452
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,719
And if I don't do the surgery,

453
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,027
can I still carry to term?

454
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,942
You could, yes.

455
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,641
But by then, the cancer will
likely have metastasized

456
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:01,731
and your chances of
survival would diminish.

457
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,733
Yeah, but there would
be less risk to my baby.

458
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:06,127
Well, technically, yes,
that's correct, but...

459
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,215
Yeah, that's what I want to do.

460
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:08,477
Laurel, uh...

461
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,610
I would strongly
suggest reconsidering.

462
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,133
No, my mind is made up.

463
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,830
Yeah, that's an incredibly
stupid decision.

464
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,049
Dr. Archer.

465
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,181
You think you're
protecting your baby,

466
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:18,226
but the risk of the
surgery harming her

467
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,923
is significantly lower

468
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:22,578
than the cancer killing
you if left untreated.

469
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,580
So bottom line, you
skip the surgery,

470
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:27,148
that baby grows up
without a mother.

471
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,759
It's up to you.

472
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,544
I'll be right back.

473
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,287
Hey.

474
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,940
What the hell was that?

475
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,465
I'm just cutting through the
mental gymnastics, that's all.

476
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,988
She doesn't need
tough love, Dean.

477
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,685
She needs empathy and direction.

478
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:45,862
No, what she needs is to
live another 18 years.

479
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,778
I'd think that you, of all
people, would get that.

480
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,695
Oh, cool.

481
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:55,872
You're going to play
my dead mom card on me?

482
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,309
Of course I get it.

483
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,701
But whatever choice they make,

484
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,399
we have to respect
their decision.

485
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,270
And it's a bad decision.

486
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,098
I mean, people will
justify any excuse

487
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,535
to avoid what's hard and scary,

488
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,711
but somebody's got to step in
and save them from themselves.

489
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,887
Oh, well, thank God you're
here to save us all.

490
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,150
Sorry to interrupt,

491
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,891
but, uh, Laurel decided
to do the surgery.

492
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,176
Damn it.

493
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,923
Unfortunately, I
have some bad news.

494
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:49,274
The mother of Milo's donor

495
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:53,539
opted out of any contact with
him before the transplant.

496
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,323
So we know nothing
about the donor?

497
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:56,890
No name, no address?

498
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,413
Their records are sealed.

499
00:19:58,414 --> 00:19:59,719
The only information I got

500
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,112
from Organ Donors of America

501
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,680
is that the heart came
from a 14-year-old girl.

502
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:06,378
A girl?

503
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:07,683
Lucky guess for Milo.

504
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:09,816
All right, so worth a shot.

505
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:13,123
Um, we're going to pivot
to traditional therapy

506
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,560
and, uh...

507
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:15,822
Have a chat with Mom and Dad

508
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,215
about toning it down
in front of their kid.

509
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,912
I mean, give me a break.

510
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:20,348
Yeah, I have zero
faith that those two

511
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:23,046
will ever see clearly
through their own anger,

512
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:24,744
let alone do right
by their own son.

513
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:27,965
Yeah, but what other
choice do we have?

514
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:31,664
Thank you, Leonard.

515
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:32,795
You're a peach.

516
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:35,363
We will never speak
of this again.

517
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:38,323
We got a trauma en route.
Man versus drive-through.

518
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,411
Oh. That sounds compelling.

519
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:41,587
My DoorDash arrive?

520
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,632
Uh...

521
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:44,852
ask Doris.

522
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:48,289
Oh, awesome.

523
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,682
What?

524
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,423
It was just sitting
here getting cold.

525
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:54,426
That was Leonard's reward for
getting the EMR up and running.

526
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:55,601
I promised him.

527
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,385
It's a Portillo's hot dog.

528
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,605
I... I can't be held
responsible for my actions.

529
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:00,954
That's a fair point.

530
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:04,000
Did you... did you put
ketchup on that dog?

531
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,524
Maybe.

532
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,090
Call yourself a Chicagoan.

533
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,309
Another fair point.

534
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,311
I can't get behind
no ketchup, Doris.

535
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,750
Oh, boy. What's with the mask?

536
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,186
The spit hood?

537
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,537
He kept spitting at the
cops, so they muzzled him.

538
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:19,973
The devil gets dessert,

539
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,236
but the bees are
stinging my tongue!

540
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:23,759
I want my McFlurry!

541
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,804
McFlurry.

542
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,109
Suspected PCP user

543
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,502
approached a
drive-through window

544
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:28,982
screaming for a McFlurry.

545
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,766
When the employees
refused to serve him,

546
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,986
he punched a hole through the
glass and tried to climb in.

547
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,640
Lacerated knuckles
on his right hand.

548
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:37,164
BP is 150 over 91,
heart rate's 130.

549
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:38,687
Maybe they just could've
given the man a free McFlurry

550
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,341
and avoided all this?

551
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,734
He was at Taco Bell.

552
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:42,909
Oh.

553
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,345
I will light your
eyeballs on fire!

554
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,607
Goodness gracious,

555
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:47,653
he's acting crazier
than a sprayed roach.

556
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:49,655
That's the PCP.
Give him a 5 and 2.

557
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:50,917
IV or IM?

558
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,397
You think you can
give this guy an IV?

559
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,268
IM.
- I feel no pain.

560
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:56,792
Oh, you will, you will, you
will, my friend, you will.

561
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:59,012
Glass hasn't lacerated
anything vital.

562
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:00,840
I'll have a med
student remove these

563
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,320
and suture the deeper wounds.

564
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,799
Give me a tox panel
and chemistry.

565
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,061
OK.

566
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:10,328
Five milligrams of
Haldol and two of Ativan.

567
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,199
It's nappy time.

568
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,505
There you go.

569
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,115
I would like fries with that.

570
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:17,030
Let's loosen the restraints.

571
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,380
Get him ready for
transfer on my count.

572
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,295
One, two, three.

573
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:23,210
Get him in four-point restraints

574
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:24,907
and then get X-ray in here ASAP.

575
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,300
I'll make it happen.

576
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,432
Dr. Archer.

577
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,216
Dr. Lenox needs you
in treatment five.

578
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,522
It can't wait.

579
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:40,445
I can't call time of death
'cause I'm not on shift.

580
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:58,550
Time of death, 15:29.

581
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,734
Thank you.

582
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:31,670
Can I help you?

583
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:32,758
Yes. Hi.

584
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,629
Uh, I'm Dr. Dean Archer

585
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,284
and I work at Gaffney
Chicago Medical Center.

586
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,504
Are you Heather Williams?
- I am.

587
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,940
I'm here because of

588
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:44,291
a 12-year-old patient of
mine named Milo Perdera.

589
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,337
He received your
daughter's heart.

590
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,253
How did you find me?

591
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:52,821
Milo's experiencing some
psychiatric challenges

592
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:55,563
due to his parents' breakup,
and his anxiety is causing him

593
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:59,785
to have some potentially
serious heart issues.

594
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:02,091
I'm sorry to hear that, but
that has nothing to do with me.

595
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:05,138
OK. Milo believes
that your daughter is

596
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:07,532
speaking to him
through her heart.

597
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:10,796
What are you talking about?

598
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:12,058
He thinks your daughter
doesn't want him

599
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,060
to have the heart anymore.

600
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,805
I'm not sure what
you want from me.

601
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:22,068
You could convince
him that he's wrong.

602
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:26,246
I'm sorry, I... I just
can't go back there.

603
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:30,772
I understand, and I have no
right to ask this of you.

604
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:34,254
But Milo's a sweet kid and
he's very scared right now

605
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,517
and I wouldn't
want you to regret

606
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:39,694
standing by and letting your
daughter's gift go to waste.

607
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,489
Hi, Milo. I'm...

608
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,752
I'm Heather.

609
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:58,453
My daughter Mackenzie
donated her heart to you.

610
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:02,936
I'm sorry she died.

611
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,894
I...

612
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:09,029
Dr. Archer told me Mackenzie's
been talking to you.

613
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,857
Yeah.

614
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:13,686
What'd she say?

615
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,565
She doesn't want me to
have her heart anymore.

616
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:29,265
But she's right.

617
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,572
I don't deserve it.

618
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:36,359
Well, that doesn't
sound like Mackenzie.

619
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,362
She knows I make
my parents argue.

620
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:40,799
They're getting a divorce.

621
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,280
And if I hadn't gotten
sick and needed surgery...

622
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:47,022
I think they'd
still be together.

623
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:48,067
Mm.

624
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:52,332
Well, I've got bad news for you.

625
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,160
People argue.

626
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:57,729
Mackenzie and I used
to argue all the time.

627
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,296
What did you guys argue about?

628
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,561
What didn't we argue about?

629
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,042
Um, cleaning her room.

630
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:10,569
Not getting a phone
until she was 13.

631
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:14,790
About the fact her dad and I
got divorced when she was 11.

632
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,577
She was very angry
at us about that.

633
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,100
I don't blame her.

634
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:25,931
But Mackenzie was
an amazing daughter.

635
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,066
How did she die?

636
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:35,636
Um...

637
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,553
She was waterskiing
with her cousins

638
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,468
and she got tangled in the rope

639
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:44,645
and it pulled her underwater
and she couldn't get any air.

640
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:49,302
My baby drowned.

641
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,829
Maybe that's what upset her.

642
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:00,269
What do you mean?

643
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,925
I was in the pool, swimming
for the first time.

644
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:07,190
That's when my heart started
pounding out of control.

645
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:11,629
I couldn't breathe.

646
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,893
Maybe she was
scared of the water.

647
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:32,737
Milo.

648
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:35,130
I'm so glad a little
piece of my Mackenzie

649
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,567
lives on in you.

650
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:40,962
But I promise you,
she's not angry.

651
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:43,051
I know she wants
to share her heart.

652
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,924
I just...

653
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:49,275
I can feel it.

654
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,320
Can you?

655
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:58,893
I can now.

656
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,416
Mm.

657
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,637
Do you want to talk with her?

658
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,821
There you are, my Mackenzie.

659
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:19,261
I love you so much, and I miss
you more than you can imagine.

660
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:25,920
But I am so glad that
you are with Milo now.

661
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:30,446
And I know you're going
to take good care of him

662
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,361
for a very, very long time.

663
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:39,499
So I guess it was just a
coincidence that Milo's

664
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,807
cardiac episode occurred in
a pool and his donor drowned?

665
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:45,374
Uh, probably.

666
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,289
Mm, who really knows?

667
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,509
I feel like I just
witnessed something

668
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,164
that can't totally be explained.

669
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:54,644
Welcome to my world.

670
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,125
I don't think it
was a coincidence.

671
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:58,736
Very, um...

672
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,215
open minded of you, Dean-o.

673
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:02,130
He was carrying a
lot of guilt, though,

674
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:05,830
and guilt can be a
powerful emotion.

675
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:09,529
And absolution can be
a very powerful remedy.

676
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,923
Right?

677
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,143
Right.

678
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,059
No cage can hold me!

679
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,062
I want my McFlurry now!

680
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:23,673
We have a situation with a
male patient high on PCP.

681
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:25,197
With Oreos!

682
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:26,459
Do you understand?

683
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,634
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Buddy, buddy, buddy.

684
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:28,896
Why don't you put
that glass down?

685
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:30,811
We can have a little
chat. Come on.

686
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:31,856
With Oreos!

687
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:33,031
Absolutely, double-stuffed.

688
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:34,597
But I... I need you to
look at me right now.

689
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:35,773
Just leave it right here, man.

690
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,774
Right here. Right up here.

691
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,079
You cannot defeat me.

692
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,124
Absolutely not.

693
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,445
You're way too
smart for me, man.

694
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,173
Thought it was coming!

695
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,707
Thanks for the assist.

696
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,970
The assist?

697
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:01,320
I saved your ass.

698
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:11,025
It was your responsibility
to make sure that the patient

699
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,287
was properly restrained.
- I did restrain him.

700
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:13,419
Properly?

701
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,942
Instead, he sliced
Dr. Lenox's arm

702
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,553
with a shard of glass that
you should have discarded.

703
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,251
That was her own
fault, not mine.

704
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:20,556
Wow.

705
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:21,775
OK.

706
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:23,255
Go home.

707
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,822
You're not allowed to fire me.

708
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,040
I'm not trying to.

709
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,260
Sadly, I need you.

710
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,044
So just...

711
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,612
come back tomorrow and just...

712
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,136
do better.

713
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,534
Yeah, I think you really
got through to her.

714
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:43,492
This situation is unsustainable.

715
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,626
We need more full-time nurses.

716
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:48,454
Well, you should take
that on the road.

717
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:49,934
I'm being serious.

718
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,239
So am I.

719
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,284
Didn't a leadership position

720
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,112
just open up in
the nurses union?

721
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,374
Yeah, Holly Spots is retiring

722
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,202
and our contracts
are about to expire.

723
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,638
So then what are
you waiting for?

724
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:01,555
All right? Toss your
name in the ring.

725
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,580
Sorry about your patient.

726
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,321
Astrid didn't have a family,

727
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:16,020
so I didn't want
her to be alone.

728
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:20,763
I never thought it would
be a random patient...

729
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:22,330
that would, uh...

730
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:24,289
melt your cold, dead heart.

731
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:29,337
- I admired Astrid's strength.
- Mm.

732
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:30,643
You know, a week
ago, she had no clue

733
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:32,950
that she was about to die.

734
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,604
And it didn't break her.

735
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:38,390
She was really proud of
the life that she lived.

736
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:40,392
No regrets.

737
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,872
She represents to you

738
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:47,268
all the sins you have never
had the courage to commit.

739
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:50,010
Excuse me. You've
read "Dorian Gray?"

740
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,708
I read books, Dr. Lenox.

741
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:56,234
Not a lot else to
do on a Naval ship.

742
00:32:58,106 --> 00:33:01,456
I hope I have Astrid's
strength when the time comes.

743
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:03,023
You're a baby.

744
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,242
Don't worry about it.

745
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,598
My mother died of prion disease

746
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,340
when she was 45 years old.

747
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:20,171
Sorry.

748
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,607
From the day she was diagnosed

749
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:24,088
to the day she
died was 11 months.

750
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,308
It was very fast.

751
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:32,792
My father took his own
life three hours later.

752
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:36,317
Didn't know how to
live without her.

753
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,189
It was like this...

754
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:43,020
silent nuclear explosion
that decimated our family.

755
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,413
And I was 19, so I
adopted my brother Kip.

756
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:47,024
And...

757
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,722
Which prion disease?

758
00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:52,812
Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker.

759
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:55,162
GSS.

760
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:57,599
Do you have it?

761
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,906
I don't know.

762
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:04,867
My brother and I took an oath
that we would never get tested.

763
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:07,087
So...

764
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,089
If my brain has an
expiration date,

765
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,135
no, I... I don't want to know.

766
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,269
Even with 50/50 odds?

767
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,880
You think I'm foolish.

768
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:20,013
No.

769
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:21,232
It takes courage

770
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:24,496
to live with that uncertainty.

771
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:29,936
Just drives me to live a life

772
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,417
that does as much
good as possible,

773
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:35,159
just in case.

774
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,986
You'll be OK, soldier.

775
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:50,217
Why did you share this
with me, of all people?

776
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:54,743
I knew you wouldn't pity me.

777
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:57,485
Us cold, dead hearts
have to stick together.

778
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:10,585
Time to pay up, Dr. Archer.

779
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:11,847
Indeed it is, Leonard.

780
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:13,110
Maggie.

781
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,807
Yes.

782
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:17,505
Just arrived and still warm.

783
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:18,724
Awesome sauce.

784
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:19,638
And you'll do this
every day for a month?

785
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,639
- Mm.
- A month?

786
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,814
You promised.

787
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:22,902
Just greasing the
wheels, Maggie.

788
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:23,990
Leonard was hugely
helpful today.

789
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:26,340
Got our EMR back
in working order.

790
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:28,516
Among other internet crimes.

791
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,997
Goodbye, Leonard.

792
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,130
Mm-hmm.

793
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:35,741
Hey, Dr. Archer.

794
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:38,744
I just examined Milo,
per your request.

795
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:41,007
And his hypertension
has been resolved.

796
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,009
OK, great.

797
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,142
Thank you.

798
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:47,970
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

799
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,147
Sure.

800
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:54,325
What was that all about?

801
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:57,415
You guys are usually so tight.

802
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:01,941
I gave him a little
too much truth.

803
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,249
Looks like it hurt.

804
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,171
There you are.

805
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,998
Hey.

806
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:17,435
That was a long
surgery. How'd it go?

807
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:19,959
Yeah. Good, good.

808
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,787
Mom and unborn baby
are doing great.

809
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:24,137
And I have no reason
to think that Laurel

810
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:26,618
won't be able to carry her
baby girl to full term.

811
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:30,491
Excellent. How's
dad holding up?

812
00:36:30,492 --> 00:36:32,190
He's beating himself up again.

813
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:36,193
That's his thing.

814
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,632
As opposed to mine,
who beats up on others.

815
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:43,374
Is that an apology?

816
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,289
Yeah.

817
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,595
I was, uh...

818
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:49,380
I was awful.

819
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:51,077
- You were.
- Yeah.

820
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:52,993
And I accept.

821
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,692
What's going on?

822
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:03,220
Sean found his mother
dead this morning.

823
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,005
What?

824
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,659
Oh, my God. Dean, I'm...

825
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,182
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

826
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:11,228
Yeah, yeah. Bad.

827
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,012
Subdural hematoma.

828
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:15,536
Leanne fell, hit her
head. She was drunk.

829
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:20,062
How's Sean?

830
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,064
I don't know. Shaken up.

831
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:23,327
How are you?

832
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,942
Right after I got off
the phone with Sean, I...

833
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:34,425
went and fished out an old
picture of Leanne and me

834
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:35,817
before we were engaged.

835
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:37,123
And you could just tell

836
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:40,039
how crazy about each
other we were, you know?

837
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,607
We got married.

838
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:44,435
And just...

839
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,219
we had... we had a ball.

840
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,220
Mm.

841
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:53,139
She started drinking
just after Sean was born.

842
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,359
And I would ship out
for months at a time

843
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,492
and leave her to parent alone

844
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:01,582
and she became resentful.

845
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:04,368
And then I got resentful.

846
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,500
I got wounded.

847
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:08,023
It was a mess.

848
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,111
Oh.

849
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:12,941
And somehow, I convinced myself

850
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:16,554
that the best thing for
everybody would be to leave.

851
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,603
I mean, who does <i>that?</i>

852
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:25,606
If I'd stuck around, maybe Sean

853
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:26,564
wouldn't have been
a drug addict.

854
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:27,739
Mm-mm.

855
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,740
Maybe Leanne would
be alive today.

856
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:29,741
- Stop.
- What?

857
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:30,959
- Stop.
- Stop what?

858
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,744
- Stop torturing yourself.
- Oh, come on.

859
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:37,923
My inability to change the past
leaves me with no other option.

860
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:40,360
OK, well, I think

861
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,362
you're choosing that option.

862
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:45,583
And if you're going to keep
choosing to torture yourself,

863
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:47,411
then you're going
to do it alone.

864
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:57,595
Hey, alone is something
I'm pretty good at.

865
00:38:57,596 --> 00:39:01,468
And how is that working
out for you, Dean?

866
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:04,297
You can't woulda-coulda-shoulda
your life.

867
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:07,779
Trust me, I've tried.
It's a dead end.

868
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,131
You still have time
to live your life,

869
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:17,136
but you have to take the
past, treat it as a lesson,

870
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:20,358
a necessary step to get you
to where you want to be.

871
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:24,578
Where do I want to be?

872
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:28,495
That's up to you.

873
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,596
<i>I'm flying to O'Hare
tomorrow afternoon.</i>

874
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,468
I'll be there.

875
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:48,472
<i>I'm sorry I was MIA today.</i>

876
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:50,952
Hey, that's OK.

877
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:58,090
<i>I meant to text you, but...</i>

878
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:00,179
<i>my brain was screaming
and I just...</i>

879
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,137
Yeah, didn't feel like talking.

880
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:03,487
<i>Yeah.</i>

881
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:04,705
<i>Wonder where I get that.</i>

882
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:06,403
Yeah, it's a mystery, I guess.

883
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:14,933
Look, your mother...

884
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:17,239
wasn't perfect.

885
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,504
But she always

886
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,680
really loved you.

887
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:26,901
In fact, that was the one
thing we always had in common.

888
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,903
Loving you.

889
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:35,301
<i>I love you, too, Dad.</i>

890
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:38,217
Well, I know you do.
You gave me a kidney.

891
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:04,548
Hey.

892
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:09,075
I, uh, brought dinner and...

893
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:12,730
Dessert.

894
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,123
Oh, I, uh, I don't do berries.

895
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:16,864
You don't do berries?

896
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,257
Yeah, I've... I've...

897
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:21,434
I've always found
them indulgent.

898
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:26,700
Well, maybe it's
time for a change.

899
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,705
Maybe it is.

900
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,931
Come in.
