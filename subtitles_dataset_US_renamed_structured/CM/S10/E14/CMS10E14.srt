1
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:04,755
We knew this was coming.

2
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:09,088
<i>I'm sorry for what
you're going through.</i>

3
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:11,464
Whatever you need, I'm game.

4
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:15,179
<i>Your presence in the ED
has become a liability.</i>

5
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:19,730
I'm suspending you without
pay, effective immediately.

6
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:23,224
<i>With Sean leaving Chicago and
Margo and I ending things,</i>

7
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:24,406
why stay?

8
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:26,563
Are you really
saying that to me?

9
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,090
Of course, you're
a reason to stay.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,017
<i>Jackson-Monroe Hospital
is closing its doors.</i>

11
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:37,164
Daily patient
numbers will double.

12
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:40,070
<i>Changes are on the horizon.</i>

13
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:52,118
Alistair Reed?

14
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:53,497
That's me.

15
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:54,759
Oh.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,545
Please, she's dizzy
and getting worse.

17
00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:59,503
Let's get you inside, ma'am.

18
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:01,462
Just a little longer, sir.

19
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:18,174
Oh, man, it's
freezing out there.

20
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:21,960
Yeah.

21
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,833
Hear anything from Ripley
yet since the suspension?

22
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,139
No.

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,228
But to be fair, I kind
of walked out on him.

24
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,015
Yeah, well, he kind
of deserved it.

25
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:35,539
I know, but doesn't make
me stop worrying about him.

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,019
Yeah.

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,194
Same.

28
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:40,239
Dr. Asher, there's
a 12-year-old girl

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,371
in treatment three.

30
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,547
Didn't want to get
the pediatrician?

31
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:45,941
Mm, the mom's requesting
a female doctor.

32
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:47,943
- Ah, OK.
- I'll be right there.

33
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:49,553
OK.

34
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:00,651
Ah, took you long enough.

35
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:02,523
Sorry, doorbell's busted.

36
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:03,654
Super said he'd fix it.

37
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:07,005
But he's also a criminal, so...

38
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:08,529
- Yeah.
- You look like hell.

39
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,660
How's Nate?

40
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,270
Oh, he's still running a fever.

41
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:14,187
OK, well, let me
take a look at him.

42
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:19,714
All right.

43
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:23,369
Going barefoot in this
weather is ill-advised.

44
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,503
I wanted to feel the
earth under my feet.

45
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:29,550
Well, I thought you said
that the Night Owl Rave

46
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:30,855
was in a warehouse.

47
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:32,857
Oh, it's a metaphor, man.

48
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:34,337
Yeah, I'm going to
go out on a limb

49
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:36,557
and say I don't think you
know what that word means.

50
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:38,559
Oh, you need to relax.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,169
I think you'll find
that touching me

52
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,564
will not elicit the
response you're looking for.

53
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:47,219
OK, Mr. Kerr, you
need a tetanus shot.

54
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,049
I'll get it while Nurse
Campos dresses your wound.

55
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,182
Let's get him some shoes
from the lost and found.

56
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:54,792
Something soft, if you have it.

57
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:57,230
UGGs, maybe.

58
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:03,932
Hi, Arianna. I'm Dr. Asher.

59
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,368
This is Student Doctor Howard.

60
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:06,369
- Hi.
- Hi.

61
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,110
And you must be Mom.

62
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,634
- Jocelyn.
- OK, nice to meet you.

63
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:12,723
OK, so what's going on today?

64
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:15,204
Arianna's school choir
had a competition

65
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:17,510
in Columbus last weekend.

66
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:19,034
They got back yesterday,
when she started

67
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:20,644
feeling sick to her stomach.

68
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:24,343
Then today she woke up with
a low fever and body aches.

69
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:26,302
Well, I'd like to take
a quick look at you.

70
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:27,390
Is that OK?
- OK.

71
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,434
OK.

72
00:03:28,435 --> 00:03:30,306
So any sore throat or coughing?

73
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:31,350
All right.

74
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:35,616
Any vomiting or diarrhea?

75
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,313
May I touch your stomach?
- Yes.

76
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:39,315
Any pain when you
go to the bathroom?

77
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:41,883
My stomach hurts, but
I haven't thrown up.

78
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:44,450
Have you started
menstruating yet?

79
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:45,974
Menstruating?

80
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,410
Have you gotten your period?

81
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,412
Um, yeah.

82
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:50,631
OK. When was the last one?

83
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:51,849
I'm sorry. Is that relevant?

84
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,198
It could be, yes.

85
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,679
Well, she got her first
period a few months ago.

86
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,378
And I believe she just finished
with the last one, yes?

87
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,119
Yes, a couple of days ago.

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,775
OK, so let's get a CBC,
a CMP, a UA, and a UPREG.

89
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:05,950
- OK.
- Wait. I'm sorry.

90
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,560
That last one, is
that a pregnancy test?

91
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,040
It is.

92
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,912
- Why do I need that?
- Oh, this is standard.

93
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:13,654
Dr. Asher, can I speak
with you a second outside?

94
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:15,744
Sure.

95
00:04:18,877 --> 00:04:20,138
Is everything OK?

96
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:22,053
Listen, I try very
hard to make sure

97
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,882
Arianna isn't exposed
to certain ideas

98
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:27,232
until she's ready.

99
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,538
OK.

100
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:29,670
Well, it just seems
like you're making this

101
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:31,410
about my daughter's
sexual history,

102
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,325
which I can assure
you she doesn't have.

103
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:35,980
I promise you, that is not
at all what's happening.

104
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,939
Everything that I'm
asking is very standard

105
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,767
and designed to get
the whole picture

106
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,377
to diagnose Arianna,
that is all.

107
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:42,944
Yeah, well, I
would appreciate it

108
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,510
if you could be more
careful moving forward.

109
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:47,470
I will do my absolute best
within the scope of my job.

110
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,602
OK?

111
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:51,517
OK.

112
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:56,871
Excuse me, sir.

113
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:58,263
You can't enter until
they call your name.

114
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,961
I've been waiting over an hour

115
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:01,136
and I keep getting
bumped by other patients.

116
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,920
We are having a
particularly busy day,

117
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,705
but we will get to you.
- Will you?

118
00:05:04,706 --> 00:05:06,097
And exactly what
criteria do you use

119
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,012
to prioritize patient entry?

120
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:10,580
Or is it just as
haphazard as it seems?

121
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:12,016
Sir, do I need to call security?

122
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:13,191
What's wrong, Doris?

123
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,366
This patient is trying
to cut the line.

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,716
Oh, I'm not a patient.

125
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:17,326
- Then who are you, sir?
- Alistair Reed.

126
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:18,631
I'm with the National
Accreditation

127
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:19,894
Board of Hospitals.

128
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:21,634
- You're with NABOH?
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:22,766
Well, right, then.

130
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:24,159
Why don't you wait in the lounge

131
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,900
while I find Ms. Goodwin,
our executive director?

132
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,381
Doris, can you help
Mr. Reed find the way?

133
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:30,905
Follow me.

134
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,996
What's NABOH?

135
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:36,737
They're like health
inspectors for hospitals.

136
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:37,999
They show up unannounced

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,741
and look for any health
and safety violations.

138
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:43,395
If Mr. Reed sees enough
things that he doesn't like,

139
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:46,398
he can recommend that Gaffney
be closed... permanently.

140
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,183
But does that
actually ever happen?

141
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:49,314
What?

142
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,663
Sounds like a
scare tactic to me.

143
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:52,840
How do you think
Jackson-Monroe got shut down?

144
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:05,211
As requested, six months
of hospital records.

145
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:07,317
I'll also need the most recent

146
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:11,084
hospital policy and
procedures manual.

147
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:12,858
I'll get that for you.

148
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,366
I'm sorry you had such
a long wait, Mr. Reed.

149
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:18,262
But I'm confused why you didn't

150
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:20,468
just alert the
staff you were here.

151
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,146
I sign in as a
non-emergent patient

152
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:24,233
and see how long it
takes to be called in.

153
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,304
If I wait more than an hour,
it's a policy violation.

154
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,679
With all due respect,

155
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:32,141
that feels a bit misleading
and unfair to my staff.

156
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:33,752
With all due
respect, Ms. Goodwin,

157
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:36,401
I've found that
full transparency

158
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:39,124
leads to less than
accurate results.

159
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,147
Mm-hmm.

160
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:41,781
Well, when you're finished,

161
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:44,655
I'm happy to escort you
through the site visit.

162
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,550
Yeah, I'll let you
know when I'm ready.

163
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:47,921
Lovely.

164
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:51,252
In the meantime, please help
yourself to some coffee.

165
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:53,288
You allow coffee
in your workspaces?

166
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,048
I'll check back later.

167
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,399
Yeah. Uh-huh. Thanks.

168
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:00,214
Is it just me, or
was that the most

169
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:01,999
humorless man you've ever met?

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,304
Worse than that.

171
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:05,393
It felt like he was nitpicking.

172
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:07,352
Look, I'm going to
need your help today.

173
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:08,875
Give the brick to Doris.

174
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:11,356
I want you to
organize the staff.

175
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:14,272
Make sure there's nothing
that could undermine us.

176
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:19,320
And if you spot any major
problems, you let me know ASAP.

177
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:20,669
Anything else I can do to help?

178
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,324
Yeah, if you see
NABOH coming your way,

179
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:24,673
tell him you need to
go to the bathroom

180
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:25,979
and run the other direction.

181
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,459
Sorry, why exactly?

182
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,895
Because they will quiz you

183
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:31,724
about every single
hospital policy.

184
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:34,814
Do you know the exact
protocol for evacuating people

185
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:37,469
out of an operating room
in case of an emergency?

186
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,123
Sorry, I have to
go to the bathroom.

187
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,342
Now you're getting it.

188
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:43,954
He was coughing all night.

189
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,172
The only way he
would sleep at all

190
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,697
is if I sat upright
and laid him on me.

191
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:54,138
Well, he's got a nasty virus,
but his lungs are clear.

192
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,662
So whatever it is,

193
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:58,620
it's all right up here.

194
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:01,536
Oh, what about the vomiting?

195
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,277
When babies have
mucus dripping down,

196
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,845
it can upset the stomach.

197
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:08,282
Oh, so he's throwing up snot?

198
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:09,370
Yeah.

199
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:11,720
That's objectively disgusting.

200
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:13,940
Yeah.

201
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:16,160
Well, I'm sorry I called
you out for a cold.

202
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,509
Oh, don't apologize.

203
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,990
It's... it's better to check.

204
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:21,817
I was just being polite anyway.

205
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:23,254
What's the point of
having a doctor friend

206
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,343
if you can't abuse them?

207
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,521
You know, if...

208
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,871
if you want, I could
stick around for a bit.

209
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:34,439
You know, keep an eye on
Nate, monitor the fever.

210
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,441
You don't have to work?

211
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:38,486
Well, I got the late
shift tonight, so...

212
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:41,185
Oh, that would be great.

213
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:44,014
Yeah.

214
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,714
Please don't tell my mom.

215
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:51,282
She's not a fan of screen time?

216
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:54,024
She's not a fan of anything.

217
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,895
And it's only supposed
to be for emergencies.

218
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:58,376
Well, I'll have to
make sure I observe

219
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:01,727
doctor-patient
confidentiality, then.

220
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:04,338
So who you texting?

221
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,340
This boy I met on the trip.

222
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:07,602
That's cool.

223
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:09,735
The trip was so fun.

224
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:11,606
We hung around this fire pit,

225
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,608
did chicken fights in the water,

226
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:15,523
basically everything
I'm not supposed to do.

227
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:17,525
You went swimming
in this weather?

228
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:19,571
The hotel had an indoor pool.

229
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:21,616
My mom would lose it if she knew

230
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,227
I was in a bathing
suit in front of boys.

231
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:27,361
I finally felt normal for once.

232
00:09:27,362 --> 00:09:29,146
Yeah.

233
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:34,586
Sorry.

234
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:37,415
I'm shivering all of a sudden.

235
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,416
Can I get a blanket?

236
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,026
Mm-hmm.

237
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:45,075
Hey, the intense
shaking, that's rigors.

238
00:09:45,076 --> 00:09:46,424
It means that she's
got an infection

239
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:47,555
and it's getting worse.

240
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,035
You know, I was
talking to Arianna,

241
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:52,778
and she mentioned on her
trip, she swam with some boys.

242
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:54,258
She didn't say it, but
it's always possible

243
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,433
there was some kissing.

244
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:56,956
You thinking mono?

245
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:58,523
Rigors is a symptom, right?

246
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,177
Could be, but,

247
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:02,048
it could also be a sign
of bacteria in the blood.

248
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,702
So I want you to get
a mono spot test,

249
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,225
draw blood cultures
and a Gram stain,

250
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,445
and start her on
broad-spectrum antibiotics

251
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:09,577
until those cultures
are done cooking.

252
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:11,884
Nice work.

253
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:14,452
Patient is Brayden
Whitlocker, 13 years old.

254
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:15,714
Gunshot wound to his left chest.

255
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,802
No exit wound found.

256
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:18,064
His mom and brother are here.

257
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:20,110
His dad's on the way,
Alderman Whitlocker.

258
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:21,459
- From city council?
- One and the same.

259
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,721
You got vitals?

260
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,985
Criticals. GCS 6,
pulse 145, SATs 89%.

261
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:28,248
- Any meds in the field?
- Just TXA and RSI meds.

262
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:29,510
It's going to be OK, baby.

263
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,643
- Let's get him over.
- Transfer on three.

264
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,732
One, two, three.

265
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,821
Hang fentanyl and
propofol drips.

266
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:37,083
OK, ultrasound.
I got the E-FAST.

267
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:38,215
Pulse is dropping. He's
getting bradycardic.

268
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,217
- Behind.
- BP 75 over 42.

269
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:42,001
Large pericardial effusion.

270
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:43,176
He's about to code.
Let's open him up.

271
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:44,612
ChloraPrep, scalpel,
and chest tray.

272
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,223
- I got it.
- Is my brother going to be OK?

273
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:48,007
Please, I need you
both to step back, OK?

274
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:49,487
Step back.

275
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:52,272
Get the ChloraPrep, please.

276
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:54,145
That's good.

277
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,974
Let's get the rib spreaders.

278
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,371
Opening the pericardium.

279
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,590
All right, pulse 44 now.

280
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:07,592
OK, looks like it hit
the left ventricle.

281
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:08,723
Any sign of the bullet?

282
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:11,117
- No, nothing.
- Grab a couple Allises.

283
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:13,119
And hold the edges
together to close the hole.

284
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,122
- OK, letting go of the hole.
- OK. Skin stapler.

285
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,347
- BP 70 over 40.
- Give it a second.

286
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:24,652
Still no bullet.

287
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:26,698
You have to look lower.

288
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,656
- What?
- He was shot from above,

289
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:30,484
so the angle of the
bullet went downward.

290
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:33,705
How do you know?

291
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,359
I'm the one who shot him.

292
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,466
Apparently Brayden
snuck out last night

293
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:44,829
to hang with friends, but when
he came back early this morning

294
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,376
and tried to climb
through a window,

295
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:49,207
Jeremiah mistook him as an
intruder and shot him once.

296
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:50,577
When Jeremiah realized
what he'd done,

297
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:52,385
he was obviously devastated.

298
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,036
I can't even imagine.

299
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,453
But it was an accident,

300
00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:57,392
so there likely won't be
formal charges, right?

301
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:58,232
I hope not.

302
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:00,271
But unfortunately
the gun Jeremiah

303
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:01,732
bought last week
is unregistered,

304
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:03,904
so he'll be processed
and charged.

305
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,103
Why would he buy a gun?

306
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,318
For protection.

307
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,297
The family lives in a
pretty rough neighborhood.

308
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:10,122
Why? The husband's
on city council.

309
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:11,645
They just separated.

310
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:14,169
Mrs. Whitlocker and her sons
moved out a few weeks ago.

311
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,345
Look, Jeremiah can stick
around until we know

312
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:17,607
where his little brother stands,

313
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:19,783
but then I got to
take him downtown.

314
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,089
That's kind of you.

315
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,221
Alderman Whitlocker.

316
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:23,570
Ed, thanks so much
for reaching out.

317
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:25,646
Is Brayden OK?
- He's stable for right now.

318
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:26,802
Tell me everything you know,

319
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,306
and please just be
straight with me.

320
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,510
Brayden was shot in the heart.

321
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:30,755
He lost a lot of blood.

322
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,146
We were able to stabilize him,
but there was no exit wound.

323
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,868
And the trajectory of
the bullet was unclear,

324
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,894
so we're doing a CT
scan to try to find it.

325
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:38,091
I've spent half my life

326
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:39,169
trying to get guns
off the streets,

327
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:40,244
and then this happens.

328
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:41,792
When will we know the results?

329
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:42,990
Soon.

330
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,716
Thank you for your candor.

331
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,503
I'd like to see my family now.

332
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,051
Please. Yeah.

333
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,432
I got the test results
back on Arianna.

334
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,825
Negative for mono.
- Damn.

335
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:02,262
But that's not the weird thing.

336
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,307
She's positive for staph.

337
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:05,381
But that doesn't make sense.

338
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:07,502
We started her on
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

339
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:08,982
That should be helping
get rid of the infection.

340
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:10,635
But it's getting worse?

341
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:12,072
So then what's going on?

342
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:13,464
I don't know, but it feels like

343
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:14,944
we still don't know the
source of the infection.

344
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:16,728
So let's get an abdominal CT.

345
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,912
OK.

346
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:19,200
Hi.

347
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,990
All right, let's
check every wheel

348
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:23,029
on every cart and every bed.

349
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,881
No dings, no dents,
no stickiness.

350
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:27,690
No anything. No friction.

351
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:30,051
Every wheel in the ED,
that's going to take all day.

352
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:31,661
- Wheels.
- You have 12 minutes.

353
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:34,229
Wheels. Wheels.
Wheels. Wheels.

354
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,841
You don't ever think
of that H in "wheels."

355
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:39,234
Everything OK, Dr. Archer?

356
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,583
Yeah, I feel good.

357
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:42,106
Yeah, I feel pretty good.

358
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:43,279
I'm a little warm,

359
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:45,653
maybe a little, uh, glow-y.

360
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,610
Glow-y?

361
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,748
What is that?

362
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:54,296
It's an owl sticker.

363
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:56,615
Those guys that were here
earlier came from a rave,

364
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,584
and they were pretty high.
- What?

365
00:13:58,609 --> 00:13:59,696
- And you're thinking...
- Yep.

366
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:00,765
- And they gave him...
- Uh-huh.

367
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,053
Those sentences, did they end?

368
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:07,185
Oh, my, what's...
what's going on?

369
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,810
That is an LSD
sticker on your arm.

370
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:10,904
You're on acid, Dean.

371
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:13,123
Oh, that's unfortunate.

372
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:15,585
Ah, that word came
out like a ribbon.

373
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,334
OK, this isn't happening.

374
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,533
OK, is this bad?

375
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,881
It's an accident, right?

376
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:21,863
You try telling NABOH that.

377
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:23,324
OK, change of plans.

378
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,132
No more wheels.
- Wheels.

379
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,028
OK, we're going to take
Dr. Archer to treatment four.

380
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:29,097
- Four.
- OK?

381
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:30,709
- And we're going to
get him on IV.

382
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:31,373
You're going to be OK.

383
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:32,746
We're going to
get you on fluids,

384
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,631
and we're going to take
good care of you, OK?

385
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:35,943
I've always liked you.

386
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:36,990
Oh.

387
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:38,591
- OK, come on.
- OK.

388
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,121
- All right.
- Let's go.

389
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,795
- Yep.
- OK.

390
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:43,707
So the CT revealed
that the bullet

391
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:45,490
embolized into the aorta.

392
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:47,168
Well, that sounds dangerous.

393
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:48,037
It is.

394
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:50,014
We need to operate
immediately to remove it.

395
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,779
Is he going to survive that?

396
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:53,287
It's a risky procedure.

397
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:54,965
The aorta is a pulsating vessel,

398
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,725
so the bullet could
move at any time.

399
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,838
There's also significant
chance of organ failure,

400
00:14:58,863 --> 00:15:00,864
catastrophic blood loss.

401
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:02,545
I can't believe I did this.

402
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,138
Don't blame yourself, Jerem...

403
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:10,010
Jeremiah.

404
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,559
Wait.

405
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,818
Walk me through
this, Dr. Lenox.

406
00:15:16,843 --> 00:15:18,757
What exactly are you
going to do in there?

407
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:20,154
First we will make an incision

408
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:21,873
down the center of the abdomen.

409
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,594
Then we will stop blood
flow to the aorta.

410
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:25,899
And assuming the
bullet's still there,

411
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,206
we'll take it out, sew
everything back up.

412
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:29,717
And how long will
the surgery take?

413
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,842
It's hard to say for sure,
but a few hours, I'd imagine.

414
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:35,216
And I do have to
get up to the OR.

415
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:37,250
Thank you so much
for helping my boy.

416
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,687
Of course.

417
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,139
I'm going to make a call.

418
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:43,165
Sure.

419
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,773
Hey, I couldn't help
but to notice your cut.

420
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:54,401
Yeah, I cut it picking up some
broken glass at the house.

421
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,787
Ah.

422
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:59,770
You really should clean it up.

423
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:01,834
I mean, Brayden is on
the way up for surgery.

424
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:05,775
There's really nothing
you can do right now.

425
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,184
OK?

426
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,082
All right, follow me.

427
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:14,119
Now that his fever is down,
hopefully he'll sleep awhile.

428
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:15,564
Oh, good.

429
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,591
Good. He needs it.

430
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:21,352
What's that?

431
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:24,572
The night Sully died, he
asked me to bring it to him.

432
00:16:24,573 --> 00:16:28,620
He wanted to give it
to you himself, but...

433
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,276
when everything happened,
I forgot about it.

434
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:45,456
Wow.

435
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:50,085
One of the first times
Sully and I hung out,

436
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,924
he, uh,

437
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:56,300
convinced me to ditch school
and sneak into a Cubs game.

438
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,978
Sixth inning,

439
00:16:58,003 --> 00:17:00,048
Mickey Morandini hits this homer

440
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:01,900
that lands just a
few feet from us.

441
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:05,710
We both dove, practically
got in a fistfight over it.

442
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:07,127
We thought it was going
to be worth something.

443
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,110
And I guess Sully
beat you to it?

444
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:13,137
Yeah, except he
told me he sold it.

445
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:16,164
He was actually
pretty sentimental

446
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:19,539
once you got past the
whole arrogant prick thing.

447
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,592
Yeah.

448
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:26,662
I miss that arrogant prick.

449
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:35,610
You know, they say
it gets easier.

450
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:38,134
It doesn't.

451
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:40,050
It gets harder.

452
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:45,675
Because when it first happens,
everyone's there, you know?

453
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:49,145
And they're sorry.

454
00:17:49,146 --> 00:17:50,669
And they're crying too.

455
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,236
And it feels like they're

456
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:56,413
helping to carry all this hurt.

457
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:02,063
But then the world moves on

458
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:05,197
'cause they got to, right?

459
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:08,790
But I'm still here.

460
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:12,832
I'm just carrying all
of it now, all alone.

461
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:15,455
Hey. Hey.

462
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,916
No, you're not alone.

463
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:32,537
Uh...

464
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,481
I'm sorry.

465
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,464
I... I didn't mean to do that.

466
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,533
Uh, uh...

467
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,095
It's OK. It's OK.

468
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,369
I should probably go.
- No, no, no.

469
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,421
Rip, don't. I'm... I'm...

470
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:47,186
It's... it's fine.

471
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:49,283
It's... I just got to go.

472
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,041
Call me if anything
changes with Nate.

473
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:52,937
OK. I'm sorry.

474
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:03,252
Problem?

475
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,929
These two trash cans
should be 8 feet apart.

476
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:09,546
Uh, shall I get
you a tape measure?

477
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:11,572
Excuse me.

478
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:14,599
Nurse Graysen, may I ask you
a quick protocol question?

479
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:18,104
Oh, uh...

480
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:20,044
I was just on my
way to the bathroom.

481
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:24,541
You may think
encouraging your staff

482
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:27,046
to stonewall me is amusing,
but I assure you it only

483
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:29,507
damages Gaffney's standing
in my final evaluation.

484
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:32,306
Well, if my staff is
avoiding you, Mr. Reed,

485
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:35,289
perhaps you need to reconsider
your bedside manner.

486
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:37,759
By all means, speak
your mind, Ms. Goodwin.

487
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,328
Gaffney is a center
of excellence

488
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:43,747
and adheres to only the
highest of standards.

489
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:45,990
I'm deeply proud of my staff

490
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,147
and the groundbreaking
work that they do.

491
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:51,261
And I'd hope that the
quality of their care

492
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:55,203
isn't measured by the distance
between two trash cans.

493
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,365
Shall we move on to
the surgical wing?

494
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:01,784
Let's.

495
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:10,177
You know, at my last hospital,

496
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:13,900
I got really good at triage,
figuring out what's wrong,

497
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,689
trying to fix it.

498
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:19,454
Over time, you start to
see the same injuries,

499
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,213
the same patterns.

500
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,544
I got to see a lot
of slide bites.

501
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,744
What are those?

502
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:29,163
Well, sometimes when a person
who isn't used to handling

503
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:32,581
a gun fires one, see, the slide

504
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,217
can come back and slice
right between the thumb

505
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:38,636
and the index finger.

506
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:45,148
Olivia, this is a slide bite.

507
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,033
Why are you letting
Jeremiah take the blame

508
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:52,669
for shooting his brother?

509
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:58,802
If I'm arrested, my husband
will get custody of Brayden.

510
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:03,278
That can't happen.

511
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,494
You're afraid of him?

512
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,841
Last year, he put
Brayden through a door

513
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,693
and broke his collarbone.

514
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,440
It's only gotten worse.

515
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:15,333
That's why I moved
us out of that house.

516
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,353
You need to report this.

517
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:19,205
OK? I can help you.

518
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,259
You can't fight my husband.

519
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:24,721
You'll lose.

520
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:27,225
I get being afraid of him.

521
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,295
I do.

522
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:32,208
But if you don't get
in front of this,

523
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:36,105
I mean, Jeremiah could be
facing serious jail time.

524
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,002
Don't gamble his future for him.

525
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:40,947
It was an accident.

526
00:21:40,972 --> 00:21:42,619
Jeremiah is young.

527
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:44,253
The judge will understand.

528
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:47,171
We have to protect Brayden.

529
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,291
So you're willing to sacrifice

530
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:54,448
one son for the other?

531
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:56,257
If Brayden goes
back to that house,

532
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,814
his father will
end up killing him.

533
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:01,994
So Jeremiah's just
sticking to his story,

534
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:04,134
even if that means throwing
his entire future away.

535
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,158
OK.

536
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:08,185
OK, so I'm not really
sure what to do here.

537
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:09,799
Well, that's simple.
We do nothing.

538
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:11,799
Nothing? What do
you mean do nothing?

539
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:13,767
I know you wanna help,
but we're not cops.

540
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,898
Our job is to find medical
solutions to medical issues.

541
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:18,465
OK, OK, so you're saying that
if they don't have a chart,

542
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:20,250
then they just
don't matter to you.

543
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,731
I'm saying there's a boy
on that operating table

544
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,341
with a bullet in his chest.

545
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:27,213
That's my patient. That's
who I know I can help.

546
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:29,565
I don't concern myself
with saving souls.

547
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:05,687
Dr. Ripley.

548
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:08,124
Hi, MK.

549
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,474
It's so good to see you.

550
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:13,695
What brings you in here?

551
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:16,480
I guess I'm running
out of places to go.

552
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:24,531
Well, your timing is perfect.

553
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:29,624
I could actually use
your help with something.

554
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,409
Right this way.

555
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,411
And this will tell
us what's wrong?

556
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,804
We hope so.

557
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:37,806
I'm sorry, but that
answer is not good enough.

558
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,416
We're doing everything
that we can.

559
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,592
Sometimes infections can be
difficult to pin down, but I...

560
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:42,680
What's that?

561
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,029
What's happening?

562
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,378
Her BP's dropping, and
she stopped responding

563
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:47,598
on the intercom.

564
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,253
Arianna, can you hear me?

565
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:52,429
BP 86 over 52, pulse 140.

566
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,605
She's tachycardic.
- What's happening? Tell me.

567
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:55,650
She's in septic shock.

568
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:56,694
Hang a liter of
saline wide open,

569
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:57,913
and let's get her
back to the ED.

570
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:00,177
Dr. Asher, look at her hands.

571
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:03,614
She went swimming on her trip.

572
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:05,094
No, she didn't.
She's not allowed.

573
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:06,530
When did you say
her period ended?

574
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:07,662
A few days ago.

575
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,054
Find me a speculum
and ring forceps.

576
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,534
I need to perform a pelvic
exam on your daughter.

577
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:12,797
Do I have your consent?
- What, now?

578
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,669
Yes. Yes. Yes.

579
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,931
Speculum and ring forceps.

580
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:17,106
OK. Pelvis up.

581
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:18,237
Grab her leg, please.

582
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:19,456
What is going on?

583
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,764
I believe your daughter
left a tampon in.

584
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:24,722
That's not possible. She's
not allowed to use them.

585
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:26,376
She probably borrowed
one from a friend

586
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:28,030
and forgot to take it out.

587
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:30,119
Your daughter has
toxic shock syndrome.

588
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,168
But I don't understand why
she didn't say anything.

589
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:38,910
Because she's too
scared to tell you.

590
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:47,973
Where's Mr. NABOH?

591
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:50,671
Hmm? Oh, he stepped out
to take a phone call.

592
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:52,064
How's the assessment going?

593
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:55,154
Honestly, Maggie, I don't know.

594
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,156
This... this guy feels like

595
00:24:57,157 --> 00:25:01,291
he's got some kind of vendetta.

596
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:04,468
Wait, isn't that his notebook?

597
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,644
Hmm?

598
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:07,819
Oh, yeah.

599
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,908
He... he must have left it.

600
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:13,303
Maybe we can find
out how we're doing.

601
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,957
No, Maggie. No, we shouldn't.

602
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,229
Maggie.

603
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:26,942
There's about 15 or 16
violations he listed.

604
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:29,681
How many does it take
before we get penalized?

605
00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:33,106
Jackson-Monroe was
shut down at 20.

606
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,610
Close the book.
Close the book.

607
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:37,115
Close it.

608
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:43,466
So how's your friend,

609
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:46,210
the one who was sick?

610
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:53,028
I'm so sorry.

611
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,272
Yeah.

612
00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:02,046
At times like this, it's
important to have community.

613
00:26:04,507 --> 00:26:07,989
Well, I'm doing a pretty
good job of destroying that.

614
00:26:08,948 --> 00:26:11,472
And why is that, do you think?

615
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,931
I don't know.

616
00:26:16,037 --> 00:26:20,258
It's like I'm reverting
back to this...

617
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:24,219
old version of me,
and I can't stop it.

618
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:32,549
Maybe I'm trying
to punish myself.

619
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,205
You know, there's...

620
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:40,339
there's no fast-forward
button for grief.

621
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:48,358
Sometimes all you can do is...

622
00:26:48,546 --> 00:26:50,329
limit the damage
you do to yourself

623
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:52,790
while the storm passes.

624
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,552
How?

625
00:27:03,577 --> 00:27:05,411
How?

626
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:09,047
By reminding yourself
what's important

627
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:13,399
over and over, like...

628
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,751
like a mantra.

629
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:21,929
Listen, close your eyes.

630
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:29,110
Think about

631
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:32,419
what matters most to you,

632
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:35,024
what you can't live without.

633
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:47,996
Looks like you figured it out.

634
00:27:57,246 --> 00:28:00,117
Think she's going
to pull through?

635
00:28:00,156 --> 00:28:01,983
I don't know.

636
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:05,291
Her vitals are
still pretty labile.

637
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,554
Next couple hours are
going to be crucial.

638
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:10,557
Oh, you've got
blood on your shirt.

639
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,161
Oh.

640
00:28:13,186 --> 00:28:16,276
NABOH won't love this.
I'll be right back.

641
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:27,278
- I feel I should inform you...
- Oh, my...

642
00:28:27,303 --> 00:28:28,433
- I'm in the room.
- Dean, what...

643
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,721
Dean, what... what the hell?

644
00:28:30,818 --> 00:28:32,903
What are you doing in here?

645
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:38,699
The ED was a little hectic...

646
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:42,383
Given my...

647
00:28:42,612 --> 00:28:44,569
you know.

648
00:28:44,602 --> 00:28:47,106
Plus,

649
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:51,221
the lighting in here is sublime.

650
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:54,700
You still feel a
little out of it?

651
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:56,944
I wouldn't say I'm out of it.

652
00:28:57,173 --> 00:28:58,739
I'd say I'm in it.

653
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:05,191
How are you?

654
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:08,115
I'm OK, I guess.

655
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:10,880
Kind of a rough day.
- Yeah.

656
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,507
The Ripley roller coaster?

657
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:15,402
Yeah.

658
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:18,560
Yeah, amongst other things.

659
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:21,761
It's a shame you don't see it.

660
00:29:22,624 --> 00:29:25,372
What... what? See what?

661
00:29:26,313 --> 00:29:28,183
Oh, Hannah.

662
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:31,083
You walk around

663
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:35,895
without realizing you
have this light...

664
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,139
all around you.

665
00:29:39,493 --> 00:29:41,630
You have every
right to be cynical

666
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,525
after everything
you've been through

667
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:47,020
and working here every day.

668
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:50,439
But you're not, you're...

669
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,640
hopeful...

670
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:55,709
and open.

671
00:29:59,455 --> 00:30:03,240
And kind.

672
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:08,050
And you deserve more.

673
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:10,621
And you don't see that.

674
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:15,817
I do.

675
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,137
I think we need to get you
back to a treatment room.

676
00:30:25,162 --> 00:30:27,685
- Fair enough.
- Mm-hmm.

677
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,323
Come on.

678
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:36,470
Dean, are you barefoot?

679
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:39,229
I wanted to feel the
earth under my feet.

680
00:30:44,247 --> 00:30:45,518
- Hey.
- What happened?

681
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:46,847
How is he?

682
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:48,917
It took some time to
localize the bullet,

683
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:52,372
but we were able to find it
and remove it without incident.

684
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:53,832
So he'll be OK?

685
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,973
Yes, I expect a full recovery.

686
00:30:55,974 --> 00:30:59,019
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

687
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,456
You're very welcome.

688
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:01,718
Can I see him?

689
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:04,286
He's being transferred
to the PICU shortly.

690
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:05,899
Yeah, I'll show you
the way. Come on.

691
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:08,012
I'm afraid that's not
going to happen, Jeremiah.

692
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:09,314
What?

693
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:10,399
Now that Brayden's
pulled through,

694
00:31:10,424 --> 00:31:11,816
I need to take him
in to be processed.

695
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,075
- Wait. Right now?
- It's OK, Mom.

696
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,971
Oh, come on, you can't just
give him a few more minutes?

697
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:17,300
I mean...
- I'm sorry.

698
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,992
I gave as much
latitude as I could.

699
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:20,539
Oh, we understand, Detective.

700
00:31:20,784 --> 00:31:22,785
I'll send over a lawyer
immediately, son.

701
00:31:22,895 --> 00:31:25,203
I don't want your help, Dad.

702
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,160
You've done enough.

703
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,100
Let's go.

704
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:38,419
Wait, Detective Rankin.

705
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,258
Jeremiah didn't shoot Brayden.

706
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:46,008
I did.

707
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:48,633
You? What?

708
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,938
Mom, please, don't do this.

709
00:31:50,963 --> 00:31:53,008
I bought the gun, and
I can tell you where.

710
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:55,861
And I was the only
one who fired it.

711
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:58,409
You almost killed our son?

712
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:01,262
Yes, because I thought it was
you breaking into our house.

713
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,000
I thought it was you
coming for us again.

714
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:07,071
And I pulled the trigger so
you'd stop hurting Brayden,

715
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:08,966
stop hurting all of us.

716
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:11,732
I love you, Olivia, but
I can no longer deny

717
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:13,172
what I've known for a long time.

718
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,067
You're a very sick woman.

719
00:32:15,092 --> 00:32:16,832
Dad, stop lying.

720
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:18,320
This is what he does!

721
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:20,346
He gaslights you
to protect himself!

722
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,258
I'm going to sue
for sole custody.

723
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:25,024
But I promise to get
you the very best care

724
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,445
that money can buy.

725
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,299
I blame myself for
not doing it sooner.

726
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,368
You always win, don't you?

727
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:34,141
Always.

728
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,080
- You damn monster!
- No, Jeremiah, don't.

729
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:37,497
Jeremiah, don't, OK?

730
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,045
Stop.

731
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:42,703
I think you should leave.

732
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,078
Of course.

733
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:46,540
If you think that's best.

734
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:52,013
Why'd you tell them, Mom?

735
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:55,954
We had to protect Brayden.

736
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:58,863
That's not your job, honey.

737
00:32:58,864 --> 00:33:00,908
It's mine.

738
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:03,911
And you shouldn't be
punished for my mistake.

739
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:06,958
I'm so sorry.

740
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,525
This way.

741
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:14,888
Well, what do I do now?

742
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:16,020
What happens to my brother?

743
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:17,369
Jeremiah, listen to me, OK?

744
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,458
I promised I would help you, OK?

745
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:22,374
And that's exactly
what I intend to do.

746
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:32,172
Ms. Shaw?

747
00:33:32,197 --> 00:33:35,200
Sorry, I just needed a minute.

748
00:33:35,911 --> 00:33:36,998
How is Arianna?

749
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:38,371
Her fever's breaking,

750
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:40,825
and it looks like
she's going to be OK.

751
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,417
Oh, God, I'm so glad.

752
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,582
Oh. Thank you.

753
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:51,240
Are you OK?

754
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:53,973
Yes, I'm... I'm so happy.

755
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,218
I just...

756
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,996
My daughter almost died because

757
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:03,545
she didn't know how
to use a tampon.

758
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,184
You were right.

759
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,254
She was afraid to tell me,

760
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,368
afraid of me.

761
00:34:10,393 --> 00:34:11,270
This is all my fault.

762
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:12,778
No, you were just
trying to protect her

763
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:13,903
because you love her.

764
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:16,403
I'm not some prude, you know?

765
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,081
It's just,

766
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:21,879
growing up, I experienced
a lot of things

767
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:23,582
I shouldn't have.

768
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:27,131
I'm so sorry.

769
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:30,724
And I promised myself that
I would let Arianna be a kid

770
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:33,882
for as long as she could before
the world could get to her.

771
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,038
I get that.

772
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:37,803
But when she was sick,
you brought her in,

773
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:42,092
and you advocated
for her strongly.

774
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:44,162
And all those missed
conversations,

775
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:47,624
you now have a chance to
have them moving forward.

776
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,437
Thank you.

777
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:55,072
Yeah.

778
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,078
Brayden sure beat
the odds, didn't he?

779
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:02,533
Yeah.

780
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,428
He still has a long road ahead.

781
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:05,932
He'll get there.

782
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:07,914
Brayden's always been a fighter.

783
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,365
Alderman Whitlocker,

784
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,087
I have a concern about
Brayden's recovery.

785
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:12,721
Oh, what is it?

786
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:14,583
Before Brayden was
transferred to the PICU,

787
00:35:14,608 --> 00:35:16,271
we did post-op X-rays.

788
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:19,603
I took the liberty of doing
a full skeletal survey,

789
00:35:19,628 --> 00:35:23,130
and I found several old
fractures, including,

790
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:27,245
most notably, this healed
fracture on the collarbone,

791
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,630
which is consistent
with the incident

792
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:31,091
your wife relayed
to Dr. Frost.

793
00:35:31,116 --> 00:35:32,357
What incident?

794
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:35,318
You remember when you shoved
Brayden through a door

795
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:36,419
and broke his collarbone?

796
00:35:36,444 --> 00:35:38,638
The thing about injuries
is, even if the bruises

797
00:35:38,663 --> 00:35:41,200
are long gone, the
bones keep a record.

798
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:42,401
And they don't lie.

799
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:44,142
This isn't something
you can just

800
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,622
brush under the rug, Alderman.

801
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:47,575
I don't like what
you're insinuating.

802
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,775
Oh, I'm not
insinuating anything.

803
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,846
You've clearly been
beating your son for years.

804
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:55,068
What will my X-rays say, Dad?

805
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:56,876
I've reported my
findings to the police.

806
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,075
They should be here soon.

807
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:00,169
How dare you?

808
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:02,717
You will both regret this.

809
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:06,083
You seem quite angry.

810
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:08,509
Do you want to hit me now too?

811
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,279
He wouldn't lay a hand
on anyone in public

812
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:12,436
because that would
jeopardize his career.

813
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:14,919
He's a coward at
heart, aren't you, Dad?

814
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:18,425
If I go to jail, my
sons go into the system.

815
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:19,750
No one wants that.

816
00:36:19,775 --> 00:36:21,583
Unless Jeremiah wanted

817
00:36:21,608 --> 00:36:23,443
to petition for
custody of Brayden.

818
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:25,426
Jeremiah's a minor.

819
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:27,810
He won't be 18 for another year.

820
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,315
You forgot my
birthday again, Dad.

821
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,299
I'll be 18 next week.

822
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:35,818
I need to make a call.

823
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:39,974
You do that. You'll
need a lawyer.

824
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:42,567
Thank you, both of you.

825
00:36:44,843 --> 00:36:47,105
Dr. Frost,

826
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,568
you kept your promise.

827
00:36:49,593 --> 00:36:51,551
I won't forget that.

828
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:00,466
Hey, you know,
I'm not a surgeon,

829
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:03,101
but I'm pretty sure that
a full skeletal survey

830
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:05,649
is not part of the
standard post-op procedure.

831
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:07,240
Just being thorough.

832
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:09,222
I thought you weren't
into saving souls.

833
00:37:09,716 --> 00:37:12,068
Just take the win, Dr. Frost.

834
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:13,099
Careful.

835
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:15,168
People might think
you have a heart.

836
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:22,318
So is the inquisition over?

837
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:24,966
Uh, I think so.

838
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:28,607
Mr. Reed is gathering his
stuff and then he'll head out.

839
00:37:28,632 --> 00:37:29,806
How did we do?

840
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,354
Well, you were amazing.

841
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:34,076
I can't imagine what today would

842
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:35,797
have been without your help.

843
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:39,129
As for our score, I think it's
going to be right on the line.

844
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:42,771
He said we'd know one way
or another in two weeks.

845
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:44,231
It doesn't seem fair.

846
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:46,431
We're the best
hospital in Chicago,

847
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:49,911
but we might get shut down
because we got an inspector

848
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:52,380
that's in a bad mood.

849
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,942
Sharon, what's wrong?

850
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,943
Oh, that's not good.

851
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:02,240
Mr. Reed, I can explain.

852
00:38:02,265 --> 00:38:03,185
Explain what?

853
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:06,656
Dr. Archer is technically
not on duty right now.

854
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:08,117
Well, regardless,
he and I just had

855
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:09,577
a very illuminating
conversation.

856
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:11,193
Very illuminating.

857
00:38:11,218 --> 00:38:13,802
I'm not so sure I would
take that to heart.

858
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:16,045
Oh, I think that I will.

859
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,681
I spend all day being ignored,

860
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:20,872
avoided, resented.

861
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,138
And Dean reminded me that
what I do is important.

862
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:26,469
Look, you're just
trying to make sure

863
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,602
everyone is the
best they can be.

864
00:38:28,603 --> 00:38:30,386
And I know what that's like.

865
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:32,301
People, they hate you for it.

866
00:38:32,302 --> 00:38:34,695
But I was also letting my own
frustration affect my attitude,

867
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:36,392
which was a mistake.
- That's right.

868
00:38:36,393 --> 00:38:37,869
It was?

869
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:39,228
I'll file my official
report tomorrow,

870
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:42,255
but I don't think Gaffney
has anything to worry about.

871
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,281
Well, I'm so glad.

872
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:47,285
And this guy is a gem.

873
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,814
Yay.

874
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,101
You should really
consider putting him

875
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:52,869
in a leadership position.

876
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:55,287
Good night.
- Good night.

877
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:59,165
Who was that guy?

878
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:07,619
Hey, thank you for meeting me.

879
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:09,645
Of course.

880
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,377
OK, um,

881
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:14,991
I know I've said
sorry to you a lot.

882
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:17,670
And after a while, that
can start to feel hollow.

883
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:21,892
But I am sorry for...

884
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:23,744
for all of it.

885
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:26,466
And I've been doing a
lot of thinking about...

886
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:29,119
OK, I've been...

887
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:33,278
I've been thinking a lot too.

888
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:34,299
Look, you're going
through a lot.

889
00:39:34,324 --> 00:39:36,761
I get it, but...

890
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:41,725
It's just...

891
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,534
I keep imagining that

892
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,737
I need to help you through this
rough patch with your past,

893
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:52,955
with Pawel, with Sully.

894
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,591
And I keep thinking
I'll help you

895
00:39:56,616 --> 00:40:00,072
and then we'll be OK again.

896
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:04,535
But then we get through
something, and...

897
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,258
there's always
another bad patch.

898
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,150
And at some point,

899
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:15,174
you have just start to wonder 
if all this trauma ...

900
00:40:15,198 --> 00:40:17,198
if that's just ...

901
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:22,781
it's just the way you are 
the way we are together

902
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:27,283
What are you saying?

903
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:30,228
I'm saying that I can't be
the one to save you, Mitch.

904
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,639
No, don't.
Don't... don't do this.

905
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,285
- I'm sorry.
- Please. Please.

906
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,310
- I'm sorry.
- Hannah... Hannah...

907
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:41,734
I love you

908
00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:52,008
It's not enough...

909
