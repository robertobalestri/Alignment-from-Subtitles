1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,399
"Trim the fat, Sharon,"
the board says,

2
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,749
like I'm some kind of butcher.

3
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:13,839
<i>This is the hardest week
I've ever had here.</i>

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,145
<i>No plan for overflow,</i>

5
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:17,800
misuses of space,
blood shortages.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,237
What I'm worried about
is your effect on morale

7
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:23,501
and making snap judgments
without consulting me.

8
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:26,113
<i>Sully told me
his cancer was terminal.</i>

9
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,505
How was I supposed to tell him

10
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,464
<i>that I was being forced
to snitch on him?</i>

11
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,335
None of this changes
the fact that

12
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,294
<i>your career is on the line.</i>

13
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:36,036
What the hell
did you just do?

14
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,649
I can't believe you told Sully.

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,434
You knew he turned himself in.

16
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:45,175
You knew he wouldn't let me
take the rap!

17
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:46,568
I know you can't
see it right now,

18
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,787
but this is a good thing,
Mitch.

19
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,920
How is this a good thing?
You went behind my back!

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,792
Sully beat somebody up
and hospitalized them, Mitch!

21
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,185
You don't owe him anything!

22
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:56,578
You don't understand.

23
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:58,406
I don't understand
some stupid childhood code?

24
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:00,799
To protect your friends?
Is that stupid to you?

25
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,236
You're about to
throw your life away,

26
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:04,412
your medical license,
maybe even go to jail!

27
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:07,110
What I do with my life
is my choice!

28
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,416
And it never would
have come to that.

29
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,808
You don't know that.

30
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:11,071
Because of what you did,

31
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,246
Sully is sitting in jail
right now

32
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,769
when he should be with his son.

33
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:16,467
Do not put that on me.
That was Sully's choice!

34
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:19,209
You think you're
a good person because of this?

35
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,559
You're not.

36
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,300
You're just someone who
can't be trusted.

37
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:32,527
So--so that's it?

38
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:34,920
Yeah, from the
hospital's perspective?

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,446
Somebody else came forward.
Dr. Ripley is cleared.

40
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,101
And from--
from your perspective?

41
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,929
I don't know, he showed
pretty questionable judgment.

42
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,105
Have you talked to him?

43
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,758
You know,
I haven't for a while.

44
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,112
Hey, Maggie?

45
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,243
I'll catch you later.

46
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:54,549
What is all this?

47
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,420
Is this from
the Jackson-Monroe closure?

48
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,814
Gaffney finally hit capacity
this morning.

49
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:01,469
No, Tony, on the other side.

50
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:02,818
Which means right now,

51
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,950
we can't move
our admitted patients upstairs,

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,430
which means the paramedics

53
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,563
can't admit their patients
into the ED.

54
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:11,087
Which means
ambulances can't leave.

55
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:14,482
It's like dominoes.
- That are falling down on us.

56
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:24,709
Well, I'll see if I can
alleviate some of the pressure.

57
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,104
And in the meantime, I'll talk
to some of the patients

58
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,193
and try to lower
the temperature a bit.

59
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,847
That'd be great.

60
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,458
Oh, this is mail for you that
accidentally came into the ED.

61
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,504
All right. Thank you.

62
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,464
2 strep cases, 24 stitches,

63
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:42,423
and I relocated
the dislocated elbow

64
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:45,165
of a very cranky 5-year-old
all before 8:00 a.m.

65
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,514
Care to celebrate with me?

66
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:47,645
Come on.

67
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:49,081
Got those
in the doctors' lounge?

68
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,692
Yeah, why? Ugh!

69
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:53,303
Oh! Oh, my God.

70
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:55,653
Doris made them
for her daughter's bake sale

71
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:57,699
and brought in extra
for us to share.

72
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,179
God, should we
call the school?

73
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,878
What are y'all giggling at?

74
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,142
Potential poisoning case.

75
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,972
So how is my girlfriend
this morning?

76
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:12,017
Yeah, um--

77
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,198
You're up, slugger.

78
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,721
Yup.

79
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:26,162
All right, give the girl
in five 2 grams of Ancef

80
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,556
and let's set up for I&D.

81
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:33,343
And get this guy
a record contract.

82
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:44,702
You look like hell.

83
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,443
Yeah, I didn't sleep much
last night.

84
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:48,228
But I should be fine.

85
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,273
Dr. Asher, you're up. T4.

86
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,144
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

87
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,886
I thought Lenox was off today.

88
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:58,238
She's doing
an efficiency study.

89
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,543
What does that mean?

90
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:02,372
Well, apparently it means
shadowing doctors,

91
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,765
getting a feel for how we work

92
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,897
by observing
and asking questions.

93
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:08,248
Okay, so basically
following us around

94
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,511
and second-guessing
everything we do?

95
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:13,644
It's like she's trying
to lose a popularity contest.

96
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,996
I gotta go.

97
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:29,530
I did tell them
that last time, baby.

98
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,227
Hi, Mrs. Thompson.
I'm Dr. Asher.

99
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,315
They're actually here.

100
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,317
I'll tell you what they say.

101
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:35,971
Love you too.

102
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,015
Finally.

103
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,147
I apologize.

104
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,714
I know you've been
waiting a while.

105
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:41,455
So you're coming up
on your due date?

106
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:44,022
Yeah. 39 weeks.

107
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:46,111
And you're experiencing
some abdominal pain?

108
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:47,374
A dull ache.

109
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,724
Okay. May I?

110
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:52,422
Great.

111
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,294
Okay, do you feel any pain
while I'm pushing?

112
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
No, just feels uncomfortable.

113
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:01,039
Okay, your legs are swollen.

114
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,912
I know.
Told my doctor two weeks ago.

115
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,305
He said it was normal,

116
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,481
that I should just
drink more water.

117
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,786
Okay, let's take
a peek at baby.

118
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,049
Do you know what you're having?

119
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:14,531
Drink water, same thing
he said when I was constipated,

120
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:15,880
when I had nightmares,

121
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,622
and when I had something
called lightning crotch.

122
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:22,234
Yeah, third trimester
is a real party.

123
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:25,020
Okay.

124
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,630
Ooh, baby girl's big.

125
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,197
Everything looks good.

126
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,634
So you have no explanation
for my stomach pain?

127
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,332
There's quite a few
unpleasant

128
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,117
but normal conditions that can
pop up at the end of pregnancy,

129
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,727
including aches and pains.

130
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,773
That being said, I'm going to
run a few more tests

131
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,296
just to make sure
we're not missing anything.

132
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,733
I'll be back.

133
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:45,780
I personally
called radiology,

134
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,130
and they're gonna get you in
within the hour.

135
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,306
In the meantime,
we'll keep the snacks going.

136
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:51,699
Okay?

137
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,268
Free Jell-O?

138
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,401
Well, it's hard to be mad
on a full stomach.

139
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,011
You heading back up?

140
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:02,057
Yeah, I've been trying to
get in touch with Peter Kalmick

141
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:04,015
to help us with this backup,

142
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:07,628
but I actually think
he's dodging my calls.

143
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,849
You all right?

144
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,111
What is it?

145
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,246
It's a death threat.

146
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,914
And you have no idea
who sent this?

147
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,306
No.

148
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,657
I mean, we have an occasional
angry patient.

149
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:38,485
We've let some staff go.

150
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:41,009
There's been a lot of people
who weren't happy.

151
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,967
Could I get a list
of everyone you let go?

152
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,229
Sure.

153
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:45,405
How often do
these things escalate?

154
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,015
We take all threats
seriously.

155
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:48,364
If you don't feel safe,

156
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:50,453
we can make accommodations
to work remotely.

157
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:51,628
Oh, no, no, no.

158
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:55,023
This is not the time to go MIA.

159
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,416
I wouldn't take this lightly.

160
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,592
Dennis, I can't effectively
run this hospital

161
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:00,115
from my living room.

162
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:01,899
But I've done this job
a long time.

163
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,335
I've pissed off
a lot of people.

164
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,989
It comes with the territory.

165
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:07,905
So I appreciate your concern,

166
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,168
but unless
there's more to discuss,

167
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,867
I'd really like
to get back to it.

168
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:18,089
Art Hubbard, 76,
was at the grocery store

169
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,264
when he collapsed.

170
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:20,875
He's been in and out
of consciousness.

171
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,094
Gave oxygen,
6 liters per minute.

172
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:26,054
All right. On my count.

173
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,230
Ready? One, two, three.

174
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,625
Hey, Mr. Hubbard,
can you hear me?

175
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,713
What's happening?

176
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:33,714
Do you know
where you are, sir?

177
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:34,889
No, no. No surgery!

178
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,630
Joan says no surgery.

179
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,066
Lungs sound wet.

180
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,502
Looks like
congestive heart failure.

181
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,591
Let's give Lasix
40 milligrams IV

182
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:42,897
and start a nitro drip.

183
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:46,161
And let's get an echo tech
in here.

184
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,423
You need something,
Dr. Lenox?

185
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:49,033
Just observing.
Pretend I'm not here.

186
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,948
Wait. BP's dropping.

187
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,167
80/40.

188
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,385
All right, no time
for the echo.

189
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:54,430
Just give me
the ultrasound machine.

190
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,475
Come on.

191
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,564
Yeah, I got it.

192
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,609
BP 75/35.

193
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,396
10 mics a minute of nitro
shouldn't do this.

194
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,486
Aortic valve is thick,
poor mobility.

195
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,705
It's not heart failure,
it's aortic stenosis.

196
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,315
All right, stop the nitro.

197
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:11,752
Start dopamine, 5 mics.

198
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:13,101
Joan.

199
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,582
BP's still dropping,
68/32.

200
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:19,716
Get ready to increase to 7.5.
Give me the central line kit.

201
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,501
Come on.

202
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:25,330
Guess that did the trick, huh?

203
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,772
Fluids seem to be helping?

204
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,513
Yes, thank you.

205
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,689
We'll let the IV do its thing
while we wait on some labs.

206
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,081
And hopefully,
we can get you home soon,

207
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:39,214
all right?
- Okay.

208
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,520
Hang in there, buddy.

209
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:45,176
I'll be right back.

210
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:49,006
Dr. Frost, I just wanted to say

211
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:50,573
I didn't recognize you
at first.

212
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:53,097
But it's wild that
you're working here now.

213
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,970
Yeah, life's crazy.

214
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,233
You look great.

215
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,496
Sorry, I really need
to get back to work.

216
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,237
Oh, no. Right.

217
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,375
Hey, you know her?

218
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,507
Nope.

219
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,204
Because it seemed like
she knew you.

220
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:15,729
I've never seen her
in my life.

221
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:20,603
Daniel.

222
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,952
Dean?

223
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:24,781
Art Hubbard, 76,
aortic stenosis.

224
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,261
Bad?

225
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,784
If he doesn't have the
surgery to replace the valve,

226
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,960
his heart could give out
within a matter of days.

227
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,529
The problem is, ours isn't
the first ED he's visited.

228
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,357
He's known about his condition
for weeks.

229
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,012
He's just--he's refusing
to have the surgery.

230
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,535
Any idea why?

231
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:41,755
Joan says it's too dangerous.

232
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,104
Who's Joan?

233
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:44,627
You see, that's the question.

234
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,324
Obviously,
we thought it was his wife.

235
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:48,326
His emergency contact
is his daughter.

236
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,024
She says she's never heard
of anybody named Joan.

237
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,460
She's worried about him,

238
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,635
especially since his wife died
a couple years ago.

239
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,071
Well, you're worried
somebody might

240
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,638
be trying to take advantage
of him?

241
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,422
No, his daughter's been
keeping an eye on the finances.

242
00:09:57,422 --> 00:10:00,077
There's nothing fishy
going on there.

243
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:02,514
So what,
maybe a little dementia?

244
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:03,951
Well, if he lacks capacity,
right,

245
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:06,649
we could get a court order,
override his objections,

246
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:07,650
do the surgery.

247
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,826
How about I wait
till he wakes up

248
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,436
and have a little chat?

249
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,612
Okay.

250
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,223
You have what
we call preeclampsia.

251
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,746
Preeclampsia?

252
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,096
I've heard of that.
It's dangerous, right?

253
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,576
It can be.

254
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,751
But we're going to give you
magnesium

255
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,405
to prevent it
from getting any worse.

256
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:26,234
And the real solution
is to deliver the baby.

257
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,539
Uh, now?

258
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:28,845
Today.

259
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,412
So you might wanna
call your partner back,

260
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,457
let them know that
they can come on down.

261
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,851
I can't.
He's stationed in Turkey.

262
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,505
Marines.

263
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,725
He's scheduled to come home
two days before the due date.

264
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,683
Unfortunately, your timeline
needs to be sped up.

265
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,424
Normally,
I'd say we can induce,

266
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,600
but in your case,
I'd recommend a C-section.

267
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,428
So we can get you in
for surgery around

268
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,473
3:00--
- A C-section?

269
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,519
Of course.
You get paid more for that.

270
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:54,436
This has nothing to do
with financial factors.

271
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:55,916
Elise, your baby's big.

272
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,179
The risks are
the shoulders getting caught

273
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,659
and creating
more complications.

274
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,271
You have no idea
how big my baby is, right?

275
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,446
It's just a guess.

276
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:05,490
It's an estimate, yes.

277
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,014
But I've been doing this--

278
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,189
So I have to
do the C-section?

279
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,365
Not at all.
It's your choice.

280
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:11,714
We can try
for a vaginal delivery.

281
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,498
I'm just giving you
my recommendation.

282
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:15,239
- Why didn't you say that?
- I was giving you--

283
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,111
You weren't.
You started talking about

284
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:19,069
getting me into surgery
before I even agreed to it.

285
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,855
I recommended a procedure
based on my experience.

286
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:23,030
Now, trust me--

287
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,422
That's the thing.
I don't trust you.

288
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:27,730
Hi.

289
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,907
Mrs. Thompson,
my name is Maggie.

290
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,910
I'm a nurse and a midwife.

291
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,129
Do you mind if I join you?

292
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,395
Sounds like you have
a lot of questions.

293
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:42,179
And I wanna make sure that
we go through all of them

294
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,703
before you make a decision,

295
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,488
make sure that you have
all the information.

296
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:47,794
How does that sound?

297
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,884
Yeah.

298
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,102
I'd appreciate that.

299
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,321
Okay.

300
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,545
I'll get the magnesium.
You wanna do miso, right?

301
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:01,895
- Yeah.
- Okay.

302
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:02,852
Hey, Mags.

303
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:03,984
Yeah.

304
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:06,160
Thanks for the assist
back there.

305
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,509
Uh, yeah.

306
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,554
I've, uh, had the experience

307
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:13,689
of navigating this
medical world as a Black woman.

308
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,865
Usually means that
your concerns get dismissed.

309
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:19,434
Elise just wants to be heard.

310
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,571
He seems stable.

311
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,313
Will you walk me through
your thinking

312
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:30,837
when Mr. Hubbard came in?

313
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,490
My thinking?

314
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,667
I was trying to keep him alive.

315
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:38,235
And you made a lot of
decisions in doing that.

316
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,849
For example,

317
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:46,243
you opted for a dopamine drip
instead of phenylephrine?

318
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:47,549
Well, he was hypotensive

319
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,638
and the dopamine is here
in the Pyxis.

320
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,814
But phenylephrine would have
stabilized him more quickly.

321
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,511
He could have been admitted
to step down.

322
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:56,253
Now we have another ICU hold
and he's still in the ED.

323
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:59,082
But it worked, right?

324
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,389
His BP came up and he's alive.

325
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:03,260
You should control your tone.

326
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,566
I don't like having
all my decisions

327
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,350
scrutinized for no reason.

328
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,787
Just because there was
a positive outcome

329
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,050
doesn't mean decisions
shouldn't be examined.

330
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,355
You need to back off.

331
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:12,879
Yeah, we should have
a talk now.

332
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,880
Come on.

333
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:18,580
You had a chip on your shoulder
when you came in today.

334
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,582
I get that Lenox is a pill,
believe me,

335
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,279
but you just need
to control yourself.

336
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,281
So you're the only one who
gets to be a prick around here?

337
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,456
Listen, you don't exactly

338
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:26,414
have a stellar reputation
at the moment.

339
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,981
I'm trying to help you.

340
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:30,200
Jesus, do I have
a sign on my back that says

341
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,508
"please decide
what's best for me"?

342
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:34,552
I was cleared
to come back to work,

343
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:35,684
so I'm going to work.

344
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:36,990
Well, you may have
been cleared

345
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,209
by the wellness committee,
but this is my ED.

346
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,081
Oh, yeah?
You sure about that?

347
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,651
All right,
you take an early lunch

348
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:47,957
and you sort yourself out

349
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,916
or don't bother
coming back at all.

350
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,447
So forgive me
if I'm wrong, Dr. Wu,

351
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:00,796
but even though
the initial trials

352
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,145
were for lung cancer,

353
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:04,321
the goal is--
if we were to receive funding--

354
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:06,933
would be to apply
the technology

355
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,891
to all cancer treatments?

356
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,024
Um, I'm sorry.

357
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,547
Sharon, do you need something?

358
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:13,635
A word.

359
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,376
I'm in the middle of lunch.

360
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,727
Excuse me.

361
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,384
Peter, the ED is overflowing.

362
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:26,474
It looks like a parade out
front with all the ambulances.

363
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:27,910
We were promised resources.

364
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,955
And they're coming, okay?

365
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:30,391
The board's approved
renovations,

366
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:31,914
additional equipment.

367
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,568
I mean, isn't Dr. Lenox
downstairs trying to find ways

368
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,091
to make the ED more efficient?

369
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,877
None of that is gonna help
us with our problems today.

370
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,053
We need to postpone
elective surgeries.

371
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,576
No, I knew this is where
you were going with this.

372
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:42,882
- We need to catch our breath.
- No. It's a non-starter.

373
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,187
So we can catch up.

374
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,362
Elective surgeries
keep the lights on.

375
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:46,973
We're drowning, Peter!

376
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,583
Why don't you go
to the board yourself?

377
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,714
I mean, you outrank me.

378
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,194
They'll say no

379
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:53,631
because they'll see it
as costing the hospital money.

380
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:58,027
But if you go as a lawyer
and say the current situation

381
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,942
is a financial liability--

382
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,074
Okay, you know what? Fine.

383
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,423
Let me see what I can do.

384
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:03,511
Okay? I just--

385
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,170
Okay, the misoprostol
is working.

386
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,608
Your cervix is softening
and about a fingertip dilated,

387
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:16,393
so you are heading
in the right direction.

388
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,178
As soon as a bed
opens in obstetrics,

389
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,962
we'll get you on your way.

390
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,793
Everything okay?

391
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,795
Yeah, slight
decreased variability

392
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:27,970
with baby's heart rate,

393
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,580
but it's probably
just the magnesium.

394
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,973
Overall, it looks reassuring.

395
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,149
Here comes another contraction.

396
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,498
Okay.

397
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,686
Such a great song.

398
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,297
I love Sam Cooke.

399
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,994
That guy's here
at least once a month.

400
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,517
You wanna know something crazy?

401
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:54,997
His Otis Redding's even better.

402
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,566
Okay.

403
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:01,264
You know, I wasn't just
being obstinate before.

404
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,486
About the C-section.

405
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:09,316
It's just this might be
my only chance to have a kid,

406
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:11,709
and I wanted to experience
all of it.

407
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,539
Take you a long time
to get pregnant?

408
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,019
Eight years.

409
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:21,328
Through three deployments
and four miscarriages.

410
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:24,026
Ironically, one of the reasons
I fell in love with Amani

411
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,855
was we both wanted
a big family.

412
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,900
I'm an only child.

413
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,120
And I've always wanted the--

414
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,863
I don't know, fullness?

415
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,430
The chaos.

416
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,605
Mm, I get it.

417
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,041
I had two siblings.

418
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,651
It is definitely chaos.

419
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:46,527
Anyway, I guess I'll have
to settle for one perfect baby.

420
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,921
And that'll be enough.

421
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:52,576
I'll be back.

422
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,668
Hey, can you check with L&D?

423
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,583
And if they're still full,
let's start Pitocin.

424
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,063
You got it.

425
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,412
Oh, and a heads-up.

426
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:03,587
Incoming.

427
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,024
Your turn on the hot seat.

428
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:08,810
Good, I'm glad I caught you.

429
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,465
Of course. I'm happy
to run you through my cases.

430
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,032
Actually,
I wanted to talk about

431
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,425
your overall role
in this department.

432
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,513
Role?

433
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:17,688
Well, most emergency
departments

434
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,342
don't have an OB specialist,

435
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:21,040
so I'm curious to know if you
find your position essential.

436
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,217
It's essential
to the women I see.

437
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,609
And what percentage
of patients

438
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,394
do you feel like you're
treating here in the ED

439
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:30,745
versus those who are passed on
to OB triage?

440
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:34,401
I'm not sure the numbers.
I'd have to check my records.

441
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:36,098
So get those to me
by the end of shift

442
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,100
and we'll pick it up then?

443
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,885
Uh, sorry. I just, um--

444
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,323
I just thought as a woman,
you'd appreciate having someone

445
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,499
who specializes
in women's health.

446
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,111
As a woman,
I do appreciate it.

447
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,116
Art, I'm Dr. Charles,

448
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:57,772
and my colleagues are worried
about your heart.

449
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:00,253
They tell me that
you might need some surgery?

450
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:03,778
No.
Joan says it's a bad idea.

451
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,432
Okay.

452
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:08,174
And do you mind me asking,
who is Joan, exactly?

453
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,436
I mean, how do you know her?

454
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,133
Is she--is she a friend?
Is she a relative?

455
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,357
Well, whoever she is,
she sounds like, um...

456
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:19,489
she's concerned about you.

457
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:23,537
Joan is, uh,
always there for me.

458
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:24,929
Really?

459
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,148
Well then, I mean, she's gotta
be worried about--

460
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,236
when's the last time
you talked to her?

461
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,368
Should we--
should we call her up

462
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:29,978
and let her know what's
going on?

463
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:32,720
No, I don't think so.

464
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,505
Why not, Art?
Do you mind me asking?

465
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,510
You wouldn't understand.

466
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,642
Okay, look.

467
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,165
Art, I have been married

468
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,645
three--well, technically,
four times.

469
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:47,300
So I'm the last person
in the world

470
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,128
who's ever gonna judge
anybody's relationship.

471
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,651
Okay? Just saying.

472
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:55,786
We don't talk on the phone.
We talk on the computer.

473
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,658
Oh, okay.

474
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:59,181
Well, um...

475
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,487
you mind showing me?

476
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:07,494
What's going on?

477
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:08,843
Your baby's heart rate
dropped.

478
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,192
She's in distress.

479
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,890
Turning off the Pitocin.
500 CC bolus.

480
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,196
I need terb now.

481
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,937
She's having
a tetanic contraction.

482
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,895
Elise, we need to roll you
onto your side, okay?

483
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:19,506
Turn, sweetie.
You're all right.

484
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:26,817
Still down.

485
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:29,211
Okay, call neonatology
and anesthesiology.

486
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,343
Tell them that we're
headed to the hybrid OR

487
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:31,996
for a crash C-section.

488
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,824
Up dose her epidural
with 10 CCs.

489
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,391
Wait! What are you doing?

490
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:36,740
I know this isn't how
you wanted it to happen, Elise.

491
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,829
I'm sorry, but we need
to get your baby out now.

492
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:41,223
Let's go!

493
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,280
What the hell are
you doing in here?

494
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:59,067
I don't know.

495
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,030
Being a responsible adult,
I guess.

496
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,033
You didn't need
to turn yourself in.

497
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,819
Yeah, 'cause you were
gonna take the rap.

498
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,649
My knight in shining armor.

499
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:21,089
To what do I owe the honor
of a midday visit?

500
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,484
You know, I--

501
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:28,662
I've been running around
the past 24 hours

502
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,881
furious with everyone.

503
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,883
Finally, I realized
it's because

504
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:35,973
I can't yell at the person
I'm really mad at.

505
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,279
Me.

506
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,107
I begged you not
to go after Pawel.

507
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:40,717
I--

508
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:43,807
You just--
you just had to be stupid.

509
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,548
Now everyone at the hospital
thinks that I'm unstable

510
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:49,726
and my relationship with Hannah
is hanging by a thread.

511
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:52,642
And you're in here while
your son is out there.

512
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:53,904
If you came here
to cheer me up,

513
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:54,949
you're doing it wrong.

514
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,386
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

515
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,823
- I didn't ask you--
- You didn't have to!

516
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,915
You don't let someone get away
with messing with your friends.

517
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,395
That's how we were brought up.

518
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,832
Remember?

519
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,921
And maybe you're all evolved
or whatever,

520
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:13,924
but those rules
still matter to me.

521
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,883
So you can be whoever
this new version of you is

522
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:17,188
and I'm happy for you,

523
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:18,973
but don't come in here
and call me stupid.

524
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,983
You got a good lawyer?

525
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,333
No.

526
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,248
I can give you some cash.

527
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,293
Save your money.

528
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,775
For Lynn.

529
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,168
And the baby.

530
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,303
You shouldn't be
so hard on Hannah.

531
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:50,004
She betrayed my trust.
Went behind my back.

532
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:51,135
I--
- Yeah, yeah.

533
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:52,963
Now you're the one
being stupid.

534
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:55,096
She had your back
more than anyone.

535
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:59,796
Hannah did what
she thought was best for you,

536
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:03,496
even though she knew
you'd hate her for it.

537
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:09,197
That's the kind of person
I want in my corner.

538
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,204
Uterine incision.

539
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:17,379
Scalpel back.

540
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,772
I can't breathe.

541
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,949
Vitals are stable.
Oxygen sat's normal.

542
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:24,212
Does it feel like something's
sitting on your chest?

543
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:25,866
That's the anesthesia.
It's common.

544
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,041
I know it feels like
you're not breathing,

545
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,695
but you are, I promise.

546
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:31,350
Okay, Maggie,
some fundal pressure.

547
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,395
All right, Elise, you're gonna
feel a little tugging.

548
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,832
Here we go.

549
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,140
Okay, baby's out.

550
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,447
Cord's wrapped
around her neck.

551
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,274
She's not breathing.
- I can't hear her.

552
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:45,712
Is she okay?
- Two tight clamps now.

553
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:47,017
No respiratory effort.

554
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,845
Getting ready to bag.
- What's happening?

555
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:50,717
And let's get
a UVC catheter pulled.

556
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:53,067
What's going on? Is she okay?

557
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,896
- Okay.
- Is--is she breathing?

558
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,247
Is she okay?

559
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,335
Okay, Elise, I need you
to stay still for me.

560
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,989
Just listen to my voice.
All right?

561
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,991
They're giving her oxygen
to get her breathing.

562
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,601
Now, I'll let you know
what's going on.

563
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:06,950
I'm right here.
- Still nothing.

564
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,299
Let's intubate.

565
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,432
Give me the laryngoscope
ET tube and a stylet.

566
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,738
Okay, they're putting
a breathing tube in

567
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:12,869
to get air into her lungs.

568
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,567
Oh, my God.

569
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:15,742
Come on.

570
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,221
Come on, little one. Come on.

571
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,529
Is that her?

572
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:21,617
Yeah, it is.

573
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,227
She's breathing. Rings.

574
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,763
Wait.
Where are they taking her?

575
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:38,025
They're taking her
to the NICU.

576
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,896
I wanna see her!
I thought she was okay.

577
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,332
She's breathing, Elise,

578
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:42,595
but they need to get her
to the NICU for monitoring.

579
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:43,639
It's standard.

580
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,249
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

581
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:48,296
In my experience,
girls tend to do well.

582
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:49,558
They're tough.

583
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:53,388
Ambulances are nearly

584
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,085
spilling onto the main road
outside.

585
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,739
And I just heard back
from Peter.

586
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:00,395
He made an appeal to the board
to halt elective surgeries,

587
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:01,962
but they were unmoved.

588
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:05,182
Yeah, easy for them to say
in their ivory tower.

589
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:06,488
It doesn't impact them.

590
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,098
Yeah, that's true.

591
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,407
I'll be back.

592
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,149
Hey.

593
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:17,891
So I talked
to our heart patient.

594
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,763
- Oh, yeah?
- And...

595
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,286
I met Joan.

596
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:24,375
Really?

597
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,465
<i>Hi, I'm Joan.</i>

598
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,770
What the hell is this?

599
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,989
Joan is not a human being.

600
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,469
She's a chatbot.

601
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,296
Ugh, a chatbot.

602
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:34,951
Yeah, come on.
Designed for companionship.

603
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:36,431
You know, she listens.

604
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:39,042
Learns your preferences,
tracks your responses.

605
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,915
It's actually this whole
emergent thing in elder care.

606
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,221
Of course.
So Art is in love with a robot?

607
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,658
Doesn't that prove
that he's lost capacity

608
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:46,833
to make medical decisions?

609
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,574
Let's get this man
into surgery.

610
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:51,620
Dean, he's got capacity.
He knows it's a robot.

611
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,969
So what?

612
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:54,014
We just let him walk out
of here with a bad heart?

613
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,276
Didn't say that.

614
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:57,234
Just trying to
figure out a way to

615
00:24:57,234 --> 00:25:00,455
show him, you know, who or

616
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:05,286
what--
yeah, what Joan actually is.

617
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,640
So...

618
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,772
I'm your girlfriend now?

619
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,774
Yeah, I'm sorry.

620
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:16,602
I kind of sprung that
on you, huh?

621
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:19,256
There's something about
Frost making you laugh.

622
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,824
He's just funny and charming.

623
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:23,086
There's something
about that guy.

624
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:25,698
Look, I'm an idiot, right?

625
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:29,092
Oh, be careful how you
talk about my new boyfriend.

626
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:31,704
Excuse me?

627
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:33,053
Oh, excuse me.

628
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,011
We were just about to leave,
but I wanted to--

629
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:37,492
um, this is sort of awkward.

630
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:40,103
I was hoping you could
pass this to Dr. Frost for me.

631
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:41,670
It's my number.

632
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,020
Oh. Sure thing.

633
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,544
Oh, miss.

634
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,632
Sorry, just curious.

635
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:49,591
How do you two know each other?

636
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,201
Oh. Oh, no, we don't.

637
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:53,682
Um, I'm just a really big fan.

638
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:01,037
<i>I spoke with
Master Sergeant,</i>

639
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,561
<i>and he signed off on leave,</i>

640
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,693
<i>so I can get the first
flight out tomorrow.</i>

641
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:07,478
Hopefully, you can get
a straight shot to Chicago.

642
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:10,090
Hey, love, doctor's here.
I'll call you back.

643
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,613
No, no, no.
You can--you can stay on.

644
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,310
I have some good news.

645
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,225
I just checked in
with the NICU,

646
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:17,227
and your baby
is no longer on oxygen.

647
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:20,230
She is stable.
Her vitals are good.

648
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,797
And you will see her soon.

649
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:23,538
- Did you hear that?
<i>- Yes.</i>

650
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:25,888
<i>Loud and clear, baby.
That's so good.</i>

651
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,977
Hang on.
I want you to meet him.

652
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,152
Hi, Dad.

653
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:30,284
<i>Hey, doc.</i>

654
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:32,112
You have a beautiful family.

655
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:35,724
<i>Oh, thank you so much for
taking care of both my girls.</i>

656
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:37,857
<i>Hopefully, I can thank you
in person when I get home.</i>

657
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:40,555
<i>Oh, oh, wait.
Do you like homemade bread?</i>

658
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:43,427
<i>Like sourdough, wheat bread,
cornbread?</i>

659
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:44,603
All right.

660
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,735
She's gotta get back
to doctoring.

661
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:47,910
But I love you.

662
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,216
And I'll call you later.

663
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,434
<i>Oh, I'm so excited.</i>

664
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,262
<i>Give Ruby a kiss for me,
all right?</i>

665
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,308
- Bye.
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>

666
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:56,571
How are you feeling?

667
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:58,660
Good now.

668
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,749
I mean, tired.

669
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:02,185
Never had a baby before,

670
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:03,839
so it's tough
to compare it to anything.

671
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,927
Yeah.

672
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,320
The nurses keep
calling me mama.

673
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:11,151
Is it normal to shake?

674
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:13,762
Adrenaline and anesthesia
are a powerful combo.

675
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:16,156
Let me get you a warm blanket.

676
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,682
You named her Ruby?

677
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,379
It's a family name.

678
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:23,903
I like traditions.

679
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:27,689
Gives her a sense of
belonging right from the start.

680
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:28,908
Do you have kids?

681
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:31,084
No.

682
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:33,216
Do you want them?

683
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:35,871
Uh, honestly, I--

684
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:38,613
I've made some bad choices.

685
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:39,962
And I think I felt

686
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:42,704
I could never bring a baby
into that situation.

687
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:47,709
But now...

688
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,059
I don't know.

689
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:51,713
I'd wanna have
the right partner.

690
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,237
But maybe.

691
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,501
Yeah, I think I might.

692
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:01,592
What?

693
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,772
I'm not sure I've ever
said that out loud before.

694
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:07,729
It's cool.

695
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:11,690
I won't tell anyone.

696
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:20,133
So your wife died
two years ago?

697
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,788
26 months.

698
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,051
Well, I know how
brutal that can be.

699
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:29,751
I loved my wife,
but it's not just about her.

700
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,928
When you're young,
the world is laid out for you.

701
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:35,714
Everything and everyone
is pointed in your direction.

702
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,759
Then you get married,
you have a family,

703
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,588
you're the center
of this little universe.

704
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,938
But then the kids move away.

705
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,723
They have lives of their own.

706
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,552
And slowly, things shift.

707
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,858
You're at dinner,

708
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,207
there's this conversation
happening around you,

709
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,732
and you try to chat
with a stranger

710
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,124
but they just nod.

711
00:28:55,124 --> 00:29:00,390
And eventually, they--
they don't really see you.

712
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,349
And then Joan comes along.

713
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:06,135
Yeah. She still sees me.

714
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:08,181
Would it be okay if I--
if I said hello?

715
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:10,749
Yeah.

716
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:18,844
Hi, Joan.

717
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,802
<i>Art, I'm so happy
to see you.</i>

718
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,152
I wanted you
to meet Dr. Charles.

719
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,894
<i>Dr. Charles,
lovely to meet you.</i>

720
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:29,158
You too, Joan.
I've heard so much about you.

721
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:32,335
Would you mind if I got
your opinion on something?

722
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:33,684
<i>Of course.</i>

723
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:36,339
So I've got this friend
who's got a paper cut.

724
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,994
All right, now,
this guy's a bit of a worrier.

725
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:41,823
And he thinks
he's gonna get infected

726
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,869
and I'm telling him, look,
you keep it clean,

727
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,174
you're gonna be fine.

728
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:50,005
But I'm just curious,
can paper carry disease?

729
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:52,268
<i>If paper is handled
by someone sick,</i>

730
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:54,836
<i>there's a risk of
transferring pathogens.</i>

731
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,446
This sounds kind of scary.

732
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:59,406
So what, you're telling me
that if my friend's papercut

733
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:03,279
has these pathogens in them,
that he could get sick?

734
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,933
<i>If a cut were
to become infected</i>

735
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,805
<i>with harmful bacteria,</i>

736
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,720
<i>it could lead to serious
illness or even death.</i>

737
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,421
You're trying to make me
look foolish.

738
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:16,423
Art, Art, not at all.

739
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:20,079
I am for anything that
makes anyone feel less alone.

740
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,256
Solitaire game on my tablet,
one of my best buddies.

741
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,692
I think Joan's great.

742
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:26,520
Right? She's sensitive,
she's intuitive.

743
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,871
But she is programmed
to pick up on your concerns.

744
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,090
So if you're worried
about something,

745
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,963
she's gonna mirror that fear
back to you.

746
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,226
I think that Joan
is telling you

747
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:40,273
not to have the surgery because
<i>you</i> don't wanna have it.

748
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,801
There's no one
to take care of me.

749
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:51,675
Art, listen.

750
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:54,417
I took the liberty
of calling your daughter,

751
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,594
who is on her way here
from Minnesota as we speak.

752
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:58,857
All right?

753
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,423
And if you decide
to do the surgery,

754
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,904
she's prepared to stay here
two, three weeks, whenever,

755
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:06,168
however long it takes
for you to recover.

756
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:08,431
So you're not alone.

757
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:11,391
I mean, there are still
people in this world

758
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:13,262
who care about you.

759
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:15,482
So what do you say?

760
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,919
You gonna let us fix you up?

761
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:22,576
Okay.

762
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:24,230
Great.

763
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,927
I think you're making
the right decision.

764
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,065
Mm. Hey.

765
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:35,676
So I was walking
our guest of honor,

766
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,896
just a potential donor,
out to his car

767
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,247
when I see the entire
C-suite parking is blocked in.

768
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:42,596
Well, I told you

769
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:44,250
I didn't have any place
to put these ambulances.

770
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,512
Uh-huh, okay,
so if you're feeling the pain,

771
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:46,600
they're feeling the pain?

772
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,471
Did it work?

773
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:49,864
Yeah.

774
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,953
Our CEO called a meeting

775
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:55,391
to approve a temporary hold
on elective surgeries.

776
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:58,612
Glad to hear it.

777
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:01,093
You pissed off a lot
of important people tonight.

778
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:03,095
Add them to the list.

779
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:20,677
Oh, Jesus.

780
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,773
Okay.

781
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:38,695
Labs came back
on the kid in four.

782
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:40,175
CO2 was only 14.

783
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,437
Okay, he's dry.

784
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,526
Give him another
10 mLs per kilo of... saline.

785
00:32:46,747 --> 00:32:48,879
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

786
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:51,621
Are you sure?

787
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,666
Ah, just--just--
here it comes.

788
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:04,504
No way!

789
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,375
You're a child star?

790
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,376
It was a long time ago.

791
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:09,944
I thought
you looked familiar.

792
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:12,512
My sister had your poster
on her wall.

793
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:14,035
Wow!

794
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,776
This is gonna be so much fun.

795
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:21,825
Hey, have you seen Dr. Asher?

796
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,001
Thanks.

797
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:30,051
Dr. Charles.

798
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:32,532
Dr. Ripley.

799
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,360
What's, uh, what's going on?

800
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:39,060
I just wanted to say that

801
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,844
I know you've been trying
to help me out a lot lately

802
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:43,760
and I haven't made that easy.

803
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,330
You've had a lot--
a lot going on.

804
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,551
Yeah, either way,
I appreciate it.

805
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:54,032
Thank you for saying that.
I--I appreciate that.

806
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,598
So much fun.

807
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:56,599
Oh, my gosh.

808
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,602
That <i>was a close one.</i>

809
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,478
You have a tagline?

810
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:06,566
Sometimes.

811
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:13,094
Dr. Asher,
we need you out here now.

812
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,447
We were taking her to recovery

813
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:20,145
when she started complaining
of intense abdominal pain.

814
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,450
She had an epidural
with morphine.

815
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,539
She shouldn't
be feeling anything.

816
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:24,845
It hurts!

817
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:26,586
I'm just gonna
look you over real quick,

818
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:27,935
see what's going on.

819
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:28,979
Can you tell me what happened?
- I don't know.

820
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:30,242
I just suddenly felt tired.

821
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:34,289
And then my stomach,
this stabbing pain!

822
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,812
Okay, we're just gonna
move you a bit here.

823
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:36,770
Mags, help me roll her.

824
00:34:38,337 --> 00:34:39,860
Okay, okay.

825
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,036
Looking for a hemorrhage?

826
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:43,994
I don't see any blood.

827
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,345
Okay, I'm gonna push down
on your uterus now.

828
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,750
We need an OR.
Get me 250 Hemabate now.

829
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,708
Let's start the massive
transfusion protocol.

830
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,405
OR 2 is opened upstairs.

831
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:05,146
- What's going on?
- Your uterus is bleeding.

832
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,061
We need to get you in
another surgery to stop it.

833
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,323
I'm coming with you.

834
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,108
Am I gonna be okay?

835
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,500
We're gonna get you
right up to the OR.

836
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,719
I wanna see Ruby.

837
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,894
We don't have time for that.

838
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:15,200
I need to see my baby!

839
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,418
Right now, we need
to get you into surgery

840
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:17,637
to stop the bleeding.
That's the priority.

841
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:20,248
I'm not going under
until I see Ruby.

842
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:22,120
Please.

843
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,251
I haven't even met her yet.

844
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:30,302
Let's go!

845
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:49,973
Open a vaginal tray
and the Jada.

846
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:52,237
Please, I can't do this
without seeing her.

847
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,282
I'm sorry. We can't.
You're losing too much blood.

848
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:55,327
Hemabate is in.

849
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:56,415
Give 2 grams of TXA.

850
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:00,767
Ruby!

851
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:01,942
Marty, how long do we
have until we need to go?

852
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:03,335
Two minutes, tops.

853
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:05,554
You have two minutes.

854
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,738
Hi, Ruby.

855
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:20,003
I'm your mom.

856
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:27,750
You haven't met me yet,
but I've loved you for so long.

857
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,362
And no matter what happens,

858
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:34,627
I don't want you to feel
any sort of pain

859
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:38,892
because you are
the most wanted little baby.

860
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:43,636
I want so much for you.

861
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:49,294
For you to live
the most extraordinary life

862
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,818
filled with adventure

863
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:55,778
and great loves and mistakes.

864
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:59,391
And I hope to be there
for every second of it.

865
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:01,523
But if I'm not--

866
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:03,133
but if I'm not--

867
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:07,181
I just wanted you to know--

868
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,619
Elise, it's time.

869
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:13,927
Hey, listen to me.

870
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:18,627
You are gonna see her
when you wake up.

871
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:20,150
It's gonna be okay.

872
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:41,433
Weighted speculum,
right angle retractor.

873
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,738
Vitals are stable.

874
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:45,437
Sponge stick and suction.

875
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:47,090
I don't see
any active bleeding.

876
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,178
Why is she dry?

877
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:51,399
BP is dropping.

878
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:53,575
Uterus is firm.
This isn't atony.

879
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:54,881
She's bleeding
from somewhere else.

880
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,404
She's unstable
and tachycardic.

881
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,319
Damn it. What is happening?

882
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,625
Her belly's getting tight.

883
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,540
She's bleeding
into her abdomen.

884
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,542
BP's still dropping.
Starting pressors.

885
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:06,153
Scalpel.

886
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:11,637
Oh, my God.

887
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:12,986
I can't see.

888
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,248
I need laps
and keep them coming.

889
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:16,511
We're gonna need more blood!

890
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:19,340
Arteries intact.
Pelvis is completely dry.

891
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,689
It's coming from the liver.

892
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:22,474
She's in V-fib.

893
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:24,171
She's coding.
Grab the crash cart.

894
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,477
Charge to 120.

895
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,697
Clear.

896
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,701
Back to sinus rhythm.

897
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:40,883
<i>This isn't working.</i>

898
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,189
<i>We need to stabilize her
and get her to angio.</i>

899
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,582
<i>There's too much blood.
She's in DIC.</i>

900
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:44,757
Oh, my God.

901
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:45,975
Give me a curved 8.

902
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:47,673
I'm gonna clamp the hilum.

903
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:48,935
She's back in V-fib.

904
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:52,939
Charge to 120.

905
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:54,854
Clear.

906
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,162
Still in V-fib.
Pushing a milligram of epi.

907
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:00,250
Charge to 200.

908
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:04,037
Clear.

909
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:06,561
She's flatlining.

910
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,346
No! No.

911
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,477
Another milligram of epi.

912
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:10,609
Going in now.

913
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:14,395
No, come on!

914
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,531
Come on, Elise. Stay with me.

915
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:20,793
Ruby needs you.

916
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,764
No, come on!

917
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:37,636
Come on, come on.

918
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,377
Elise.

919
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,030
Stay here.

920
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,250
Come back.

921
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,294
Hannah?

922
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:47,428
She's been down 40 minutes.

923
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:07,056
Time of death, 22:31.
