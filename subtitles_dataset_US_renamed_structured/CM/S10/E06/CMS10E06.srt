1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,220
<i>I'm proposing a mobile unit.</i>

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,750
If the patients can't get
to us, we gotta go to them.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,310
You have no knowledge of
the way this place operates

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,440
<i>or the chain of command.</i>

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,220
You're resistant to change.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,710
It's only going to hinder
your ability moving forward.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,450
<i>CPD didn't find any
evidence of forced entry.</i>

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,980
But I know how I felt.
Someone was in my house.

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,470
Wow.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,170
What is all this?
- Good morning.

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,210
Good morning.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,040
Have a seat.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,910
Uh, careful now.

14
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,430
I might outstay my welcome.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,570
Would that be such a bad thing?

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,090
Are you asking me to move in?

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,700
Why not?

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,660
I mean, hasn't this
been kind of fun?

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,360
Uh, what part?

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,670
Being driven from my home
by a crazed stalker or...

21
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,110
I know the circumstances
were not ideal,

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,550
but I love sharing
a home with you.

23
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,510
And I don't want that to end.

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,730
Oh, Dennis, I don't know
if I'm in the right headspace

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,120
for discussing
long-term plans right now.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,120
I hear you. I hear you.

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,090
But you think about it.

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,350
Of course I will.

29
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,530
I'm hearing we're down
and OB and a charge nurse.

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,140
And good morning to you,
too, Dr. Archer.

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,920
And you approved this, did you?

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,050
Maggie and Hannah are doing
a mobile women's health clinic

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,190
on the South Side.

34
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,880
I sent you a memo
about it last week.

35
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,230
We need them on the floor.

36
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,930
I don't disagree,
but I was overruled.

37
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,580
By Goodwin?

38
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,020
This initiative
has her full support.

39
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,890
This is a one-time thing?

40
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,290
- For now.
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,680
What time are they back?

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,380
Read the memo.

43
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,260
Oh!

44
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,340
Smell that deliciousness.

45
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,430
Mmm. Harold's Chicken.

46
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,260
They're all over Chicago.

47
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,740
Not just any Harold's Chicken.

48
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,270
It's the original,
without a doubt the best.

49
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,440
You gotta show some respect.

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,880
Are you all doing
the well-women exams?

51
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,270
- Oh, we're just setting up.
- We are, yeah. Here.

52
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,750
Get you to take a seat
right here.

53
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,450
Do you need anything?
We have snacks.

54
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,450
We've got granola bars,
crackers, chips.

55
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,760
- I'm okay. Thanks.
- Okay.

56
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,980
Was I too thirsty?
- Kind of.

57
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,990
I just really need
a good turnout today.

58
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,420
It's the only way we convince
the board to keep funding this.

59
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,300
But we don't open
for another 45 minutes,

60
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,300
and we already have a patient.

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,950
We got this.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,170
Relax.

63
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,350
Okay.

64
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,390
Dr. Archer, take trauma 1.

65
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,220
- Got it, trainee.
Talk to me, Matt.

66
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,480
Jordan Bennett,
16-year-old male.

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,960
Fell off a reach
during a rock slide

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,570
at the South County State Park.
He's critical.

69
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,660
- How far did he fall?
- About 20 feet.

70
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,010
Massive head trauma,
arrested during transpo.

71
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,410
ROSC after 1 amp of epi.

72
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,100
Doesn't sound encouraging.

73
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,760
The buddy's right behind us.

74
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,370
Tried to rescue Jordan after
the fall, then slipped himself.

75
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,670
He's a real hero.

76
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,800
Hmm.

77
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,460
Let's hope for a happy ending.
Ready?

78
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,680
On my count. One, two, three.

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,900
- Trauma 3 is ready for you.
- Thanks, Trini.

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,210
Cody Lawson, 15-year-old
male, chest pain and bruising

81
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,690
from falling on the crag.

82
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,080
Lacerations on both arms,
a fractured left wrist,

83
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,210
and left knee injury.

84
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,860
Looks a lot better
than his friend.

85
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, he rolled.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,350
His friend fell.
- Makes a difference.

87
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,520
Need X-ray in here.

88
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,530
Get him on a vent and
place a second large-bore IV.

89
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,090
These boys hiking alone?

90
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,230
No, they were part of a group,

91
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,490
some kind of adventure camp.

92
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,140
The counselor could
tell you more.

93
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,270
He's coming in on the next ambo.

94
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,020
All right, second IV's in.

95
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,150
I'll check on Frost.

96
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,410
I know, buddy. I know.

97
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,200
We're getting you something
for the pain, all right?

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,980
How's he doing?

99
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,510
A couple of bruised ribs,
wrist, and a knee injury.

100
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,120
But he's gonna be okay.

101
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,290
Um, Dr. Frost?

102
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,990
Is that a rash?

103
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,860
It looks like insect bites.

104
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,520
Maybe fire ants?

105
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,260
Jordan was carrying this.

106
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,780
Wow. What's in here?

107
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,910
Let's look.

108
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,400
Ugh.

109
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,090
I just saw the other kid.

110
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,530
This was no adventure camp.

111
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,930
No, it looks like
they were being tortured.

112
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,470
ICP is in the high 30s,

113
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,990
and markedly reduced
brain perfusion.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,210
Well, that's not good.

115
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,740
Give him one gram
per kilo of mannitol.

116
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,220
Is he gonna make it?

117
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,440
He's gonna need
a really aggressive surgery

118
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,870
to even have a chance.

119
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,270
And I'm not optimistic.

120
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,090
But then again,
I'm never optimistic.

121
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,050
- Dr. Archer?
- Hmm?

122
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,620
Camp counselor's here.

123
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,540
What the hell are you
doing to these kids?

124
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,500
- What do you mean?
Today was an accident.

125
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,890
I'm not talking
about just today.

126
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,330
- There was a rockslide...
- These boys... no, stop!

127
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,850
These boys came in.

128
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,980
They were malnourished.
They were freezing.

129
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,940
They were covered in bug bites.

130
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,810
It's a disciplinary camp.

131
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,420
Listen, man, don't talk
to me about discipline, okay?

132
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,080
I went through Navy boot camp.

133
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,300
This is abuse.

134
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,340
We're trying to show these kids

135
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,910
that their actions
have consequences.

136
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,350
When they act out, they get
their food privileges revoked,

137
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,090
or they lose their
sleeping bag for a night.

138
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, tell me, do the parents
know anything about

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,440
what you're
subjecting them to, huh?

140
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,790
Do they have any idea that
you got them lugging

141
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,140
50-pound backpacks
filled with rocks?

142
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,790
Their parents signed
them up for this.

143
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,530
Oh.

144
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,930
Everything we're doing is legal.

145
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,630
Okay, well, I'm not gonna
take your word for it.

146
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,630
I'm gonna be alerting
hospital counsel.

147
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,800
Look, these kids
aren't star students.

148
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,020
Most of them are
one misstep away from juvie.

149
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,070
Our methods may seem extreme,
but that's because

150
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,640
we have a short window to pull
them back from the edge.

151
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,160
Mm, well, today,
two of those kids

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,900
went over the edge
on your watch,

153
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,210
an edge they never should have
been on in the first place.

154
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,650
He just opened his eyes.

155
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,700
- All right, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

156
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,910
Hey there, buddy.

157
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,830
I'm Dr. Frost.
- Hey.

158
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,700
How you feeling?

159
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,050
My chest hurts.

160
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,840
My leg too.

161
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,100
Well, you bruised some ribs
and injured your knee,

162
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,880
so that's to be expected.

163
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,150
What happened?

164
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,840
You took a pretty bad fall.

165
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,500
Do you remember that?

166
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,720
Uh, no, not at all.

167
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,680
His CT scan was normal, right?

168
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,860
Yep, and neuro exam
was normal too.

169
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,550
Okay.

170
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,990
Do you know where you are?

171
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,300
Hospital.

172
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,860
That's right.

173
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,910
Can you tell me things
like your name, your age?

174
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,270
No, sorry.

175
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,620
It's okay.

176
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,920
Do you remember anything
about the camp?

177
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,450
What camp?

178
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,190
Thank you.

179
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,280
So there's dinner on the stove
when I get to the house.

180
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,890
Breakfast is already made
when I wake up.

181
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,550
He does the dishes.

182
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,080
Daniel, he makes up the bed
and puts a glass of water

183
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,420
on the nightstand.

184
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,470
What a prick.

185
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,770
No, no, no.

186
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
It's just that
I'm not used to...

187
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,300
Being taken care of
in a manner you most

188
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,690
definitely deserve.

189
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,480
Dr. Goodwin,
sorry to interrupt,

190
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
but we need you to come
with us to your

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
hospital security office.
- What's going on?

192
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,880
Well, I'll explain on the way,

193
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,750
but right now we need to
move you to a secure location.

194
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,920
You mean like an active threat?

195
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
No time to explain.

196
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,050
We gotta move.

197
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,270
You gonna be all right?

198
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,880
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,580
Dr. Charles, you know
I'll keep her safe.

200
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,930
Yeah, keep me updated.

201
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,240
Copy that.

202
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,200
Extensive skull fractures,
severe left-side, frontal,

203
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,160
and temporal contusions,
significant brain edema causing

204
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,380
left-to-right midline shift,
not to mention the persistently

205
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,950
high intracranial pressure.

206
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,260
I'd recommend an up-front
left-side hemicraniectomy.

207
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

208
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,430
We're not sawing off
half his skull

209
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,960
and leaving his brain
exposed for months?

210
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,920
That's not how I'd put it.

211
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,140
Well, sort of hoping you would.

212
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,310
A hemicraniectomy feels
like the last resort,

213
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,920
not the first line of defense.

214
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,620
Well, we could continue
to treat conservatively

215
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,970
with scheduled mannitol,
ongoing paralytics

216
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,020
and sedation, see if we can
keep his ICPs down.

217
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,930
- There you go.
Let's do that. Let's do that.

218
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,410
Absolutely not.

219
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,240
I agree with
Dr. Abrams' assessment.

220
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,110
This is not the time for
a cautious, stepwise approach.

221
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,290
We're at the last resort stage.

222
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,640
Oh, no, no, we are not.

223
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,680
There was not
a major bleed in his CT.

224
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,210
All right, Sam, how sure
are you that a hemicraniectomy

225
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,380
is the right procedure here?

226
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,690
It's close, 51/49.

227
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,650
Jordan could herniate
at any moment,

228
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,300
and then it'll be
too late for surgery.

229
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,310
And when are
his parents arriving?

230
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,000
We haven't reached them yet.

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,010
High-risk brain surgery
on a minor without legal

232
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,490
guardians' consent when
there's a viable alternative,

233
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,100
I don't know, Sam.

234
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,270
Sounds kind of dicey to me.

235
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,500
Let's monitor
for a bit longer while we

236
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,800
try to reach the parents.

237
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,370
In the interim,
push the sodium above 145

238
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,500
and I'll have Gottfried in
to place an EVD.

239
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,070
All right.

240
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,400
You recognize him, right?

241
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,580
Oh, yes, of course,
it's Patrick Dunn.

242
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,800
He worked in radiology
for years.

243
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,760
Until you let him go
a few weeks ago.

244
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:01,433
What... you think he sent
a death threat?

245
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,330
Yes, ma'am, we think
it's a very high likelihood.

246
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:08,200
Look, he had
an overblown reaction,

247
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,590
but a lot of people did.

248
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,950
As long as I have worked
with Patrick Dunn,

249
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,640
he is always well-mannered
and completely professional.

250
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,430
Completely professional
with a history

251
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,910
of mental instability
and aggressive behavior.

252
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,560
He also has several guns
registered in his name.

253
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,130
Why would he be targeting me?

254
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,960
We've been monitoring
his social media accounts.

255
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,490
Dunn's been posting a barrage
of vitriol against Med

256
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,490
on social media
since you fired him.

257
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,060
And he posted a message
an hour ago about you.

258
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,370
The language is violent,
Ms. Goodwin.

259
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,030
Well, that... that
changes things, doesn't it?

260
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,420
- Hey, Mags?
- Yeah?

261
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,510
Can you grab some alcohol wipes?

262
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,640
You got it.

263
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,170
Hey!

264
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,520
Hey, what are you doing?

265
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,570
Hey!

266
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,960
Stop!

267
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,010
Those are not yours!

268
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,600
Open the door.

269
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,860
Those medical supplies
are for people in need.

270
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,990
What's going on in there?

271
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,210
Is someone hurt?

272
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,220
- I'm a registered nurse.
I can help.

273
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,910
Please open the door.

274
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,220
Please.

275
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,360
Hey.

276
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,050
Where is she?
- In there.

277
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,240
How far along are you?

278
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,330
I don't know.

279
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,760
I think about nine months.

280
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,240
What's your name, sweetie?

281
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,810
Sylvie.

282
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,070
Sylvie, my name is Maggie.

283
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,730
I'm a nurse and midwife.

284
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,900
We're gonna get
through this together, okay?

285
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,690
So this is just
a first guess, right?

286
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,000
But I think that we might
be looking at some form

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,040
of dissociative amnesia.

288
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,300
Like you dissociate
from yourself?

289
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,000
Kind of, but whereas with
the sort of garden variety

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,090
"bump on the head forget stuff"
version, in this case,

291
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,010
your mind blocks out
personal information

292
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,230
and memories in order
to protect you

293
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,930
from a traumatic experience.

294
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,580
Cody seems pretty chill for a
guy who doesn't know who he is.

295
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,710
Weird, right?

296
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,450
But that lack of concern
is common

297
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,930
with dissociative amnesia.

298
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,720
Do you know, did he
experience any memory loss

299
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,370
before the accident?

300
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,590
His counselor told me no.

301
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,290
All right, say anything else?

302
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,640
He did, actually, yeah.

303
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
After Jordan
fell over the ledge,

304
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,860
Cody snapped,
wouldn't stop screaming,

305
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,120
like he was possessed
out of his body.

306
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,870
Keith tried to hold him back,
but Cody began scrambling down

307
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,130
the ridge to save Jordan
until he slipped

308
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,740
near the bottom himself.

309
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,350
That's interesting.

310
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,000
Cody Lawson's mother
just landed at O'Hare.

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,660
She should be here
in an hour or so.

312
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,880
Thank you.

313
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,970
Let me know when
she arrives, okay?

314
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,790
I'd like to be there
when she walks in the room.

315
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,840
- You got it.
- Thank you.

316
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,190
Just ride out the wave.

317
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,500
There you go.

318
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,590
Come on, cuz. You got this.

319
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,670
Shut up, Eli.

320
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,760
Okay, okay. Give me the bag.

321
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,680
How long ago did
your water break?

322
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,120
First period, around 9:00.

323
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,420
I found Eli,
and he walked me home.

324
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,640
Okay, are you the father?

325
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,250
No, that's my cousin.

326
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,730
The father doesn't know
and never will.

327
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,260
This is your house?

328
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,610
Me and my mom, yeah.

329
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,780
Okay, when does she get home?

330
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,570
Three hours or so.

331
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,610
Why don't we give her a call?

332
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,530
- No!
- No way!

333
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,610
Not an option.

334
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,790
Why not?

335
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,220
Aunt Donna doesn't know.

336
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,230
Okay, did you wear baggy
clothes to hide the pregnancy?

337
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,580
- My mom can't ever know.
She'd kill me.

338
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,800
Okay, we'll worry
about that later.

339
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Right now, we got a baby coming,

340
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,370
so I'll call my friend
Dr. Asher

341
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,800
over at the mobile clinic.

342
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,680
But I forgot
my phone at the van.

343
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,550
I need to borrow
one of your phones.

344
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,590
We don't have phones.

345
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,290
You're teenagers
on planet Earth.

346
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,810
You must have phones.

347
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,380
Aunt Donna says
they're a distraction.

348
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,990
Okay, change of plan.

349
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,600
I need you to go to the mobile
clinic and find a Dr. Asher,

350
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,860
and bring her back here.

351
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,040
- Why can't you do it?
You're a midwife.

352
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,960
Sweetie, I need all
the help we can get, okay?

353
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,570
Okay.

354
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,650
Eli, go now.

355
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

356
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,570
Okay, all right, sweetie.

357
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,350
Do you mind if I
check your dilation?

358
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,490
Okay, I need you to
scooch to the side.

359
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,100
You're gonna feel some pressure.

360
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,760
Okay, ah, Sylvie, you are
10 centimeters dilated,

361
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,850
which means...

362
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,500
The baby's coming,
like, right now.

363
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,810
Yeah, I guess we're doing this.

364
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,724
Take Motrin for the pain,
and follow up

365
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:15,965
with an orthopedic surgeon
after the swelling goes down.

366
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,360
Any questions?

367
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,450
I'm not a monster.

368
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:21,082
Okay.

369
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,957
I know you and your
colleagues think that

370
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:24,935
we were abusing these kids.

371
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,360
I can't speak for my
colleagues, but yes, I do.

372
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,620
While these camps may be
legal, which blows my mind,

373
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,280
I think they're despicable.

374
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,284
So you think I'm despicable?

375
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,925
Connect the dots
however you will.

376
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,690
I've seen this method
change lives.

377
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:46,247
Changed my life.

378
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,464
Save your shtick.

379
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,659
I'm not buying
what you're selling.

380
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:50,124
Trust me.

381
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,109
Fine, can you at least
tell me how Jordan is doing?

382
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:56,435
Despite what you think, I really

383
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,659
do care about these kids.

384
00:15:58,684 --> 00:16:00,944
I'm not at liberty
to discuss Jordan's

385
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:03,059
medical information with you.

386
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:05,245
Yes, you are.

387
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,660
I'm legally responsible
for Jordan

388
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:08,035
until his parents get here.

389
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:13,915
Do you have that in writing?

390
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,979
Cody, I have a visitor for you.

391
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,059
Cody.

392
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:19,774
Hi.

393
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:21,745
Who is this?

394
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:23,886
This is, uh, this is Shayna.

395
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,070
This is... this is your mom.

396
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,460
I'm sorry.

397
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,394
I don't know who this is.

398
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:36,119
Cody, you really don't know me?

399
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:38,409
Uh, no.

400
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,901
Oh, my God.

401
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:44,769
This is all my fault.

402
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:47,054
I should never have sent him
to that awful place.

403
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,581
What's wrong with her?

404
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:49,866
I just... I didn't
know what else to do.

405
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:50,784
I was gonna lose him.

406
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,415
Why don't you give Cody
a little rest, all right?

407
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,230
- I didn't have a choice.
I didn't.

408
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,660
- I completely understand.
- I have to go.

409
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,750
I'm sorry.
- Okay.

410
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:06,497
No, I can't do this.

411
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:07,522
Yes, you can.

412
00:17:07,547 --> 00:17:08,597
Listen to me.

413
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:11,232
Breathe with me.

414
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:15,251
Your body knows
how to do this, okay?

415
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,150
You got this.

416
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,510
No, I can't.

417
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,160
My back is killing me.

418
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,820
Okay, okay.

419
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,357
Okay, let's stand up and
relieve that pressure, okay?

420
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:27,498
And then we're gonna
lay back down,

421
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:29,953
and we're gonna
deliver this baby, okay?

422
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:33,378
Okay, on three.
One, two, three.

423
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,518
Good job, sweetie.

424
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:36,713
Good job.

425
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:38,388
Good girl. Ready?

426
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:39,933
One, two, three.
Let's get up.

427
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,348
Oh!

428
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,333
- There you go.
Lean against the wall.

429
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,020
There you go, there you go.

430
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,890
Okay, how does your back feel?

431
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,760
Much better, thanks.

432
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,720
Good, good.

433
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,110
Ready to lay back down?

434
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,280
Yeah, sure.

435
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,760
There you go.

436
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,240
Oh, Maggie.

437
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,250
The baby's coming.

438
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,460
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

439
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,470
Let's get to the bed.

440
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,860
No, it's too late.

441
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,770
Okay, okay, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

442
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,470
Oh, okay, Sylvie, got the head.

443
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,820
Okay, I need one more push.

444
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,960
Okay, look at me.

445
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,740
You got this. Okay?

446
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,960
On three.

447
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,480
One, two, three, push, Sylvie!

448
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,750
Push!

449
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,440
Okay, I got her.

450
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,790
I got her.

451
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,190
There she is, Sylvie.

452
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,970
You did it, mama.

453
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,280
Let me clamp the umbilical cord.

454
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,020
There you go.

455
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,980
You have a healthy baby girl
with an equally healthy set

456
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,760
of lungs, just like her mama.

457
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,590
Okay, I'm gonna cut
the umbilical cord,

458
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,160
and then do you wanna hold her?

459
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,330
Just cut it, and take
her to the hospital.

460
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,820
I don't want her.

461
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Sylvie, you don't have
to decide right now.

462
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,600
Please, just do it.

463
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,040
I don't want her attached to me.

464
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,740
Okay, sweetie, there you go.

465
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,480
Okay, why don't you sit down?

466
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,880
There you go.

467
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,880
Listen to me.

468
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
Everything is okay, okay?

469
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,460
Shayna, how are you doing?

470
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,410
I know that that was
a whole lot to take in,

471
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,370
and I just wanted
to check up on you.

472
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,460
Do you mind if I sit?

473
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,380
I was at my wit's end with Cody.

474
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,820
He was flunking out of school,
getting in fights.

475
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,650
Pretty sure
he started dealing drugs.

476
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,090
And whenever I'd try
and talk to him,

477
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,130
he would just... he would
just explode at me.

478
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,920
Mm, sounds like, you know,
had a whole lot of anger

479
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,700
that he didn't know
what to do with.

480
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,100
Well, he never told me why.

481
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,710
And then last summer,
he got a DUI.

482
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,230
He spent the night in jail.

483
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,280
I mean, my friend said
she knew about this camp.

484
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,410
I realize it's... it was
a horrible idea, but I ju... I...

485
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,670
Shayna, I get it.

486
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,150
You're desperate.

487
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,200
I just... I just wanted it
to be the wake-up call that

488
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,600
I really believed he needed
because I thought otherwise

489
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,420
he was gonna end up dead.

490
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,510
That's just really hard to
believe because he used to be

491
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,300
such a sweet and gentle kid.

492
00:20:20,778 --> 00:20:24,078
Until... until when?

493
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:26,453
Until his dad died.

494
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:29,434
- And they were...
they were close?

495
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:33,133
I don't know how close they
were, but Mark was his dad.

496
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:34,125
Cody loved him.

497
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,812
I tried to make sure
it stayed that way.

498
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,945
How?

499
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,800
How did you make sure
it stayed that way?

500
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,117
Mark was a drunk.

501
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,669
I tried to make sure
that Cody just saw

502
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:52,460
the happy drunk,
right, the clown version,

503
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,600
the one that would play
video games with him all day

504
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,578
and wrestle, and...

505
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,860
when I could sense that
he was about to turn, though,

506
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:01,570
I would grab Cody and get him
out of there real fast.

507
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,047
And by turn, you mean?

508
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:05,722
I mean he would get violent.

509
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,578
I did my best to protect Cody.

510
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,523
I'm not sure
how successful I was.

511
00:21:15,663 --> 00:21:18,663
How exactly did
your husband die?

512
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,555
Mark was, uh, um, fixing a...

513
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,020
a rain leak on our roof.

514
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:30,565
And he just loved doing
things around the house.

515
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:35,203
And he'd been drinking
all day and lost his balance.

516
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,448
And he... he slipped and he fell.

517
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,640
And Cody... Cody was there?

518
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,820
Cody...
- No, no, no, no.

519
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,640
Neither of us were.

520
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,340
Earlier in the day when I could
tell that Mark was turning,

521
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,220
I grabbed Cody, and I took him
to our neighbor Sally's house.

522
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:54,175
You know, Shayna,
there's a procedure

523
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:56,326
that I'd like to
talk to you about.

524
00:21:56,351 --> 00:22:01,871
It has the potential to help us
help Cody with his memory loss.

525
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,435
Whoa, wait.

526
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,250
Hold it, hold it.

527
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:12,310
What are you doing, huh?

528
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:14,177
This patient doesn't have
an order for transfer.

529
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,029
We were told to take him
to OR number 5.

530
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:17,104
And who told you that?

531
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,389
Me.

532
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,950
You got consent
from his parents?

533
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:22,730
We haven't reached them yet.

534
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,990
Well, then this isn't happening.

535
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,730
Keith Bauman consented
to Jordan's surgery.

536
00:22:25,974 --> 00:22:27,390
The camp counselor?

537
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,430
Keith has the legal authority
to make medical decisions

538
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,520
on Jordan's behalf.

539
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,960
Are you for real right now?

540
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,260
Very much so, Dr. Archer.

541
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,660
That man is the one responsible

542
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,350
for Jordan's injuries.

543
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,660
That's exactly why he signed,
to try to save Jordan's life.

544
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,360
Playing it safe won't do that.

545
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,840
All right, don't move this
patient until I get back.

546
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,890
Where are you going?

547
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:50,022
And?

548
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,260
She's absolutely perfect.

549
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,310
Did you check her Apgar score,

550
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,660
color, heart rate, reflexes,
muscle tone, and respiration?

551
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,870
I did.

552
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,220
Everything checks out.

553
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,310
Oh.

554
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,010
Where'd you learn all that?

555
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,450
YouTube. Yeah.

556
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,190
See, I learned in case I would
have to deliver the baby,

557
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,320
but I'm glad you did it.

558
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,150
Ambulance will
be here any second.

559
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,850
Okay, I'll go wake up Sylvie.

560
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,200
Okay.

561
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,940
What are you doing?

562
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,070
You shouldn't be
on your feet yet.

563
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,770
I've gotta get
everything cleaned up

564
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,080
before my mom gets home,
take it all to the laundromat.

565
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Okay, forget about the sheets.

566
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,350
Drink this.

567
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,960
Listen, your mom's gonna
find out sooner or later.

568
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,140
No!

569
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,310
Just take her.

570
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,270
Make sure she's safe, that she
goes to people who love her.

571
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,930
Okay.

572
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,110
Giving up a baby
is a big decision.

573
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,940
It's not one that you should
be making on your own.

574
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,080
Now, I can talk
to your mom for you.

575
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,690
You don't understand.

576
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,780
She had me when she was 16.

577
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,080
She didn't get to finish
high school or go to college.

578
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,440
She sacrificed
her whole life for me.

579
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,010
And this is how I repay her?

580
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,180
You're afraid
of disappointing her?

581
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,540
Okay, uh,

582
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,760
she will be disappointed.

583
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,590
There's no way around it.

584
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,460
I know my mom was
when I got pregnant at 16.

585
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,940
You?

586
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,470
I was terrified to tell
my parents, especially my mom.

587
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,170
Pushed it off for months and...

588
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,300
as long as I could.

589
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,000
And when I finally did tell her,

590
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,480
she was disappointed
and furious.

591
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,010
But she didn't stop loving me.

592
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,790
She didn't stop
being there for me.

593
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,540
She was still my mom.

594
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,500
What did you do with the baby?

595
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,070
I gave her up.

596
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,860
Do you ever regret it?

597
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,340
Sometimes.

598
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,520
But you are not me.

599
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,220
You need to make the
right decision for you.

600
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,360
I just...

601
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,490
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

602
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,360
Okay, who do you
normally talk to when you

603
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,620
have to make a tough decision?

604
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,500
- My mom.
- All right.

605
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,110
Well, let's call her on
the way to the hospital, okay?

606
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,510
Okay.

607
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,420
Look, it's pretty cut and dry.

608
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,430
I mean, Mr. Bauman has
the legal authority as granted

609
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,860
by Jordan's parents to make
medical decisions in the event

610
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,730
they're unreachable.

611
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,210
They still unreachable?

612
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,690
- Yeah.
- Yes.

613
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,520
Then Mr. Bauman's
consent holds.

614
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,390
You and Dr. Abrams can
proceed with surgery.

615
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,180
Sorry we wasted
your time, Peter.

616
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,440
Wasn't my idea.

617
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,880
We haven't maxed out
on conservative options.

618
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,050
That is your opinion.

619
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,750
Based on decades of experience.

620
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,060
Forget trying to stick it
to me for a second.

621
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,450
This has nothing to do with you.

622
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,410
I'm doing what's necessary
to save Jordan's life.

623
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,190
Or have you forgotten
that's our primary goal?

624
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,460
Cody, as I was
explaining to Shayna,

625
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,070
what we're about
to do is something we call

626
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,070
a medication-assisted interview.

627
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,420
Okay.

628
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,690
Dr. Frost is gonna give you
a sedative.

629
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,120
It's called lorazepam,
and it's gonna relax you.

630
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,780
Hopefully, maybe,
as we talk, who knows?

631
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,610
We might start getting
your memory back.

632
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,650
Are you ready?

633
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,000
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

634
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,140
Pushing 1 milligram lorazepam.

635
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,920
All you gotta do,
pal, is just...

636
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,010
just relax, you know?

637
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,750
Just gonna have a conversation.

638
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,850
Okay, so I am just wondering
if at this point,

639
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,290
you would be able
to tell me your full name.

640
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,550
I know my first name is Cody,

641
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,380
but just because
you keep calling me that.

642
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,730
All right, how about if
I ask you about your dad?

643
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,170
Anything... anything
coming up there?

644
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,260
No, nothing. I'm sorry.

645
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,780
Hey, I don't want you
to apologize, all right?

646
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,310
It's not a test.

647
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,740
I'm just gonna keep
asking you questions.

648
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,140
And if something,
anything comes up, just let it.

649
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,830
- Okay.
- Good.

650
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,310
Okay, so now back to
your dad, I don't know.

651
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,620
Sometimes it's just,
like, little details,

652
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,540
you know, color of his hair,
sound of his voice,

653
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,500
maybe a favorite present
he gave you for the holidays.

654
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,240
I remember
the smell of his cologne.

655
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,720
Oh.

656
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,290
Okay, excellent.

657
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,510
What did it smell like?

658
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:33,820
Maybe like his shampoo he liked?

659
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,170
And sweat.

660
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,740
He would sweat
when he was working.

661
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,350
Right.

662
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,920
Wasn't he, um, working up on
the roof the day that he died?

663
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,830
I think he was.

664
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,360
Look, I know you weren't there,

665
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,930
but um, remember
anything about that day?

666
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,890
I was there.

667
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,280
Honey, you're confused.

668
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,580
He wasn't there.

669
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,930
You weren't...
you weren't there.

670
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,630
Shayna, thanks.

671
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,200
So what you're
saying is that you...

672
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,290
you were there.

673
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,460
I thought that your mom
took you to a neighbor's house.

674
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,080
Yes, she did,
but I went back home.

675
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,820
Okay, why?

676
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,380
Why'd you go back?

677
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,470
Because I thought my mom did.

678
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,130
- 'Cause you were what?
You were worried about her?

679
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,650
Yeah, when my dad drank,
she would

680
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,520
always take me somewhere else,
but she would always go back.

681
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,220
Oh, so you're back at the house.

682
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,270
Now, what would happen?

683
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,790
What did... what did you see?

684
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,400
My...

685
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,100
my dad was on the roof.

686
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,190
He was... he was so drunk
he could barely stand.

687
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,890
And when he saw me,
he asked me where my mom was.

688
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,810
And when I wouldn't tell him,
he got mad, like really mad.

689
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:00,510
And he started to
throw things at me.

690
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:05,130
And it wasn't until he threw
the hammer that...

691
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,690
that he lost his balance.

692
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,870
And he fell, and he landed
on the fence,

693
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,040
and the spikes went
right through him,

694
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,440
and there was blood everywhere.

695
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,790
But Dad was still alive.

696
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,530
He asked me to call 911.

697
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,500
And did you?

698
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,810
No, I didn't move.

699
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,890
- Why not?
Why didn't you call?

700
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,470
So she would always be safe,

701
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,820
so that he would
never hurt her again.

702
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,350
Okay, Sylvie,
so it looks like you have

703
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,010
a small
first-degree vaginal tear.

704
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,310
Am I gonna need stitches?

705
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,710
No, no, no.

706
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,760
First-degree tear heals
on its own in a few weeks.

707
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,370
Mom?

708
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,940
I'm so sorry, Mom.

709
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,730
All the talks we had?

710
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,340
I know.

711
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,260
I do not want this life for you.

712
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,390
I know.

713
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,660
You've sacrificed
so much for me.

714
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,660
I don't care about that.

715
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,570
I'd do it all again.

716
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,270
But you are meant
for better things.

717
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,970
I won't let this derail you.

718
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,020
That's... that's why
I'm not keeping it.

719
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,900
Wait, Mama!

720
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,340
Sylvie.

721
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,600
Give her time.

722
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:18,130
She needs to wrap
her head around this, okay?

723
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,940
All right, extend
the dural opening.

724
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,110
Got it.

725
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,290
What happened?

726
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,470
We got severe venous bleeding
from the sagittal sinus.

727
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,170
Skull fracture,
likely a bolster branch.

728
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,690
BP's dropping into the 50s.

729
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,950
Latest hemoglobin is only 7.1.

730
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,040
Lactate's been rising.
- Stay on top of it.

731
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,390
Push more fluids and blood.

732
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,910
We're already maxed
out on pressors.

733
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,570
He's losing it quicker
than I can replace it.

734
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,960
What if you drill off more skull

735
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,480
to get across the midline,
flap the dural on itself

736
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,010
to reconstruct
the sagittal sinus

737
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,400
and secure it down?

738
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,840
He could suffer a venous bleed,

739
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,050
or he could thrombose the
whole sinus and stroke out.

740
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,620
Or he could
continue bleeding out,

741
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,140
and we lose him
in the next two minutes.

742
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,320
All right. Drill?

743
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,590
You mind if I join you?

744
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,510
You're from the South Side.

745
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,250
I can hear it when you talk.

746
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,210
Probably within three blocks
of High Park Boulevard?

747
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,560
Two blocks.

748
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,870
Thought so.

749
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,910
You?

750
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,700
Kimbark Avenue.

751
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,920
Bet we know some
of the same people.

752
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,400
I guarantee we do.

753
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:43,320
Sylvie thinks I'm mad at her,
but I'm just mad at myself.

754
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,670
I failed her.

755
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,320
That's not true at all.

756
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,850
Then how'd this happen?

757
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,200
How did she make
the exact same mistake I did?

758
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,510
The same way you did,
the same way I did.

759
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,420
Life happens.

760
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,340
You didn't keep
your baby, did you?

761
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,640
No.

762
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,690
Know how I knew that?

763
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,780
You're a nurse,
and I drive a bus.

764
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,870
There's nothing wrong
with driving a bus.

765
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,480
No, but point is, mistakes
can cost you if you let them.

766
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,010
And I don't want
Sylvie driving any bus.

767
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,230
I want her to go wherever
her heart takes her.

768
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,140
That's my life.

769
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,400
That's my life's work.

770
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,320
She's my life.

771
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,190
That can't include a baby.

772
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:37,720
I get you, but this
is Sylvie's decision.

773
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,640
How can I leave this up
to her knowing what I know?

774
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,160
Because if you don't,
she'll never forgive you.

775
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:53,000
And Sylvie won't know
what to do until she...

776
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,310
until she holds that baby
in her arms.

777
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,570
She hasn't held her yet?

778
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,010
Well, I know why.

779
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,620
I told Sylvie
a million times how

780
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,880
I fell in love
with her the moment

781
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,450
I first held her in my arms.

782
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,410
There was no choice.

783
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,020
She was mine.

784
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:20,940
Sylvie knows that if
she holds that baby,

785
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,160
she won't be able
to let it go either.

786
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,900
I held my baby,

787
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,560
and I fell in love
with her too, instantly.

788
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,700
And then I said goodbye.

789
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,050
Sylvie will know what to do.

790
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,190
I gave Shayna the name
of a therapist I really trust.

791
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,280
And look, they got
a long road ahead of them,

792
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,670
but they do the work,
they got a real good shot.

793
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,240
- Yeah?
I mean, I certainly hope so.

794
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,160
Human mind never
ceases to astonish me.

795
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,720
I'm telling you.

796
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,250
I mean, Cody's gave him
a complete memory wipe

797
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,900
to protect him from trauma.

798
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,510
Yeah, I mean, I wish I could
wipe my parents

799
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,690
from my memory, permanently.

800
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:21,690
Not too... not too close, huh?

801
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,050
Haven't spoken to them in years.

802
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,880
Well, look,
I've been there, brother.

803
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,010
The thing I try
to remember when I'm...

804
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,620
- Uh, look, I...
- When I'm grinding on my...

805
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,140
I really appreciate it,
Dr. Charles,

806
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,450
but I got someplace
I need to be, so...

807
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,930
Right on. Off you go, man.

808
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,540
I get it.
- All right.

809
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,670
- All good.
- I'll see you.

810
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,550
Hey, it's okay.

811
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,740
Make sure to support her head.

812
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,790
She looks just
like you as a baby.

813
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,320
Sylvie, no matter
what you decide,

814
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,590
you need to hold this baby
and tell her

815
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,720
what's in your heart
for both of you.

816
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,120
Yeah.

817
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,910
Hey.

818
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,820
Mama?

819
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,830
Yes, baby?

820
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,790
I wanna keep her.

821
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,930
Then that's what we'll do.

822
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,020
But you'll have
one thing I didn't.

823
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,760
Me.

824
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,460
We'll do this together, okay?

825
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,070
Babies need names, Sylvie.

826
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,290
Her name is Sophia.

827
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,170
Hey, Sophia.

828
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,470
Hey.

829
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,430
Mr. and Mrs. Bennett,
I wanted

830
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,610
to come introduce myself.

831
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,960
I'm Dr. Archer.

832
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,830
Hi.
- How's our boy?

833
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,220
He's still in surgery.

834
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
I'm glad we were able
to reach you.

835
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,010
Yeah, we were
on my brother's farm

836
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,100
with terrible cell reception.

837
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,140
Yeah.

838
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,540
Dr. Lenox,
these are Jordan's parents.

839
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,060
Mr. And Mrs. Bennett.

840
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,890
During surgery, your son
suffered a massive brain bleed,

841
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,980
which was a complication

842
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,940
from the massive skull fractures

843
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,990
he sustained in his fall.

844
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,290
Unfortunately,
although we attempted

845
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,430
to resuscitate Jordan,

846
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,910
we ultimately were
unable to save him,

847
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,000
and Jordan died.

848
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,390
No, no, no.

849
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,170
Oh, my God, no.

850
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,660
I'm so sorry for your loss.

851
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,060
I'm gonna need you to reschedule

852
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,840
my morning appointment.

853
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,190
One second.

854
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,500
Come in.

855
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,890
I'm gonna have to
call you back, okay?

856
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,030
All right.

857
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,640
Patrick Dunn's being transported

858
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,810
to Med in an ambulance.

859
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,340
What happened?

860
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,380
Self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the chest.

861
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,080
He tried to kill himself
during a standoff with police.

862
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,390
He's alive, but barely.

863
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,840
Save it.

864
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,360
What?

865
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,620
What did you say?

866
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,490
Save it? Save it?

867
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,760
Are you kidding?

868
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,800
That kid never
had to have surgery,

869
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,460
but you pushed it, he died,

870
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,810
and the blame for that
falls directly onto you.

871
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,330
Yeah.

872
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,940
You think waiting
would have saved Jordan?

873
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,940
He was a time bomb
waiting to happen.

874
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,340
I gave him a chance to live.

875
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,690
He would still be here
if not for you.

876
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,170
You don't know that.

877
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,080
But go ahead and live
in your alternate reality

878
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,820
where Dean Archer
is always right,

879
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,260
and I will live in this one,

880
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,180
where sometimes
we lose patients.

881
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,530
You made a bad call,
and you goddamn well know it!

882
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,880
When your tantrum is over,
I'll be in the ED

883
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,050
treating patients.

884
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,970
You're gonna answer for this.
