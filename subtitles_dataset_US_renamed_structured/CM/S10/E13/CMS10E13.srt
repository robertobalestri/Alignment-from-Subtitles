1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:07,049
Just because Carl is
going for full custody

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,008
<i>does not mean he's gonna get it.</i>

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,184
He's gonna use my
psych hold against me.

4
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:13,360
I'm really glad to
have you in my corner.

5
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:15,231
<i>It means more than you know.</i>

6
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:22,195
<i>I'm seeing my attacker
whenever I'm in my office.</i>

7
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:24,632
In my experience, when
you try to run away

8
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,809
from your demons,
they chase you.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,159
<i>You never made it back
to my place last night.</i>

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,423
I'm worried you're trying
to numb your grief.

11
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:35,643
- Watch where you're going!
- Get out of my face.

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,875
That's right. Stay down.

13
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,534
Where's that smart mouth now?

14
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:11,940
Well, it sounds to me, anyway,

15
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,160
like you're feeling a
lot closer to normal,

16
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,639
and that makes me happy.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,293
Well, I don't know about normal,

18
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:20,731
but I now know the value
of a good therapist.

19
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:22,168
Does that mean I'm gonna
get a big, fat raise?

20
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,865
No.

21
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:26,389
Okay, well, I'm still happy
you're feeling better, I guess.

22
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,392
Is that Jackie?

23
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,655
Hey, good morning.
- Good morning, Jackie.

24
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:33,483
Ms. Goodwin, good morning.
Good morning, Dr. Charles.

25
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:36,096
- How're you doing?
- Good, good.

26
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:40,708
Ah, you know, this is
gonna take forever.

27
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,405
I'm just gonna head
back to the ED, I think.

28
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:43,406
Why don't you give
us your order?

29
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:44,581
I'll bring it up.
- Oh, no.

30
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:45,800
No, no, it's fine.
- You sure?

31
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,803
Yeah, yeah, I'll
see you in there.

32
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:54,025
What was that all about?

33
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:55,462
Oh, I don't know, man.

34
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:58,682
That was very... that
was weird, wasn't it?

35
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:00,162
Okay.

36
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,946
What?

37
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:06,081
That looks good.

38
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:07,778
Where am I?

39
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,650
Martin, I told you,
we're at the hospital.

40
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,608
Okay, so how did this happen?

41
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,393
Someone turned off the
TV he was watching,

42
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,177
and he got mad and
smashed a lamp.

43
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,352
He's been getting
pretty worked up

44
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,093
over that kind of thing lately.
- Got it.

45
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:22,097
Any history of bleeding
disorder or, uh, diabetes?

46
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:23,664
I'm really not sure.

47
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,362
Okay. Any family
we can contact?

48
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:28,364
Unfortunately, no.

49
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:30,149
All we know is that
he was living alone

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,454
until he set his
stovetop on fire.

51
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:33,152
CFD turned him
over to the state,

52
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,154
and when a cognitive
eval tagged dementia,

53
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,677
he ended up at our facility.

54
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:40,637
All right, I see bedsores,
and he's pretty thin.

55
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:42,422
When's the last
time he took a bath?

56
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:43,684
Look, there's only three of us

57
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,251
on the entire memory care floor

58
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,862
trying to rotate
through all the rooms.

59
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,299
How long is this gonna take?

60
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,040
Martin's not my only patient.

61
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,650
I need to get back
to the facility.

62
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,478
Well, you're gonna have to
hang tight because Dr. Archer

63
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,046
wants occupational therapy
to examine Martin's hand

64
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,222
before he's released.

65
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,311
Where am I?

66
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:04,184
You are right here
with me, Martin.

67
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,887
- Uh...
- What is it?

68
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:15,237
Uh, uh.

69
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:19,415
Okay.

70
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,678
Listen to me. We're
gonna figure this out.

71
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,463
I'm gonna take good
care of you, Martin.

72
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:26,422
You hear me? I promise.

73
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:41,437
What happened to your lip?

74
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:44,353
I'm fine.

75
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:47,182
You got in a fight
last night, didn't you?

76
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:48,705
Yeah, let's not do this again.

77
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:50,229
You, uh... you
made your feelings

78
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,535
perfectly clear last night.

79
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,409
Could use you in T6.

80
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,019
Patient's complaining
of back pains,

81
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,107
but there's... there's no rush.

82
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,388
Okay, I'll be there in a moment.

83
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,376
Oh, Ms. Copeland,
this is Dr. Asher.

84
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:08,725
You can call me Eva.

85
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:09,813
Hi, Eva.

86
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,206
I heard you've got
some back pain.

87
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,687
Can you show me where it hurts?

88
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:17,256
Okay, any chance you
could be pregnant?

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,083
- No.
- Are you sexually active?

90
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:22,565
My fiancé and I, we've been
saving ourselves for marriage.

91
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:25,264
Okay, so when did
your back pain start?

92
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,309
When I woke up this morning.

93
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,964
I'm a bit of a wild sleeper.

94
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,270
Oh, I am the same way.

95
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,098
My poor fiancé has no
idea what he's in for.

96
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,578
Ow!
- Ooh.

97
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,408
All right, I'm
gonna lie you back.

98
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,193
Okay?

99
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:43,673
Ow!

100
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:45,719
Okay, I am done
torturing you, Eva.

101
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,851
Let's get a CBC and a BMP.

102
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:48,939
You got it.

103
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,594
We'll be right back.

104
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:54,554
- And an ultrasound?
- And a pregnancy test.

105
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,077
Victor Tullman, 52 years old.

106
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:58,297
Was ejected when his motorcycle
hit a retaining wall.

107
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,428
Got lodged in the fence line.

108
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,038
CFD extracted him at the scene.

109
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,127
Oh, it hurts so bad.

110
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:04,781
All right, we're gonna
get you fixed up, Victor.

111
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:07,349
All right, come on.
Put him in here.

112
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,961
You know, we're gonna keep
this here for a moment, yeah?

113
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:13,747
All right, push one of
Dilaudid and a tetanus shot.

114
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:14,835
Copy that.

115
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,358
It's embedded in the chest wall.

116
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,881
All right, and the
other's anterior.

117
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:20,319
You stabilize while I
dissect the barbs one by one.

118
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,800
Give me a heavy clamp and a
pair of wire cutters, please.

119
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,064
- Careful.
- Dilaudid's on board.

120
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,153
Tetanus is up next.
- Okay, good. Let's clamp.

121
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,503
All right, let me get
this out of the way first.

122
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,331
All right.

123
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,332
You in?

124
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,724
Yeah.

125
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,161
Got it. One down, one to go.

126
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:40,339
Irrigate to make sure there's
no retained foreign bodies.

127
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,166
Now this one is deep.

128
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,083
Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,129
Okay.
- All right.

130
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,174
It's out.

131
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,176
All right, good job.

132
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,178
All right, let's get him a...

133
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,790
Oh!

134
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,922
Is that what I think it is?

135
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:02,012
That is his lung.

136
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,849
Eviscerated lung.
I've read about them.

137
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,547
Multiple rib fractures
created instability

138
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,462
in the chest, allowed the lung

139
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,594
to herniate through
the chest wall.

140
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:21,467
Pressure from his cough
forced it through the opening.

141
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,948
So what's our plan of
attack, Ms. Howard?

142
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:27,037
Immediate surgery
to reduce the lung

143
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,300
and reconstruct the chest wall.

144
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,564
Yes.

145
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,044
And what else?

146
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,786
Um...

147
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:40,224
His EKG showed low-voltage
conduction disturbances.

148
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:41,617
He has a weakened heart muscle.

149
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,140
Before he gets anesthesia,

150
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,099
it's a good idea to make
sure it doesn't kill him.

151
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,535
Right, of course.

152
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:49,364
Let's page Dr. Hayes for
a cardiothoracic consult

153
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,192
before surgery.

154
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,719
She's had enough hand-holding.
- Oh, please, I get it.

155
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,417
Yeah, yeah, but what concerns me

156
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,071
is that you're getting
into her head too much.

157
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,943
I hope I am.

158
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,771
Naomi has to learn not
to buckle under pressure,

159
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:07,774
or she's gonna spend her entire
career threading catheters.

160
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,776
Naomi's going to
match very soon.

161
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,778
I want to make sure she's ready.

162
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,223
You finally getting that
first cup of coffee?

163
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:25,531
Yep.

164
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,708
Hey, look, um...

165
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,145
I wanted to ask you or just, uh,

166
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:34,322
make sure that we're...

167
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:37,368
we're okay, I mean, after
that... whatever happened,

168
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,762
or rather, didn't
happen last night.

169
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,721
Yeah, of course.

170
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:43,984
It was just a weird
moment, I think.

171
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:46,595
Yes, definitely.

172
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:49,468
Um, so you have your...

173
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,731
you got your... your custody
hearing this afternoon.

174
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,994
How you doing with that?

175
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:56,475
Yeah, I'm gonna leave
here in an hour.

176
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,346
I'm gonna go change
and head over.

177
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:00,522
I gotta find a perfect outfit

178
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,960
that says I am capable
of caring for my child.

179
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,571
Please don't do
that to yourself.

180
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,181
How can I not?

181
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:09,662
Carl's lawyer, she's...
she's going after me.

182
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,925
She's got a child psychologist.

183
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,667
She's got an expert
in self-harm.

184
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,584
She's even got somebody from
the psych ward coming in.

185
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,194
From here? From Gaffney?

186
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,326
Yeah, Dr. Nemic.
Do you know him?

187
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:23,806
Yeah.

188
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,547
Good doc.

189
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,767
I mean, at least he'll... he'll
play it straight, you know?

190
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:30,160
But can I just give you
a little piece of advice,

191
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,727
if you'll allow me?

192
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,860
Just try and stay out of,
oh, what are they gonna do?

193
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,644
What are they not
gonna do, you know,

194
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:39,909
and focus on the stuff
that you can control.

195
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,128
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

196
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,392
I don't feel like I
can control anything.

197
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,873
Looks like he has an underlying

198
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,397
constrictive cardiomyopathy.

199
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:52,532
Thank you, Doris.
- Thank you, Dr. Hayes.

200
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,056
Repairing his heart
is my priority.

201
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:58,362
Let's get him upstairs ASAP.

202
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:00,669
Respectfully, I disagree.

203
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,236
Oh?

204
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:04,717
We have to repair the
exposed lung first.

205
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:07,502
Every second we wait increases
his risk of deadly infection.

206
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,591
I hear you, Dr. Lenox, but
there's significant thickening

207
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:10,723
of the pericardium.

208
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,246
It's impeding perfusion.

209
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:13,726
A repaired lung is not gonna
do much good if his heart

210
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,249
gives out on the table.

211
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,033
Well, what if we take a
thoracoscopic approach,

212
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,166
fix the heart and
lung simultaneously?

213
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,255
Bold but riskier approach.

214
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,431
But we could limit his
time under anesthesia,

215
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,476
which minimizes the risk of
a stroke and cardiac arrest

216
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,609
during surgery.

217
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,219
Interesting.

218
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,179
But we'd have to drop the
left lung to reach the heart.

219
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,094
If there's an air
leak on the right,

220
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,269
we won't be able to ventilate.

221
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,400
He dies on the table.

222
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,011
Well, I'm not
concerned about that.

223
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:41,449
We can protect the eviscerated
lung and secure the opening.

224
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,929
I'll have my team prep the OR.

225
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,540
Excellent idea, Ms. Howard.

226
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,760
Would you like to
scrub in with us?

227
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,805
- That would be amazing.
- Great.

228
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,024
See you both up there.

229
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:05,952
What you have is called
an ectopic pregnancy.

230
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,344
I'm pregnant?

231
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,520
Not in the traditional sense.

232
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:12,698
See, your egg became fertilized
in the fallopian tube,

233
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,004
which is normal, but
it got stuck there,

234
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,659
and it never traveled
to the uterus.

235
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,358
That's what's causing your
abdomen and back pain.

236
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,708
But if the tube ruptured,

237
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,927
it could quickly turn
life-threatening.

238
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:28,104
Well, what happens now?

239
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,324
Now we need to
remove the pregnancy.

240
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:33,240
Fortunately, this is a routine
laparoscopic procedure,

241
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,981
and you'll be back on
your feet in a week.

242
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:38,158
Eva, your fiancé just checked
into the waiting room.

243
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,507
Can I let him come in?

244
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:40,683
He can't know.

245
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,381
I can't tell him if
you don't want me to,

246
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:47,603
but wouldn't he want to know?

247
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,172
It's not his.

248
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:55,088
Please. He'll leave me.

249
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:06,665
- Sharon?
- Yeah?

250
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,406
- You got a minute?
- Of course. What's up?

251
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:11,887
I got a patient
that was brought in

252
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:15,848
from a state dementia care
facility with a hand injury.

253
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:19,155
Nothing serious, but I've been
slow playing his treatment.

254
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,723
So what's your concern?

255
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:24,291
He's underweight, hasn't bathed.

256
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,380
And I was checking out
his medication history,

257
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,164
and it's all over the place.

258
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,558
They had him on statins
and took him off.

259
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,516
And then they had
him on levothyroxine,

260
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,780
and they discontinued that too.

261
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:37,478
So you think it's neglect?

262
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,784
Yes.

263
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,873
These facilities can
be dumping grounds

264
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:43,136
for insurance companies.

265
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,878
Well, what about
family, friends?

266
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,445
No family, and I checked
out last-known address,

267
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:52,058
and no one's heard of Martin.

268
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,581
He must have been
a bit of a shut-in.

269
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,497
So you want to know
if we should report?

270
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:59,065
I don't want to sound
the alarm unnecessarily,

271
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,850
but I can't help but feeling
that Martin's trying to tell me

272
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,766
something important but can't.

273
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:08,422
You know, Bert exhales
and groans a little

274
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:11,991
when he doesn't like something
and can't find the words.

275
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:15,516
Dementia patients
have small signs

276
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:20,434
that are language that
we have to understand.

277
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:24,134
You need more time
to know Martin's.

278
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,050
- All right, what have we got?
- 34-year-old male.

279
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:30,183
GCS 12.

280
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,446
Hypotensive with an
oxygen level of 90.

281
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,926
Came home drunk last
night and passed out.

282
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,449
When his wife tried to
wake him up this morning,

283
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,755
he could barely
keep his eyes open.

284
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,931
- Oxygen's down to 88.
- Please help him.

285
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:40,584
Did he take anything unusual?

286
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:43,196
A new medication that doesn't
mix well with alcohol?

287
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,501
I don't know.

288
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,068
He went out last night
to meet some friends.

289
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,635
He's got some bruising
here on the ribs.

290
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:48,810
Did he say how that happened?

291
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,160
He mentioned falling
down stairs, but...

292
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,466
You think he got into a fight?

293
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,381
I love him, but he's a hothead.

294
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:56,296
Stethoscope?

295
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,950
When did he start having
difficulty breathing?

296
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,821
In the car on the way here.

297
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:00,909
Okay, let's intubate.

298
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,824
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

299
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,217
On it.

300
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:13,356
Where's that smart mouth now?

301
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,316
Meds are in.

302
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,450
Ripley? You cool?

303
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,107
Yeah.

304
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,370
All good.

305
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,814
Oxygen at 94 and climbing.

306
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,554
No free fluid in his abdomen.

307
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,905
No sign of any traumatic injury.

308
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,255
Maybe it's a
retroperitoneal bleed.

309
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,823
His kidneys look normal
in the ultrasound.

310
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,868
Yeah, but if he
took a flank shot,

311
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,479
there's a possibility it
could have opened a slow bleed

312
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,179
that wouldn't necessarily
show up on a scan right away.

313
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,702
Fair call.

314
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,095
Graysen, let's order a CT

315
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,097
of his posterior
abdomen and pelvis,

316
00:13:58,098 --> 00:13:59,750
and then we'll go from there.
- Copy.

317
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,622
Okay.

318
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,580
Thanks for the assist.

319
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,452
Yeah.

320
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:08,368
Keep me in the loop.

321
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,283
I can't believe you called
protective services.

322
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,893
It's my job to ensure
that all patients

323
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,242
are properly cared for.

324
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:14,722
Well, it's a colossal
waste of time.

325
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,159
Well, I'm sorry I held you up.

326
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,597
Not this again.
Martin, lift your feet.

327
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,208
Where did I go?

328
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,862
Come on, Martin,
we gotta go home.

329
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,647
Wait, stop.

330
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,779
It's okay, Martin.

331
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,042
Why don't you come with me?

332
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:35,917
Where am I?

333
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,137
You don't see yourself.

334
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,966
Where did I go?

335
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,750
Bri, you said that
Martin would get upset

336
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,012
every time you
turned the TV off?

337
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,145
That's right. He'd freak out.

338
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,887
Didn't want to miss
his game shows.

339
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,847
- What would he say?
- Same thing as now.

340
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:55,719
Where am I? Where did
I go? Over and over.

341
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,897
He wasn't upset you
turned the TV off.

342
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:03,249
He was upset at his own
reflection on the empty screen.

343
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,946
Okay, Martin.

344
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,731
Why don't you sit down?

345
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:09,909
Okay.

346
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,260
I am not discharging him.

347
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,872
Stay put.

348
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,179
You were right.

349
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,094
Slow bleed from the right kidney

350
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,965
that's leaking into
the perinephric space.

351
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,445
I didn't want to be right.

352
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:27,186
I'm giving him a couple
of units of blood.

353
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:29,318
I already spoke to trauma,
and once an OR is available,

354
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,277
I'm gonna get him
upstairs for surgery.

355
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,757
You want to remove his kidney?

356
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,846
Well, I'm afraid
we have no choice.

357
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,632
Well, we could take him to
angio and embolize the bleed.

358
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,764
I wish we could,
but it looks like

359
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,462
the bleed's coming
off the vena cava,

360
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,029
so kidney has to come out.

361
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,379
I'd go more conservative.

362
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,381
Look, this is a young
guy who got in a fight.

363
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,557
I'd rather... I'd rather he
didn't have to lose a kidney

364
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,559
over one bad decision.

365
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,214
So I'm just sort of surprised

366
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:58,608
that you want to embolize
when he came in hypotensive.

367
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,175
We'd be risking his life for...

368
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,786
Neither of us want
that, obviously.

369
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,919
But I'm surprised you jumped
to such an extreme measure

370
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,355
when there are other options

371
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,227
that don't involve
removing a kidney.

372
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,577
He'll still have another one,

373
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:15,408
and we're not talking about
a lifetime on dialysis here.

374
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,064
Dude, are you okay?

375
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,936
Don't worry about me.
Just cancel the OR.

376
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:24,025
Schedule the embolization.

377
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,811
Okay, so you're just
pulling rank, then?

378
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,989
Yeah, I guess so.

379
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,397
I feel like you're
angry with me.

380
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,399
I disagree with you.
There's a difference.

381
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,229
You think I overstepped
with Dr. Hayes?

382
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,449
I think you blurted out the
first idea that came to mind

383
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,148
to impress a world-renowned
cardiothoracic surgeon.

384
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,979
No, I actually believe
in this approach.

385
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,459
But did you think
it through first?

386
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,635
Because I see endless
potential for error.

387
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:09,810
And when it comes to surgery,

388
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,465
you have to think
three steps ahead.

389
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:15,468
You told me to find my
voice, to speak my mind.

390
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,296
Now I have, and
you're still unhappy?

391
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,124
So which is it?
- It's both.

392
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,082
You have to pick your
moments because everything

393
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,562
you do between now and match day

394
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:25,478
can have a significant
impact on your career.

395
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,350
I'm sorry you're angry he
preferred my idea to yours...

396
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:31,092
That's not what this is about.

397
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,833
Are you sure?

398
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,662
Yes.

399
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,795
Dr. Hayes liked your idea,
and I know that feels good.

400
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,362
But if this surgery goes south,

401
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:43,278
the only thing he's going
to remember is the failure.

402
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,714
And he won't punish
himself for that.

403
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:46,151
He will punish you.

404
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:48,109
And all your match
opportunities will vanish.

405
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,329
And then where will you be?

406
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,417
I'm a big girl.

407
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,075
OR is prepped. Is
the patient ready?

408
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,556
What's up?

409
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,606
I think it might be
best if I sit this out.

410
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:08,521
May I ask why?

411
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,566
I'm not on board with
the surgical plan.

412
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,307
You still object to
deflating the good lung

413
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,700
in order to reach the heart?

414
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,049
Yes.

415
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,269
And if he crumps,
his trauma injuries

416
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,141
prevent us from administering
heparin to put him on bypass.

417
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,536
I don't want my doubts to
negatively impact the outcome.

418
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,190
Understood.

419
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,843
Ms. Howard and I will
take it from here.

420
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,250
And to be clear,

421
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,904
you don't feel that Penny
is safe with your wife?

422
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,471
No, I don't.

423
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:46,820
And why is that?

424
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,996
Jackie's been prone to
depression for years,

425
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,782
and it got a lot worse leading
up to her suicide attempt.

426
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,437
Look, I don't want to be here

427
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:57,178
trying to take custody
away from my wife.

428
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,355
That's Penny's mother.
This is killing me.

429
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,314
Then why are you doing it?

430
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,839
I don't feel I have a choice.

431
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,884
I've seen my wife go to a place

432
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:10,800
where she can't see anything
else but her own pain.

433
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:13,499
And God forbid, if she
chose to do something

434
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,501
to herself again and hurt Penny,

435
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:17,895
I'd never forgive myself.

436
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,900
Hi, Eva.

437
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,599
So I'd like to go over your
procedure again with you.

438
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,167
I will make a small
incision near your navel,

439
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,604
and from there, I
will go in and remove

440
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:35,216
the ectopic pregnancy and
the affected fallopian tube.

441
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,784
Okay, we're gonna give
you a little bit of Versed

442
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:40,917
to take some of the edge off
before going to the OR, okay?

443
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:43,006
Yeah. Okay.

444
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:46,184
Do you think I'm
a horrible person?

445
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,620
No.

446
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,318
I love Caleb so much.

447
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,015
He helped get me on the path.

448
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:56,629
I just can't stand the
thought of disappointing him.

449
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,718
My eyelids feel so heavy.

450
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,937
Yeah, that's the
Versed kicking in.

451
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,855
I just...

452
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:09,250
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

453
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:13,124
I told him. I told him not to.

454
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:19,086
I said no.

455
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:22,481
Please, no, no, no.

456
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:25,135
Please stop.

457
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:27,095
Don't do this.

458
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,620
It hurts.

459
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:37,800
I'm through the pleura.

460
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,933
Marty, can we drop
the left lung, please?

461
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:42,283
On it.

462
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,546
Lung's deflated.

463
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,592
Vitals holding steady.

464
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:48,855
Perfect. You're doing
fine, Ms. Howard.

465
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:50,683
Just keep holding that
angle on the scope.

466
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,380
I'll cut the scar tissue away,

467
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,948
and then we can reduce the lung
and reconstruct the chest wall.

468
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,645
Sound like a good plan to you?

469
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:57,995
Yes, Dr. Hayes.

470
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,785
You got benched?

471
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,309
I benched myself.

472
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,790
Why is that?

473
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,618
Dr. Hayes and I
couldn't reach consensus

474
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,054
on a surgical approach,

475
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:16,317
so I thought it best
to remove myself.

476
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,014
Sure.

477
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,886
I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

478
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:22,323
that the Caitlin Lenox
that I've dealt with

479
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:25,152
would never just remove herself.

480
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:27,285
This is about Naomi.

481
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,071
A thoracoscopic dual repair
seems like an impressive pull

482
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:33,334
for a med student,
especially when it was

483
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,901
said medical student's idea.

484
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:37,817
Oh, and you're worried
that it would backfire?

485
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:39,471
I tried to throw
her a life jacket,

486
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:40,994
and she accused me of jealousy.

487
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:43,736
Oh, I see.

488
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,825
It was disrespectful
and reckless.

489
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,522
Neither of us
should throw stones

490
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,655
on that particular point.

491
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:51,787
But she stood up to you.

492
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:54,137
I would call that progress.

493
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,099
Med students take
what you teach them

494
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,145
and eventually use
it against you.

495
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,625
That's right, and they
become the competition,

496
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,106
whether we want to
admit that or not.

497
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,371
I hate this feeling.

498
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,374
I did too.

499
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,158
Did?

500
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,160
Yeah, well, I learned
to love that feeling.

501
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,555
It means I've done
my job as a mentor.

502
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,210
You know what?

503
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:26,431
Naomi's only in there
right now because of you.

504
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:30,260
You should be proud of that.

505
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,787
Sats are falling.

506
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:37,529
What do you think?

507
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,749
Put him on bypass.

508
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:44,492
He'll bleed out from heparin.

509
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:50,890
<i>You prepped the femorals.</i>

510
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,674
<i>I figured I'd have it ready</i>

511
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,807
in case we needed central line
access or to put him on bypass.

512
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,548
Impressive call.

513
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,506
You're thinking
three steps ahead.

514
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:00,160
Well done.

515
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,645
She's a transgender woman.

516
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:09,691
Name is Loretta.
Because of the dementia,

517
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,258
she didn't recognize
her own reflection.

518
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,607
And you were right.

519
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,435
She was trying to
tell you something.

520
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,176
Mm-hmm.

521
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:17,960
All the neighbors I contacted
from her last known address

522
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,006
had no idea who Martin was.

523
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:23,096
So as a last Hail Mary,
I sent them a photo.

524
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:25,664
If the name didn't ring a
bell, maybe a face would.

525
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:26,795
Mm-hmm.

526
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:28,275
One of them sent me this photo

527
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:31,017
and said that Loretta was
kind, warm, and gregarious.

528
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:32,322
Hmm.

529
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,847
She was getting hormone
replacement therapy.

530
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:37,458
She must have fallen
behind on her injections

531
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,068
when the dementia took hold.

532
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:40,374
Yeah, by the time the
state took her in,

533
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,550
she was no longer
presenting as a woman.

534
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,247
Mm-hmm.

535
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:46,946
And I know this is
different, obviously,

536
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:50,166
but that pain in her eyes,

537
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,517
I recognized it.

538
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:55,302
Loretta deserves better than
the care that she's getting.

539
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:58,523
Yeah, agreed. She needs
the proper resources.

540
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:01,961
You know, there's a new
LGBTQ+ memory care center

541
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:03,919
that recently opened a wing

542
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,226
dedicated to
transgender patients.

543
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:08,881
The administrator
owes me a favor.

544
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:11,058
Thanks, Sharon.

545
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:15,540
I'm sorry. You were right.

546
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,804
I should have taken the time
to pay closer attention.

547
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:22,199
I just wish there was
something I could do.

548
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,638
There is something.

549
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:30,859
- He's bradying down.
- What's happening to him?

550
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,731
The embolization failed
to stop the bleed.

551
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:33,819
Call the OR.

552
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,907
No, he won't make it up there.

553
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:36,299
His heart's bottoming out.

554
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,518
We need to open up
his chest right here

555
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,998
and cross-clamp the aorta.

556
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,739
- I'll do it.
- No, you've done enough.

557
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,262
What the hell are you doing?

558
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:43,611
He's hypotensive.

559
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:45,004
Heart rate's down to 32.

560
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:46,440
Please, somebody help him.

561
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:48,007
Trigger the MTP and
hand me a scalpel.

562
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,356
I'm opening him up now.

563
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:50,400
Dr. Ripley, step aside.

564
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:51,880
I don't what's
going on with you,

565
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:53,055
but you're out of line
and out of control.

566
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,493
- I need to do this.
- Step aside now.

567
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,798
- It has to be me.
- Why?

568
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,148
Because I did this to him!

569
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,021
He's in asystole.

570
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:04,023
Oh, my God, do something!

571
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:05,546
Get out. You can't
be here right now.

572
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,243
Get out. Prep.

573
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:08,549
Come on.

574
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:12,988
Scalpel.

575
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:14,381
Hold compressions.

576
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,345
Okay, give me an aortic clamp

577
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,348
and prep one milligram
intracardiac epinephrine.

578
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:33,313
What is Adam
O'Rourke's condition?

579
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,793
Right now, you should be

580
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:36,621
a little more concerned
about yourself.

581
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:37,883
Please.

582
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:41,277
He's in surgery to
repair the vena cava

583
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,366
and remove his kidney.

584
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:47,109
He's expected to
make a full recovery.

585
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,459
- Good.
- No, no.

586
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,027
Saving him does not save you.

587
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:55,596
His wife is planning to
sue, one way or another.

588
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:59,514
I'm afraid your presence in
the ED has become a liability.

589
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:04,126
Look, whatever you have to do,

590
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,998
I understand.

591
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,131
I'm suspending you without
pay effective immediately

592
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:10,785
until further notice.

593
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:13,353
There will be a
formal investigation,

594
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:16,617
hearing, and judgment.

595
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:20,447
I don't intend to
fight you or the board,

596
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:23,624
to blame anyone else,
or make excuses.

597
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,235
I... I brought this on myself.

598
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,630
I'm deeply sorry for the trouble

599
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,198
I have caused this hospital.

600
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,896
Full disclosure,

601
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:37,856
I'm recommending that
the board terminate you.

602
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,645
I appreciate your honesty.

603
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:49,520
You have left me no
choice, Dr. Ripley.

604
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:54,960
Just go home.

605
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,837
Hey, Eva.

606
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:04,447
You did so good.

607
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:06,275
How are you feeling?

608
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,887
Good. I'm a little tired.

609
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:10,410
Where's Caleb?

610
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:12,020
He'll be here soon.

611
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:14,109
I just...

612
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,635
I wanted to talk to you
about something first.

613
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,375
Okay.

614
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,464
Eva, do you remember
what you said

615
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,423
before you went into surgery,

616
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:26,469
right before you went under?

617
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,430
No, I don't remember anything.

618
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:34,086
Eva, did someone hurt you?

619
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:35,566
Please, can you get Caleb?

620
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:38,917
Nothing that we discuss in here

621
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:41,747
will ever leave this room,
unless you want it to.

622
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,927
Um...

623
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:51,451
a few months ago,

624
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:54,628
I went to stay with my
best friend, Athena,

625
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:58,327
and her family on the lake.

626
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,242
Caleb wasn't there.

627
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:02,941
He had to work.

628
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:06,118
So Athena broke
out the champagne

629
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,555
to celebrate my engagement.

630
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:12,124
And we drank some wine.

631
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:15,475
Her cousin was there.

632
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,956
When I went to bed,

633
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:21,307
he, uh...

634
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:25,659
he came in my room, and...

635
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,401
I told him to stop,
but he wouldn't.

636
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:33,058
And I was just so
drunk that I went numb,

637
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,148
like I wasn't even in my body.

638
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,498
He raped you.

639
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,674
I think I'd been sending
him mixed signals.

640
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:42,589
Like, I'd been really
sweet to him all night.

641
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,765
Hey, hey, don't you
think for a second

642
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,898
that being sweet
justifies his behavior.

643
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:49,074
It doesn't.

644
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:50,684
This was not your fault.

645
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:53,992
You said no. End of discussion.

646
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,255
Yeah, I know.

647
00:28:56,256 --> 00:29:00,128
I am so sorry that this
happened to you, Eva.

648
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:03,044
And I am here to help
you, however you want.

649
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,353
Do you think I
should tell Caleb?

650
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,706
I think that that's up to you.

651
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,232
Can you be there
when I tell him?

652
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,887
Of course, I will.

653
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,593
Ms. Embry, your next witness.

654
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:31,856
Actually, um, sorry, Your Honor.

655
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:34,772
We might want to
adjust slightly.

656
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,556
We're still waiting on a
representative from Gaffney,

657
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,819
Dr. Orson Nemic.

658
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,649
Um, Dr. Nemic, uh,
had an emergency.

659
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,520
He asked me to step
in. I'm Dan Charles.

660
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,741
I'm the, um, head of
psychiatry at Gaffney.

661
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:49,438
You're familiar with
Ms. Nelson's case?

662
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,918
I am, Your Honor.

663
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,964
I'm actually the doctor who
committed her last year.

664
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,748
Okay.

665
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:57,925
I'm okay with it, so
long as both sides agree.

666
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:04,323
It's fine with us.

667
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,194
Ms. Embry?

668
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:07,674
We're good, Your Honor.

669
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:09,633
Then please take the
stand, Dr. Charles.

670
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:14,855
You placed Mrs. Nelson
on a psychiatric hold

671
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,858
because you considered her a
threat to herself, correct?

672
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,599
Yes.

673
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,082
That's actually a core criteria
for placing somebody on a 5150.

674
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,954
And in a state like
that, is someone capable

675
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:29,435
of properly considering
the health and safety

676
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,306
of others around them?
- No.

677
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:33,439
And let's be crystal
clear about the state

678
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,093
Mrs. Nelson was in.

679
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:37,312
She was found bleeding
on the bathroom floor

680
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:38,966
after cutting herself, correct?

681
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,576
That's correct.

682
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,448
And why do you
think that happened?

683
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:43,971
Well, at that
point, Mrs. Nelson

684
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:48,454
had been working in the
burn unit for over 10 years.

685
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:52,414
And in my opinion, she was
suffering from severe PTSD.

686
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:56,114
Isn't PTSD a chronic,
difficult-to-treat condition?

687
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:59,117
Well, the biggest challenge
in addressing PTSD

688
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,640
isn't treating it.

689
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,120
It's getting the
sufferer to acknowledge

690
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:03,686
that they need help.

691
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:07,908
And once this crisis broke
through Mrs. Nelson's denial,

692
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,824
she threw herself
into her recovery.

693
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:13,653
She took a two-month
leave of absence,

694
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:15,873
underwent intensive
psychotherapy.

695
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,353
She's doing everything
that you're supposed to do

696
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:22,140
to prevent a relapse, and
in my opinion, anyway,

697
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:26,318
is no more of a threat to
her child than I am to mine.

698
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,624
A moment, Your Honor?

699
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,852
Dr. Charles, how
would you describe

700
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:42,551
the nature of your relationship
with Mrs. Nelson now?

701
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:44,858
I'm sorry, I don't
understand the question.

702
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:46,381
Well, you seem to know
a lot about someone

703
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:47,948
who isn't under
your direct care.

704
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,645
Well, we're...
we're colleagues.

705
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:51,691
We work together.

706
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:52,953
Friends?

707
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,999
In a professional
context, anyway.

708
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,437
And are you romantically
involved with Jackie Nelson?

709
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,091
Objection.

710
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:02,963
Your Honor, this is
wildly inappropriate.

711
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,313
Isn't this your
witness, counselor?

712
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:07,272
This is a replacement
for my witness,

713
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,970
and I believe he might
have a certain bias.

714
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,712
Make it quick, Ms. Embry.

715
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:15,976
Dr. Charles, are you now

716
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,892
or have you ever been
romantically involved

717
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,676
with Jackie Nelson?
- Absolutely not.

718
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:25,812
And do you have romantic
feelings for Mrs. Nelson?

719
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:28,642
No, I do not.

720
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:32,210
No more questions, Your Honor.

721
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:52,099
Ms. Howard just
went downstairs,

722
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,972
if that's who
you're looking for.

723
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,409
He seems to be
recovering nicely.

724
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,846
In no small part
thanks to Naomi.

725
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,500
As you can imagine,

726
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:04,459
I have worked with a
lot of med students.

727
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,245
She is one of the best
and brightest I've seen.

728
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:08,724
She speaks her mind.

729
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:12,250
And that's a testament
to your mentorship.

730
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:13,686
I appreciate that.

731
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,818
I appreciated your honesty today

732
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,733
and how you removed yourself

733
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,648
from a procedure that
you didn't agree with.

734
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,259
That is integrity.

735
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,437
Thank you, but you clearly
had everything under control.

736
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,352
Did I?

737
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:30,050
We so often discuss
and debate and consider

738
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,574
all possible options,
but at some point,

739
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,533
you just got to take
a leap of faith.

740
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,622
I don't agree.

741
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,189
I'm not surprised.

742
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,105
Faith is a roll of the dice,
and life is random enough.

743
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:43,368
So I prefer to game
out possible outcomes

744
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:45,631
and stress test the
merits and dangers

745
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:49,069
and determine which
is the strongest path.

746
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,376
I prefer solid
ground under my feet.

747
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:53,074
Can I buy you dinner, Caitlin?

748
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:56,076
You haven't been listening.

749
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:00,124
I'll see you
tomorrow, Dr. Hayes.

750
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,604
Good night, Dr. Lenox.

751
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:06,521
Tell me what?

752
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,872
I, um...

753
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,920
I wasn't being completely
honest with you earlier

754
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:17,097
about my surgery.

755
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,883
Okay.

756
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,757
Well, be honest now.

757
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:28,761
Dr. Asher didn't
remove a cyst.

758
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:33,114
She removed an
ectopic pregnancy.

759
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,422
Pregnancy?

760
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:42,296
When I was up at Athena's
cabin, her cousin, he...

761
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:45,560
he came into my bed that night.

762
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,302
And he raped me.

763
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:52,741
Caleb, please don't hate me.

764
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,930
I could never hate you.

765
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:09,976
I love you.

766
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,805
I love you too.

767
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:16,417
It's gonna be all right, Eva.

768
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:19,203
God is merciful.
He forgives you.

769
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:25,165
And eventually,

770
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,298
I will too.

771
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:31,650
Eva has nothing
to apologize for.

772
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:32,999
Excuse me?

773
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,696
She was assaulted.

774
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,394
She doesn't need
your forgiveness.

775
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:38,657
She needs your support.
- Dr. Asher.

776
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:41,399
There is only one judgment
that matters to me,

777
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,966
and it is definitely not yours.

778
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,533
She didn't deserve
for this to happen.

779
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:47,840
She said no and was
forced against her will.

780
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,190
Eva?

781
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,196
I appreciate your
support, Dr. Asher.

782
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:57,545
I really do.

783
00:35:57,546 --> 00:36:02,898
But now this is between
me, Caleb, and God.

784
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:04,813
Eva, you don't...

785
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,216
Okay.

786
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:24,225
And one more thing.

787
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,793
There you go.

788
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:44,375
It's me.

789
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:50,207
Beautiful.

790
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,339
Hello, Loretta.

791
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,949
Great news.

792
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,083
The memory care center
has a bed available.

793
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:59,216
They can pick up
Loretta tonight.

794
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Thank you.

795
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,452
Prepping for your USLME exam?

796
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:21,107
I'm making my way
through your checklist.

797
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:23,457
Good.

798
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,893
You did excellent work today.

799
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:27,287
Dr. Hayes was
impressed with you.

800
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,071
And so was I.

801
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,422
Thank you.

802
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:34,686
Look, I'm... I'm sorry for
the way I talked to you.

803
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:38,386
You were honest, and I would
never fault anyone for that.

804
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:42,868
The first time I saw you,
you diagnosed and reduced

805
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:47,481
a man's dislocated hip
in under 20 seconds.

806
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:50,702
I instantly knew I
wanted to learn from you.

807
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:53,444
And it definitely
hasn't been easy.

808
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:56,795
But if it makes me
the doctor you are,

809
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:58,884
I don't regret a second of it.

810
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:06,761
What you did today
was also badass.

811
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:09,025
Thank you.

812
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,683
So let's get you prepped.

813
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:22,560
- Hey.
- Hello, there.

814
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:25,040
I thought you'd like to know
that the judge granted me

815
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:27,521
joint custody and
full parental rights.

816
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:29,306
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

817
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,179
And, um, sorry it
got so personal.

818
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,660
Hey, at least we got that
stuff figured out this morning.

819
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:39,098
Yeah, except I lied.

820
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,274
- How do you mean?
- I was embarrassed.

821
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:43,363
And, um,

822
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,583
I'm just not gonna pretend like
there's not something here.

823
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:48,368
Yeah, me, neither.

824
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:50,501
But you know what?

825
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:53,895
I'm not so sure that this
is a really good idea

826
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,854
for me right now.

827
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:57,116
Why not?

828
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:59,074
Nemic didn't have
an emergency today.

829
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,686
I cooked up an excuse for
him to stay at the hospital

830
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:04,036
and sped over to the courtroom

831
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:06,908
and jumped up on the
stand and perjured myself.

832
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:09,215
I'm really worried that
this is not starting out

833
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:10,738
in a very healthy place for me.

834
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:12,174
Daniel.

835
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:14,394
Look, something that I've
come to realize is that

836
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:16,091
when it comes to
the relationships

837
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:19,399
that really matter to me,
I'm just not very good

838
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,835
at figuring out where, you know,

839
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:23,229
the shrink ends and I begin.

840
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,406
Wow.

841
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:29,714
You're so full of
it, you know that?

842
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:31,803
It's not that you can't
turn the shrink off.

843
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:35,023
It's that you don't want
to because you like it

844
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:36,938
because it keeps you in control.

845
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:38,723
I'm not so sure you're
right about that.

846
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,247
You know, Daniel,

847
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,945
you deserve to be happy.

848
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:46,992
- I know I do.
- No, you don't.

849
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:51,475
But I sincerely
hope someday you do.

850
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:10,799
Goodwin suspended you?

851
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,109
Hannah, I...

852
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,807
Don't.

853
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,860
I swear to you.

854
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:31,689
I wasn't looking for a
fight. This guy, he just...

855
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,517
he wanted trouble.

856
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:36,128
And you just gave it to him?

857
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:37,869
If I'm trying to walk away
and someone throws a punch,

858
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,045
I'm gonna defend myself, yeah.

859
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:41,307
Anyone would.

860
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:46,007
You don't...

861
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:48,923
you don't see the irony at all.

862
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:51,317
Irony?

863
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:53,319
What... what irony?

864
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,974
A few months ago, you were
accused of assaulting Pavel.

865
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:57,890
- Falsely accused.
- That's right.

866
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:02,676
And now you're back here again.

867
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:05,200
Except this time, you did it.

868
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,292
I think that's
incredibly unfair...

869
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:11,773
You nearly killed a man.

870
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:17,648
But I... I helped
save him. I fixed it.

871
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,651
Really? That's your
takeaway? That's...

872
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:26,091
I don't even know what
to say to you anymore.

873
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:28,006
Or why you are so hell bent
on throwing this life away

874
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:31,270
that you fought so hard to have.
