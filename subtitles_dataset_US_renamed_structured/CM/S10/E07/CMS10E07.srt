1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,330
<i>- You recognize him?</i>

2
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:09,028
<i>- Patrick Dunn.
He worked in Radiology.</i>

3
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,943
- Until you let him go
a few weeks ago.

4
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:13,380
- You think he sent
the death threat?

5
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,339
- Patrick Dunn's being
transported to Med,

6
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:18,820
self-inflicted gunshot wound.

7
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:20,648
- Assertiveness and confidence,

8
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,694
<i>two critical qualities
for a doctor.</i>

9
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:27,003
- That was totally badass.

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,310
<i>- That kid never had to have
surgery, but you pushed it.</i>

11
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:32,921
He would still be here
if not for you.

12
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,619
- You don't know that.

13
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:37,839
- You made a bad call
and you goddamn well know it!

14
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,667
You're gonna answer for this.

15
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:47,110
You miss the target every time
until I step in front of it?

16
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,111
- The target's small.

17
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,503
Your fat ass is enormous.

18
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,070
- Oh, so we body-shaming now?

19
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,029
- Sir, keep your head down.

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,160
All right, what's our next move?

21
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:57,250
- Um, start an IV,
give antibiotics,

22
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:58,686
wash it out,
and then stitch it up.

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,123
- Missing something?

24
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:01,863
- Take out the ax!

25
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,778
- Take out the ax, right.

26
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:06,477
- Thankfully, our patient
has some excess soft tissue,

27
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,566
so the ax didn't hit
anything vital.

28
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,350
- See?
I'm not the only one

29
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:11,308
saying you need to lose weight, babe.

30
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:12,961
- Go ahead and get started.

31
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,659
I have a case review.

32
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:17,140
- Oh, whose case?

33
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:19,209
- Mine.

34
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,277
- Dr. Frost, I saw the time
that you took

35
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,626
with the kid in six.

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,237
It was really sweet.

37
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,629
- Oh, thanks.

38
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:31,067
I just didn't want him
to feel scared, you know?

39
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,547
Yeah, of course.

40
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,853
- Wow.

41
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:37,203
People at Jackson-Monroe
were never this nice.

42
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:39,031
- Were they complete suckers?

43
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:40,598
- What?

44
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:42,730
- You got pinned.

45
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:45,255
- I don't get it.

46
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,300
- Must be your first time
working on payday.

47
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,000
This is the pin.
- Okay.

48
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:54,742
- It's a game a traveling nurse
showed us a few months ago.

49
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,483
If you get pinned, you got
to put it on someone else

50
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:57,963
without getting caught.

51
00:01:57,987 --> 00:02:00,879
Whoever has the pin on them
at the end of the shift

52
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,446
has to pay for the first round
at Molly's.

53
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,491
And you do not
want to get caught,

54
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,319
because Molly's is packed
on payday.

55
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:09,148
- Damn, Trini,
that's cold-blooded.

56
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,541
Nice.

57
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:13,239
- Only two rules,
no Archer, no Lenox.

58
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:14,545
Archer never shows up.

59
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,722
And Lenox, well,
you don't want to lose a hand.

60
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:19,226
- Game on.

61
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,945
Yes.

62
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:25,860
- Hey, goofballs, incoming.

63
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:27,340
Man and a woman
fell down a flight of stairs.

64
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:28,733
Let's go.

65
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:30,996
- Declan Russell, 54,
walking down the stairs

66
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,650
when he lost consciousness.

67
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:35,305
- Declan? Declan?
Is he okay?

68
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,263
- She tried to catch him
and they both fell.

69
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:39,439
GCS 13, heart rate 140,

70
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:43,617
BP 85 over 55, O2 saturation 95.

71
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,010
Feels hot.

72
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,272
- He just finished treatment
for prostate cancer,

73
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:47,447
if that matters.

74
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:49,188
Oh, and he's on nitroglycerin.

75
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,103
- Are you his wife?
- No, coworker.

76
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:54,193
- On my count.
One, two, three.

77
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,760
Okay.

78
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:57,588
Looks pale.
Let's check his temp.

79
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:59,111
- BP 80 over 50.

80
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:00,460
O2 is still 95.

81
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:01,983
- Okay, lungs are clear.

82
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,769
- Okay, give a liter of saline
and prepare levophed.

83
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,901
- Fever, 102.7.

84
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:09,295
- He's been a little off
the past few days.

85
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,557
Is he gonna die?

86
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:11,863
- Dr. Ripley's
taking care of him.

87
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,647
We're doing everything
that we can.

88
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:15,475
All right, but for right now,
we have to get this jacket off.

89
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:16,824
Okay? All right.
- Okay.

90
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:19,044
- Send the sepsis panel
and start antibiotics.

91
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,437
Vanc and cefepime.

92
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,655
- Arm does look busted.

93
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,222
You know, I'm sorry,
I have to do this.

94
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,832
I have to check, all right?
Now, tell me if this hurts.

95
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:26,269
Ow. Yes.

96
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:27,748
- Yeah, all right,
let's get her an X-ray, please.

97
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,533
- Yes.

98
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,012
- And if this guy had
prostate cancer,

99
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,188
make sure his urine gets sent.

100
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,343
- Yeah.

101
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:36,192
We need a doctor
in treatment five.

102
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,498
- Okay.

103
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,283
- Greg Wright took a blow
to the abdomen

104
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:42,023
from an I-beam
being lowered by a crane.

105
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:44,417
- Help me.
- We're gonna help you.

106
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,027
- Okay, vitals?
- Heart rate's 96.

107
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,638
BP 98 over 56.

108
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,857
Respirations 20.

109
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:50,945
- Lungs sound clear.

110
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,382
- Belly distended
with a fluid wave.

111
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:53,513
Looks jaundiced.

112
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:54,688
- He's got a bad liver.

113
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,342
- Oh, you need...
please, you need to...

114
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,996
- Give him 2 of versed
and 100 of fentanyl.

115
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,477
- Mr. Wright, I need you
to keep your mask on, okay?

116
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:02,435
Ultrasound.

117
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,958
We got free fluid.

118
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:05,438
- Oh, please.

119
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,135
- Okay, let's do a diagnostic
peritoneal aspiration

120
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,136
to make sure it's not blood.

121
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,051
DPL kit. Thank you.

122
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,010
Okay, Mr. Wright, I need you
to relax a little bit.

123
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,098
You're about to feel a pinch.

124
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,273
Here we go.

125
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:19,757
- It's ascites.

126
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,932
- Well, it's better
than the alternative.

127
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,542
- Oh, my son.
My son, please call my...

128
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:23,804
- No, no, Mr. Wright,
we need you to calm down.

129
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:24,979
- Mr. Wright,
that mask is there

130
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:25,937
to help you breathe easier.

131
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:26,981
We'll call your son, but first,

132
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,461
we need to make sure
you're okay.

133
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:29,549
- Hey, what happened to
that first set of fentanyl?

134
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,247
- I gave it to him.

135
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,422
- I want to talk to my son.

136
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:34,293
I need to talk to...

137
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:35,903
- BP 105 over 60.

138
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,601
O2's up to 96.

139
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,647
- Okay, let's work on
getting him to CT.

140
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:41,890
- Yeah.

141
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,873
- Really got hectic
all of a sudden.

142
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,004
- Yeah, tell me about it.

143
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,441
- Hey, Dr. Asher?
- Yeah?

144
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,399
- I found this
in Mr. Wright's wallet.

145
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:54,879
- Is it his son?
- I don't know.

146
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:56,272
No next of kin listed.

147
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,708
- Chicago area code.

148
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:58,970
- You want me to reach out?

149
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,538
- Uh, no, I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

150
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:03,583
- Duty calls.

151
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:06,456
- Okay, so Dr. Lenox,

152
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,414
we're here to review
your course of care

153
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:11,417
for Jordan Bennett,
16-year-old male,

154
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,507
fell off a rock ledge
at the disciplinary camp

155
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,553
and suffered
massive head trauma.

156
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:19,077
- Yes.
And after a CT head,

157
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,601
we discerned Jordan had
extensive skull fractures

158
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,300
and increased
intracranial pressure.

159
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,302
Thus, Dr. Abrams recommended

160
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,782
an upfront left side
hemicraniectomy.

161
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,610
- And just to be clear,
yours was not

162
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:33,134
the initial course of
treatment, am I right?

163
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:35,354
- There was some disagreement
on the ethics

164
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:36,747
of such an aggressive procedure.

165
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:38,488
So we started with
a more wait-and-see approach.

166
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,054
- Sorry. Sorry.

167
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:43,971
To be clear, uh, you wanted
to cut his head open.

168
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:47,497
I thought we should start
more conservatively,

169
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,455
which Dr. Abrams agreed with.

170
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,457
- Only because the patient
was a minor

171
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:53,459
and his parents weren't there
to weigh in.

172
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:54,982
- An important detail,
don't you think?

173
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:57,333
Especially when Dr. Abrams
described the two options

174
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,770
for treatment
as basically a coin flip.

175
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,816
- I believe he described it
as a 51/49 proposition.

176
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,993
- Nevertheless, it was not
an obvious decision.

177
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:07,778
- I believe it was. There's...
- Oh, God.

178
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,170
Doesn't that smack of hubris?

179
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,694
- If there's a preferred...

180
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:12,435
- And that...
isn't that your problem?

181
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,741
- Excuse me?
- The hubris you displayed

182
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:17,962
in taking a difficult decision
away from these two parents.

183
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:20,573
- If there is a 1% better
chance with a given course

184
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:22,445
of action,
resources should be marshaled

185
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,403
as if it were
the only course of action.

186
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:25,709
We didn't have time to wait,
in my opinion.

187
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,580
- Well, but that's why
we're here.

188
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:28,929
Your opinion was wrong.

189
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:30,496
We're here to question
your judgment.

190
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,932
- Dr. Archer, can we...
- No.

191
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:35,283
That in a case where
there was so much uncertainty,

192
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:37,808
when a child's life
was hanging in the balance.

193
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,200
- We traffic in uncertainty.

194
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:40,898
- There's a dead kid, Doctor.

195
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:41,899
- Dean!

196
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,379
That's enough.

197
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,558
- I agree with you.
It is enough.

198
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,800
- Hey, you okay?

199
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,628
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

200
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,978
- Well, word on the street is
things got a little heated

201
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,153
in the case review.

202
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,894
- It seems also
word got to Goodwin.

203
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:23,593
She wants to see me.

204
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:24,942
Who you on the phone with?

205
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,334
- Uh, nobody right now.

206
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,598
But I'm on hold
with a friend at CPD.

207
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,469
I'm trying to track down
this patient's son,

208
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,384
but all I've got is a number
that's disconnected.

209
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:33,994
- Okay.

210
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:35,996
- Hey, Dean, when you...

211
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,910
When you speak to Goodwin,

212
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,999
maybe don't...

213
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,784
be yourself so much?

214
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:41,785
- Thanks.

215
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:43,395
Yeah.

216
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,266
I think, actually,
it's... it's time

217
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,641
this came to a head, you know?

218
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,883
- You did it
without talking to me.

219
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,667
We didn't even discuss it, again.

220
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:55,929
- Oh, sorry to interrupt.

221
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:57,148
- Carl, I got to go.
Got to go.

222
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:58,454
- Were you looking for me?

223
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,151
- Yeah. Sorry.

224
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,762
Uh, yeah, there's a teen girl
on four who had a panic attack.

225
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:03,807
I thought you could take a look.

226
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,682
Mr. Ramirez, Jemma,
I'm Dr. Charles.

227
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:10,683
- Hi.

228
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:11,858
- Wow.

229
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,991
That is... that is some gown.

230
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,167
- Thanks.
- She looks beautiful, right?

231
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,777
- The debutante ball's
next week.

232
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,257
- Oh, that sounds fun.

233
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:21,607
- Yeah, um, family tradition.

234
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,480
My sisters, my mom.

235
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,178
- We lost Jemma's mom
a couple of years ago.

236
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,701
She's the one that really
got Jemma and her sisters

237
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,181
into the whole thing.

238
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,836
It's a nice way of keeping
her memories alive.

239
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,272
- Right.

240
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,143
Well, family traditions
can be really important

241
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,449
that way, right?
- Yeah.

242
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,713
- Um, Jemma,
tell me what happened.

243
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:42,062
- Well...

244
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:43,368
- Well, she was getting fitted
for her dress

245
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,413
when she started
hyperventilating.

246
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:48,504
- Right, and has this
ever happened before?

247
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,549
- No. First time.

248
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:53,291
- Tell me, like, how did
you feel it in your body?

249
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:56,642
- I don't know.
It was like this, um, wave.

250
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,166
Kind of like... it felt
really tight in my chest

251
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,211
like I couldn't breathe.

252
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,822
- We did an EKG,
just sinus tach.

253
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,563
- Do you mind me asking,
is there anything going on

254
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,173
in your life right now
that you're worried about,

255
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,566
you know,
that's giving you anxiety?

256
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,828
- No.

257
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:09,873
- And you're feeling better now?

258
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:11,265
- Yeah, mostly.

259
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,919
I mean, my stomach
just kind of hurts.

260
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:16,096
- All right,
let's get a CBC, CMP,

261
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,924
Lipase, UA, and a UPREG.

262
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:18,969
All right?

263
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,448
Look, panic attacks suck,

264
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:22,146
but there are a number of ways
to treat them, right?

265
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,539
And we'll get into that.

266
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,410
I just want to get
a clearer picture

267
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,934
of what's going on with Jemma's
stomach before we let you go.

268
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:28,979
Okay.

269
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,570
Nice to meet you both.

270
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,246
- Dr. Ripley,
this is Mr. Russell's wife.

271
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,162
- Sheryl.
I was told my husband fell?

272
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:41,295
- It's actually a bit more
complicated than that.

273
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,471
The fall, luckily,
wasn't that serious,

274
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:47,475
but the reason he fell was
because he's in septic shock.

275
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,608
That means he has an infection
in his body.

276
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:53,090
He's having
an extreme reaction to it.

277
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,613
It's putting added stress
on his organs,

278
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,137
especially his heart,
which was already weak.

279
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,791
- What's causing it?

280
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:01,359
- I understand he had surgery
recently for prostate cancer.

281
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,753
- Yes.

282
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:06,059
Oh, my God.

283
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,540
Declan.

284
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:09,672
Are you okay?

285
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:12,152
- A little banged up,
but I'm fine.

286
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,937
- Thank God you were there.

287
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,200
- Well, yeah, of course.

288
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,202
- But his surgery
was five weeks ago.

289
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,073
- Six, actually.

290
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:24,164
Sorry, I just remember it was
before the company retreat.

291
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,166
- Either way,

292
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,126
why is he getting sepsis now?

293
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,823
- Well, it's not uncommon

294
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,565
to pick up an infection
after this kind of surgery.

295
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,568
Though six weeks after
is kind of rare.

296
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:39,527
But I actually need to talk
to you about what comes next.

297
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:41,051
- All right.

298
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,879
- Now, the way to treat sepsis
is with a strong course

299
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:45,011
of antibiotics.

300
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,970
Thing is,
those can take time to work.

301
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,146
In the meantime,
your husband's heart

302
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,714
is close to giving out.

303
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:54,194
In fact, I believe it will fail
in the next few hours,

304
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,110
and if it does, he would
need to be resuscitated.

305
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,547
But his file says he has a DNR.

306
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:00,853
- Yes.

307
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,507
- Well, this is a unique case

308
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:05,466
where I'm not sure we want
to abide by that document.

309
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,426
Like I said,
once the antibiotics take hold,

310
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,819
the stress on his heart
will come down.

311
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:12,386
So if we can keep him alive
until then,

312
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,301
even if we need to
resuscitate him,

313
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,564
he would have a strong chance
at a full recovery.

314
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:19,567
- Is there a chance
he'll have lasting damage

315
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:22,092
if his heart fails
and you bring him back?

316
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,963
- There is always that risk, yes.

317
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,878
But if we're fast,
and I believe that we can be...

318
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:27,750
- I'm sorry.

319
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,708
No.

320
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,580
- Sheryl, I would...
- I said no.

321
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:35,758
My husband was very adamant
about his wishes

322
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,456
in a case like this.

323
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,719
I have to respect that.

324
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,776
- I was just finishing up.

325
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,212
- Howard, outside?

326
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,692
- Oh, I'm...

327
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,501
- What's wrong?
- She'll be right back.

328
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,655
- Did you use a simple suture?

329
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,961
- I did.

330
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,440
- That creates too much tension.

331
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:08,486
You should have used
a mattress suture.

332
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,835
- Oh, well, should I...

333
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,359
- Redo it, and go quickly
so he can be discharged.

334
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,927
This kind of thing shouldn't
take up a bed this long.

335
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:24,763
- Alex? Greg Wright's son?

336
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,113
Hi, I'm Dr. Asher.
Thanks so much for coming.

337
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,506
It was tough to track you down.

338
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,185
Your dad is, uh, this way.

339
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,033
Okay, so as I mentioned
on the phone,

340
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,600
he was in an accident at work.

341
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,429
Now, the impact alone may not
have done too much damage,

342
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,474
but the stress from the injury
is what led him

343
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:42,781
into liver failure
due to his cirrhosis.

344
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,740
- From drinking?
- That's usually the culprit.

345
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,306
Now, your timing
is actually good.

346
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,463
He's starting to wake up,
right over here.

347
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,357
You all right?

348
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,968
- I haven't seen him
in 20 years.

349
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,840
- Wow, I...

350
00:12:57,864 --> 00:13:00,973
I had no idea.

351
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,410
- He walked out when I was 11.

352
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:06,979
I just assumed that
he was dead by now.

353
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,590
I only came because
I wasn't sure I believed it.

354
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:19,078
- Alex?

355
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:20,906
- Hey, Dad.

356
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,680
- Come in.

357
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:36,704
- Oh, free from Big Brother
at last, huh?

358
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:40,839
- I'm just glad
the stalker nonsense is over.

359
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:45,825
gentlemen, can you give us
the room, please?

360
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:55,027
I hear the, uh,
case review got lively.

361
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:59,771
- Well, it's more than
just about the case review.

362
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,860
- I figured that.

363
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,601
- All right, look,
I understand that there

364
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,559
were extenuating circumstances,

365
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:09,737
which necessitated
bringing Dr. Lenox in.

366
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,784
But that work's now
been mostly done.

367
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:16,309
And I think it might be time
to re-evaluate her position.

368
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:20,879
Re-evaluate, how?

369
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:24,970
- I don't think Dr. Lenox
is a good leader for this ED.

370
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,015
She's overbearing.

371
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,973
She's got a bit
of a God complex.

372
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:30,889
- Isn't that like the pot
calling the kettle?

373
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,848
Yeah, no, I know. I know.

374
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,982
I'm sure people
think of me that way, too.

375
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:39,202
But she's reckless.

376
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:42,335
And she doesn't listen
to anybody else's opinion.

377
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:45,861
And her patients
are paying the price.

378
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,645
I think Gaffney
would be better off

379
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,343
if Dr. Lenox
was merely an attending

380
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,477
and no longer
co-chief of this ED.

381
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,317
- They've been at it a while.

382
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,015
- Yeah, I think they're
making progress, though.

383
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,495
- Well, if it was my dad,

384
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,019
I wouldn't have even
come to the hospital.

385
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:16,413
- You don't believe
in forgiveness?

386
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:18,023
- Oh, I believe in it.

387
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:22,201
I just think there's
a statute of limitations.

388
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,464
- Tough crowd.

389
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,726
- You okay?

390
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,555
I feel like
I'm missing something.

391
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,949
- After I got sober,
it took my family a while

392
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,821
to trust me again, but they did.

393
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:35,780
Except my sister, Lizzy.

394
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:39,958
She wouldn't even talk to me,
so eventually I gave up trying.

395
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,964
- Hey, uh,

396
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:49,185
I didn't mean that
you don't deserve forgiveness.

397
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,057
My family is a totally
different situation.

398
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:55,084
- No, I know.
I just... I guess...

399
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:59,760
I guess I just miss her.

400
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,240
- Yeah.

401
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,851
- It kind of makes me
a sucker for reunions.

402
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,302
- Where's the patient
with the ax?

403
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:20,956
- Oh, he left.

404
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,914
I did the mattress sutures and
discharged him, like you said.

405
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,785
- But you didn't check with me.

406
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:25,961
- Well, you looked busy,

407
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,527
so I just checked it
with Dr. Johnson.

408
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,529
- I'm your attending.
You come to me.

409
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:30,966
You don't go behind my back.

410
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,619
- Oh, no, sorry, sorry.
I wasn't trying to...

411
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,428
- I don't want to hear excuses.

412
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:41,063
Look, I'm trying to help you.

413
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,022
But you need to listen
and stop apologizing.

414
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,112
If you show weakness,
people come for you.

415
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,723
So, uh, go grab an orange

416
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:52,465
and practice your sutures on it
the rest of the day.

417
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:56,992
- Our debutante's labs are back.

418
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,081
I just shot you the results.

419
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:02,649
And I-I should apologize
for earlier.

420
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:06,523
The phone call you so politely
pretended not to overhear...

421
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,568
- I didn't hear anything.
- Liar.

422
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,179
- I didn't.
- Okay.

423
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,355
Yeah, it...

424
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,184
Carl deactivated all of Penny's
social media accounts.

425
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,621
And I know,
it's a double-edged sword

426
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,450
'cause ostensibly, I'm against
all social media, but...

427
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:21,929
At the same time,

428
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,627
sometimes looking at her posts

429
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:26,543
is the only way I have any idea
what's going on with her life.

430
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,762
- When my girls
were about that age

431
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,112
and I'd come home from work,

432
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,114
all excited
to hear about their day,

433
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,246
they'd look at me like
I was like some kind of hobo

434
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,206
who wandered in off the street.

435
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,946
- Anything interesting?

436
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,863
- Yeah, lipase levels
are pretty elevated.

437
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:43,951
- Pancreatitis?

438
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:45,431
- Yeah.

439
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:47,738
I mean, bilirubin is normal,
so it's not gallstones.

440
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:49,174
What could be causing it, though?

441
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,785
- Well, Jemma's a teenager.
Maybe drinking?

442
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:55,311
- That would require
some prolonged alcohol abuse

443
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,356
at this age.
- Alcohol abuse?

444
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,097
Jemma's been drinking?
- That's not what we're saying.

445
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,099
Nope. Mr. Ramirez.

446
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,231
- Jemma, have you been drinking?

447
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,449
- Mr. Ramirez.
- What?

448
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:04,755
- Honey, you need to
tell us right now.

449
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:07,105
- I'm not drinking, Dad.
I swear, I never have.

450
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,715
- Mr. Ramirez,
that's not what we're saying.

451
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:10,108
What we're saying is we think
that Jemma might have

452
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,588
a case of pancreatitis.

453
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,721
- And one of the causes
can be alcohol consumption.

454
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,071
- Can be other causes, too.

455
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,811
For instance,
it can be a genetic thing.

456
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,204
- What is pancreatitis?

457
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:21,076
I mean, is that serious?
- It can be.

458
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,381
Yeah, I mean,
that's why you're in pain,

459
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,296
because your pancreas
is inflamed.

460
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,212
We just got to figure out why
so we can treat it properly.

461
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,214
So let us do
a little more digging

462
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:31,501
and we'll see what
we come up with.

463
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,093
- Hey, Dr. Charles.

464
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,573
Hey.
I just wanted to apologize.

465
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:43,489
- Trust me,
you do not need to explain.

466
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:45,230
- Look, you mentioned
that these things

467
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:47,754
can sometimes be genetic.
- Yeah.

468
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:50,235
- Well, um, Jemma's adopted.

469
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:51,410
- Really?
- Yeah.

470
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:52,977
It's not a secret or anything.

471
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,457
She knows.

472
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:58,156
In fact, she met her birth mom
once about a year ago.

473
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,593
I... I have her
contact information

474
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,378
if that would be helpful.
- You know what?

475
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:04,771
It actually could be.
Thank you.

476
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,121
- Yeah.

477
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,601
That meeting didn't
go very well.

478
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,237
Jemma doesn't really like
to talk about it.

479
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,262
- All right,
this is really good.

480
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,395
I think we can let you go.

481
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:20,874
I'm gonna go send in a nurse

482
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,920
to start your discharge
paperwork, all right?

483
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,511
Great.

484
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:28,969
- Dr. Frost?

485
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:30,473
- Yeah.

486
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:34,801
- There's something
I need to tell you.

487
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,673
- Okay.

488
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,631
- Hey, you tried this place?
It's so good.

489
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,242
- No, but I already ate.

490
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:43,854
Look, how are you with, like,
super awkward conversations?

491
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:45,856
- Uh, same as everyone else.

492
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,162
Not great.
- Okay.

493
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,251
- Why?
- Declan's coworker said

494
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:51,296
that we should not abide
by the DNR.

495
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,299
Says she knows it's not what
he would want, apparently.

496
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:56,301
- And how would she know that?

497
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:59,870
- Turns out that they
are not just coworkers.

498
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,351
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

499
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,005
- So they weren't headed
to a lunch meeting.

500
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:06,529
- Her place, actually.

501
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:10,402
- And, uh, she said Declan
wouldn't want the DNR?

502
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,317
- She actually made
a pretty compelling case.

503
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:14,841
- So you're pitching
we have another conversation

504
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,321
with his wife?

505
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:18,758
And to be clear,
you want to try to convince her

506
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:20,673
to rip up her husband's DNR

507
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:24,721
by telling her
he was cheating on her?

508
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,747
- Yeah?

509
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,536
This won't be awkward.

510
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:42,347
- So, uh, what are you thinking?

511
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:46,003
- Well, I'm thinking that
Dr. Archer was way out of line.

512
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:48,571
And I don't like to be
backed up into a corner,

513
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:52,966
but I also did spring this
whole co-heads of the ED on him

514
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,795
and that wasn't completely fair.

515
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:58,494
- Look, Jackson-Monroe
was closing, right?

516
00:20:58,518 --> 00:20:59,712
You had to put out some fires.

517
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:03,020
And Lenox has a résumé
to help with that.

518
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:06,632
- So you think I should keep
her as co-head of the ED?

519
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:07,981
- Not saying that.

520
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,592
Okay, 'cause one thing
that is clear

521
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,681
is that this
power-sharing arrangement,

522
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:14,031
I mean, it's just not working, right?

523
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,641
You, um...

524
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,208
You talked to
any of these folks?

525
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:18,992
- Well, I've been quietly

526
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,212
taking the temperature
of the staff on Lenox.

527
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,475
But everyone's
being so political.

528
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:24,998
- Of course.

529
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,522
- You know, they don't want
to say the wrong thing.

530
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:28,287
- Right. Right.

531
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,745
- How's he doing?

532
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,660
- Okay, I guess.

533
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:37,034
- And how are you?

534
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:39,970
- Honestly, I don't know.

535
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,451
It's a lot.

536
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:45,280
- He said some nice things.

537
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,610
Says he regrets what he did.

538
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:50,720
How bad is his liver?

539
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,504
- It's not good.

540
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:55,072
It's basically shutting down.

541
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,248
- And he'll die.

542
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,337
How long?

543
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,906
- I don't like to predict
those sort of things, but...

544
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,345
I would imagine he has
less than a year.

545
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,868
- Can you do a transplant?

546
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:10,174
- Unfortunately,
in order to qualify,

547
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:12,437
he needs to be six months sober.

548
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,700
- And he hasn't been sober?

549
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:17,399
- He has, but only for
about three months.

550
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:20,184
So he's still got a ways to go.

551
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:27,234
So he comes back into my life

552
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:29,193
only to just leave again.

553
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,961
Hardly seems fair.

554
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:37,506
- You know,

555
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,334
you might be able to donate.

556
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,118
- My liver?

557
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:44,382
- It would just be a piece that
you would give to your father.

558
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,993
But because you're family,
our transplant team

559
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:50,238
would be able to waive
the sobriety requirements.

560
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,435
- Wait, is that...

561
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:56,568
Is that why he wanted you to
find me so that I could donate?

562
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:58,091
- No, no, no, no, no.

563
00:22:58,115 --> 00:23:00,398
Your dad doesn't even know
that this is a possibility.

564
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:05,384
And if you decide not to,
I won't tell him.

565
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,540
Alex,

566
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:14,804
this is how we found you.

567
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,502
He's had it in his wallet
all these years.

568
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,767
- I keep thinking about
all the times

569
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,943
that he wasn't there

570
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:27,338
when I needed him,

571
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,296
when I was always the kid
who didn't have a parent

572
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,168
on the field trip,

573
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:32,778
when I had to switch
middle schools

574
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:35,128
'cause I was getting bullied,

575
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:38,001
when I learned how to drive.

576
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:41,874
Whole time, he was just
sitting there with my picture

577
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:46,575
when he could have just
been there.

578
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,968
- Look, I...

579
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,406
I don't know if you'll ever
fix your relationship.

580
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,973
But what I do know

581
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:56,933
is that if he's gone,

582
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:59,239
it can never be repaired.

583
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,510
- Uh, would you mind just
stepping in here?

584
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,100
- Okay.

585
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:14,472
What's going on?

586
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:18,476
- There's something we need to
discuss, but it's difficult.

587
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,174
- Keep in mind, we're all here
just trying to do

588
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:23,176
what's best for your husband, okay?

589
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,265
- Okay.

590
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:27,050
- Sheryl,

591
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:30,009
I don't think Declan would want
the DNR kept in place.

592
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:33,491
- I'm not sure his cubicle-mate
has a say in this.

593
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,537
- I'm not just his coworker.

594
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:40,063
We've been more than that
for almost two years.

595
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:43,849
I don't want to be saying this,
especially not now.

596
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:48,027
But we've had conversations
about the future.

597
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:50,726
- About what, leaving me?

598
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,424
- He talked about
what he used to believe.

599
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:55,948
But after fighting cancer
and beating it,

600
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,820
he realized that life
was worth fighting for.

601
00:24:57,844 --> 00:24:59,517
Those are his words.

602
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,737
- Look, I know you hate me
and you have every right.

603
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,173
- Do you love him?

604
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:05,088
- I do.

605
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,916
- That's just awful.

606
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,093
- Sheryl, I can't imagine
what you're feeling,

607
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:13,575
having your whole life
with someone.

608
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,446
But I know about regret,

609
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,275
decisions made in a moment
that haunt you forever.

610
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,712
- Just please don't make
this choice out of anger.

611
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:24,368
- Do you even know why he was
so adamant about the DNR?

612
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:27,937
Because he watched
his mother have a stroke

613
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:30,069
and be resuscitated.

614
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,941
She had so much brain damage,

615
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:35,553
she was just
a shell of a person.

616
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,512
I was there for it.

617
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,515
I sat behind Declan
and he made me promise

618
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,780
that I wouldn't let him suffer
like that.

619
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:48,547
DNR stays.

620
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,559
- Don't even think about it.

621
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,150
- Ooh, who we cyberstalking?

622
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:09,108
- Jemma's birth mom.

623
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:10,414
- Any particular reason?

624
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:13,243
- Well, it is, in fact,
all your fault.

625
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,505
You know, I was looking through

626
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:16,463
her mom's medical records, right?

627
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,161
Nothing popped.

628
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,163
And so I started to think about
our conversation this morning

629
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:22,078
through which you got
a much fuller picture

630
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:24,384
of your daughter's life
on social media, right?

631
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:26,343
So here I am.

632
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,301
- Well, Jemma definitely
has her mother's face.

633
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:29,955
- These must all be relatives.

634
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:32,329
- Mm, they look like
a lively group.

635
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:38,311
What's your spidey sense saying?

636
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,965
- I'd like to talk
to Jemma alone.

637
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:43,534
You think you can run a little
interference with dad for me?

638
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,536
- Yeah.

639
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,712
- Ah, Ms. Howard.

640
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,018
Good to see you.

641
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,672
- Ms. Goodwin, I was
actually looking for you.

642
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,674
- Oh, how can I help you?

643
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,066
- I'm...

644
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,415
- Something on your mind?

645
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,069
- Yes, uh...

646
00:26:57,093 --> 00:27:00,899
look, I know that you've been
asking around about Dr. Lenox.

647
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:04,555
- And you have something
to say about her?

648
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:07,147
- Yes, I do.

649
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:14,826
- Okay, what's your pain level?

650
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,351
- Not bad, just a little itchy.

651
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,484
Hey.

652
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,660
- Hey, Alex.
- It's okay. Come in.

653
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,686
I'm just getting poked
and prodded.

654
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:28,647
You okay?

655
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:33,671
- I was just outside
doing some thinking.

656
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:36,326
I was talking
to Dr. Asher earlier.

657
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,371
She told me that I could

658
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:41,461
give you a piece of my liver,

659
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:44,682
that it would save you.

660
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:48,686
So I was thinking that
I could do that.

661
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,689
- This is unbelievable.

662
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:55,214
I-I can't believe
you'd do this for me.

663
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:56,825
- Yeah, well, we're family.

664
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,392
- You know, I was always worried

665
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:02,439
that I messed you up
when I left.

666
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,746
But you're... you're
such a good person.

667
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,705
And you're giving me
a second chance.

668
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:11,230
And I do not take that
for granted.

669
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:13,276
I'm gonna be better.

670
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,434
You and I,
we're gonna be better.

671
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,743
- I'd like that.

672
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:24,722
- Okay.

673
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,202
So later today,
we'll get you upstairs

674
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,594
for some preliminary stuff.

675
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:29,466
And ideally,
we'll get you into surgery

676
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,468
within the next few days.

677
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:34,340
- I can start making up
for lost time.

678
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:45,047
- Dr. Lenox.

679
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,483
- Ms. Goodwin.

680
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:49,486
- After your shift,
come see me, please?

681
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,121
- Of course, no problem.
- Great.

682
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:03,239
- Jemma, how are you doing?

683
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:05,023
- Okay.

684
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:07,025
- You know,

685
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,593
your dad was telling me
that you're adopted.

686
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:12,074
- He did?
- Yeah.

687
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:14,816
So I've been looking into
your... your birth mom,

688
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,948
you know, medical records,
looking for clues,

689
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:20,299
and I ended up on...
on social media.

690
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:22,345
Saw a bunch of family pics.

691
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:25,087
And I couldn't help noticing
that they were all

692
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:28,699
of a certain...
a certain body type.

693
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:30,396
- They're all bigger.

694
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,443
- Look, I mean,
genetics can be a random thing.

695
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:38,796
But you, yourself, you seem
to be of a different body type.

696
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,493
- Just lucky, I guess.

697
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:42,017
- Okay.

698
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,888
'Cause it just
got me wondering, and I...

699
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,412
I hope you don't mind me
asking you this...

700
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,458
If maybe,

701
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,808
I don't know, you were getting

702
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,637
a little extra help
keeping the weight away?

703
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,900
Because I have
a strong hunch that

704
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:57,772
what we're dealing with here

705
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,383
could be a result of something
that you're taking.

706
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,472
- Taking what?
- Semaglutide.

707
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,169
It's the active ingredient

708
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:06,955
in some of these new, you know,
inject able weight loss drugs.

709
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:10,349
And in rare cases,
they cause pancreatitis.

710
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,830
If you keep taking this stuff,

711
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:16,486
you could do serious,
lasting damage to your body.

712
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,704
Right?
I mean, eventually,

713
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,730
I mean, it could even kill you.

714
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:27,932
- A girl at my school showed me
how to order it online.

715
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,151
- Okay.

716
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:31,849
How long ago was that?

717
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,546
- A year.

718
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,678
- Right.

719
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,811
Right around...

720
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,031
Right around the time
that you met your birth mom?

721
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,817
- Yeah, um...

722
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,211
I didn't think
much of it at first,

723
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:49,475
that they were heavier.

724
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,870
But then I started high school,

725
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:57,353
and I could feel myself
getting bigger, and I...

726
00:30:57,377 --> 00:30:59,268
I just felt like I was, like,

727
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:02,445
genetically destined
for the same thing.

728
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:05,230
Um,

729
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:08,103
and I couldn't stop it,
so I found a way to stop it.

730
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:11,019
- I get it, I do,
but if it's hurting you,

731
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:14,152
if it's... if it has the
potential to seriously...

732
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,328
- I-I can't.

733
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:19,766
I can't stop taking it.

734
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,421
I can't become that.

735
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,989
I won't belong anymore.

736
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:27,122
- Belong where?
At school?

737
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:28,775
- In my family.

738
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,256
Everyone is perfect,
and thin, and tall.

739
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,173
And just... if you're not,
then you don't belong.

740
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:37,610
This month's shipment
got delayed,

741
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,612
so I haven't been taking it.

742
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:42,833
But when we went to go
try on the dress

743
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:45,401
and it was a little tight,
like, I just panicked.

744
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:46,924
And everyone would know.

745
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,404
Even my dad would know.

746
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:50,580
They would all know
that I'm not like Erin,

747
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,495
like Ali, like Mom.

748
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,757
Like...

749
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:56,412
- Your dad loves you
more than anything.

750
00:31:56,436 --> 00:32:00,416
And he just wants you
to be happy and healthy.

751
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,375
Look, something that
I've learned in my life, okay?

752
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:05,987
The more you keep stuff
like this inside,

753
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,945
the more powerful it becomes.

754
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:11,775
I mean, you've got to find
a way to talk about it, right?

755
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,952
And I think that your dad,

756
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,649
it just might be a great place
to start, right?

757
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:19,043
And if you could
be honest with him,

758
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,219
get honest with each other,

759
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:23,613
it would just make you both
feel so much better.

760
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:25,963
And one thing
I can guarantee you...

761
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:29,575
Your mom would be
so proud of you.

762
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:38,086
Okay.

763
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:45,635
- What's happening?
- Move back, please.

764
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,182
Move back, move back, move back.

765
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,988
- Pulmonary edema.
He's got fluid in his lungs.

766
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,642
- Heart rate's 130.
BP's dropping.

767
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:53,904
- Give him Lasix,
push 40 milligrams.

768
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:56,080
- Yep. It's coming.

769
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:58,169
Okay, it's going in.
- What's that for?

770
00:32:58,193 --> 00:32:59,649
- Trying to get some of
this fluid off his lungs,

771
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:01,042
get him breathing again.

772
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:03,024
- He's gonna need
to be intubated.

773
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,961
- He's in V-fib.

774
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,223
- His heart's failing.

775
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:10,268
I... I don't know.

776
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,836
- Oh, my God, Declan.
What's happening?

777
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,707
What are you doing?
Save him!

778
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,318
- We only have
a few seconds here.

779
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:17,580
- Please help him.

780
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:19,843
- Sheryl, he'll die
if we don't shock him.

781
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,111
- Bag him and charge
the paddles to 120.

782
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:30,332
Starting compressions.

783
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,227
- Clear.

784
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,163
- Still in V-fib.

785
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:36,773
- Charge to 200.

786
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:39,060
- Charged.
- Clear.

787
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:44,911
- We have a pulse, sinus rhythm.

788
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,652
- Oh, thank God.

789
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:01,145
- His fever has broken

790
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:02,494
and his blood pressure
is getting better,

791
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:04,801
which means
the infection is improving.

792
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:07,804
We are hopeful
he's through the worst of it.

793
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:09,414
- When will he be awake?

794
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:10,981
- Uh, it's hard to say.

795
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:12,287
We're doing everything we can,

796
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:15,357
but you can go in if you'd like.

797
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,861
- You go.

798
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:24,821
- What?

799
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:29,304
- We haven't been happy
for a very long time.

800
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:33,308
I've given that man
more than half my life,

801
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:35,962
and now I've given him
a new one.

802
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:39,903
I think maybe it's time
I try to be happy, too.

803
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,631
- That's it, time's up.
Shift's over.

804
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:54,024
Let's see who's got the pin.

805
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,941
Who could it be... oh, no.

806
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,683
Drat.

807
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:02,380
- Dr. Asher?

808
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,861
I just got a call from Imaging.
They're ready for Alex Wright.

809
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:05,862
- Great.

810
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,429
- A prelim workup
for his surgery?

811
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:09,039
That's one lucky dad.

812
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,388
- You want me to take him up?

813
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:11,389
- Oh, no, that's okay.
Your shift's over, too.

814
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:12,999
I got it.
- Thanks.

815
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,610
- Besides, no one's getting
a free round anyway.

816
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:17,003
- Wait, why no free round?

817
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,137
- Oh, come on!

818
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,966
The rules were clear...
no Archer, no Lenox.

819
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,861
People don't know how to...
- Wasn't me.

820
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,904
- He walked out.

821
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:51,429
- Well, maybe he ducked out
for a bite or something.

822
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:52,952
Did you call?

823
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:54,693
- He's not answering.

824
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,719
And...

825
00:35:58,982 --> 00:36:00,786
He left this.

826
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,229
It was a lot to ask.

827
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:10,927
- I'm sorry, Greg.

828
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:14,104
I feel like I might have pushed
him, and I shouldn't have.

829
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:16,628
- No, don't apologize.

830
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:19,394
I deserve this. I do.

831
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:25,898
It was nice to hope
for a moment, though.

832
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:29,250
That you don't pay so dearly
for your mistakes.

833
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,214
- I'm good.
- Yes, yes?

834
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,215
One.
- Oh, I'm good.

835
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,216
- Shots for everybody.

836
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,174
- Why?
- Okay.

837
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,958
- One shot. One.

838
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:43,307
- Hey, hey! Come here.

839
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:47,770
- Ooh.

840
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,837
- Hey.

841
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,491
I didn't think you were coming.

842
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:54,971
- So I looked at the schedule.

843
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:57,539
Turns out, I'm in late tomorrow.

844
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,628
So I figured,
you know, just one.

845
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:01,238
- Oh, just one?
- Or three.

846
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,417
- Have you ever cheated?

847
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:08,202
- Um, actually, no.

848
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,639
I mean, I was legitimately

849
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:13,163
the worst boyfriend
in the universe,

850
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:15,296
but no, no, not cheated.

851
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,472
What about you, Hollywood?

852
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:20,518
- Yeah, once, when I was 16.

853
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:23,434
But she was, you know,
like a pop star

854
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,741
and wrote a song about it.

855
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:27,395
It was...

856
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:30,180
- Wait, are you...
are you serious?

857
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:32,182
- Yeah.
- Who was it?

858
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:35,403
- Oh, you are literally going
to your grave wondering.

859
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:36,969
Uh, bartender?
- Yeah.

860
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:38,232
- Let's... let's
get this man drunk.

861
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,190
- Not gonna work.
Steel trap.

862
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:47,328
Hey.
You all right?

863
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:49,068
- Yeah, I... I'm good.

864
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:51,704
I just... I need to make
a phone call.

865
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:55,292
- Can I ask a question?

866
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:02,584
What?

867
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,218
Never seen a guy buy a round
for the bar before?

868
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,307
- Whoo!

869
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:19,471
- You're welcome.

870
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:21,927
- Hey, Lizzy, it's me.

871
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:23,929
Um...

872
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:28,543
I know you really don't want
to talk to me, but...

873
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,545
I don't know,
life is short, I guess.

874
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:32,982
So I figured, uh...

875
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:36,226
I'd try in case
you change your mind.

876
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,817
Anyway, I'm here.

877
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:44,234
Love you.

878
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,961
- Come in.

879
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:59,530
- Ah, Dr. Lenox.
Please, come sit.

880
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,924
I wanted to talk with you.

881
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:04,535
- If this is about the
situation with Dr. Archer,

882
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,624
I've already reached out
to him to discuss it,

883
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:08,409
iron out any issues.

884
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,236
- Well, I appreciate that,

885
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,501
but I don't think that's
going to solve anything.

886
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:17,331
And I also don't think it's
going to be necessary anymore.

887
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:21,683
I spent the day today
talking to your staff

888
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:25,034
about the working environment
in the ED.

889
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:26,340
- I see.

890
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,691
- And most of them were
pretty tight-lipped,

891
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:32,171
but some were more candid.

892
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:37,307
In particular,
Ms. Howard had a lot to say.

893
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:39,178
- Really?
- Yeah.

894
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:42,573
She said that you were
challenging at times,

895
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:45,600
caustic, condescending.

896
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:49,319
- I don't mean to be.

897
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:52,540
- Well, she said that, too.

898
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:54,585
But she also said

899
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:57,806
that you consistently

900
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,026
push her to be a better doctor

901
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:04,247
and that she has gained
more practical knowledge

902
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,075
from you in a month

903
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:09,644
than she had in the past
four years of med school.

904
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:14,953
And that she hopes to be
as badass as you someday.

905
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:18,783
And yet, Dr. Archer
has made it clear that he

906
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:23,875
cannot coexist running
the department with you,

907
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:26,617
which is why, starting tomorrow,

908
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:30,229
you will be the sole chief
of the ED.

909
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:34,364
And Dr. Archer will go back
to being a regular attending.

910
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,064
- Have you told Dr. Archer yet?

911
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:40,457
- Yes.

912
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:43,068
He knows.

913
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:46,202
- Dr. Dean Archer.

914
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:47,682
- Dr. Hannah Asher.

915
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,337
- Well, well, well.

916
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:54,471
Gotta say, it is a bit of
a surprise to see you here.

917
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,647
- Yeah, well, you know,

918
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,475
life's full of surprises.

919
00:40:58,499 --> 00:40:59,781
- Amen.

920
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:01,763
- Cheers to that.

921
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,962
- Um, we were talking about
the wallpaper...
