1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,530
Morning.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,530
I don't know...

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,700
Hey!

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,700
Hi, Dad.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,200
Oh, sorry, Mom.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,200
I've got to go.

7
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

8
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,860
what'd I do?

9
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,130
Nothing.

10
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,130
You are perfect.

11
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,470
Bye, honey.

12
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,640
Bye. See you

13
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,640
this evening.

14
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,080
How are you feeling?

15
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,080
Fantastic.

16
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,640
They're giving me

17
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,640
the steroids in the infusion.

18
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,540
So I feel like

19
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,540
I could run a marathon.

20
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,250
Look what I found.

21
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,190
Remember that trip

22
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,190
we took to

23
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,190
Mackinac Island

24
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,560
when Robin

25
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,560
was three?

26
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,460
No cars,

27
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,460
nothing but horses.

28
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,420
I remember that

29
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,420
Rainbow Brite t-shirt.

30
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,420
Mmm-hmm.

31
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,790
Nothing but saltwater

32
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,790
taffy and ice cream.

33
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,330
What a trip. That was

34
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,330
a great trip.

35
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,900
No, it wasn't, Danny.

36
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,900
You were horribly depressed.

37
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,730
You stayed in the hotel room,

38
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,730
laid in the bed,

39
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,800
and stared at the ceiling.

40
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,170
I kept telling Robin that

41
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,170
you wouldn't come down

42
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,440
"because Daddy

43
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,440
didn't feel good."

44
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,440
Hmm.

45
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,720
I mean, I remember maybe

46
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,720
a couple of dark days.

47
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,880
But, on the whole,

48
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,880
didn't we have...

49
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,650
Danny, what

50
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,650
are you doing?

51
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,360
I just thought you'd like

52
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,360
to see these pictures.

53
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,060
That's all, you know?

54
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,990
I know you were trying

55
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,990
to rewrite history

56
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,470
to paint a pretty picture,

57
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,010
aw, of a happy marriage

58
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,470
and it wasn't

59
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,470
always like that.

60
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,440
It's pure fantasy,

61
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,440
Danny.

62
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,980
I know Med is not

63
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,980
a for-profit organization...

64
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,680
But

65
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,680
this report?

66
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,680
If my board saw

67
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,680
numbers like this,

68
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,620
they'd be calling for

69
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,620
a vote of no confidence.

70
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,680
Mr. Rhodes, you can see

71
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,680
that one reason

72
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,850
for our fiscal issues is

73
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,850
the ED's Hybrid Room

74
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,790
which you

75
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,790
only partially funded.

76
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,700
I think the rest of the board

77
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,700
would agree with me

78
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,260
that my contributions

79
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,260
have been more than generous.

80
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,200
No, in fact, what I'm seeing

81
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,200
is a lot of your pet projects

82
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,680
not working out so well.

83
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,810
Let's look

84
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,810
at the refurbishment

85
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,810
of the VIP wing.

86
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,740
A lot of empty beds there.

87
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,150
After Dr. Downey's death,

88
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,150
we became less of a...

89
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,780
a destination hospital

90
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,780
for our CT patients.

91
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,060
We're still in the process

92
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,060
of re-branding.

93
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,950
But in the meantime,

94
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,690
since you were

95
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,690
such a vocal advocate

96
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,260
of the Hybrid OR,

97
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,260
Sharon,

98
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,330
it seems only fair that

99
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,330
you should find cuts

100
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,500
in other departments

101
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,170
to make up for

102
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,170
some of our losses.

103
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,930
Well, I will certainly

104
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,930
take a look.

105
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,440
But I'd hate to put us

106
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,440
in legal jeopardy

107
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,950
or lose our reputation

108
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,450
as the premier

109
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,450
medical center

110
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,450
of the Midwest.

111
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,650
Well said, Sharon.

112
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,650
Very, very well said.

113
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,190
We certainly

114
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,190
would not want that.

115
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,390
Mom, seriously, I'm fine.

116
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,590
That's not what

117
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,590
you said this morning.

118
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,790
You could hardly

119
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,790
get out of bed.

120
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,800
Jenny Simpson, 17,

121
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,800
abdominal pain.

122
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,860
Hi. I'm Dr. Manning.

123
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,860
This is Dr. Choi.

124
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,370
Hi.

125
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,370
Mom and Dad?

126
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,740
Evie. That's

127
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,740
my husband, Joel.

128
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,800
Hi.

129
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,770
This is

130
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,770
so unnecessary.

131
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,440
It was probably that

132
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,440
sketchy salad

133
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,440
I had last night.

134
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,040
Remember I said

135
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,040
it smelled weird?

136
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,240
Jenny's been in pain

137
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,340
since we left Fort Wayne

138
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,340
three days ago.

139
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,940
Hoosiers, huh?

140
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,940
Winter getaway?

141
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,390
College tour.

142
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,390
Jenny got into

143
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,390
Northwestern.

144
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,050
Perfect SATs.

145
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,290
Wow!

146
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,290
Congratulations.

147
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,330
Jenny, are you

148
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,330
feeling any nausea?

149
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,360
I mean, a little,

150
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,360
but I'm better now.

151
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,560
I don't know why

152
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,560
you guys are freaking...

153
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,070
Oh, honey.

154
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,000
We thought

155
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,000
maybe appendicitis.

156
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,630
No rebound tenderness.

157
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,400
BP 100/62.

158
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,400
Heart rate 103.

159
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,140
I told you, it's just

160
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,140
food poisoning.

161
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,600
All right, well,

162
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,600
I'd still like to do

163
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,600
a quick ultrasound

164
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,670
just to see if I can get

165
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,940
a visual on

166
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,940
the appendix, okay?

167
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,110
An ultrasound?

168
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,110
Mmm-hmm.

169
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,440
It'll just

170
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,440
take a second.

171
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,540
No, I don't want that.

172
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,580
Honey.

173
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,580
I want to go.

174
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,050
Jenny, appendicitis

175
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,050
is serious,

176
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,720
but it's easily treatable

177
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,720
if we catch it early.

178
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,460
But I have to take

179
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,460
a look to do that, okay?

180
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,390
Jenny.

181
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,160
Okay. I guess.

182
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,660
Great.

183
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,240
Well, good news is

184
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,300
it doesn't look

185
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,300
like appendicitis.

186
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,480
So what is it?

187
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,350
Well, it's hard

188
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,350
to tell just yet.

189
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,050
But I would like

190
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,050
to run some tests

191
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,450
just to rule a few things

192
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,450
out if that's all right.

193
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,990
Oh, of course.

194
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,990
Absolutely.

195
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,390
Monique, CBC, BMP,

196
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,390
coags, and a quant hCG.

197
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,550
Mmm-hmm.

198
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,650
We'll be back

199
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,650
to check in

200
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,960
once we get

201
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,960
the test results in.

202
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,160
Thank you.

203
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,090
Did you see

204
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,090
how scared she got

205
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,470
when I mentioned

206
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,470
the ultrasound?

207
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,300
Yeah, she was

208
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,300
pretty defensive.

209
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,070
You thinking

210
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,070
what I'm thinking?

211
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,070
Pregnancy?

212
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,270
Thinking an endometrium,

213
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,270
but I didn't see an embryo.

214
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,510
Well, she could've had

215
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,510
a miscarriage or an abortion.

216
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,700
But whatever it is,

217
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,720
she is definitely trying to

218
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,720
keep her parents in the dark.

219
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,710
Yeah, but I don't think

220
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,710
that's going to be possible.

221
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,770
Heads up, Maggie.

222
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,170
There's probably

223
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,170
going to be

224
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,430
more spending cuts

225
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,430
coming down.

226
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,490
More?

227
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,200
Gwen hasn't met her goals

228
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,200
and she's feeling the heat.

229
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,900
We're already

230
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,900
short-staffed.

231
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,570
We're using those

232
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,570
cheapo central line kits.

233
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,980
What more

234
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,980
does Gwen want?

235
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,050
Speak of the devil.

236
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,050
Oh...

237
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,940
She's got a big fish

238
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,940
coming into the VIP wing.

239
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,480
Ooh.

240
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,380
Wow!

241
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,680
Man, I love it.

242
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,750
Thanks.

243
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,800
It's a lot easier

244
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,800
to manage.

245
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,420
Hey.

246
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,960
New hairdo?

247
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,160
Hey.

248
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,160
It looks good.

249
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,270
Uh, so we still on?

250
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,270
Drinks for tonight?

251
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,180
Um...

252
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,580
I'm sorry.

253
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,480
I can't. Something came up.

254
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,550
"Something"?

255
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,410
Yeah.

256
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,230
Uh, tomorrow, then?

257
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,620
That's not going to work,

258
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,620
either.

259
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,630
This weekend?

260
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,100
Can I let you know?

261
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,700
Yeah. No big deal.

262
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,800
New hairdo? Hmm, hmm, hmm.

263
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,200
Women don't do that

264
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,200
for no reason.

265
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,980
I'm guessing

266
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,980
there's a guy.

267
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,810
You're suddenly

268
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,810
an expert on women.

269
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,640
Too bad, Choi.

270
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,460
I'll be using what's called

271
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,460
the "David procedure"

272
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,620
to resect

273
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,620
your aneurysm.

274
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,350
It will allow us

275
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,350
to preserve

276
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,350
your native valve.

277
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,290
Our Chief of CT,

278
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,290
Dr. Latham,

279
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,490
is going to be assisting

280
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,490
me on the operation.

281
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,360
Do you have any

282
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,360
questions, concerns?

283
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,440
No concerns. My people

284
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,440
did their research.

285
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,610
You were

286
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,610
at the top of the list,

287
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,410
just under

288
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,410
the late Dr. Downey.

289
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,740
Dr. Rhodes was

290
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,740
Dr. Downey's

291
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,740
star protégé.

292
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,810
I'm aware.

293
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,320
I wanted to

294
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,320
let you know,

295
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,320
Mr. Montero,

296
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,580
that as you recuperate,

297
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,490
we can offer you

298
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,490
spa-like amenities.

299
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,320
Massage, facials.

300
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,590
With your doctor's

301
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,590
permission, of course.

302
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,020
We also have a concierge

303
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,020
at your disposal.

304
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,730
Here is a list

305
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,730
of all our

306
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,730
personal services

307
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,170
and our menu options.

308
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,210
You can almost forget

309
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,210
you're in the hospital.

310
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,150
Why is Dr. Rhodes scheduled

311
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,150
to operate on Mr. Montero?

312
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,710
It's out of my hands.

313
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,320
Dr. Rhodes is

314
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,320
on the trauma service.

315
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,490
I'm the attending in CT.

316
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,500
Mr. Montero's case

317
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,500
should've come to me.

318
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,950
Dr. Bekker,

319
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,870
Mr. Montero specifically

320
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,870
requested Dr. Rhodes

321
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,200
and Mr. Montero

322
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,200
gets what he wants.

323
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,310
Jenny Simpson's

324
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,310
test results.

325
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,270
What's going on

326
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,270
with you and Phillip?

327
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,380
Are you seeing him?

328
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
You know, like,

329
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
"seeing him" seeing him?

330
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,680
Mmm-hmm.

331
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,090
I thought it was

332
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,090
headed that way.

333
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,290
He is a lovely guy,

334
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,290
Maggie.

335
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,360
But so is Big Red.

336
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,770
It is way more complicated

337
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,770
than that and you know it.

338
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,170
Ethan.

339
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,750
Jenny, where are

340
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,750
your parents?

341
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,290
They went to get coffee.

342
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,980
We have to

343
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,980
ask you something.

344
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,690
Jenny, we got your

345
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,690
blood work back

346
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,250
and it indicates

347
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,250
a pregnancy.

348
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,300
No, I'm not pregnant.

349
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,860
Let us explain.

350
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,860
I'm not pregnant.

351
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,470
We understand

352
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,470
how hard this is.

353
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,430
But your test results

354
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,430
and your symptoms

355
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,980
shows that maybe you had

356
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,980
a miscarriage or...

357
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,980
No. No, I didn't.

358
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,980
I don't want to talk about it.

359
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,310
Jenny, in order for us

360
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,310
to treat you properly,

361
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,350
we really need to know

362
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,350
what happened.

363
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,580
Please,

364
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,250
we are not here

365
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,250
to judge you.

366
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,190
No.

367
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,190
We want to help you.

368
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,690
The whole thing was stupid.

369
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,690
So stupid.

370
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,170
When I found out

371
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,170
that I was pregnant,

372
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,570
I didn't know what to do.

373
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,060
I'm finishing high school

374
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,060
and I'm going to college.

375
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,300
I understand.

376
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,000
So I went online

377
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,000
and I read about these pills.

378
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,440
And what were they?

379
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,440
Mife... something.

380
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,500
Mifepristone?

381
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,080
Did you take

382
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,080
the follow-up pill,

383
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,080
misoprostol?

384
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,180
I couldn't get it.

385
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,180
Not without a doctor.

386
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,920
Jenny, that's why

387
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,920
you're in so much pain.

388
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,720
Without the second pill,

389
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,720
you haven't fully aborted yet.

390
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,560
Help me.

391
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,290
Please.

392
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,290
Just don't tell

393
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,290
my parents.

394
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,490
They'll hate me

395
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,490
and they'll never forgive me.

396
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,560
Please.

397
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,400
I think you might be

398
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,400
underestimating them.

399
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,240
No, I know them and

400
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,240
you can't tell them.

401
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,240
Jenny, I'm sorry...

402
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,240
We're not

403
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,240
going to tell your parents,

404
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,340
but I am going to

405
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,340
give you the second pill

406
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,950
so that you can expel whatever

407
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,950
is left in your uterus, okay?

408
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,380
Thank you.

409
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,640
Yeah.

410
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,020
Nat, she's a minor.

411
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,990
We can't give her medications

412
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,990
without her parents' consent.

413
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,080
Yes, we can.

414
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,080
Dr. Manning?

415
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,100
Have you found out

416
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,100
what's wrong with

417
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,100
our daughter?

418
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,260
We were actually

419
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,260
just discussing that.

420
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,860
Unfortunately, we're still

421
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,860
waiting on some test results.

422
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,160
The best thing

423
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,160
you can do right now

424
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,460
is just be patient.

425
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,470
Wait, that's it?

426
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,860
You have no idea?

427
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,970
I know how frustrating

428
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,970
this must be,

429
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,070
but I promise you,

430
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,910
we are doing

431
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,910
everything possible

432
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,910
for Jenny.

433
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,910
I'm sure that you are.

434
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,850
Come on, hon.

435
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,450
What do you think

436
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,450
you're doing?

437
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,150
I'm honoring

438
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,150
the patient's wishes.

439
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,120
And lying

440
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,120
to her parents?

441
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,120
I did not lie to them.

442
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,780
You withheld

443
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,780
the truth, Nat.

444
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,560
They have a right

445
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,560
to know. A legal right.

446
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,820
That's Jenny's call.

447
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,030
If you have a problem with it,

448
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,030
take it up with Goodwin.

449
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,460
Dr. Lanik, FBI medics

450
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,460
have landed.

451
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,800
April, you're up.

452
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,960
FBI?

453
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,330
Special Agent

454
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,330
Sam Pearson.

455
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,170
Low-speed

456
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,170
motor vehicle collision.

457
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,470
GCS 10, LOC on site,

458
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,470
nasal airway in place.

459
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,780
Hey, I know this guy.

460
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,780
Let me work him up.

461
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,610
Self-starter.

462
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,610
Who am I to interfere?

463
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,250
Okay, on my count.

464
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,820
One, two, three.

465
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,460
Hang in there, Sam.

466
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,460
I got you.

467
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,220
What's the story?

468
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,220
Air bags deployed,

469
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,660
but his chest got

470
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,660
most of the impact.

471
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
He's not protecting

472
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
his airway, gotta intubate.

473
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,400
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

474
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,700
Get an X-ray in here.

475
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,340
Meds are in.

476
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,040
Heart rate 124,

477
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,040
BP 132/88, sats 95.

478
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,480
I'm in. Bag him.

479
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,390
Good breath sounds

480
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,390
bilaterally.

481
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,550
Let's get that

482
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,550
chest X-ray.

483
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,620
Yes, Doctor.

484
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,320
Clear.

485
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,160
Chest shows multiple

486
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,160
rib fractures

487
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,430
and bilateral

488
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,430
pulmonary contusions.

489
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,770
I need a CBC, CMP,

490
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,770
blood gas, and coags.

491
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,500
I'm seeing PVCs

492
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,500
on the monitors.

493
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,600
Got it.

494
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,740
Is he going to be okay?

495
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,080
Ingrid.

496
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,650
He's in rough shape,

497
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,650
but stable for now.

498
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,650
Were you with him?

499
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,150
Yeah.

500
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,660
Let me check you out.

501
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,660
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

502
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,850
Just...

503
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,850
Just keep my partner alive.

504
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,930
Dr. Manning boxed us

505
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,930
into this situation.

506
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,630
You want to talk

507
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,630
about boxed in?

508
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,700
The only reason

509
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,700
we're in this situation

510
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,040
is because Jenny

511
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,040
had no options.

512
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,630
The family lives

513
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,630
in Indiana.

514
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,800
Where she would need

515
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,800
parental consent.

516
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,110
And she was afraid

517
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,110
to talk to them,

518
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,270
so there was

519
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,270
nowhere else to go,

520
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,320
so she went online

521
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,320
to find medication.

522
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,320
This generation's

523
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,320
back-alley abortion.

524
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,120
We don't make the laws,

525
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,120
but we have to obey them.

526
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,780
Jenny's a minor

527
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,780
and that means

528
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,020
we have to tell her parents

529
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,020
before we treat.

530
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,420
No, her pregnancy test

531
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,420
is still positive.

532
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,960
Therefore, under the law,

533
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,960
she is emancipated.

534
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,220
She was pregnant.

535
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,220
Not anymore.

536
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,700
Technically,

537
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,700
she still is.

538
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,700
Ms. Goodwin.

539
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,700
I'll admit

540
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,700
it's a thin argument.

541
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,160
Emancipation covers

542
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,160
a woman's decisions

543
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,730
regarding her pregnancy,

544
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,500
but my understanding

545
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,370
is that Ms. Simpson

546
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,370
has already made her choice.

547
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,570
So we betray

548
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,570
this girl's trust?

549
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,170
Well, that's not

550
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,170
what I'm suggesting.

551
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,050
We have to obey the law

552
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,050
and tell her parents.

553
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,110
That's not

554
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,110
exactly right, either.

555
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,850
If we had provided

556
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,850
a medical abortion,

557
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,390
which we didn't,

558
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,390
then, yes.

559
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,180
The State of Illinois says

560
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,350
we're obligated

561
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,350
to inform the parents.

562
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,560
But since she obtained

563
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,560
the medication herself

564
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,690
out-of state,

565
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,690
I'm not so sure.

566
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,260
So you intend to keep

567
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,260
the parents in the dark

568
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,330
based on a technicality?

569
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,900
No, because

570
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,900
our patient asked us

571
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,960
to keep it confidential.

572
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,910
Look, I would suggest you

573
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,910
continue to treat her

574
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,910
according to her wishes

575
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,980
until our lawyers

576
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,980
make a determination.

577
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,620
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

578
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,320
Why are you here?

579
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,360
I'm scrubbing in

580
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,360
on your surgery.

581
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,530
No, Dr. Latham

582
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,530
is assisting.

583
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,860
He reconsidered.

584
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,500
So just like that,

585
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,500
he pulled out?

586
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,540
What did you say to him?

587
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,540
Really, Connor?

588
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,970
Why wasn't I

589
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,970
consulted?

590
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,370
Don't worry.

591
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,370
It's been made

592
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,370
very clear to me

593
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
that Mr. Montero

594
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
is your patient.

595
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,610
I'm only here

596
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,610
as your humble assistant.

597
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,210
By the way, I had

598
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,210
my last HIV test.

599
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,310
I'm clear.

600
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,180
I'm glad to hear it.

601
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,120
Since you were the one

602
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,120
who so carelessly cut me,

603
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,380
I thought you might be.

604
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,230
How is she?

605
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,370
Cuts and scrapes.

606
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,370
Nothing serious.

607
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,870
Ingrid.

608
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,170
How's Sam?

609
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,770
Wait and see

610
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,770
right now.

611
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,580
Can I get you

612
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,580
anything?

613
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,510
No.

614
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,750
Haven't seen you

615
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,750
at the dog park lately.

616
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,420
It's... work.

617
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,090
I'll keep you

618
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,090
posted on Sam.

619
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,770
Where are we?

620
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,570
The PVCs were all unifocal,

621
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,640
but his airway pressures

622
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,640
are bad.

623
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,740
PaO2's at 50 and

624
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,740
peak pressure's at 55.

625
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,480
All this from a car crash?

626
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,380
They said he wasn't even

627
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,380
going that fast.

628
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,560
He shouldn't be this sick.

629
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,190
Crank the O2 and increase

630
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,190
his PEEP to 12.

631
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,020
See if we can improve

632
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,020
his oxygenation.

633
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,080
Okay.

634
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,590
These bruises...

635
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,400
They don't look like

636
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,400
they're from an air bag.

637
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,940
They're too extensive.

638
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,140
The air bag shouldn't

639
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,140
have touched his legs.

640
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,470
We still waiting

641
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,470
on those CT scans?

642
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,210
Radiology's been

643
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,210
slammed all morning.

644
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,910
Get him moved up.

645
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,910
Don't take no

646
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,910
for an answer.

647
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,140
These injuries

648
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,140
just don't add up.

649
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,210
You got it.

650
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,290
Proximal anastomosis done.

651
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,690
I'm working on the distal now.

652
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,360
Temp's coming up.

653
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,360
33 degrees.

654
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,800
We need to move faster.

655
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,030
Look, I realize that,

656
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,830
but the graft

657
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,830
is coming down unevenly.

658
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,470
If I keep tugging,

659
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,470
I could tear the aorta.

660
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,830
A suggestion?

661
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,170
What?

662
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,910
Try pulling on

663
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,910
the non-coronary commissure.

664
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,110
I think that'll move the graft

665
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,110
into the proper position.

666
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,640
Okay.

667
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,910
That did it,

668
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,910
thank you.

669
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,980
Of course.

670
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,960
All right, let's finish

671
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,960
the anastomosis.

672
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,520
No, I haven't told him,

673
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,520
but I don't feel good

674
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,520
about it.

675
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,430
Don't you think he has

676
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,430
a right to know?

677
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,470
I've gotta go.

678
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,470
I'll talk to you later.

679
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,560
You need something?

680
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,260
No.

681
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,830
Okay.

682
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,340
Help! Dr. Manning! Dr. Choi!

683
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,140
Oh, my God.

684
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,520
Help her!

685
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,520
I feel dizzy.

686
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,610
Jenny, keep looking at me.

687
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,610
Keep talking, okay?

688
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,680
Mom...

689
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,250
You'll be okay, honey.

690
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,250
Mommy is right here.

691
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,310
I don't feel good.

692
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,310
Oh, God.

693
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,590
What is happening

694
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,590
to my daughter?

695
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,650
There's so much blood.

696
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,920
It's a gynecologic

697
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,920
hemorrhage.

698
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,020
She's passing

699
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,020
retained tissue...

700
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,220
We need to

701
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,220
control the bleed.

702
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,090
Monique, hang a unit of typed

703
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,090
and crossed-matched blood,

704
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,140
give her 0.2 milligrams

705
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,140
of Methergine IM...

706
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,140
Mmm-hmm.

707
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,230
...and I need a stat

708
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,230
CBC and coags.

709
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,110
Wait, we need

710
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,110
your parental consent.

711
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,170
Ethan.

712
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,010
To start the transfusion

713
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,010
and administer the medication.

714
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,110
Whatever you need to do.

715
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,310
Go ahead.

716
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,300
I may have

717
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,300
distorted the graft

718
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,300
with that last stitch.

719
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,190
I'm doing this backhand.

720
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,190
Do you have a better angle?

721
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,360
I think so.

722
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,240
Dr. Rhodes's phone.

723
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,240
Take a message.

724
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,080
All right, last couple

725
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,080
of stitches then

726
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,080
we're coming off pump.

727
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,910
Dr. Rhodes?

728
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,910
I said take a message.

729
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,480
Dr. Rhodes, he says

730
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,480
it's an emergency.

731
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,640
All right.

732
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,720
Look, I'm in the middle

733
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,720
of an operation.

734
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,990
What?

735
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,390
Is this some kind of joke?

736
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,230
How do I know that?

737
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,920
All right.

738
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,260
All right. All right.

739
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,800
What do you

740
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,800
want me to do?

741
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,860
What is it?

742
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,670
Okay. Yeah, okay.

743
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,770
Yeah. Look...

744
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,900
No, I won't hang up.

745
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,900
I promise.

746
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,550
I have to leave.

747
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,550
What?

748
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,340
Finish the anastomosis.

749
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,080
Check the competency

750
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,080
of the valve.

751
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,080
Connor, no!

752
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,680
You've done this before.

753
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,680
You'll be fine.

754
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,050
That's not...

755
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,050
No!

756
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,920
I'm not hanging up.

757
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,920
I promise.

758
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,880
All right, we have

759
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,880
a patient on the table.

760
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,020
Let's get back to work.

761
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,090
I just left

762
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,090
the operating room.

763
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,090
I'm headed out now.

764
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,600
You finished already,

765
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,600
Dr. Rhodes?

766
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,330
No, I'm still here, okay?

767
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,330
I won't hang up.

768
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,460
Dr. Rhodes?

769
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,040
No, I'm still here.

770
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,040
I'm still here.

771
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,380
The elevator is really slow.

772
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,680
Look, I'm moving as fast

773
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,680
as I can, man, I promise.

774
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,790
Can I talk to her?

775
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,560
Okay, okay, okay.

776
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,460
I'll do whatever you say.

777
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,260
All right,

778
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,260
I'm leaving now.

779
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,970
Just, please,

780
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,970
don't hurt her.

781
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,970
Robin, it's Dad.

782
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,130
Can you... can you call me

783
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,130
as soon as you get this?

784
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,110
My bank is on the corner

785
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,110
of LaSalle and Van Buren.

786
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,570
I'll be there

787
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,570
in 20 minutes.

788
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,760
Trudy, it's Dan Charles.

789
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,160
I need to speak

790
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,160
to Hank Voight immediately.

791
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,970
What the hell is going on

792
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,970
with Dr. Rhodes?

793
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,030
What do you mean?

794
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,810
Halfway through

795
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,810
Mr. Montero's surgery,

796
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,740
he left the OR

797
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,740
and the hospital.

798
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,840
What?

799
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,940
You know how important

800
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,940
this patient is to us,

801
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,080
and if his outcome

802
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,080
is less than perfect,

803
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,810
I will fire Dr. Rhodes

804
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,450
and that'll be the least

805
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,450
of his problems.

806
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,590
I'll sue him and then

807
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,590
I'll bring him up

808
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,590
on charges.

809
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,000
I know there is a reasonable

810
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,000
explanation for this.

811
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,430
If this blows up, Sharon,

812
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,660
he won't be

813
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,660
the only one

814
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,660
without a job.

815
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,310
I'm heading east on Lake.

816
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,640
You're late. You said

817
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,640
you'd be there in 20 minutes.

818
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,180
I can't help the traffic.

819
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,710
Are you playing

820
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,710
games with me?

821
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,180
I am doing

822
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,180
the best I can.

823
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,650
Whatever happens to Robin,

824
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,650
that's on you, man.

825
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,750
Just don't touch her!

826
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,350
Move! Move!

827
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,970
Since your patient,

828
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,970
Jenny Simpson, is a minor,

829
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,210
legal is concerned

830
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,210
about liability.

831
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,410
Of course they are.

832
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,910
Bottom line,

833
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,910
if you feel the need

834
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,650
for any further

835
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,650
medical procedures,

836
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,090
you must obtain

837
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,090
parental consent.

838
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,450
Good, thank you.

839
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,780
This isn't right.

840
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,330
I'm sorry, Dr. Manning,

841
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,330
but you've given her

842
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,330
Methergine.

843
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,390
Yes?

844
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,390
Yes.

845
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,760
So let's hope she passes

846
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,760
any retained tissue

847
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,660
and that should

848
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,660
take care of it.

849
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,960
Hi.

850
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,870
Could we have a moment

851
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,870
to examine Jenny?

852
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,110
Oh, of course.

853
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,110
When are we

854
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,110
going to know something?

855
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,850
Honey, let them

856
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,850
do their job.

857
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,280
Come on.

858
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,180
Thank you.

859
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,620
How are you feeling, Jenny?

860
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,180
Not good.

861
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,590
Well, I'm going to do

862
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,590
an internal exam, okay?

863
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,220
So I just need you

864
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,220
to lift up your legs

865
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,220
just like that

866
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,920
and then just

867
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,920
let them fall open.

868
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,220
Perfect.

869
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,760
I apologize,

870
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,760
this is going to be

871
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,530
a little

872
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,530
uncomfortable, okay?

873
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,930
Thank you.

874
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,370
All right, you ready?

875
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,570
You okay?

876
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,300
What is it?

877
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,680
Well, your body

878
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,680
hasn't expelled

879
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,380
all the tissue

880
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,380
related to the pregnancy.

881
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,010
The medication

882
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,010
we gave you was

883
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,010
supposed to help,

884
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,620
but, unfortunately,

885
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,620
you're still bleeding.

886
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,590
It means you're

887
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,590
going to need a D&C,

888
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,590
dilation and curettage,

889
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,030
a surgical procedure

890
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,030
to remove the tissue.

891
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,560
But we do need

892
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,560
your parents'

893
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,560
permission for this.

894
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,630
No. You can't tell them.

895
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,830
We have to.

896
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,460
Jenny, your temperature

897
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,460
is elevated,

898
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,170
which means you could be

899
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,170
developing endometritis,

900
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,210
which is

901
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,210
a very serious infection.

902
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,110
It could be

903
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,110
life-threatening.

904
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,550
No! No! No!

905
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,140
Jenny, I know you're afraid

906
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,140
of what your parents will say,

907
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,820
but they love you

908
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,980
and they would

909
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,980
never want to lose you.

910
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,290
So I'm going to go

911
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,290
talk to them, okay?

912
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,250
Wait.

913
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,460
My mom...

914
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,460
Ask my mom to come in.

915
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,560
Okay.

916
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,870
Mrs. Simpson,

917
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,870
Jenny would like

918
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,870
to talk to you.

919
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,600
Oh...

920
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,870
Um...

921
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,510
Why don't you go get

922
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,510
a cup of coffee?

923
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,380
I think this is

924
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,380
mother-daughter talk.

925
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,750
No, it'll be okay.

926
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,500
Agent Pearson's CT results.

927
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,230
Is something wrong?

928
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,640
Sam's CAT scan.

929
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,080
Bilateral diffuse

930
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,080
pulmonary whiteout,

931
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,580
bilateral subclinical

932
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,580
pneumothoraces,

933
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,350
sternal fracture,

934
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,350
subcapsular

935
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,350
liver hematoma...

936
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,550
What does all that mean?

937
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,490
Looks like blast lung.

938
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,920
These injuries

939
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,920
were not caused

940
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,920
by a car crash.

941
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,090
Ingrid, what really happened?

942
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,020
Tell me.

943
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,800
Will it affect

944
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,800
how you treat him?

945
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,800
Of course it will!

946
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,100
What happened?

947
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,100
Okay.

948
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,650
We... there was an explosion

949
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,650
and Sam took the brunt of it.

950
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,940
What kind of explosion?

951
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,710
A meth lab.

952
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,350
What are we

953
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,350
talking about, then?

954
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,620
Acetone peroxide?

955
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,620
Red phosphorus?

956
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,750
Yes.

957
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,050
What else can you tell us?

958
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,020
Ingrid!

959
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,620
For God's sakes, Will,

960
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,620
isn't that enough?

961
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,470
Convert him

962
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,470
to lung protective

963
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,470
ventilation.

964
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,730
Drop the tidal volume

965
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,730
to four cc's per kilo

966
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,730
and up his rate to 28.

967
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,800
On it.

968
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,110
You... I knew it.

969
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,380
I knew it

970
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,380
all along.

971
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,720
You had no right

972
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,720
to keep this from us.

973
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,020
It was Jenny's wish.

974
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,630
Well, of course

975
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,630
she didn't want us

976
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,630
to find out.

977
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,460
She knew it was wrong.

978
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,860
What she did was murder.

979
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,160
Mrs. Simpson,

980
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,200
you should know that Jenny

981
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,200
didn't want to tell you

982
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,400
because she was afraid

983
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,400
you wouldn't love her

984
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,400
anymore.

985
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,340
No.

986
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,640
No.

987
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,640
No, no, no.

988
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,780
Listen, no matter

989
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,780
what your beliefs are,

990
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,380
that's your daughter,

991
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,380
and she's very sick.

992
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,390
Look, can I give

993
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,390
the consent for the D&C

994
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,390
without my husband?

995
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,790
Yes.

996
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,540
Do whatever you have to do

997
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,540
to save my daughter.

998
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,770
Just don't tell Joel

999
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,770
what happened.

1000
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,830
I don't want this

1001
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,830
to destroy my family.

1002
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,570
But doesn't he have

1003
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,570
the right to know?

1004
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,870
He's her father.

1005
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,570
Actually...

1006
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,310
Actually, he isn't.

1007
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,510
And, no,

1008
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,510
I never told him.

1009
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,770
All right, I'm here.

1010
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,040
Ginny! Ginny, hi. Hi.

1011
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,080
Hello, Dr. Rhodes,

1012
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,080
what can I do for you?

1013
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,840
I need to take $50,000

1014
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,970
out of my money market

1015
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,970
account in cash.

1016
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,270
Cash?

1017
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,340
Yes, and, please,

1018
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,340
I am in a bit of a hurry.

1019
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,090
It'll take a few minutes.

1020
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,490
I'm not sure the tellers

1021
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,490
have that much on hand.

1022
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,750
I may need to go

1023
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,750
into the vault.

1024
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,880
Ginny, whatever it takes,

1025
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,880
just please do it. Thank you.

1026
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,260
All right, did you hear that?

1027
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,620
It's going to take a while.

1028
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,940
No, no, no.

1029
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,160
I... I... I didn't call them,

1030
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,160
I swear!

1031
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,340
No, no, no,

1032
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,340
they can't be outside!

1033
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,930
I didn't call them!

1034
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,930
Please! Please!

1035
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,310
No, no, no! Don't hang up!

1036
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,870
I am getting you the money!

1037
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,080
Hello? Hello, you there?

1038
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,080
You... hello?

1039
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,080
No, no, no, no, no!

1040
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,480
No!

1041
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,960
No, no, no!

1042
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,220
I told you

1043
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,220
not to call the police!

1044
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,520
They saw you!

1045
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,520
They're going to

1046
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,520
kill her!

1047
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,090
They're not.

1048
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,090
You don't know that.

1049
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,650
Yes, I do.

1050
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,650
Dr. Rhodes.

1051
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,220
Robin was never kidnapped.

1052
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,860
No, she was.

1053
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,860
I heard her.

1054
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,100
I heard her scream!

1055
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,100
It wasn't her, buddy.

1056
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,100
No, it's a scam.

1057
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,940
Dr. Rhodes, it's a scam.

1058
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,630
A scam?

1059
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,310
When I finally reached Robin,

1060
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,010
she had no idea

1061
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,010
what I was talking about.

1062
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,540
You spoke to her

1063
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,540
and she's fine?

1064
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,280
Was never in any danger.

1065
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,430
Watch out.

1066
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,600
BP 92 over 56.

1067
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,600
Heart rate 48.

1068
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,140
Sats 73 and dropping.

1069
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,100
He's bradying down.

1070
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,670
Bilateral tension

1071
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,670
pneumothoraces.

1072
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,910
Two needle kits?

1073
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,910
Yeah, gotta decompress

1074
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,910
his chest.

1075
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,010
What's happening?

1076
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,680
Air's leaking

1077
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,680
into his chest

1078
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,680
from his lungs.

1079
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,880
Now, his lungs

1080
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,880
can't inflate.

1081
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,380
Second needle?

1082
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,020
Sats and heart rate climbing.

1083
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,470
Set up for bilateral

1084
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,470
chest tubes.

1085
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,800
Otherwise his lungs are just

1086
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,800
going to collapse again.

1087
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,930
Right.

1088
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,700
We'll need to

1089
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,700
send him up to the ICU

1090
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,700
and get him on ECMO.

1091
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,340
Is this because

1092
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,340
you didn't know?

1093
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,010
It didn't help, Ingrid.

1094
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,250
Evie?

1095
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,320
What's happening?

1096
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,320
Where are they taking her?

1097
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,780
They'll explain.

1098
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,430
We're starting your daughter

1099
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,430
on broad spectrum antibiotics

1100
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,730
and we're taking her

1101
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,730
up to surgery.

1102
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,590
Why?

1103
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,230
We were unable

1104
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,230
to stop her bleeding,

1105
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,140
and also we were concerned

1106
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,140
she could become septic.

1107
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,940
Oh, God.

1108
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,440
The procedure to address this

1109
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,440
is simple, very low-risk.

1110
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,810
In all likelihood,

1111
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,850
she'll be able

1112
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,850
to go home

1113
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,850
with you tomorrow.

1114
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,610
Okay.

1115
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,490
I'm still not clear.

1116
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,750
This procedure...

1117
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,390
It's to remove

1118
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,390
degenerating tissue

1119
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,590
that's trapped

1120
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,590
in her uterus.

1121
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,800
Her uterus?

1122
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,800
That's right.

1123
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,400
Okay, as long as

1124
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,400
she's going to be all right.

1125
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,330
Yeah.

1126
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,440
Do you have

1127
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,440
any further questions?

1128
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,010
No. No.

1129
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,010
Okay.

1130
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,520
Then why don't we have

1131
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,520
someone take you up

1132
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,640
to the waiting area?

1133
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,390
Monique, take Mr. Simpson

1134
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,390
upstairs to join his wife.

1135
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,320
Sure. This way, sir.

1136
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,180
Thank you.

1137
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,290
Robin.

1138
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,430
Hey.

1139
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,430
Oh, my God.

1140
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,270
Oh, it's okay.

1141
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,270
I'm fine.

1142
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,400
I was just so worried.

1143
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,600
No... Dad, you know

1144
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,600
I go swimming

1145
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,600
during lunch.

1146
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,140
Do I know that?

1147
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,540
I don't think I know that.

1148
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,170
Yeah, well, maybe

1149
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,170
you should listen.

1150
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,210
How were they even able

1151
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,210
to pull this off?

1152
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,450
I mean, they must've

1153
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,450
known so much about you.

1154
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,690
The cops said they

1155
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,690
must've hacked my email.

1156
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,090
Apparently, this sort of scam

1157
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,090
has been happening a lot.

1158
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,260
I'm really sorry.

1159
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,260
I've got to get back

1160
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,260
to the OR.

1161
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,060
Oh, I'm fine,

1162
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,060
Connor. Go.

1163
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,260
Okay, thank you.

1164
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,060
And change

1165
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,060
your passwords.

1166
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,700
Dr. Rhodes?

1167
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,750
Ms. Goodwin, I will explain

1168
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,750
everything when I can, but...

1169
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,640
right now, I have got to

1170
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,640
get back to the OR.

1171
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,870
There's no hurry.

1172
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,080
Mr. Montero?

1173
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,080
Did fine.

1174
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,810
They're closing him up now.

1175
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,110
That's good.

1176
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,350
Since you ran out

1177
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,350
in the middle of the surgery,

1178
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,360
I'd say it's very good.

1179
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,630
And now you have time

1180
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,630
to tell me what happened.

1181
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,030
Hey.

1182
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,840
Sam is stable, on ECMO.

1183
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,010
That'll take

1184
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,010
the strain off his lungs,

1185
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,010
so they can heal.

1186
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,770
He's got a long road

1187
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,770
ahead of him,

1188
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,510
but he should pull through.

1189
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,710
Good.

1190
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,250
And, look, I'm sorry.

1191
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,950
Even if I had known earlier

1192
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,950
what caused his injuries,

1193
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,050
I don't think

1194
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,050
it would have made

1195
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,050
a difference.

1196
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,450
Thank you.

1197
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,590
You can go and see him.

1198
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,160
Okay.

1199
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,230
You're still

1200
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,230
not gonna tell me

1201
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,230
what happened?

1202
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,290
We're fortunate

1203
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,290
Dr. Bekker was able

1204
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,290
to take over

1205
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,860
for Dr. Rhodes when

1206
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,860
he became incapacitated.

1207
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,760
She is a brilliant surgeon.

1208
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,310
And she's proven herself

1209
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,310
a worthy successor

1210
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,310
to Dr. Downey.

1211
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,470
Thank you.

1212
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,340
You're most welcome.

1213
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,350
I think we can all agree

1214
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,350
that thanks to Dr. Bekker,

1215
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,920
we're on our way

1216
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,920
to becoming

1217
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,620
a destination hospital

1218
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,620
once again.

1219
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,200
I heard what happened.

1220
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,900
That's awful.

1221
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,780
But Robin's okay?

1222
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,780
It was just a scam?

1223
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,040
Yeah.

1224
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,040
So cruel.

1225
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,270
Well, thank you

1226
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,270
for stepping in.

1227
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,880
Of course.

1228
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,580
I'm going to go

1229
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,580
write up my notes.

1230
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,320
Looks like it all

1231
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,320
worked out well for her.

1232
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,790
Yeah.

1233
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,340
Dr. Choi, Dr. Manning,

1234
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,500
I thought Jenny

1235
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,500
might be hungry.

1236
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,480
And I wanted to thank you.

1237
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,740
The OB said

1238
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,740
she's gonna be fine.

1239
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,540
Yes, everything

1240
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,540
went well.

1241
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,610
Yeah. She's a good girl.

1242
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,950
Mr. Simpson.

1243
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,680
Take care.

1244
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,220
I will. Thanks.

1245
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,860
That man's being lied

1246
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,860
to by us, his wife,

1247
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,860
his daughter.

1248
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,670
I don't get you, Ethan.

1249
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,830
You believe that everyone has

1250
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,830
a right to make decisions

1251
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,240
about their own body.

1252
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,300
It's not that.

1253
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,300
It's the dishonesty.

1254
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,710
Listen, some people

1255
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,710
don't want honesty.

1256
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,770
They find

1257
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,770
living with a lie

1258
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,770
to be a lot easier.

1259
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,310
Not me.

1260
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,420
April?

1261
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,360
April, it's Ethan.

1262
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,890
Ethan, what are you doing?

1263
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,170
If you're seeing another guy,

1264
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,170
just tell me the truth.

1265
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,100
You have no right

1266
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,100
to come to my apartment

1267
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,640
demanding anything.

1268
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,710
You keep making excuses.

1269
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,710
You cut your hair.

1270
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,240
My hair? So what?

1271
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,510
Just be honest with me.

1272
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,510
I can handle it.

1273
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,790
You're going to

1274
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,790
wake the baby.

1275
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,980
Emily.

1276
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,010
Why don't you come in?

1277
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,840
Hey.

1278
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,900
Hey.

1279
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,540
They're probably not going to

1280
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,540
extubate him for a few days.

1281
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,980
You should go home,

1282
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,980
get some rest.

1283
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,410
Okay.

1284
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,100
Will, it wasn't

1285
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,100
because of security

1286
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,530
that I didn't tell you.

1287
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,590
I trust you.

1288
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,430
Then, why?

1289
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,340
I just didn't want

1290
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,340
to burden you with it.

1291
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,100
Ingrid.

1292
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,210
I'm not really good

1293
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,210
at letting people in,

1294
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,450
but I do know...

1295
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,750
sometimes burdens

1296
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,750
are easier to bear

1297
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,750
if they're shared.

1298
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,880
You can tell me.

1299
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,090
Tell me.

1300
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,660
That raid on the meth lab?

1301
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,230
The suspect

1302
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,230
was supposed to be alone,

1303
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,600
but he had his kids with him.

1304
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,810
They're twins, girls,

1305
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,810
six years old.

1306
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,180
And, um, rather than

1307
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,180
surrender, he lit a match.

1308
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,720
Uh...

1309
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,330
After the explosion

1310
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,330
when the smoke

1311
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,330
started to clear,

1312
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,300
I could see that

1313
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,300
Sam was down.

1314
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,390
And then I, um...

1315
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,900
I just saw bits of them

1316
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,900
everywhere.

1317
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,970
And then in the middle

1318
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,970
of all it...

1319
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,450
I saw a little girl's toy,

1320
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,450
a pink unicorn.

1321
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,380
It was perfect.

1322
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,490
There wasn't

1323
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,490
a scratch on it.

1324
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,030
I got you.

1325
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,740
Bernie just needs some time.

1326
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,030
So April said

1327
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,030
I could stay with her.

1328
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,540
But what's he doing

1329
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,540
at his wife's?

1330
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,240
He left her.

1331
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,240
He did.

1332
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,410
But he misses her

1333
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,410
and he misses his daughter.

1334
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,250
So we talked about it

1335
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,250
and thought it would be good

1336
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,910
if they spent some time

1337
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,910
together, and, you know,

1338
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,880
just work things out.

1339
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,180
Work what things out?

1340
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,180
He has a baby.

1341
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,450
Your baby.

1342
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,450
She knows that.

1343
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,150
Obviously, you're

1344
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,150
fine with this.

1345
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,230
They're doing the best

1346
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,230
they can, Ethan.

1347
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,760
It doesn't sound

1348
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,760
that way to me.

1349
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,600
See? This is why

1350
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,600
I didn't want him to know.

1351
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,570
Okay, come here.

1352
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,270
Don't you want

1353
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,270
to meet your nephew?

1354
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,500
Come here, Em.

1355
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,130
Come on.

1356
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,650
His name is Vincent.

1357
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,250
Vincent.

1358
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,150
After Grandpa.

1359
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,120
Mmm-hmm.

1360
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,960
You know, I did cut

1361
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,960
my hair because of a guy.

1362
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,470
Vincent likes

1363
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,470
to pull on it.

1364
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,010
Yes, I got that.

1365
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,170
Hey, Ma?

1366
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,810
So Dad has had

1367
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,810
a bit of a rough day

1368
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,350
and wants to know

1369
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,350
if we can all go out

1370
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,350
to dinner together.

1371
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,150
So why isn't he

1372
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,150
asking me himself?

1373
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:57,210
Oh, I wouldn't want you

1374
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:57,210
to think that I was being

1375
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:57,210
manipulative.

1376
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,950
Oh.

1377
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,630
Tell him I like steak.

1378
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,760
Not for nothing,

1379
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,760
you were absolutely

1380
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,760
right this morning

1381
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,820
about Mackinac Island.

1382
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,770
Okay, now, you're being

1383
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,770
really manipulative.
