1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,130
I'm sorry, Nat,

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,130
I just gotta do

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,130
something quick for Jay.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,500
I'm gonna be

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,500
a few minutes late.

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,930
Thanks.

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,830
Hey, why didn't you call 911?

8
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,830
We called you.

9
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,140
Hi, Ray.

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,310
So, what made you fall?

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,250
I took one look

12
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,250
at that carburetor.

13
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,450
Can you tell me

14
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,450
how old you are?

15
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,810
62.

16
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,510
What month is it?

17
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,510
Come on, Will.

18
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,180
Ray, what month is it?

19
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,950
It's... It's, uh...

20
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,560
I can't remember.

21
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,190
Your eye movement's

22
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,190
a little sluggish.

23
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,630
I need to get you

24
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,630
to the hospital for an MRI.

25
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,190
Happy to do it,

26
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,190
first thing tomorrow.

27
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,330
Ray...

28
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,430
So, he's got

29
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,430
a bridge game today

30
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,940
with some friends

31
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,940
that, um, hasn't seen

32
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,940
in a while.

33
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,880
Look at your father.

34
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,880
He could be having

35
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,880
a stroke right now.

36
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,980
If he is,

37
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,980
and we don't get him

38
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,980
to the hospital, he could die.

39
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,520
I'll get you in and out

40
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,520
in an hour.

41
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,450
Really? An hour?

42
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,640
Promise.

43
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,720
Fine, get my stuff.

44
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,960
All right, come on.

45
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,960
Okay.

46
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,590
All right, there we are.

47
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,590
Okay.

48
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,790
An hour.

49
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,470
Em, you sure you should be

50
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,470
going to Vegas?

51
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,470
I mean, you did meet in AA.

52
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,640
Ethan, Bernie has a lead

53
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,640
on a really good job.

54
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,340
I mean,

55
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,340
we're gonna buy a house.

56
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,110
Look, I know

57
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,110
you're worried about me,

58
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,380
but everything's

59
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,380
gonna be okay.

60
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,010
Em, he has pancreatitis.

61
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,290
You have to keep

62
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,290
his drain clean.

63
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,950
Check his glucose

64
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,950
every four hours.

65
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,950
It's a lot of work.

66
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,050
I know.

67
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,360
Well, if we're gonna

68
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,360
get to Omaha by dinner,

69
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,360
we gotta hit the road.

70
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,620
Drive safely, okay?

71
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,620
We will.

72
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,430
And, Bernie...

73
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,430
Don't worry, Doc.

74
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,400
I'll be checking my glucose.

75
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,870
Oh, thanks for everything.

76
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,340
Call when you get there?

77
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,300
I will.

78
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,600
Thanks for your help.

79
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,600
Yeah, of course.

80
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,630
See you at work.

81
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,600
Yeah.

82
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,910
Hey, haven't seen

83
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,910
your big, red shadow today.

84
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,110
Yeah, he's running

85
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,110
a little late.

86
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,740
Oh, hey, um...

87
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,740
Yeah?

88
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,790
Have you noticed Will

89
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,790
acting a little weird lately?

90
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,420
He is getting married

91
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,420
in a month.

92
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,590
Makes most men act

93
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,590
a little weird.

94
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,360
Yeah, I guess.

95
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,370
Heard Emily left.

96
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,370
Oh, yeah.

97
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,440
So?

98
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,240
So now what?

99
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,010
Nothing.

100
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,910
Really?

101
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,910
Yeah.

102
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,380
Emily was the only thing

103
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,380
keeping you two apart.

104
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,550
She actually just made

105
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,550
our problems more obvious.

106
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,650
Really, there's nothing left

107
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,650
between me and Ethan.

108
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,850
If you say so.

109
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,090
Dr. Choi,

110
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,990
there's a patient

111
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,990
in Treatment 4

112
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,990
that's insisting to see you.

113
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,100
You know him?

114
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,860
Don't think so,

115
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,860
but I'll check him out.

116
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,560
All right, then.

117
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,940
Mr. Patrick,

118
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,940
hey, I'm Dr. Choi.

119
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,940
What brings you in today?

120
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,070
Uh...

121
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,080
I was looking

122
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,080
for Dr. Ethan Choi.

123
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,340
Is that you?

124
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,340
Yeah.

125
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,980
And why are you

126
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,980
looking for me specifically?

127
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,950
Do you recall

128
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,950
seeing my wife here

129
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,950
a year ago?

130
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,450
Megan Patrick?

131
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm sorry,

132
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,520
not off the top

133
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,520
of my head. Why?

134
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,000
'Cause you're the doctor

135
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,000
that killed her.

136
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,890
I don't care

137
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,890
what you remember.

138
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,290
Just give me the facts.

139
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:29,520
I understand, but first,

140
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:29,520
I just want you to know

141
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,090
that I realize you've been

142
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,090
through something

143
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,090
truly awful...

144
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,690
Sit down.

145
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,070
Just tell me what happened.

146
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,940
Okay, Mr. Patrick,

147
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,940
but I have to look up

148
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,940
her chart.

149
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,580
Go ahead, go ahead.

150
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,020
Man, those vanilla lattes

151
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,020
never get old, do they?

152
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,690
Why do people think drinking

153
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,690
black coffee makes them cool?

154
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,420
We don't. We are cool,

155
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,420
so we drink black coffee.

156
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
Is that my dad?

157
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,830
I do have one final question.

158
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,830
Yes?

159
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,000
How you feeling?

160
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,930
Second trimester,

161
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,930
and a lot better.

162
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,930
Thank you.

163
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,840
You look fantastic.

164
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,840
Hey, Dad.

165
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,470
Thank you.

166
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,470
Connor, hello.

167
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,010
Hello, Dr. Bekker.

168
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,650
You are a little far

169
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,650
from your office, aren't you?

170
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,810
Didn't you hear?

171
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,250
I have a seat

172
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,250
on the board now.

173
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,350
I guess we'll be seeing

174
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,350
more of each other.

175
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,290
Great.

176
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,890
Hey, Ms. Garrett.

177
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,790
Yes?

178
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,330
Can you tell me why

179
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,330
my father has a seat

180
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,330
on the hospital board?

181
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,170
Well, it's the least

182
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,170
we can do after

183
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,170
he donated all that money.

184
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,440
The money for...

185
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,070
Wait.

186
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,710
Is he the principal donor

187
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,710
for the Hybrid OR?

188
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,250
Nice having a rich dad.

189
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,060
Unbelievable.

190
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,920
He is always trying

191
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,920
to undercut me,

192
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,090
trying to have some kind

193
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,090
of power over me.

194
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,090
Um...

195
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,490
Wait a second, did you know?

196
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,070
You knew

197
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,070
and you didn't tell me.

198
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,670
So instead, you lie to me,

199
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,670
to my face for weeks?

200
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,070
I didn't lie.

201
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,070
I just didn't mention it.

202
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,440
No, Ava, that is a lie.

203
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,570
That's great.

204
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,110
Thank you very much.

205
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,020
Your wife was admitted

206
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,020
to the ED at 7:12 a.m.

207
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,210
Her blood pressure was 104/62,

208
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,210
heart rate 87.

209
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,190
Dr. Manning, you're going

210
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,190
to Treatment 3.

211
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,320
Monique, go with her.

212
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,430
Claire Burton, ran her bike

213
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,430
into a car on Michigan Avenue.

214
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,590
Vitals stable.

215
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,830
Can't get any answers

216
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,830
out of her,

217
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,370
but she definitely

218
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,370
looks pregnant.

219
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,010
Claire, I'm Dr. Manning.

220
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,010
Do you remember me?

221
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,670
I used to eat

222
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,670
a lot of carrots...

223
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,670
Dr. Charles.

224
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,210
...but, you know, they don't

225
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,210
really help your eyes.

226
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,210
I don't really

227
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,210
need them anyway...

228
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,010
She manic?

229
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,010
Yes, bipolar.

230
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,140
I treated her a few months ago

231
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,140
for morning sickness.

232
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,380
All right,

233
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,380
let's move her on my count.

234
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,380
Ready, one, two, three.

235
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,510
Anybody we should call?

236
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,510
Oh, my gosh.

237
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,420
As far as I know,

238
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,420
boyfriend's out

239
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,420
of the picture.

240
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,690
Sometimes, if I look at

241
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,690
something for too long,

242
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,730
I feel like all that energy

243
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,730
is gonna turn into a laser

244
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,130
and just burn a hole right

245
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,130
though whatever it is

246
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,130
that I'm looking at.

247
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,220
I heal a lot faster

248
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,220
than others...

249
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,530
Claire, does it hurt anywhere?

250
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,900
Two Haldol, please.

251
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,030
A lot of times I try

252
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,030
not to look at anything

253
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,030
but myself.

254
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,570
Claire, Claire, can you

255
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,570
tell me if anything hurts?

256
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,940
Every single molecule

257
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,940
on my skin is something...

258
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,200
She'll calm down

259
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,200
in a couple of minutes.

260
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,540
I'm right outside.

261
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,540
Okay, thank you.

262
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,740
...and I just heal.

263
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,540
Does anybody know

264
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,540
what happened to my bike?

265
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,280
This, it's just

266
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,280
a little bit of a cut.

267
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,480
Maybe, I could just

268
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,480
get my bike and go.

269
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,490
What are you doing?

270
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,490
Ray's gonna be here

271
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,490
any minute.

272
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,390
Our tail has him

273
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,390
seven minutes out.

274
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,460
You need to call off the MRI.

275
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,660
What are you talking about?

276
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,170
That bridge game is the summit

277
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,170
between Ray and his crew

278
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,170
that we've been waiting for.

279
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,300
This is where he's going

280
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,300
to incriminate himself.

281
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,600
So I'll do one test

282
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,600
and send him home.

283
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,410
Listen, you work for us,

284
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,410
and I am telling you

285
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,410
to call it off.

286
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,350
I work for the hospital,

287
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,350
and he needs an MRI,

288
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,350
so he's gonna get one.

289
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,780
We can make your life

290
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,780
very hard.

291
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,350
Make sure you get him home

292
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,350
for that meeting.

293
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,430
What's going on?

294
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,530
I just got a weird vibe

295
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,530
from Dr. Choi's patient.

296
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,980
I'll check it out.

297
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,980
Yeah.

298
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,210
O2 sats, 86%.

299
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,140
You need my help?

300
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,210
No.

301
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,190
We're fine in here, thanks.

302
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,110
All right.

303
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,220
Yeah, something's up.

304
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,990
Ethan wouldn't even

305
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,990
let me in the room.

306
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,660
Okay, I'll call security

307
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,660
and have them

308
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,660
keep an eye on them.

309
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,260
Derek Glenn, 35, MVC,

310
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,260
BP 110/60,

311
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,740
heart rate's 120,

312
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,740
left upper quadrant pain.

313
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,740
Why the hell is he in my OR?

314
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,740
It's not a treatment room.

315
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,870
I was told to park him here

316
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,870
because all the other rooms

317
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,870
are full.

318
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,640
All right.

319
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,640
Let's get an ultrasound.

320
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,110
Hey there, Derek.

321
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,180
Can you tell me

322
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,180
where it hurts?

323
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,390
Right here.

324
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,390
All right.

325
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,690
Is there anyone

326
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,690
you need us to call?

327
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,690
Already called my wife.

328
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,750
Good.

329
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,260
Well, it looks like

330
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,260
you've got some free fluid

331
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,260
around your spleen.

332
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,670
That usually indicates

333
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,670
a small tear,

334
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,470
which we do sometimes see

335
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,470
with blunt trauma.

336
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,670
Now, the good news is

337
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,670
90% of these bleeds

338
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,670
stop on their own.

339
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,980
So for now, I'd just like

340
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,980
to get a scan to confirm,

341
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,580
and then we'll keep

342
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,580
a close eye on you to make

343
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,580
sure that you're stable.

344
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,320
That sound okay?

345
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,320
Yeah, sure.

346
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,380
Good.

347
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,020
Let's get him a CBC, CMP,

348
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,020
coag panel,

349
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,930
type and cross

350
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,930
four units of blood,

351
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,930
and set him up for a CT.

352
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,170
We will get you all set up,

353
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,170
and then I'll be back

354
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,170
to check in on you soon, okay?

355
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,640
Look, about this morning...

356
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,640
I don't want to hear it.

357
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,040
So what if your father's

358
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,040
the main donor?

359
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,840
This Hybrid Room

360
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,840
has been a godsend.

361
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,970
That's not the point.

362
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,710
You're saving lives with it.

363
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,710
Who cares where

364
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,710
the money came from?

365
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,550
I do, and you should know me

366
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,550
well enough to know

367
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,820
that I don't want

368
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,820
to be beholden to my father.

369
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,790
Connor...

370
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,790
You should have told me.

371
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,330
How many more damn papers

372
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,330
do I got to sign?

373
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,430
That's it.

374
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,430
We're gonna get this

375
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,430
done right now.

376
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,490
About time.

377
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,900
Let's get this done

378
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,900
fast, okay?

379
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,210
It's a head MRI.

380
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,210
It takes as long

381
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,210
as it takes.

382
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,480
Let's lay you down.

383
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,340
All right.

384
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,850
Ray, I got to see

385
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,850
some more patients,

386
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,250
but I'll be back

387
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,250
before you're done.

388
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,310
Yeah.

389
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,690
What was her normal dose

390
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,690
of Quetiapine?

391
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,030
It was 800 milligrams,

392
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,030
but I cut it in half

393
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,030
to be safe for the baby.

394
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,730
Huh. That might explain

395
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,730
the onset of the mania.

396
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,770
Well, the standard of care

397
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,770
is to cut the dose in half.

398
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,640
There's actually been

399
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,640
some new research,

400
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,140
a couple of new papers,

401
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,140
both suggesting...

402
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,150
Dr. Charles,

403
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,150
I can't keep up with

404
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,150
every psychiatric journal.

405
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,680
Of course you can't.

406
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,110
And more,

407
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,110
I didn't have a choice.

408
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,110
I did what I had to do.

409
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,840
Dr. Manning.

410
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,210
What's wrong?

411
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,890
Your placenta

412
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,890
must have abrupted

413
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,890
from the accident.

414
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,260
Call OB, we need to get her

415
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,260
upstairs for a delivery.

416
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,060
Delivery, did something happen

417
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,060
to my baby?

418
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,930
Is he gonna be okay?

419
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,930
What's wrong with my baby?

420
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,030
Everything's gonna be fine.

421
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,030
Let's get you upstairs,

422
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,870
and then we'll figure out

423
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,870
what happens next, okay?

424
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,240
Are you sure

425
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,240
I didn't hurt the baby?

426
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,770
Are you sure?

427
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,770
What if I hurt it?

428
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,210
Your wife was given

429
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,210
antihistamine, steroids

430
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,210
and epinephrine,

431
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,180
but progressed

432
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,180
to cardiac arrest.

433
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,810
I performed CPR with ACLS

434
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,810
for 35 minutes,

435
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,680
but she never

436
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,680
regained circulation.

437
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,830
And at 9:17,

438
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,830
she was pronounced dead.

439
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,830
Mr. Patrick,

440
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,360
I assure you,

441
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,360
we did everything we could.

442
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,890
No.

443
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,460
I can only imagine

444
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,460
the pain you felt.

445
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,940
She couldn't breathe.

446
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,210
Do you know what's that like?

447
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,140
I want you to know

448
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,140
how it feels.

449
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,880
This is your...

450
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,880
Mr. Patrick!

451
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,320
There's a toxic spill.

452
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,320
Evacuate the ED now!

453
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,220
Code Orange!

454
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,220
Everyone, out, right now.

455
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,050
Get your patients out

456
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,050
right now!

457
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,390
Code Orange!

458
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,900
Get out! Everybody, out!

459
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,900
Go, move!

460
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,220
This is Maggie Lockwood.

461
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,600
Toxic exposure in the ED.

462
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,600
I repeat,

463
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,600
toxic exposure in the ED.

464
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,790
Get the hospital

465
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,790
on bypass right now.

466
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,860
Start the internal

467
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,860
disaster protocol.

468
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,570
Everyone, out now! Move, move!

469
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,730
Dr. Rhodes.

470
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,880
Ava, get me a gurney.

471
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,500
They're all in use.

472
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,520
What's going on?

473
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,520
Toxic spill.

474
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,740
We need

475
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,740
to get you out of here.

476
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,610
No, that's too dangerous.

477
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,320
What are you doing?

478
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,230
This room has

479
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,230
positive pressure ventilation.

480
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,850
We're safe as long

481
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,850
as we stay in here.

482
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,990
What happened?

483
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,540
Why did we stop?

484
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,540
What's going on?

485
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,540
I don't know.

486
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,860
Move! Move! Move!

487
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,860
Everybody, out!

488
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,490
Moving out the truck!

489
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,210
Head trauma, GCS 9.

490
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,840
We just got her,

491
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,840
so she needs a full trauma

492
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,840
workup when you land.

493
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,840
35% TBSA second

494
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,840
and third-degree burns.

495
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,220
Take him straight

496
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,220
to the burn center.

497
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,990
Maggie?

498
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,990
Yeah.

499
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,490
Have you seen Natalie?

500
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,490
Don't worry.

501
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,320
I saw her take a patient

502
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,320
upstairs before the spill.

503
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,730
Dr. Choi.

504
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,960
You need to sit down.

505
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,960
I'm okay.

506
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,730
But we have more patients

507
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,730
in ambulances,

508
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,000
so we need to triage into red,

509
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,000
yellow and green,

510
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,270
and get the sickest ones off

511
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,270
in the first wave.

512
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,670
Make sure

513
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,670
everyone's showered

514
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,670
and deconned.

515
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,370
You got it.

516
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,960
How long till you can detox

517
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,960
my ED?

518
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,490
Depends on the floor plan,

519
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,490
ventilation, size of spill.

520
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm sending Squad in now.

521
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,120
Soon as they

522
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,120
get us the samples,

523
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,130
we'll take them down

524
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,130
to the lab and try

525
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,130
and ID the toxin.

526
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,670
And what about Mr. Patrick?

527
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,970
We're looking into him now.

528
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,970
Background, employment,

529
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,970
family,

530
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,060
anything that'll give us

531
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,060
a lead.

532
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,170
We already have

533
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,170
12 hospital staff and patients

534
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,170
in respiratory distress.

535
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,210
We need to figure this out,

536
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,210
and fast.

537
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,270
Got it.

538
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,150
Easy, easy, easy.

539
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,990
Okay?

540
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,990
Yeah.

541
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,350
Why are we here?

542
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,350
What is this place?

543
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,520
Uh... Orthopedics.

544
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,520
They're renovating

545
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,520
the rehab floor.

546
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,530
I'm supposed to have my baby.

547
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,530
You said I was bleeding.

548
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,330
Emergency exits are locked.

549
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,400
I was thinking maybe

550
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,400
a Code Orange.

551
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,160
Would explain why

552
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,160
the elevators were down.

553
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,570
Oh, there's a lot more blood,

554
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,570
a lot more blood.

555
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,440
Her bleeding's much worse.

556
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,440
Call Labor and Delivery.

557
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,170
Worse?

558
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,170
What does that mean?

559
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,170
Is my baby dying?

560
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,210
No. We need to lay you down,

561
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,210
okay? Come on.

562
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,470
He's dying, isn't he?

563
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,470
My baby's dying.

564
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,470
Come on.

565
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,880
No, he's not.

566
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,880
Come on, let's lay you down.

567
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,470
Just lay down right here.

568
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,050
You're all right.

569
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,050
There you go.

570
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,750
Dr. Charles.

571
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,690
There's no signal.

572
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,690
I can't find a signal.

573
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,280
Oh, my God. I killed him.

574
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,020
Just stay right there, okay?

575
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,100
We have to figure out a way

576
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,100
to break open these doors.

577
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,290
We need to get her upstairs.

578
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,560
Natalie, we're not

579
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,560
getting through those doors.

580
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,970
We're gonna have to do

581
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,970
a C-section.

582
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,370
This is all my fault.

583
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,370
I killed my baby.

584
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,150
His pressure's dropping.

585
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,150
Derek, are you feeling dizzy?

586
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,750
A little. What does that mean?

587
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,750
That means

588
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,750
you're still bleeding.

589
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,690
The tear in your spleen

590
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,690
isn't clotting like I'd hoped.

591
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,420
He's got

592
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,420
a lot more free fluid.

593
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,860
Hey! Hey!

594
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,360
Cruz!

595
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,800
I need to get

596
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,800
this patient upstairs.

597
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,970
Sorry, Doc, I can't open

598
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,970
these doors until we get

599
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,970
the place clear.

600
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,630
Just to get a couple units

601
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,630
from the blood bank.

602
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,840
Even if I wanted to,

603
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,840
all of the stairs

604
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,840
are locked down

605
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,140
so the gas can't spread.

606
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,340
Emergency exits, everything.

607
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,340
We'll get you out

608
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,340
as soon as possible.

609
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,440
All right.

610
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,780
We need to keep

611
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,780
his pressure up

612
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,780
until they get us out of here.

613
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,010
I'll hang a bag of saline.

614
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,010
I got it.

615
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,060
April, we need

616
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,060
more oxygen masks.

617
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,890
Fire brought out

618
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,890
everything they could find.

619
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,760
All right, see how many

620
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,760
nasal cannulas we have.

621
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,430
The worst patients can always

622
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,430
double up.

623
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,630
Ethan, you need to sit down.

624
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,770
I'm okay. I'm fine.

625
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,770
I'll be okay. Don't worry.

626
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,140
Okay, you let this nurse know

627
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,200
if you feel any nausea,

628
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,200
dizziness or problems

629
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,200
with your vision, okay?

630
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,270
Hey, Will!

631
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,890
Where's our dad?

632
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,890
He's safe.

633
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,890
He's still upstairs.

634
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,320
Then go and get him

635
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,320
out of there.

636
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,320
I can't.

637
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,090
They've locked down

638
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,090
the entire hospital.

639
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,220
You're a doctor.

640
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,270
You go find whoever's got

641
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,270
the key and you get him

642
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,270
the hell out.

643
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,400
Look, guys,

644
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,400
I'm sorry, but it just

645
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,400
doesn't work like that.

646
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,000
Will, you said

647
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,000
it'll only take

648
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,000
an hour.

649
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,730
Yeah, and it should have,

650
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,730
but we're having an emergency.

651
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,800
Dr. Halstead!

652
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,940
Guys, I got to go.

653
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,940
Ethan! Ethan, breathe.

654
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,000
Ethan!

655
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,480
Talk to me, Ethan.

656
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,780
Talk to me.

657
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,780
Get him on O2!

658
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,290
Mask!

659
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,290
Here you go.

660
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,650
Ethan.

661
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,620
Ethan.

662
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,620
Hang in there, Ethan.

663
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,230
How's he doing?

664
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,230
Not good.

665
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,170
We'll get him through this.

666
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,030
He was trying to keep me safe.

667
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,950
Back there in the ED.

668
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,950
That's why he didn't let me

669
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,950
in the room.

670
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,110
Yeah.

671
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,590
I've never done a C-section.

672
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,590
I haven't even seen one

673
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,590
in years.

674
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,650
We're gonna figure it out.

675
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,590
But we don't have any

676
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,590
instruments or emergency

677
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,590
supplies or pain meds.

678
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,430
There's got to still be some

679
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,430
supplies on this floor.

680
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,730
What if we just held pressure?

681
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,430
I mean, whatever's happening

682
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,430
in the hospital right now

683
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,430
can't last forever.

684
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,530
We have to do this now.

685
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,530
We don't have a choice.

686
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,600
Listen, whatever doubts

687
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,600
you may or may not have

688
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,410
about your previous treatment

689
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,410
of this patient...

690
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,570
I led her to believe

691
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,570
that she could go through

692
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,570
with this pregnancy.

693
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,180
She can't take care of a baby.

694
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,180
She can't even take care

695
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,180
of herself.

696
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,880
You were in a very

697
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,880
difficult situation...

698
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,820
If I operate on her in this

699
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,820
hallway and she dies,

700
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,820
that's my fault.

701
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,110
Okay.

702
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,050
Okay, look. Um...

703
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,470
I am going to find a signal

704
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,470
and get an ob-gyn

705
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,470
on the phone.

706
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,260
But no one can get down here.

707
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,600
No, no, so she can talk us

708
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,600
through it on the phone.

709
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,600
Together.

710
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,130
Okay?

711
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,240
Please tell me

712
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,240
you found something.

713
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,680
Jacob Patrick is an engineer

714
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,680
at a textile factory.

715
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,150
He has access

716
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,150
to numerous industrial toxins.

717
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,780
We're hoping to have it

718
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,780
narrowed down soon.

719
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,260
Please keep me posted.

720
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,260
I will.

721
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,230
You can't be serious!

722
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,930
Until an ambulance shows up

723
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,930
with more,

724
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,930
there's nothing we can do.

725
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,490
What's going on?

726
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,270
Ethan and Mr. Patrick

727
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,270
and both in bronchospasm

728
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,270
and in need of racemic epi.

729
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,740
The problem is

730
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,740
there's only one dose left.

731
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,110
Which, obviously,

732
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,110
we should give to Ethan.

733
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,980
Who's doing worse?

734
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,910
That's the thing,

735
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,910
Mr. Patrick is.

736
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,620
You're not really thinking

737
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,620
of giving it to him?

738
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,450
I'm following protocol, April.

739
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,010
Whichever patient

740
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,010
has the greatest need

741
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,010
gets treated first.

742
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,150
He came here

743
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,150
on a suicide mission.

744
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,390
I'm sorry.

745
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,560
Give Mr. Patrick the epi.

746
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,160
This is wrong.

747
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,140
What's happening?

748
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,480
The bleed isn't stopping.

749
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,160
I'll hang some Ringer's.

750
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,300
I'm gonna embolize it.

751
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,300
What?

752
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,310
We're just putting a wire

753
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,310
into his groin.

754
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,310
It's a simple procedure.

755
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,070
Not without nurses or techs,

756
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,070
let alone anesthesia.

757
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,510
No, we can twilight him

758
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,510
with Versed.

759
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,970
Look, we don't have a choice.

760
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,340
We need to close off

761
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,340
the vessel,

762
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,350
and frankly,

763
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,350
I'm not interested

764
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,350
in your opinion.

765
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,550
All right,

766
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,550
the guys inside checked.

767
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,060
They can't find any more doses

768
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,060
of racemic epi.

769
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,560
We have to do something.

770
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,560
His airway's almost closed.

771
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,590
I mean, we could try

772
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,590
methylprednisolone.

773
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,630
It's not great,

774
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,630
but it's better than nothing.

775
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,130
Okay, where can I find it?

776
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,130
In the respiratory

777
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,130
therapist carts.

778
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,070
All right,

779
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,070
what does that cart look like?

780
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,260
We're wasting time.

781
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,900
April!

782
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,900
Hey, you can't go in there!

783
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,590
Give it to him now.

784
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,320
That was incredibly stupid.

785
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,770
Let's hope this works.

786
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,580
All right, come on.

787
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,580
Let's get you decontaminated.

788
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,990
Do you have reception?

789
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,860
I've got one bar.

790
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,860
It's ringing.

791
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,830
I'm not cutting

792
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,830
until you get someone.

793
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,230
Cutting melon,

794
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,230
cutting chicken,

795
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,230
cutting me, cut the baby.

796
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,730
No one's gonna hurt the baby,

797
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,730
Claire.

798
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,770
Her Haldol's wearing off.

799
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,770
Is someone answering?

800
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,370
Uh, yes, this is Dr. Charles.

801
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,850
I need an OB immediately

802
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,850
to talk me through

803
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,850
an emergency C-section.

804
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,580
They're getting Dr. Grant.

805
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,180
Come here and put her

806
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,180
on speaker.

807
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,480
I can't.

808
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,480
I'll lose the call.

809
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,480
I'll drop the call.

810
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,850
Dr. Grant, thank God.

811
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,220
I have a woman, 36 weeks,

812
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,220
abrupted placenta,

813
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,430
already lost a couple units

814
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,430
of blood.

815
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,990
Some lidocaine,

816
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,990
which we've administered.

817
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,760
A scalpel and a few clamps.

818
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,760
Okay, okay, here we go.

819
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,650
Dr. Grant says to start

820
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,650
the incision three centimeters

821
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,650
below the umbilicus.

822
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,610
Okay, here we go.

823
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,800
Come on.

824
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,970
Come on.

825
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,270
Damn it.

826
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,270
The pressure's still dropping.

827
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,810
I can't get the wire in there.

828
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,980
The anatomy's too challenging.

829
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,480
Hang 500 of albumin.

830
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,710
We'll hold pressure

831
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,710
until we can

832
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,710
get him out of here.

833
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,990
He won't make it that long.

834
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,990
There's nothing else

835
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,990
we can do.

836
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,720
We can remove his spleen.

837
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,720
We can't open him up.

838
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,030
He'll lose too much blood,

839
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,030
and we don't have

840
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,030
any to give him.

841
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,930
I'm a universal donor.

842
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,100
That's insane.

843
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,100
The surgery

844
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,100
will take too long.

845
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,430
Well, then do it faster.

846
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,240
Ava, what are you

847
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,240
trying to prove?

848
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,240
I'm trying to save his life.

849
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,900
If you do this,

850
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,900
you both are gonna bleed out

851
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,900
before I'm done.

852
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,250
Unless you have a better idea,

853
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,250
I suggest you stop making

854
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,250
excuses and get started.

855
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,720
How's your breathing?

856
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,330
Good? All right.

857
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,330
Will.

858
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,990
Be right back.

859
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,360
Congratulations.

860
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,130
They called off Ray's meeting.

861
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,130
You screwed it up.

862
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,970
He was sick.

863
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,970
What was I supposed

864
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,970
to do?

865
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,730
What I told you to do,

866
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,730
stay out of the way.

867
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,670
I didn't know

868
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,670
there was gonna be

869
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,670
a toxic spill, Jay.

870
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,140
This is why

871
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,140
we don't take chances,

872
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,140
and you needed to listen.

873
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,580
He could have had a stroke.

874
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,580
I wasn't gonna let him die.

875
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,810
I took an oath.

876
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,690
PD's narrowed down

877
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,690
the possible toxins.

878
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,600
We hope to have

879
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,600
an answer soon.

880
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,330
Look, I understand

881
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,330
you're upset, April.

882
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,500
Ethan is dying,

883
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,500
and you didn't fight for him.

884
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,840
I did what I was obligated

885
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,840
to do,

886
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,370
and Dr. Choi would have done

887
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,370
the same thing.

888
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,130
Can you see

889
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,130
the splenic artery?

890
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,130
Not yet.

891
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,830
I'm still getting through

892
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,830
the mesenteric fat.

893
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,200
Just keep going.

894
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,740
Ava, you've probably given

895
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,740
a pint by now.

896
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,100
I'm doing fine.

897
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,370
You're gonna run out of blood

898
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,370
before we even get there.

899
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,610
If I stop transfusing now,

900
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,610
he'll die.

901
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,250
This is crazy.

902
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,960
Okay, tell Dr. Grant

903
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,960
I'm through the uterine wall

904
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,090
and ready to deliver.

905
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,730
Through the wall.

906
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,730
It's a baby. Through the wall.

907
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,090
Yeah, she's through

908
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,090
the uterine wall.

909
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,360
Hold on.

910
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,360
The placenta's in the way.

911
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,360
I can't see the head.

912
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:54,210
Ask Dr. Grant if I should

913
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:54,210
extend the incision

914
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:54,210
or reach through the placenta.

915
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,610
Well, can you reach around it?

916
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,610
Is there any room?

917
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,700
Ask Dr. Grant.

918
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,640
Yes, Dr. Grant,

919
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,640
Dr. Manning

920
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,640
wants to know

921
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,780
if she should extend

922
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,780
the incision or go through

923
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,780
the placenta?

924
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,580
Dr. Grant says

925
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,580
that she totally

926
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,580
trusts you to make that call.

927
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,650
No, she needs to tell me

928
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,650
which way to go.

929
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,320
Make the call, Manning.

930
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,320
Manning, make the call.

931
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,760
Dr. Grant says that without

932
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,760
being there to assess

933
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,760
the position of the placenta,

934
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,930
there's no way

935
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,930
that she can make

936
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,930
that determination.

937
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,260
You need to decide.

938
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,540
I'm going through

939
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,540
the placenta.

940
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,240
Hold on, it's too high.

941
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,680
I need you to come over here

942
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,680
and push down on it.

943
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,120
Here?

944
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,120
Yeah, I think so.

945
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,490
Okay, I'm sorry,

946
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,490
but you're gonna feel this.

947
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,560
Get out of me! Help!

948
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,320
Did you get the baby?

949
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,320
No.

950
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,230
Maybe I should do

951
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,230
the incision.

952
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,530
Stop! Get off me! Stop!

953
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,870
Okay, okay, Hold on.

954
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,930
How about now?

955
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,530
Yeah, okay. I think...

956
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah, there it is.

957
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,700
Okay, push again. Push again.

958
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,910
Get off me!

959
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,050
I got it.

960
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,820
The baby...

961
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,450
Push. Push. I got it.

962
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,450
I got him.

963
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,990
Keep pushing.

964
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,990
How's the baby?

965
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,050
I got it.

966
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,260
How's the baby?

967
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,360
He's not breathing.

968
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,430
His trachea's blocked

969
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,430
with secretions.

970
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,840
What do you need?

971
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,840
An aspirator.

972
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,270
Something to get

973
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,270
the secretions out.

974
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,810
All I got is IV tubing.

975
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,810
Give it to me.

976
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,690
He's okay.

977
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,990
You did it.

978
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,820
Yeah.

979
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,800
Baby greens,

980
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,800
baby carrots, baby teeth...

981
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,400
Baby single parents,

982
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,400
baby teeth,

983
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,170
baby blankets, warm blankets,

984
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,170
fuzzy blankets.

985
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,680
The artery's almost impossible

986
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,680
to get to.

987
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,580
You okay?

988
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,580
Yeah.

989
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,860
Ava.

990
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,000
You need to sit down

991
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,000
before you pass out.

992
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,090
I'm okay.

993
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,570
Hey! Hey. Hey.

994
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,970
I'm not taking out the tube

995
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,970
till you're done.

996
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,140
All right, stay with me

997
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,140
just a little bit longer,

998
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,140
okay?

999
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,580
Hold on for me. Stay with me.

1000
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,380
And...

1001
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,420
All right. And...

1002
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,350
All right. We did it.

1003
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,050
Ava? Ava!

1004
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,830
Ava. Hey, Ava.

1005
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:03,920
Oh!

1006
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,660
Okay. Okay.

1007
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,030
There we go.

1008
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,940
Did we do it?

1009
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,830
Yeah.

1010
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,980
Yeah, we did it.

1011
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,580
Coming through.

1012
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,760
Any changes?

1013
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,060
Nothing.

1014
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,560
All right, keep him going.

1015
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,830
Word is we should have an ID

1016
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,830
on the toxin soon.

1017
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,240
He's in v-fib.

1018
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,740
April, start compressions.

1019
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,310
I need these cuffs off.

1020
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,310
Monique, charge to 200.

1021
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,680
Bag.

1022
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,720
Clear.

1023
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,760
Continue compressions.

1024
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,760
Charge again.

1025
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,260
Clear.

1026
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,870
Still no pulse.

1027
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,210
Charge again.

1028
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,580
Clear.

1029
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,490
Continue compressions?

1030
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,490
No, he's gone.

1031
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,130
Time of death, 12:12.

1032
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,590
They identified the toxin.

1033
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,930
It's cyanide.

1034
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,300
Oh, God.

1035
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,900
Ethan.

1036
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,110
Okay, let's go everyone.

1037
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,110
Let's go.

1038
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,280
We got the all clear.

1039
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,280
Let's get everyone inside.

1040
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,020
All affected staff,

1041
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,020
go to Trauma 2 and 3

1042
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,020
and we'll triage from there.

1043
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,350
Let's go.

1044
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,420
Give a dose to everyone

1045
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,420
who's affected.

1046
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,120
What is it?

1047
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,120
Hydroxocobalamin.

1048
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,760
It helps counteract

1049
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,760
the cyanide.

1050
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,800
I got the hydroxocobalamin.

1051
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,210
Think it'll work?

1052
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,710
As you know,

1053
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,710
there's no antidote

1054
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,710
to cyanide.

1055
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,610
But it's the best chance

1056
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,610
we got.

1057
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,600
Dr. Grant, how's Claire doing?

1058
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,630
She and the baby

1059
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,630
are both stable.

1060
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,430
You did a nice job.

1061
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,400
Well, I couldn't have done it

1062
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,400
without you.

1063
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,710
I don't follow.

1064
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,710
The phone call

1065
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,710
with Dr. Charles.

1066
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,150
Thank you for getting me

1067
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,150
through the C-section.

1068
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,940
I wasn't on any phone call.

1069
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,930
Dr. Charles, you lied to me.

1070
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,320
Yes, I did.

1071
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,270
You tricked me into doing

1072
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,270
a surgery that endangered

1073
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,270
both Claire and her baby.

1074
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,330
What you did was reckless

1075
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,330
and unprofessional.

1076
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,400
You had no right

1077
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,400
to manipulate me.

1078
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,310
Can I show you something?

1079
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,550
She looks good.

1080
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,320
Yeah.

1081
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,260
Meds kicked in.

1082
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,600
Listen, you were

1083
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,600
trying to solve

1084
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,600
a very tricky problem,

1085
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,900
and most doctors would have

1086
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,900
tried to talk her out

1087
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,900
of this pregnancy.

1088
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,310
But you, you saw the woman,

1089
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,310
not the mental illness.

1090
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,350
You have excellent instincts,

1091
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,350
Nat.

1092
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,980
Just gotta trust them.

1093
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,800
We've got a room

1094
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,800
for him in ICU.

1095
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,800
We're moving him upstairs.

1096
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,890
I'll make sure they call

1097
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,890
if anything changes.

1098
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:34,960
Thank you.

1099
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,230
Ms. Goodwin, you were right.

1100
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,230
He would have done

1101
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,230
the same thing.

1102
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,880
His pressure's going up.

1103
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,880
I think

1104
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,880
the medicine's working.

1105
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,610
All right,

1106
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,610
get him upstairs.

1107
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,420
Two units of PRBC are up.

1108
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,830
What happened?

1109
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,840
The surgery got

1110
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,840
a little complicated,

1111
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,840
but you're gonna be fine.

1112
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,700
In fact, your wife is waiting

1113
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,700
for you in the ICU.

1114
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,840
They're gonna get you up

1115
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,840
to her,

1116
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,970
and I'll be there to meet you

1117
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,970
in just a minute.

1118
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,150
Here you go.

1119
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,370
You know I hate peanuts.

1120
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,070
Well, as long as

1121
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,070
you're not allergic, right?

1122
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,170
What you did back there...

1123
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,100
You were incredible.

1124
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,110
Derek's alive because of you.

1125
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,020
So thank you.

1126
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,410
Wait.

1127
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,150
About your father...

1128
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,820
No, forget it, Ava.

1129
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,130
I had no right

1130
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,130
to get upset

1131
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,130
with you like that.

1132
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,390
I'm sorry.

1133
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,390
No, Connor.

1134
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:14,960
It was me.

1135
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,670
I was the one who asked

1136
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,670
your father to donate

1137
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,670
to the Hybrid Room.

1138
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,430
What, you?

1139
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,000
You were taking that job

1140
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,000
at the Mayo Clinic.

1141
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,770
I didn't want to lose you.

1142
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,270
Will, are you all right?

1143
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,440
That's blood.

1144
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,440
Were you exposed

1145
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,440
to the cyanide?

1146
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,710
Maybe.

1147
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,090
Let's get you back inside.

1148
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,090
Come on, let's go.

1149
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,430
April, the ICU just called.

1150
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,430
Dr. Choi's improving.

1151
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,490
Oh, thank God.

1152
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,660
Go on, go up there.

1153
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,660
I'll cover your patients.

1154
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,990
Okay.

1155
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,300
Hey, you know

1156
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,300
what I said earlier,

1157
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,000
about there being

1158
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,000
nothing left between us?

1159
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,770
I was wrong.

1160
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,770
I knew that.

1161
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,020
Hey, you're up.

1162
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,350
Yeah.

1163
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,760
So, it turns out

1164
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,760
it's not cyanide.

1165
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,290
It's an ulcer.

1166
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,500
Did you know

1167
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,500
this was happening?

1168
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,400
I had no idea.

1169
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,940
What is going on, Will?

1170
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,740
Are you stressed?

1171
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,580
No.

1172
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,580
Really?

1173
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,950
Because I have to say,

1174
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,950
you've not been

1175
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,950
yourself lately.

1176
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,450
Natalie, most ulcers

1177
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,450
are bacterial.

1178
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,460
They're not stress-related.

1179
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,460
I know that.

1180
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,290
With the way

1181
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,290
you've been acting,

1182
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,290
it's not...

1183
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,690
There's nothing going on.

1184
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,850
I'll go get your antibiotics.

1185
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,220
Thanks.

1186
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,220
Yeah.

1187
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,400
Is there something

1188
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,400
you're not telling me?

1189
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,140
No.

1190
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,640
Everything's fine.

1191
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,110
Okay.

1192
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,260
Vicki?

1193
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,430
Hey.

1194
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,720
I got a call

1195
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,720
from the hospital.

1196
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,980
Apparently,

1197
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,980
you haven't updated

1198
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,980
your emergency contact.

1199
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,380
Are you okay?

1200
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,520
I will be.

1201
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,390
Are you back in town?

1202
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,520
Couple of months now.

1203
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,330
I'm back at the VA.

1204
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,900
I should have called...

1205
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,900
It's okay.

1206
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,440
Glad to see you.

1207
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,210
So, how was Germany?

1208
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,380
It was good.

1209
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,320
I've had enough bratwurst

1210
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,320
to last me a lifetime,

1211
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,020
but my skiing has vastly

1212
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,020
improved, so...

1213
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,360
That's good.
