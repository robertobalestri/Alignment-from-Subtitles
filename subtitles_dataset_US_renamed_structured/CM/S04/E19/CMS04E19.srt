1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,670
Good morning.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,670
Hey.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,770
Saw you posted a picture

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,770
at Wine Fest. How was it?

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,880
Great until I got drunk off a

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,880
flight of Pinots from Oregon.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,080
Thought you didn't

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,080
care for Pinot.

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,080
Well, I don't, but Phillip...

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,680
Just thought I would try

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,680
something different.

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,920
Glad you had a good time.

13
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,920
Thanks.

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,990
Dr. Manning?

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,990
Yeah.

16
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,250
Treatment four.

17
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,590
Sixteen-year old female,

18
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,590
thirty-eight weeks pregnant.

19
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,960
Rear-ended

20
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,960
while she was driving.

21
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,860
Now, I cleared her C-spine

22
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,860
and she has labs brewing,

23
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,200
but I figured you could

24
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,200
check her cervix

25
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,200
before calling the OB.

26
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,700
Sure.

27
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,700
Great.

28
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,330
Lily? Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

29
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,040
I understand you're 38 weeks.

30
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,040
Are you family?

31
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,770
I'm her father, yes.

32
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,770
Joseph Cooper.

33
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,650
And this is Edie Thompson.

34
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,650
I'm not family exactly.

35
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,180
She's, uh...

36
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,180
She's adopting my baby.

37
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,680
Great. All right, well,

38
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,680
let's take a look.

39
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,260
Thanks.

40
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,630
Baby looks healthy

41
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,630
and the placenta looks good.

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,530
All right, Lily,

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,530
if it's okay with you,

44
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to ask

45
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,000
your dad and Edie

46
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,000
to step out of the room

47
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,400
while I check your cervix.

48
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,400
Okay.

49
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,840
We'll be right outside, honey.

50
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,840
Thank you.

51
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,010
All right, now you let me know

52
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,010
if anything's uncomfortable

53
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,510
or if you feel any pain, okay?

54
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,510
Mmm-hmm.

55
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,450
All right, if you could just

56
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,450
put your knees up

57
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,080
and then let them fall open.

58
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,080
Thank you.

59
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,180
All right, you ready?

60
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,380
You okay?

61
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,230
Everything okay?

62
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,230
Yeah, everything's fine.

63
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,630
I'm feeling that you're two

64
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,630
centimeters dilated

65
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,000
and seeing that you started

66
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,000
contractions.

67
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,730
What does that mean?

68
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,540
Oh, I think the car accident

69
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,540
caused you to start labor.

70
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,770
You've got to stop it.

71
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,770
I don't want to see the baby.

72
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,610
That's why I scheduled

73
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,610
a c-section.

74
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,050
I'm sorry, Lily,

75
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,050
but it doesn't work that way.

76
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,080
Um, you can't stop labor

77
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,080
once the baby is full term.

78
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,850
I just want to be

79
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,850
put to sleep and wake up

80
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,850
with it gone, okay?

81
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,910
I will call Labor and Delivery

82
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,910
and see what we can do, okay?

83
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,050
Now what's that

84
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,050
called again?

85
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,760
Turmeric latte

86
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,760
with macadamia nut milk.

87
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,700
Whatever happened

88
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,700
to just plain old coffee?

89
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,630
Okay, okay.

90
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,630
Now just a reminder.

91
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,070
According to our calendar,

92
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,230
next Wednesday we got that

93
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,230
appointment with a broker

94
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,710
to find you an apartment.

95
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,400
Danny, why are you talking

96
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,400
about something that's not

97
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,400
happening for a week?

98
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,610
Cece, this stuff is not gonna

99
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,610
take care of itself.

100
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,310
Yeah, but can't we just

101
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,310
visit with people?

102
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,580
We're visiting!

103
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,580
You know Dad likes to plan.

104
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,420
Yeah, I guess he never

105
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,420
read Be Here Now.

106
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,110
I'm here now.

107
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,990
Gwen, I want to be absolutely

108
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,990
clear on this, okay?

109
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,460
From what I am seeing,

110
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,190
this growth you keep

111
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,190
talking about is

112
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,190
virtually nonexistent.

113
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,660
I am confident we'll see

114
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,660
a marked increase

115
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,660
next quarter.

116
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,000
Next quarter?

117
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,900
That's what you said

118
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,900
last quarter.

119
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,740
Mr. Rhodes?

120
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,740
Dad? Dad, hey.

121
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,900
Hey, easy there. Easy.

122
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,840
Is everything all right?

123
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm fine.

124
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,980
Just give us a minute,

125
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,980
will you? Thank you.

126
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,410
Okay.

127
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,490
Your pulse is racing

128
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,490
and you can't catch

129
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,490
your breath.

130
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,220
Incompetence makes my blood

131
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,220
boil. What can I say?

132
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,560
You having chest pains?

133
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,560
No.

134
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,220
Really?

135
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,160
Dad, there is clearly

136
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,160
something going on

137
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,160
with your heart.

138
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,630
We should get you seen

139
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,630
by a cardiologist.

140
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,970
Well, that's not gonna

141
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,970
happen today. I've got

142
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,970
too much on my plate.

143
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,440
Just let me take

144
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,440
you to the ED.

145
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,840
I'll check you out myself.

146
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,070
It'll only take a couple

147
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,070
of minutes, I promise.

148
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,840
Connor, please. Just stop it,

149
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,840
all right? I'm absolute...

150
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,540
Ooh.

151
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,620
Hey. So, good news.

152
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,290
Dr. Patchefsky called

153
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,290
and she can schedule you

154
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,850
for a c-section today,

155
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,850
if you still wanna do that.

156
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,560
So that means the baby's

157
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,560
coming today?

158
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,560
Mmm-hmm.

159
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,830
Oh, that's... That's

160
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,830
incredible. I... I have to

161
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,830
text Howard.

162
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,260
Are you sure you're okay,

163
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,260
sweetie? I know this is a lot.

164
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm ready to get it

165
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,000
over with, Dad.

166
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,300
All right, well, we'll send

167
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,300
you upstairs as soon as a bed

168
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,300
becomes available, okay?

169
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,010
And where's Lily at?

170
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,010
Lily Cooper?

171
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,010
David, what are

172
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,010
you doing here?

173
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Hi, Jessie told me.

174
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Are you all right?

175
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,940
You need to leave.

176
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,940
It's okay, Dad.

177
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,590
I'm fine, but they say

178
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,590
the baby's coming out today.

179
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,120
It... It's happening now?

180
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,590
You better go, David.

181
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,590
That's right!

182
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,790
I'm ready to take care

183
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,790
of you and our baby.

184
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,100
You're telling me this now?

185
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,100
Yeah, you never

186
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,100
answer my calls.

187
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,760
All right, I get that

188
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,760
you're mad.

189
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,300
When you told me,

190
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,570
I'd just lost my job

191
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,570
and my mom was sick

192
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,570
and I freaked out.

193
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,400
But I got a good job

194
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,400
now, all right?

195
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,070
They're paying me

196
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,070
12 an hour at the...

197
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,980
At the tire and rim...

198
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,980
It's too late, David!

199
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,810
No, listen, listen, they're

200
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,810
giving me full-time hours.

201
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,510
That's enough!

202
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,510
You need to leave.

203
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,980
No, no. This isn't about me.

204
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,980
Maybe I should wait

205
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,980
in the lobby?

206
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,610
No, no. He's the one

207
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,610
who's leaving.

208
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,610
Hey, Maggie, call security?

209
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,120
Dad, stop! Please!

210
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,120
Don't touch me.

211
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,620
All right, I'm going to

212
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,620
need you to wait

213
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,620
in the lobby, okay?

214
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,990
But that... That's my baby!

215
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,290
Not anymore!

216
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,290
Security.

217
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,960
Wait, what does that mean?

218
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,860
What does that...

219
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,860
What does that mean? Lily?

220
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,270
I'm giving the baby up.

221
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,140
Did he talk you into this?

222
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,730
Hey, hey!

223
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,730
Hey, that's my kid!

224
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,830
You can't take... No, no!

225
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,830
You can't just take my kid.

226
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,670
Let's go, son.

227
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,670
Hey, hey!

228
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,510
Let's go, son.

229
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,510
I'm the father! I have a say!

230
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,440
Hey! Let go! Hey, no!

231
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,440
You can't take me from my kid!

232
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,420
That's my kid! Let go!

233
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,420
You can't do this!

234
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,140
David Novak?

235
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,270
Hi.

236
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,280
I'm Sharon Goodwin,

237
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,280
Director of Patient Services.

238
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,710
Why don't we have a seat?

239
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,010
I want to see Lily.

240
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,010
I understand that.

241
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,350
Hey, no, no, then tell this

242
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,350
rent-a-cop to back off.

243
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,860
I'm sorry but it's

244
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,860
hospital policy

245
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,480
to restrict access

246
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,480
only to those visitors

247
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,480
approved by our patients.

248
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,960
That's my baby she's having.

249
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,960
I don't have any rights?

250
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,290
According to

251
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,290
the adoption papers,

252
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,360
Lily is not certain

253
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,360
who the birth father is.

254
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,690
No, that's crazy.

255
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,970
All right, I'm... I'm the only

256
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,970
one she's ever been with.

257
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,370
All right, her dad is just

258
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,370
making her say that

259
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,410
so that he can give

260
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,410
this baby away.

261
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,980
How old are you, David?

262
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,980
Seventeen... And a half.

263
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,210
How did you and Lily meet?

264
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,210
How did we meet?

265
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,760
Well, I like to hear

266
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,760
those stories.

267
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,890
I saw her in...

268
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,890
In line at the cafeteria.

269
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,890
Oh, so you met at school.

270
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,460
Yeah, Marie Curie.

271
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,460
Archer Heights?

272
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,220
Well, let me...

273
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,220
Let me ask you,

274
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,870
is there anyone

275
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,870
that I can help you

276
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,870
with this situation?

277
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,370
A family member?

278
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,970
Maybe someone who can

279
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,970
speak to Lily's father?

280
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,510
No.

281
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,410
You know, technically,

282
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,410
I'm not supposed to do this,

283
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,390
but let me recommend a lawyer

284
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,390
for you, someone who

285
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,390
specializes in Family Law.

286
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,460
I just need to get to Lily

287
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,460
before my kid is born.

288
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,620
Can you... Can you help

289
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,620
me with that?

290
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,620
I'm sorry, David. I can't.

291
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,170
Hey, Maggie?

292
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,170
Yeah.

293
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,480
Can you see if you can

294
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,480
rustle up an EKG

295
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,480
and chest x-ray in two?

296
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,640
And have cardiology

297
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,640
come down to do a stat echo.

298
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,180
Sure thing.

299
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,180
Thank you.

300
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,680
You're examining your father?

301
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,680
Just a cursory

302
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,680
cardiac check-up.

303
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,950
Huh. A doctor shouldn't

304
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,950
be treating a close

305
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,950
family member,

306
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,790
especially one

307
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,790
with a fraught history.

308
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,800
Whatever you're doing, Ava,

309
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm not interested.

310
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,060
What I'm doing is rising above

311
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,060
any personal animus

312
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,070
I might have to help

313
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,070
a colleague.

314
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,300
Well, this colleague

315
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,300
doesn't need your help.

316
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,810
Thank you.

317
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,980
All right. Take a deep breath.

318
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,350
And exhale.

319
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,720
Saw you with your little

320
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,720
friend out there. What were

321
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,720
you two talking about?

322
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,190
Well, there's some fluid

323
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,190
in your lungs which explains

324
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,190
the shortness of breath.

325
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,830
And I'm picking up

326
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,830
a heart murmur.

327
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,830
I know about the murmur.

328
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,060
My GP told me about that

329
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,060
a long time ago.

330
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,400
You know what?

331
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,400
Excuse me. I'm done.

332
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,400
I'm gonna get dressed.

333
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,050
Fine. I will get started

334
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,050
on your discharge.

335
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,620
Tell me if this hurts,

336
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,620
okay, Joshua?

337
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,620
Okay.

338
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,120
His temperature was 102,

339
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,120
which didn't seem crazy to me

340
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,350
because he was already

341
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,350
home sick from school,

342
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,350
you know?

343
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,390
But I called his mom and she

344
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,390
said just take him to the ER.

345
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,860
Where is my mom?

346
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,860
She's on her way, buddy.

347
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,860
Okay? Don't worry.

348
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,770
I'm gonna need to

349
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,770
draw a little blood

350
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,770
from you, Joshua,

351
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,360
in order to run some tests.

352
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,360
Would that be okay? Great.

353
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,070
I'm just gonna go find one

354
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,070
of our super nice nurses

355
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,510
to help us out.

356
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,340
I'll be right back.

357
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,550
And my car key

358
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,550
is in the diaper bag.

359
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,310
Okay? All right.

360
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,310
Thanks.

361
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,550
Are you sure you can't come

362
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,550
upstairs while he gets his

363
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,550
shots?

364
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,350
I mean, Vincent's so much

365
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,350
calmer with you.

366
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,520
I gotta work, Emily.

367
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,520
He'll be fine.

368
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,360
Hey, Ethan.

369
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,360
Hey.

370
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
April, got a patient.

371
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,100
Okay, bye.

372
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,100
Bye.

373
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,960
Sorry I'm late.

374
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,900
What? Just say it.

375
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
You know better than anyone

376
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
my sister is trouble,

377
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,930
and yet here you are

378
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,930
letting her

379
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,930
take over your life.

380
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,510
I am helping out

381
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,510
a young mother who also

382
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,510
happens to be your sister.

383
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,380
Dr. Choi? I gotta make a phone

384
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,380
call. Is it okay if I step

385
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,380
outside for a second?

386
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,080
Sure, we'll keep

387
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,080
an eye on Joshua.

388
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,920
That kid in seven's been

389
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,920
battling a persistent fever.

390
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,430
I need a CBC, CMP

391
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,430
and some cultures, please.

392
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,120
All right.

393
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,320
And the baby looks good,

394
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,320
so we're gonna take you up

395
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,100
and get you prepped

396
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,100
for the c-section.

397
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,970
Are you ready?

398
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,970
I guess.

399
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,130
It's going to be fine.

400
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,130
Hey, Maggie, will you page OB

401
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,260
and tell them we're

402
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,260
on our way up?

403
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,830
Copy that.

404
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,830
Thanks.

405
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,470
David.

406
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,950
Don't worry, I'm gonna

407
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,950
take care of everything.

408
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,610
What are you doing?

409
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,280
Whoa. David, put that down.

410
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,120
You think I'm gonna

411
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,120
let you come in here

412
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,120
and steal my kid?

413
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,420
Dad, Dad, Dad, no. Dad, stop!

414
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,160
Security, code silver!

415
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,160
Active threat in the ED!

416
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,350
Dad! Dad!

417
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,650
Oh, my God.

418
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,650
David, no. David.

419
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,130
Drop your weapon!

420
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,040
Oh, my God.

421
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,980
Dad!

422
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,120
David!

423
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,520
No, no, no, no...

424
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,150
Dad!

425
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,460
Stop! Stop!

426
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,460
No, drop it! Drop it! Now!

427
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,690
Frank, listen to the man.

428
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,690
Listen to him.

429
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

430
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,760
I'm a doctor!

431
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,600
Let me just take a look.

432
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,600
Okay.

433
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,980
Don't move! Don't!

434
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,330
What's happening?

435
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,330
Was that a gun?

436
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,560
Shh. Stay quiet.

437
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,540
Just stay quiet.

438
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,930
Hey, hey, hey!

439
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,930
I said stop moving!

440
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,340
Dad!

441
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,340
Stop moving!

442
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,640
Dad, Dad, are you okay?

443
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,640
Please help my dad!

444
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,180
I'm a doctor. I can help.

445
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,180
Get... Get in there. Now.

446
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,180
This room here?

447
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,120
Yeah, yeah. Now, now.

448
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,120
Dad!

449
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,520
We need to help this man.

450
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,520
Daddy! Dad!

451
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,540
It wasn't my fault.

452
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,540
But you don't want him

453
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,540
to die, do you?

454
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,860
No. Help him, help him.

455
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,300
Okay.

456
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,300
Help him.

457
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,810
Lily?

458
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,810
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay.

459
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,870
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

460
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,870
Hey, hey, hey!

461
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,450
Hey! How do I lock the doors?

462
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,280
You need keys.

463
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,280
Get them!

464
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,390
Now! Now!

465
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,280
Easy, easy!

466
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,820
All right, lock

467
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,820
all the doors. Now!

468
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,500
Hey, they...

469
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,500
Hey, they can see me!

470
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,370
Hey, they can see

471
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,370
right through.

472
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,370
They're gonna shoot me!

473
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,160
All right.

474
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,400
Hey, you!

475
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,640
I have to cover the windows!

476
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,640
What do I use?

477
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,870
I don't know.

478
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,810
How about...

479
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,810
How about the sheets?

480
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,940
All right, you have

481
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,940
lots of those, right?

482
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,940
All right, do it. Now.

483
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,620
You... You help him.

484
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,590
Let's go.

485
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,400
Maggie, what's going on?

486
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,750
Hey, hey, kid. I need to get

487
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,750
this guy to a trauma room now.

488
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,480
Do you understand me?

489
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,780
Yeah, okay.

490
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,920
Maggie, I need

491
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,920
a backboard now.

492
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,920
Got it.

493
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,360
David, they're going

494
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,360
to need my help to lift him.

495
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,450
All right.

496
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,120
But right after, you're right

497
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,120
back where I can

498
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,120
see you, okay?

499
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,430
All right, keep

500
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,430
pressure on it.

501
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,430
I'll be right back.

502
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,430
Okay.

503
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,360
Come on, man.

504
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,540
All right, all right.

505
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,540
There we go.

506
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,650
Dad? Dad, are you okay?

507
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,050
Listen, I just want to get

508
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,050
my girlfriend and my baby

509
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,050
out of here.

510
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,760
I don't want to hurt

511
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,760
anybody else, but I will

512
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,760
if you get in my way.

513
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,330
Hey, you. Back where you were.

514
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,260
I got this.

515
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,570
How's he doing?

516
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,570
Not good, David.

517
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,500
He's bleeding

518
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,500
from inside his chest.

519
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,770
Well, it's his fault.

520
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,770
He grabbed the gun.

521
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,040
Breathe, breathe.

522
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,040
I don't care.

523
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,810
He needs to go

524
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,810
upstairs for surgery.

525
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,610
No. He stays here, all right?

526
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,750
He might not make it if you

527
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,750
don't let him go upstairs.

528
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,990
Okay, breathe, yeah.

529
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,850
You're a doctor.

530
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,850
Do something!

531
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,360
I need blood, plasma,

532
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,360
and platelets.

533
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,900
Now! Otherwise he dies.

534
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,870
Okay, what do I...

535
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,870
What do I do?

536
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,990
Pick up any one of those

537
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,990
phones and dial 911

538
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,990
and tell them who you are.

539
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,870
They'll find someone

540
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,870
for you to ask.

541
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,070
Now!

542
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,070
Okay.

543
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,050
He's got a pulmonary embolism.

544
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,670
So let East Mercy

545
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,670
know he's on a heparin drip

546
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,680
and monitor

547
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,680
his vitals closely.

548
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,680
Yes, Doctor.

549
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,320
Is this the last

550
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,320
of our emergency patients?

551
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,150
The last we could get out.

552
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,660
Miss Goodwin, the gunman

553
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,660
just called with a list

554
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,660
of supplies they need.

555
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,290
He's insisting

556
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,290
that you bring

557
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,290
the supplies in.

558
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,620
Me?

559
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,620
Yeah, he says you tried

560
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,620
to help him.

561
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,670
It seems he doesn't

562
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,670
trust anyone else.

563
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,570
You're completely dilated.

564
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,570
We have to deliver the baby.

565
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,070
No, I don't want

566
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,070
to push it out.

567
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,570
I know this isn't

568
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,570
how you wanted it to happen

569
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,270
but we cannot wait any longer.

570
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,340
Can't you just do

571
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,340
the c-section?

572
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,340
It's not safe to do it here.

573
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,350
I'm sorry, Lily,

574
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,350
but I need you

575
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,350
to deliver this baby.

576
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,550
Okay? I'll be right back.

577
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,950
Hey.

578
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,680
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

579
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,680
Hey, stay there.

580
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,880
What do you want?

581
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,880
Lily's about to deliver.

582
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,450
I just need you

583
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,450
to get me a precip pack.

584
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,450
It's for the delivery.

585
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,330
They're in the blue boxes

586
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,330
in the Pyxis.

587
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,060
Okay, just right over there.

588
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,060
You heard her.

589
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,060
You get it.

590
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,100
Go, now.

591
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,840
You get in there.

592
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,840
Go. Now, now.

593
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,040
Just breathe. It's okay.

594
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,040
You're okay, you're okay.

595
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,050
Just keep breathing.

596
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,050
You're doing great.

597
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,280
It's going to be okay,

598
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,280
Lily. I promise.

599
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,280
It's going to be okay.

600
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,380
You shot my dad.

601
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,220
Keep breathing, Lily.

602
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,590
It was an accident.

603
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,590
I swear... I swear it was.

604
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,960
But there's a doctor

605
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,960
looking at him...

606
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,970
There's a doctor looking

607
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,970
at him right now, all right?

608
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,270
And it... It's going to be

609
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,270
okay. I promise you.

610
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,270
He's going to be okay.

611
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,570
Dr. Manning is gonna need

612
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,570
another set of hands

613
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,570
to deliver your child.

614
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,940
Okay, yeah.

615
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,310
Help her, help her,

616
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,310
help her, help her, help her.

617
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,810
You've got this,

618
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,810
Lily. Keep breathing.

619
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,850
I just couldn't let him

620
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,850
take our baby like that, Lily.

621
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,580
I could... I couldn't do it.

622
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

623
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,620
Yeah, you're doing

624
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,620
great, Lily.

625
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,390
Just keep looking

626
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,390
at me, okay? Breathe.

627
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,390
Breathe with me, Lily.

628
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,430
We can raise

629
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,430
this kid together.

630
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,940
I know we can.

631
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,940
And I know that's

632
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,940
what you want too.

633
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,730
No. I just want my life

634
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,730
to go back to normal.

635
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,070
I wanna finish high school.

636
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,070
I wanna go to college.

637
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,610
No, no, no, no.

638
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,610
That's your dad

639
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,610
talking, all right?

640
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,440
And I'm gonna fix everything

641
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,440
as soon as we get out of here.

642
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,710
Hey.

643
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,350
Get back! Get back!

644
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,060
Hey, hey, get back!

645
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,490
You stay where

646
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,490
I can see you. All right?

647
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,120
You! You.

648
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,120
Get those cuffs. Now.

649
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,330
Don't move or I'll kill you.

650
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,230
Cuff him to that desk.

651
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,710
I want my mommy!

652
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,710
Take... Take care of that kid.

653
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,650
Baby, let's get you back

654
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,650
in the bed, come on!

655
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,890
Just get back

656
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,890
in the bed, okay?

657
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,720
Easy. Take it easy.

658
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Take down these curtains!

659
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,570
I will shoot the next person

660
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,570
that tries anything!

661
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,980
Sharon, please.

662
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,980
Let me switch places with you.

663
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,840
I... I have a tremendous

664
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,840
amount of experience

665
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,910
dealing with people

666
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,910
in David's emotional state.

667
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,210
It's what I'm trained to do.

668
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,910
Oh, well, I appreciate

669
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,910
it, Daniel,

670
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,960
but I think we should follow

671
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,960
David's instructions.

672
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,750
Okay, this is everything

673
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,750
on the list.

674
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,120
All right,

675
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,120
thank you, Monique.

676
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,530
Okay, listen, people who are

677
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,530
as desperate as he is,

678
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,330
they need to know

679
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,330
that there's a possibility

680
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,660
of a happy ending.

681
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,300
Daniel, I'm going to be okay.

682
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,630
I really want you

683
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,630
to be careful, okay?

684
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,040
I know.

685
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,040
Be careful.

686
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,540
I will.

687
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,540
Miss Goodwin.

688
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,310
I need to show you something

689
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,310
before you go in.

690
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,980
Now, the gunman has

691
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,980
blanketed the windows

692
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,880
to obscure our view,

693
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,880
but there is a small gap

694
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,890
that gives James

695
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,890
here a clean shot.

696
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,890
Now go ahead, have a look.

697
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,920
That's the kill zone.

698
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,230
Uh, look, I'd like to

699
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,230
get this resolved

700
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,230
without anyone else...

701
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,660
Getting hurt.

702
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,660
I understand.

703
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,760
But that young man

704
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,760
has already shot two people.

705
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,140
You walk him into that spot

706
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,140
and no one else gets hurt.

707
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,670
All right?

708
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,210
Good luck in there.

709
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,270
Open it!

710
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,140
Get in!

711
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,650
Keys, keys, keys.

712
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,650
David.

713
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,890
David, what are you

714
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,890
doing with the gun?

715
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,550
Just help me. Okay?

716
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,730
He's that way.

717
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,300
Come on.

718
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,040
Sharon?

719
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,570
All right, hang one to one to

720
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,570
one on the rapid transfuser

721
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,570
and keep going.

722
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,680
Do not let his

723
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,680
blood pressure drop.

724
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,680
Got it.

725
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,250
Do you know how the other

726
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,250
patients are doing?

727
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,690
My father's in two.

728
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,020
He's got something going on

729
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,020
with his heart.

730
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,260
Earl got hit by a bullet.

731
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,260
Ethan said he was going

732
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,260
to be okay.

733
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,420
And April's got

734
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,420
a sick kid in seven.

735
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,260
Chest tube auto

736
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,260
transfuser's full.

737
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,260
All right, run it back to him.

738
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,060
Got it.

739
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,060
How's he doing?

740
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,900
His heart rate will come down,

741
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,900
thanks to the blood,

742
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,340
but he's still hemorrhaging

743
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,340
into his chest.

744
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,740
If we don't get him upstairs

745
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,740
soon, we're gonna lose him.

746
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,570
Okay.

747
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,480
David, Lily's father is not

748
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,480
going to last much longer

749
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,480
down here.

750
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,250
But the doctor said he needed

751
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,250
blood and they got him blood.

752
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,850
He needs surgery and

753
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,850
a full trauma team

754
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,850
if he's going to survive.

755
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,130
Just Lily's dad. No one else.

756
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,360
But I've got

757
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,360
a very sick little boy

758
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,360
down there

759
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,200
and... And a man

760
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,200
with a bad heart.

761
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,170
They need to go too.

762
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,170
No.

763
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,770
Just Lily's dad,

764
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,770
and then we'll see.

765
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,780
Okay. Okay.

766
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,820
Dr. Rhodes, get your patient

767
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,820
ready to move out of the ED.

768
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,830
We're going to wheel him out.

769
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,830
Whoever's back there, back up!

770
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,890
All right.

771
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,160
Wait!

772
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,730
Hey, hey, hey! Back up!

773
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,730
I swear to God, I'll kill her.

774
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

775
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,140
I swear to God!

776
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,770
Lower your weapons!

777
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,750
Step back! We need to move

778
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,750
this patient through!

779
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,280
Back up! Back up!

780
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,280
Lower your weapons!

781
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,720
Back up now! Now!

782
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,720
Move, move, move, move, move.

783
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,220
Okay, grab this. Move, move!

784
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,220
Move, move, move!

785
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,950
Close it!

786
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,950
Close it now! Now!

787
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,360
You better not try

788
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,360
anything else!

789
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,360
David, please.

790
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,100
Let me talk to the police

791
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,100
for you, try to figure

792
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,100
a way out of this.

793
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,400
No!

794
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,400
Hey, I need a doctor in here.

795
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,970
This boy is not responding

796
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,970
to his medication.

797
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,480
I can't get his fever down.

798
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,310
David, please, just uncuff me,

799
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,310
so I can check on him.

800
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,980
Do you think I'm stupid?

801
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,980
Deal with the kid yourself.

802
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,720
Nat, fetal heart tones just

803
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,720
flipped to the other side.

804
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,160
I just felt something shift.

805
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,790
Does that mean

806
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,790
the baby's coming out?

807
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,030
Let me see.

808
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,730
The baby just went transverse.

809
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,960
Wait, what does that mean?

810
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,440
The baby's turned sideways

811
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,440
in her uterus.

812
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,740
She can't deliver like that.

813
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,740
So what happens now?

814
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,900
We need to move her upstairs.

815
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,540
No, you do it here.

816
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,740
Well, then I need you

817
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,740
to get me something

818
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,740
out of the Pyxis.

819
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,640
A medication, Terbutaline.

820
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,670
I'll get it.

821
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,120
Just look at me.

822
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,120
Look at me.

823
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,120
Breathe.

824
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,310
Good.

825
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,310
Are you gonna turn the baby?

826
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,090
Water hasn't broken yet,

827
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,950
and the Terbutaline

828
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,950
should soften her uterus.

829
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,150
She's in labor.

830
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,990
We could cause a placental

831
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,990
abruption or a prolapse.

832
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,090
Well, he's not giving me

833
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,090
any other choice.

834
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,600
All right, breathe, breathe,

835
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,600
breathe... Hey, look at me.

836
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,430
Breathe. That's good.

837
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,920
106 over 66. Heart rate's 122.

838
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,420
All right, let's give 10 of

839
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,420
Lasix and 12.5 of metoprolol

840
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,420
on an IV drip.

841
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,860
All right.

842
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,860
What is it?

843
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,020
I don't know, Dad.

844
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,020
But something's not right.

845
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,790
This is your fault!

846
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,460
I should have never let you

847
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,460
convince me to come here

848
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,460
in the first place.

849
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,160
If...

850
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
Dad?

851
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,070
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

852
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,410
He's not breathing.

853
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,410
Start bagging.

854
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,710
No pulse. He's in V-tach.

855
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,150
I need the paddles!

856
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,150
Sharon, we need you in here!

857
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,740
He's in cardiac arrest!

858
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,750
We need the paddles.

859
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,750
Okay.

860
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,590
Charge to 200.

861
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,590
Charged.

862
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,330
Clear.

863
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,260
No pulse. Milligram of epi.

864
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,840
Epi's in.

865
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,180
All right, I've got a pulse.

866
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,180
He's back in sinus rhythm.

867
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,120
Dad, Dad? Can you hear me?

868
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,860
All right.

869
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,860
I want to do an echo.

870
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,860
We need to figure out

871
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,860
what's going on.

872
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,790
Got you.

873
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,570
Okay, okay.

874
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,200
Okay. Okay, okay.

875
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,540
All right.

876
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,510
Hang in there, Joshua. Okay?

877
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,340
Ethan, I still can't get this

878
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,340
fever under control.

879
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,890
His BP's in the tank.

880
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,440
He just seized.

881
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,440
Almost aspirated himself.

882
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,920
Sounds like he's

883
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,920
in septic shock.

884
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,390
He needs more volume

885
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,390
and pressors to get

886
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,390
his pressure up.

887
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,980
You're gonna need to do

888
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,980
a central line right away.

889
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,430
I've never done one.

890
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,430
It'll be okay.

891
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,260
I'll walk you through it.

892
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,260
Okay.

893
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,090
That man needs

894
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,090
to be moved upstairs.

895
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,160
He just had a heart attack.

896
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,160
No. No, no, no, no!

897
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,330
Not after what

898
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,330
happened last time!

899
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,570
If he dies, they're going to

900
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,570
hold you responsible.

901
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,300
I didn't do anything

902
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,300
to hurt him!

903
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,070
It'll be the same

904
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,070
as if you had.

905
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,310
Look, David, I know you didn't

906
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,310
want any of this to happen,

907
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,010
and it's not too late

908
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,010
to walk it back.

909
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,050
They were taking

910
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,050
your child away.

911
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,250
That's something anyone

912
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,250
can understand.

913
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,250
Please let these people go.

914
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,050
No, no! Because then

915
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,050
I go to prison

916
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,530
and then my kid

917
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,530
is just gone forever!

918
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,820
Lily? Lily?

919
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,460
She's hypotensive.

920
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,460
What's that?

921
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,870
Her blood pressure's dropping.

922
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,870
She must be bleeding

923
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,870
from somewhere.

924
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,200
We are losing the baby.

925
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,200
Fix it!

926
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,970
We need to do a c-section

927
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,970
now or you're going to

928
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,970
lose them both.

929
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,870
Well, if either of them die,

930
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,870
I'm gonna kill you.

931
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,310
Hey!

932
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,410
Fix it!

933
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,140
Now!

934
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,880
He's got a hole

935
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,880
in his heart between

936
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,880
the left and right atria.

937
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,760
He's in heart failure.

938
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,930
Can you repair it?

939
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,930
Not here.

940
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,390
I need to get him upstairs.

941
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:52,000
No, don't do that.

942
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:52,000
Don't let me die.

943
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:52,000
No, Dad. I won't, Dad.

944
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,300
Dr. Rhodes?

945
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,300
Lily needs your help.

946
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,170
I'm not leaving my father.

947
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,610
Connor, I think

948
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,610
her uterus ruptured.

949
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,510
She needs immediate surgery

950
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,510
before she and the baby

951
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,510
bleed to death.

952
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,390
I will do the surgery

953
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,390
if you agree to transfer

954
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,390
my father upstairs.

955
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,120
No, you fix him here.

956
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,120
I can't!

957
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,060
He needs an operating room

958
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,060
with a bypass machine!

959
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,760
Operate on Lily

960
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,760
or I will kill you

961
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,760
right here.

962
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,130
You want to kill

963
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,130
the only person

964
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,130
who can save her?

965
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,730
I will

966
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,730
transfer his father.

967
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,570
And I give you my word,

968
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,570
I will not let SWAT in.

969
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,670
Please, David,

970
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,670
Lily and the baby

971
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,670
are losing valuable time.

972
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,720
David.

973
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,720
Okay.

974
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,590
Go.

975
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,030
All right.

976
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,760
Bring whatever blood we have

977
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,760
to the hybrid OR.

978
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,930
Prep her belly, scrub in.

979
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,930
I'm gonna need your help.

980
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,800
Daniel, I'm... I'm bringing

981
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,800
another patient out.

982
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,640
But it's getting out of hand

983
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,640
in here and I need you

984
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,640
to keep the SWAT back.

985
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,450
What's the status

986
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,450
on the target?

987
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,750
I haven't been able to get

988
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,750
a clean shot yet.

989
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,830
Can you contact them?

990
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,830
TOC, TOC, Commander.

991
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,870
I want that Bearcat G3 prepped

992
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,870
and ready for dynamic entry.

993
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,130
Over?

994
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,130
Copy that.

995
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,830
Yeah?

996
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,830
Sorry, Captain.

997
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,600
Just out of curiosity,

998
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,600
what is a... A Bearcat? A G3?

999
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,160
That's an armored vehicle.

1000
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,160
Kid's already unhinged.

1001
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,870
We don't want to do anything

1002
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,870
to make him think

1003
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,140
he's got to shoot

1004
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,140
his way out of there.

1005
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,940
Miss Goodwin's doing

1006
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,940
a pretty good job.

1007
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,210
We already got

1008
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,210
one hostage out,

1009
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,210
bringing another.

1010
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,610
Don't we want to give

1011
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,610
her some more time?

1012
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,450
That kid is a ticking

1013
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,450
time bomb.

1014
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,350
We cannot wait for him

1015
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,350
to just go off.

1016
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,560
Okay, I'm ready.

1017
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,820
Insert the needle

1018
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,820
at a 45 degree angle,

1019
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,890
and then aim the needle

1020
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,890
toward your index finger.

1021
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,620
Josh's vein is right under

1022
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,620
the clavicle.

1023
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,370
Okay, I'm doing it.

1024
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,430
Withdraw from the syringe

1025
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,430
until you get blood.

1026
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,610
There's no blood.

1027
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,610
I'm just getting air.

1028
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,670
It's okay.

1029
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,670
Just pull back

1030
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,670
ever so slightly.

1031
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,680
Change your angle

1032
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,680
and try again.

1033
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,760
Okay. Okay, I got it.

1034
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,760
Good. Now feed the wire in.

1035
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,420
Okay, okay.

1036
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,100
His sats are dropping.

1037
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,000
April, you need to finish

1038
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,000
the line quickly and then

1039
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,000
insert a chest tube.

1040
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,130
A chest tube? Ethan, no.

1041
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,130
That air you got?

1042
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,000
That was his lung collapsing.

1043
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,000
He needs a chest tube

1044
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,000
to breathe.

1045
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,320
Daniel?

1046
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,320
We're here, Sharon.

1047
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,290
I've got a gun on me.

1048
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,160
So if anyone charges through

1049
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,160
when we open this door...

1050
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,100
No one's gonna do that.

1051
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,100
I promise you.

1052
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,100
You can open the door.

1053
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,330
He's my friend.

1054
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,330
I trust him.

1055
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,280
Give me the patient.

1056
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,090
Sats are good. Ketamine's in.

1057
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,660
Everybody ready?

1058
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,660
Mmm-hmm.

1059
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,930
Okay.

1060
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,610
Okay.

1061
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,270
Okay.

1062
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,610
Her uterus ruptured.

1063
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,340
Wait, what's happening?

1064
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,340
I don't know.

1065
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,620
The baby's floating

1066
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,620
in the abdomen.

1067
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,620
Need suction.

1068
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,280
I'm in there.

1069
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,030
There we go.

1070
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,630
Mom's pressure is crashing.

1071
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,630
O neg's running in.

1072
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,330
All right, we're losing her.

1073
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,330
Keep suction going. More laps.

1074
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,340
More!

1075
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,840
Don't let her die!

1076
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,840
You hear me?

1077
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,850
Okay.

1078
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,080
Make an incision

1079
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,080
next to his nipple,

1080
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,790
about an inch and a half

1081
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,790
over the top of the rib.

1082
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,030
Okay.

1083
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,030
Now take the big clamp.

1084
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,670
Place it into the incision

1085
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,670
and push until the clamp

1086
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,670
pops into his chest.

1087
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,080
It's not going.

1088
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,080
This isn't working.

1089
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,080
Push harder.

1090
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,140
If I hit a lung

1091
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,140
or the heart...

1092
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,210
April, trust me.

1093
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,210
Push harder.

1094
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,790
I got a rush of air.

1095
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,040
Sats are coming up.

1096
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,110
Good job.

1097
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,110
Okay.

1098
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,710
What's happening

1099
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,710
with the baby?

1100
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,750
His color's coming back.

1101
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,750
He's stable for now.

1102
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,950
Guys, I need a little

1103
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,950
help over here.

1104
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,990
Wait, what about Lily?

1105
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,990
She's lost a lot of blood.

1106
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,960
What... What have we got left?

1107
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,960
I'm hanging

1108
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,960
my last two of FFP.

1109
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,260
She's not stable.

1110
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,420
All right, keep suctioning.

1111
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,420
Yeah.

1112
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,030
I can't see a thing.

1113
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,870
All right, the rupture

1114
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,870
extended into

1115
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,870
the uterine artery.

1116
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,900
All right, keep suction going.

1117
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,910
She's bottoming out, Connor.

1118
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,910
You said you could

1119
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,910
stop the bleeding!

1120
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,880
We had a deal, all right?

1121
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,880
Your father for Lily!

1122
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,810
All right, hold on. Hold on.

1123
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,810
I think I got it.

1124
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,150
Got it!

1125
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,810
Give me an O prolene

1126
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,810
on a needle.

1127
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,120
Pressure's rising.

1128
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,120
Bleeding's under control.

1129
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,860
All right, let's finish

1130
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,860
this and then we'll

1131
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,860
close the uterus.

1132
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,490
See? Lily's okay.

1133
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,430
They stopped

1134
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,430
the bleeding and...

1135
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,430
And your baby's here.

1136
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,640
You can still have

1137
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,640
a meaningful life

1138
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,640
with him, David.

1139
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,640
Please put the gun down.

1140
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:45,020
I promise to help

1141
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:45,020
make sure this baby

1142
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:45,020
stays a part of your life.

1143
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,140
No.

1144
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,920
I'm taking Lily and my baby

1145
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,920
and we're getting out of here.

1146
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,560
My baby?

1147
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,560
It's a healthy boy.

1148
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,840
Hey, Lily, we're gonna go

1149
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,840
right now, all right?

1150
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,440
That's not happening.

1151
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,440
She can barely move

1152
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,440
in her condition.

1153
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,380
Stop talking.

1154
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,750
We gotta go. Lily, we gotta go

1155
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,750
right now. All right?

1156
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,850
David, no.

1157
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,890
No, listen, all we gotta do

1158
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,890
is get to the neighborhood,

1159
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,890
all right?

1160
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,990
Because I know people

1161
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,990
who'll help us get out.

1162
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,620
I promise, it's gonna

1163
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,620
be okay. All right?

1164
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,890
No.

1165
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,400
It's over, David. It's over.

1166
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,240
If you change your mind,

1167
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,240
when you do, call my mom.

1168
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,550
She'll tell you to get in

1169
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,550
contact with me and the baby.

1170
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,980
David.

1171
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,080
What are you doing?

1172
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,590
Give me my son.

1173
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,460
I can't do that, David.

1174
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,230
Get back. Get back.

1175
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,130
Everyone back

1176
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,130
against the wall now.

1177
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,670
Miss Goodwin, hand him over.

1178
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,140
I said I'd help you, David,

1179
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,140
and I meant that.

1180
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,040
But I'm not giving

1181
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,040
you this baby.

1182
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,810
I'm not leaving here

1183
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,810
without my son.

1184
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,450
Sharon?

1185
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,750
You don't have a choice.

1186
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,590
No, you don't have a choice.

1187
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,290
I will kill everyone

1188
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,290
in this hospital

1189
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,290
before I leave my son.

1190
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,830
Then you're gonna

1191
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,830
have to start with me.

1192
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,540
Give me my son.

1193
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,330
David! No!

1194
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,000
David! David!

1195
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,440
Stay... Stay with me, David.

1196
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,440
Move, move, move, move!

1197
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,640
Stay with me, David.

1198
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,650
Target is down.

1199
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,650
Stay with me, David.

1200
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,950
Target is down...

1201
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,950
Stay with me.

1202
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,620
David? Stay with me.

1203
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,930
Weapons down!

1204
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,930
Let's go! Clear the area!

1205
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,740
Susie. Do you know

1206
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,740
who did his surgery?

1207
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,740
Yes, I believe

1208
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,740
it was Dr. Bekker.

1209
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,150
You did the surgery?

1210
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,280
He had an atrial septal defect

1211
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,280
the size of the Chicago Bean.

1212
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,660
But fortunately, yes,

1213
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,660
I was able to patch it.

1214
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,930
I saved his life,

1215
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,930
but I suppose

1216
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,930
this is the closest

1217
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,590
you can come to

1218
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,590
saying thank you.

1219
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,160
I'll be back later

1220
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,160
to check on my patient.

1221
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,040
Hello, Dr. Manning.

1222
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,910
Hi. I'm glad to see you're

1223
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,910
feeling better.

1224
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,810
Just wanted to come in

1225
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,810
and check and see

1226
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,810
if you needed anything.

1227
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,610
Hi. Lily Cooper?

1228
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,590
Dr. Lang cleared the baby.

1229
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,420
I'm having a hard time finding

1230
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,420
the adoptive mom, though.

1231
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,190
Edie Thompson, right?

1232
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,860
I saw her leave

1233
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,860
the hospital.

1234
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,490
I don't think she'll

1235
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,490
be coming back.

1236
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,470
I'll call

1237
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,470
the agency tomorrow.

1238
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,630
Have them find

1239
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,630
another couple. I'm sure

1240
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,630
it won't be a problem.

1241
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,270
Can you take him back

1242
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,270
to the nursery until we get

1243
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,270
this straightened out?

1244
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,300
Hang on a second.

1245
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,370
Lily, is there something

1246
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,370
you want to say?

1247
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,650
Would it be okay

1248
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,650
if I hold him?

1249
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,990
Honey.

1250
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,990
Just for a little bit.

1251
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,860
Of course.

1252
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,730
Hi.

1253
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,300
There you go.

1254
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,280
Sweetie.

1255
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,810
Dad?

1256
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,810
Lily.

1257
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,280
But he's mine, Dad.

1258
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,390
What?

1259
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,020
Will?

1260
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,340
When everything first started,

1261
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,340
you could've gotten out.

1262
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,120
But you came back for me.

1263
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,850
I know that.

1264
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,560
Thank you.

1265
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,530
Agent Lee?

1266
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,530
Will, Dr. Manning.

1267
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,940
Is the FBI involved?

1268
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,940
No, this is a CPD matter.

1269
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,070
I heard about what happened.

1270
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,070
Are you two okay?

1271
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,700
I was worried about you.

1272
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,550
I'm all right, Ingrid. Thanks.

1273
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,710
I should get going.

1274
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,710
Good night.
