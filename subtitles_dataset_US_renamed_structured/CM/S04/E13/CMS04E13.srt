1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,300
I mean...

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,140
What's so funny?

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,140
Come on, April. Tell him.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,310
It's a nurse thing.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,310
You wouldn't get it.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,110
Come on.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,110
Our shift's about

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,110
to start. Sorry.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,010
I don't know why I'm

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,010
so tired this morning.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,250
Really, you don't know?

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,850
Maybe I have some idea.

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,290
I'm just happy you're back

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,290
home and the whole gun

15
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,290
thing is behind us.

16
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,560
Excuse me,

17
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,560
Dr. Halstead.

18
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,090
Hey, Earl. What's up?

19
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,460
Sorry to interrupt,

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,870
but it's about your car.

21
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,370
Seems they pried

22
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,370
the latch open.

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,480
Oh, my God, he literally

24
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,480
just parked. What was it,

25
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,480
like 10 minutes ago?

26
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,250
My guess is whoever

27
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,250
did this cased out

28
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,250
Dr. Halstead specifically.

29
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,080
Knew his schedule, what he

30
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,080
might leave in the car.

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,090
Mine was the only

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,090
car broken into?

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,520
Yeah, seems so.

34
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,050
Oh, my God, Will.

35
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,390
I can't believe you left

36
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,390
this back here.

37
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,390
Your laptop's inside.

38
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,460
I'm surprised

39
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,460
they didn't take it.

40
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,530
They must have gotten scared

41
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,530
off before they found it.

42
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,340
See anything missing,

43
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,340
Dr. Halstead?

44
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,070
No, it doesn't look like it.

45
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,270
Well, you must have

46
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,270
got lucky then.

47
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,880
Here you go, Top Gun. You're

48
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,880
going to Treatment Five.

49
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,490
And take Terry with you.

50
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,080
It seems like he needs

51
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,080
something to do.

52
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,850
Come on.

53
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,260
Good morning, Mr. Kaminsky.

54
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,800
Hi, I'm Dr. Choi and this is

55
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,260
Student Doctor McNeal.

56
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,260
Hi.

57
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,670
I understand you're

58
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,670
experiencing some

59
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,670
palpitations in your chest?

60
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,760
How about you unbutton your

61
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,760
shirt so I can take a listen.

62
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,900
Sure.

63
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,900
I see we already took

64
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,900
your blood pressure.

65
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,970
226 over 117.

66
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,240
That's high, isn't it?

67
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,740
A lot higher than

68
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,740
I'd like to see it, yes.

69
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,380
All right,

70
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,380
take a deep breath for me.

71
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,850
And exhale.

72
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,820
Then another.

73
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,120
Exhale.

74
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,820
All right. Bilateral crackles

75
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,820
with mild rhonchi.

76
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,790
That didn't sound good.

77
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,890
Not time to panic yet,

78
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,890
but it's good you came in.

79
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,630
I want to run a few tests

80
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,630
and give you something

81
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,890
to bring down

82
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,890
that blood pressure.

83
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,230
Excuse me.

84
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,770
Hey, Hank. Start an IV

85
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,770
and give 20 labetalol, please.

86
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,000
Absolutely.

87
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,940
Let's get a CBC,

88
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,940
CMP, troponins,

89
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,980
and set him up with

90
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,980
an EKG and renal ultrasound.

91
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,570
Okay.

92
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,480
Hey, Hank.

93
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,480
Everything all right?

94
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,380
Where are you going?

95
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,850
Is he okay?

96
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,130
I'm sure it's nothing.

97
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,700
Terry, clean this up,

98
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,700
and let's get that IV started.

99
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,860
All right.

100
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,000
It's okay. It's okay.

101
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,900
It's okay.

102
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,010
Hey, what's going on?

103
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,940
Hey, what happened to Hank?

104
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,940
He's not feeling well.

105
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,280
Does he know

106
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,280
that patient, Kaminsky?

107
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,850
April, what's going on?

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,820
Sorry.

109
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,090
Hey, hey, hey,

110
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,090
come on. It's me.

111
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,830
You always read me in.

112
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,960
Not this time.

113
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,200
Maggie?

114
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,200
Yep?

115
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,500
Patient in Two's got a small

116
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,500
splenic crack without a blush.

117
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,970
Let's send her upstairs

118
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,970
for observation.

119
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,170
I'm on it.

120
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,170
Thanks.

121
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,440
Morning.

122
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,210
That's really all

123
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,210
you're going to say?

124
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,010
Um, what else do you

125
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,010
want me to say?

126
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,980
"I'm sorry," would be a start.

127
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,490
Yeah, I'm sorry things

128
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,490
turned out this way.

129
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,360
Turned out?

130
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,690
Things didn't turn out.

131
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,530
You accused me of sleeping

132
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,530
with your detestable father.

133
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,790
I'm not going to keep

134
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,790
rehashing this, Ava.

135
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,860
Oh, you poor thing.

136
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,930
Connor, incoming.

137
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,930
You're going to Baghdad.

138
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,640
What do we got?

139
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,800
Bode Isiah, 23,

140
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,470
motorcycle versus car, GCS 12,

141
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,540
BP 110 over 70,

142
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,540
heart rate 120,

143
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,540
O2 sats 98%.

144
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,850
He's obviously

145
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,850
in a lot of pain,

146
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,850
seems to have taken

147
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,650
most of the trauma

148
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,650
to the torso.

149
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,950
All right, let's get a chest

150
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,950
X-ray in here now.

151
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,620
All right, on my count.

152
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,620
One, two, three.

153
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,700
All right, Bode,

154
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,700
we're going to take care

155
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,700
of that pain, okay?

156
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,760
Give me 50 of fentanyl.

157
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,740
Yeah.

158
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,740
I'm HIV-positive.

159
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,900
It's good to know,

160
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,900
but we're prepared

161
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,900
for that, okay?

162
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,740
Just let us take care of you.

163
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,170
All right, Bode.

164
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,280
Can you move your head

165
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,280
up and down for me?

166
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,320
There we go, very good.

167
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,110
Now how about

168
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,110
left and right, okay?

169
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,250
All right, C-spine's clear.

170
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,260
Let's roll him

171
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,260
and get a board out.

172
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,760
One, two, three.

173
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,130
Hey, what's the hold-up on

174
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,130
the fentanyl I asked for?

175
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,590
I already gave it to him.

176
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,090
All right, let's get

177
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,090
the X-ray in. Come on.

178
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,870
Whoa. All right, Bode.

179
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,840
You've got a bunch of broken

180
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,840
and displaced ribs.

181
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,670
In order to stop the pain

182
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,670
we're going to have

183
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,670
to surgically

184
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,180
put them back into alignment

185
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,180
with metal plates.

186
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,650
Is that okay?

187
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,650
Okay.

188
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,350
All right, tell CT

189
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,350
we're on our way up.

190
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,080
Let's get him ready to move.

191
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,180
All right? Let's go.

192
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,980
There are my two lovebirds.

193
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,150
I got a tough one in

194
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,150
Treatment Four. Colon cancer.

195
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,260
Who wants it?

196
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,260
I'll take it.

197
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,820
Thanks.

198
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,820
Yeah. Can you take my stuff?

199
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,260
Sure.

200
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,260
You all right?

201
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,130
Yeah.

202
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,130
See you.

203
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,330
See you.

204
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,830
Damn it.

205
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,570
Yeah, I need to report

206
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,570
a stolen firearm.

207
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,810
You know what?

208
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,810
Let me call you back.

209
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,680
Dr. Halstead.

210
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,680
Good morning.

211
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,720
You're a hard man to pin down.

212
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,850
What do you mean?

213
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,980
Buddy, I heard you been

214
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,980
skipping your sessions.

215
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,760
Therapy?

216
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,930
Yeah, well, kinda busy saving

217
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,930
lives down here.

218
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,530
Listen, for what

219
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,530
it's worth,

220
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,530
in my experience,

221
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,040
this kind of trauma, you gotta

222
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,040
take the treatment seriously

223
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,900
or it'll bite you in the ass.

224
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,870
I mean, the stories I could

225
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,870
tell you. Drugs, alcohol,

226
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,870
family issues.

227
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,240
Hey, why don't you

228
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,240
just say it?

229
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,740
All right, Natalie told you

230
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,740
I bought a gun.

231
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,950
Well, it's gone.

232
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,950
It's not an issue anymore.

233
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,150
Okay, we done?

234
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,150
Will, let me remind you

235
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,290
your therapy

236
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,290
is not elective.

237
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,220
Goodwin mandated it.

238
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,160
Come on, man.

239
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,960
I don't want to see

240
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,960
you lose your job.

241
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,700
Appreciate it.

242
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,430
I'm not seeing any signs

243
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,430
of concussion.

244
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,100
Are you sure it was a seizure

245
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,100
that made you collapse?

246
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,010
That's what my manager

247
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,010
at the food co-op said,

248
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,480
but it was more

249
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,480
of a dizzy spell.

250
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,580
Thinking it was a reaction

251
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,580
to the chemo.

252
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,050
All right, well, I'm seeing

253
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,050
in your chart that

254
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,050
you're battling colon cancer.

255
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,020
I'd like to send you

256
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,020
for a set of scans

257
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,450
just to see what's going on.

258
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,450
Scans?

259
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,290
No, I don't want to blow

260
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,290
my insurance up any more

261
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,290
than I already have.

262
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,090
Plus, my oncologist

263
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,090
scanned me

264
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,090
just last week.

265
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,460
Well, in that case

266
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,460
I will contact

267
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,460
your oncologist directly

268
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,000
so I can access your records.

269
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,000
I just need your

270
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,000
written consent.

271
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,360
No, I don't want

272
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,360
to bother her.

273
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,360
I'm feeling better.

274
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,930
I'll make an appointment

275
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,930
for the day after tomorrow.

276
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,470
Jared! Oh, baby.

277
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,670
What are you doing here?

278
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,670
I thought you were

279
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,670
at the airport.

280
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,210
I was until Jason

281
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,210
called me in a panic.

282
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,350
He overreacted, all right?

283
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,350
You should be on your way

284
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,350
to Phoenix.

285
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,410
That conference is important.

286
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,410
You are more important.

287
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,150
No way I can stay away for

288
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,150
a week with you like this.

289
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,190
This is my girlfriend, Lucy.

290
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,190
How is he?

291
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,480
We're trying

292
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,480
to figure that out.

293
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,530
I'm telling you,

294
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,530
it's a reaction

295
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,530
to the chemo, all right?

296
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,430
This isn't my first rodeo.

297
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,760
Chemo? I thought

298
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,760
your last cycle

299
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,760
ended three weeks ago.

300
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,390
Three weeks?

301
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,390
Something like that.

302
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,600
That seems unlikely that

303
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,600
would still be affecting you.

304
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,160
Do you mind if I take a look

305
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,160
at your chemo port?

306
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,970
I opted not to get one.

307
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,440
Nurses say my veins

308
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,440
are easy to access.

309
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,980
So what's the plan?

310
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,180
Well, since you don't want

311
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,180
any scans, please just let us

312
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,180
run some labs.

313
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,550
No.

314
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,550
Jared, please.

315
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,980
This is serious.

316
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,690
Okay.

317
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,690
But just the blood tests.

318
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,690
Okay, I'll be back shortly.

319
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,990
Hey, can we get a CBC, CMP,

320
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,990
magnesium and phosphates

321
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,990
for Mr. Bray?

322
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,900
No scans?

323
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,900
He won't let me.

324
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,300
Huh?

325
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,300
Yeah, weird, right?

326
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,170
Yeah.

327
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,170
Speaking of,

328
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,210
did you hear about what

329
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,210
happened to Will's car?

330
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,750
Yeah, it got

331
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,750
broken into, right?

332
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,710
Yeah, but nothing was stolen.

333
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,710
Not even a bag

334
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,710
with his computer in it.

335
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,310
That's strange.

336
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,310
Sounds like Will got lucky.

337
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,890
That's exactly what Earl said.

338
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,890
Mmm.

339
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,190
Dr. Choi, I just checked in

340
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,190
on Mr. Kaminsky.

341
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,190
Yeah.

342
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,800
Nurses still haven't

343
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,800
drawn blood or sent him

344
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,800
up for scans.

345
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,490
What are they waiting for?

346
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,490
Don't know.

347
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,260
Can't get a straight answer.

348
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,260
Want me to do it?

349
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,400
No, I'll handle this.

350
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,340
Hey. Why is nobody filling the

351
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,340
orders for my patient in Five?

352
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,880
Got busy.

353
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,880
I need that workup now.

354
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,880
Will you do it, please?

355
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,710
Sorry, gotta give stat nitro

356
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,710
to Treatment Two.

357
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,180
April.

358
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,470
Doris, I need you

359
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,470
to draw blood in Five.

360
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,020
I'm sorry, I'm on a break,

361
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,020
I gotta clock out.

362
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,710
Draw Mr. Kaminsky's blood

363
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,710
first or don't bother

364
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,710
clocking back in.

365
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,090
Mags.

366
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,090
Yep?

367
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,150
You gotta rein in

368
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,150
your nurses.

369
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,920
They're dropping the ball

370
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,920
on my patient in Five.

371
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,660
Dr. Choi,

372
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,660
we're down a nurse.

373
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,660
We'll get to him.

374
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,660
Ow!

375
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,230
Ow!

376
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,970
What's wrong?

377
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,970
She's hurting me.

378
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,910
His veins are impossible

379
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,910
and he keeps moving.

380
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,910
Stay still.

381
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,910
Ow! Stop stabbing me.

382
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,950
Doris.

383
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,950
There we go.

384
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,010
All done.

385
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,260
Suddenly don't know your way

386
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,260
around a rolling vein?

387
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,160
It was a hard stick.

388
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,160
I gotta run this to the lab.

389
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,940
Mo, talk to me.

390
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,940
What happened with Hank today?

391
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,270
Nothing. He wasn't

392
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,270
feeling good.

393
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,000
Monique.

394
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,000
You have to ask April.

395
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,570
I'm asking you.

396
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,370
We're talking about patient

397
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,370
care, here. This is serious,

398
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,370
all right?

399
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,040
Monique.

400
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,610
Your patient's

401
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,610
a child molester.

402
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,650
What?

403
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,380
He was Hank's piano teacher.

404
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,580
He raped him when

405
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,580
he was a little boy.

406
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,700
Dr. Lanik is wondering

407
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,700
when his chest tube in T-Two

408
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,700
is getting set up.

409
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,970
You want me to do that

410
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,970
before or after this MVC

411
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,970
that just came in?

412
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,870
How about both

413
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,870
at the same time?

414
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,210
Yeah.

415
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,310
Someone named Sydney Hawkins

416
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,310
is asking for you out

417
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,310
in the waiting room.

418
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,110
Said she's a friend of yours?

419
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,380
Doesn't ring a bell.

420
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,020
I can tell her

421
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,020
you're too busy.

422
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,160
No, I'll come out.

423
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,970
Okay. Hello, Sydney?

424
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,970
I'm Maggie Lockwood.

425
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,230
How can I help you?

426
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,070
You don't remember me,

427
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,070
do you?

428
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,770
I'm Naomi's cousin.

429
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,170
From down round

430
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,170
41st and Langley?

431
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,310
She was a year behind you

432
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,310
at Wendell Phillips?

433
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,720
Well, that was

434
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,720
a bit ago, yeah?

435
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,720
But I do remember Naomi.

436
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,350
Well, she said if I ever need

437
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,350
anything at Med I should ask

438
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,350
for you.

439
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,950
Okay, so what can I

440
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,950
do for you?

441
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,250
Well, just so you know,

442
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,590
I'm not the kind of person

443
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,590
that gets sick a lot.

444
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,920
Mmm-hmm.

445
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,330
But I got this body pain

446
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,330
that I just can't seem

447
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,330
to shake.

448
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,830
If I had a regular doctor

449
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,830
I'd go see 'em,

450
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,110
but if you could hook

451
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,110
a girl up that'd be cool.

452
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,810
Okay, listen, this is an ED.

453
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,810
We need to prioritize

454
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,810
our emergencies.

455
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,110
Yeah, okay, well,

456
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,110
if it's too hectic here,

457
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,110
I mean,

458
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,550
you could just give me

459
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,550
something for the pain.

460
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,990
Okay, no one here is going

461
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,990
to be able to do that for you

462
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,860
until you are

463
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,860
formally examined.

464
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,320
So why don't you come

465
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,320
and take a seat over here.

466
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,560
Go ahead.

467
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,690
Yeah.

468
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,630
And we'll do our best

469
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,630
to get to you, okay?

470
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,730
All right.

471
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,470
Thank you for stepping out

472
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,470
to see me.

473
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,510
Of course. Mmm-hmm.

474
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,510
I appreciate it.

475
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,710
Okay.

476
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,810
Give my hand back,

477
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,810
Sydney. Okay.

478
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,980
Did you take her temperature?

479
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,980
99.6. Just a bit elevated.

480
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,030
I can bump her up the triage

481
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,030
list if you want.

482
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,320
Not necessary.

483
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,900
Please tell me

484
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,900
this wasn't your idea.

485
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,100
What?

486
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,930
You know how unethical it is

487
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,930
denying a patient care.

488
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,000
Treat him like

489
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,000
a pin cushion?

490
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,540
I should write you all up

491
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,540
for what you've been doing.

492
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,870
Do you know

493
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,870
what that guy did to Hank?

494
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,610
He molested him,

495
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,610
Ethan. Regularly.

496
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,440
During their piano lessons.

497
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,440
It's terrible.

498
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,610
I know. But it's not up to us

499
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,610
to dole out justice.

500
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,490
Hank should call PD.

501
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,490
Press charges.

502
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,550
He did already, but it was

503
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,550
Hank's word against Kaminsky's

504
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,250
and the judge dismissed

505
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,250
the whole thing before

506
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,250
it even went to trial.

507
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,590
Yeah, and since Kaminsky

508
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,590
wasn't even convicted,

509
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,690
he's not registered

510
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,690
as a sex offender.

511
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,670
For all we know,

512
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,670
he's still doing this

513
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,670
to other little boys.

514
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,530
Look, I get why

515
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,530
this upsets you.

516
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,090
It upsets me too.

517
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,370
But regardless of how awful

518
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,370
this patient might be,

519
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,370
we have an ethical obligation

520
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,110
to treat him as

521
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,110
we would anyone else.

522
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,450
Fine, but there's nothing

523
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,450
that says we have to make

524
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,450
his stay a vacation.

525
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,110
He will get the bare minimum

526
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,110
from me.

527
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,450
Look, if that's how you feel,

528
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,250
maybe it's better

529
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,250
you keep away altogether.

530
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,830
No problem.

531
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,900
Mr. Kaminsky's EKG

532
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,900
and scans are done.

533
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,570
Your labs came back negative.

534
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,570
I'm not seeing any tumors

535
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,570
or lesions.

536
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,210
That's good, right?

537
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,210
Can I go home, now?

538
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,480
You'll need a follow-up

539
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,480
with a primary care physician,

540
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,880
but it looks like you're

541
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,880
responding to the labetalol

542
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,880
we gave you

543
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,650
so, hopefully,

544
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,650
we can discharge you soon.

545
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,490
Thank you.

546
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,700
One last thing.

547
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,090
I didn't ask you earlier,

548
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,090
but hypertension can often

549
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,090
be made worse

550
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,900
by things like

551
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,900
work-related stress.

552
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,600
That wouldn't apply to me

553
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,600
because I've always

554
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,600
loved my job.

555
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,270
And what's that?

556
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,270
I teach piano at my house.

557
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,900
For over 30 years now.

558
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,840
You have a lot of students?

559
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,840
Enough to keep me occupied.

560
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,460
What are you doing up here?

561
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,560
Trauma patient with severely

562
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,560
displaced rib fractures.

563
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,460
And you didn't page me?

564
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,560
Dr. Latham's held up

565
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,560
in surgery, but he wanted me

566
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,560
to let your know

567
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,370
that he reviewed

568
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,370
your patient's chart

569
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,310
and doesn't think Mr. Isiah's

570
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,310
a good candidate for surgery.

571
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,470
The patient's HIV puts him

572
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,470
at too high of a risk

573
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,470
for infection.

574
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,910
Plating his ribs

575
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,910
is the only way

576
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,910
to treat his pain.

577
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,640
Dr. Latham says you're welcome

578
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,640
to seek another opinion.

579
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,550
Well, that's just great.

580
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,420
Hey.

581
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,820
What about you?

582
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,560
You're asking

583
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,560
for my opinion now?

584
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,500
Look, I know that

585
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,500
I am the last person

586
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,500
that you want to help,

587
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,970
but we shouldn't be afraid

588
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,970
of surgery just because

589
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,970
the patient has HIV.

590
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,530
May I?

591
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,900
Here.

592
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,510
I'm thinking

593
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,510
three KLS titanium

594
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,510
plates per side,

595
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,170
maybe four hours max.

596
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,170
Okay.

597
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,880
I'll clear my schedule

598
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,880
and do the surgery.

599
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,110
Really? Hey. Thank you.

600
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,390
I'm not doing it for you,

601
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,390
I'm doing it for your patient.

602
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,330
Dr. Halstead?

603
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,330
Yeah?

604
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,260
I was waiting

605
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,260
for you outside.

606
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,800
Sorry, I was

607
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,800
with a patient.

608
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,800
Let's go.

609
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,740
Mr. Bray's labs are back.

610
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,740
Thank you.

611
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,920
So, Jared, your liver enzymes

612
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,920
were a little higher

613
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,920
than expected,

614
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,550
given when you had

615
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,550
your last chemo treatment,

616
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,220
but everything else looks

617
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,220
surprisingly good.

618
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,160
So he's out of the woods?

619
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,850
Well, I still don't know

620
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,850
what caused his seizure,

621
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,660
but, for now,

622
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,660
your vital signs seem stable.

623
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,790
Listen, if I leave now,

624
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,600
I can get to my first

625
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,600
presentation in time.

626
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,300
I might just

627
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,300
be able to make it.

628
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,970
You're going to leave

629
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,970
this late? You'll have

630
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,970
to catch a red-eye.

631
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,030
That's okay.

632
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,170
I'm gonna go see

633
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,170
if I can reschedule my flight.

634
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,610
Okay.

635
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,740
Dr. Manning, could you pass me

636
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,740
my bag, please?

637
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,240
It's right over there.

638
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,110
Sure.

639
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,390
Here you go.

640
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,390
Thank you.

641
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,430
No problem. I'll be back to

642
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,430
check on you soon.

643
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,940
Pressure drop.

644
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,500
No pulse, he's in v-fib.

645
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,500
Terry, start compressions.

646
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,610
Doesn't make any sense.

647
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,610
He was fine five minutes ago.

648
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,020
Thought you were staying away

649
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,020
from this patient.

650
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,320
He pushed the call button.

651
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,320
No one else was around.

652
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,480
Charge to 200.

653
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,480
Charged.

654
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,820
Clear.

655
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,550
Still in v-fib.

656
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,120
Push 1 milligram of epi.

657
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,120
Charging 200 again.

658
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,860
Charged.

659
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,860
Clear!

660
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,000
He's asystole.

661
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,000
I think he's gone.

662
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,810
Dr. Choi?

663
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,750
Time of death, 14:42.

664
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,200
Not sure what

665
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm missing here,

666
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,200
Dr. Choi.

667
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,040
The patient responded

668
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,040
to the labetalol,

669
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,520
so how'd he have a massive

670
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,520
cardiac event out of the blue?

671
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,080
I'm not sure.

672
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,610
I know they're pretty rare,

673
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,920
but at first I thought maybe

674
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,920
a pheochromocytoma

675
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,950
was responsible for spiking

676
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,950
his BP, but I don't see

677
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,950
any tumors on these scans.

678
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,530
There must have

679
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,530
been some other

680
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,530
factor at play, right?

681
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,530
How many doses of epi did we

682
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,530
give Kaminsky when he died?

683
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,230
According to the case notes,

684
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,230
one, before he went asystolic.

685
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,230
Why?

686
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,720
There's four empty

687
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,720
amps in the trash.

688
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,820
Really? How could that be?

689
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,190
Follow the body down to the

690
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,190
morgue, find Dr. Shore,

691
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,090
and ask her

692
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,090
if she could tell me

693
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,090
how much epinephrine

694
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,560
Kaminsky had in his system

695
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,560
when he died.

696
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,620
Okay.

697
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,720
And ask her

698
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,720
to keep it off the books.

699
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,920
Off the books?

700
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,130
Just do it.

701
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,330
All right, that does

702
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,330
it for this side.

703
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,060
Let's close him up

704
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,060
and reposition him,

705
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,160
re-prep and re-drip.

706
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,160
You got it.

707
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,440
His splintering was

708
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,440
much more extensive

709
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,440
than I thought from the scans,

710
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,980
so you made the right call.

711
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,410
Well, so far so good.

712
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,420
So a patient of mine

713
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,420
sent over a bottle

714
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,420
of Yamazaki 12

715
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,110
as a thank-you

716
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,110
for a triple bypass.

717
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,550
Perhaps after we're done

718
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,550
we could put a dent in it?

719
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,250
Look, Ava...

720
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,250
One drink.

721
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,620
Connor, what are you

722
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,620
so afraid of?

723
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,420
Why did you agree

724
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,420
to do this surgery?

725
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,830
You trying to fix things

726
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,830
between us?

727
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,930
So what if I was?

728
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,130
Then this is not the time

729
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,130
or the place.

730
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,970
I still have feelings

731
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,970
for you, Connor.

732
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,140
Let me know when the team's

733
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,140
ready to restart.

734
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,680
You know what I find most

735
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,680
bewildering about all this?

736
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,120
You've somehow

737
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,120
convinced yourself that

738
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,120
you're the victim here.

739
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,060
Dr. Manning, Dr. Manning,

740
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,060
come quick.

741
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,800
I was just about to leave

742
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,800
when this happened.

743
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,400
Jared, can you talk to me?

744
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,700
Push 2 of Ativan, stat!

745
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,640
What's going on?

746
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,640
He's having a seizure.

747
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,170
Ativan's in.

748
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,720
Jared, can you take

749
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,720
a deep breath?

750
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,010
Baby, can you hear me?

751
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,290
What happened?

752
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,160
You just had

753
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,160
your second seizure today.

754
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,870
Jared, you need to get

755
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,870
a CAT scan immediately.

756
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,840
No, no, I'm fine.

757
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,840
Jared.

758
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,930
I'm fine, really.

759
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,170
Don't... Don't let this stop

760
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,170
you catching your flight.

761
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,410
You should go.

762
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,410
Are you crazy?

763
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,780
I'm not leaving you now.

764
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,480
What about your job?

765
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,120
None of that

766
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,120
matters right now.

767
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,080
I'm not leaving your side

768
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,080
until you're better.

769
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,400
Hey, how's your patient doing?

770
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,770
I'm not sure yet.

771
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,770
Hey, where'd you go?

772
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,240
I was looking for you,

773
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,240
I couldn't find you.

774
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,670
Well, I had to call

775
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,670
the insurance company.

776
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,940
But I saw you

777
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,940
talking with a cop.

778
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,710
Well, yeah,

779
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,710
that was part of it.

780
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,040
I had to file

781
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,040
a whole police report

782
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,040
for the insurance claim.

783
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,040
Why would you file

784
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,040
a police report?

785
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,110
Was something stolen?

786
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,110
Natalie, for the last time,

787
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,190
nothing was stolen.

788
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
Hey, I just planted a patient

789
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
in Treatment Three for you.

790
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,300
Sydney, right?

791
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,300
I was just about

792
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,300
to head in there.

793
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,840
All right.

794
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,070
Did I hear something about her

795
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,070
being a friend of yours?

796
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,530
She's not a friend of mine.

797
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,200
Okay.

798
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,110
Hey, sorry.

799
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,240
It's just I know

800
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,240
something about Sydney.

801
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,250
She has a reputation of being

802
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,250
a bit of a grifter.

803
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,650
Heard she got arrested for

804
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,650
solicitation last year.

805
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,820
I have sympathy for the girl,

806
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,820
but quite possibly

807
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,120
she's just here

808
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,120
to score some pills.

809
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,320
Yeah, good to know.

810
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,320
I'll proceed accordingly.

811
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,560
Yeah.

812
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,800
So you think Jared's

813
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,800
lying to you?

814
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,060
Yes.

815
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,590
Wow. That's a pretty

816
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,590
serious accusation.

817
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,160
His story just

818
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,160
doesn't add up.

819
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,200
He won't show me his scans,

820
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,200
he doesn't have a chemo port,

821
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,140
and both his seizures today

822
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,140
timed out perfectly

823
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,200
to stop his girlfriend

824
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,200
from going on

825
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,200
her business trip.

826
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,680
Faking a cancer diagnosis for

827
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,680
two years would take

828
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,680
unbelievable commitment,

829
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,650
and then also, how do you

830
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,650
explain the hair loss

831
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,090
and other physical symptoms?

832
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,390
Well, I saw a Ziploc full

833
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,390
of green pellets in his bag.

834
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,400
They looked just like

835
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,400
the rat poison that my

836
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,400
handyman uses in the basement.

837
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,430
If Jared is ingesting a small

838
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,430
dose of a toxin like arsenic,

839
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,270
it could easily mimic

840
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,270
the side effects of chemo.

841
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,130
Huh.

842
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,380
I think he's harming himself

843
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,380
and he needs to be evaluated.

844
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,310
Okay. I will talk to him.

845
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,010
Thank you.

846
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,340
And

847
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,390
another here.

848
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,120
One last fracture here.

849
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,200
20 ccs quarter-percent

850
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,200
Marcaine to me.

851
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,630
Make that to me, Beth.

852
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,070
What, you want to do

853
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,070
everything yourself?

854
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,130
I have the better angle.

855
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,130
Not for the incision.

856
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,940
Okay, fine. Give me

857
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,940
the Marcaine.

858
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,610
Knife to me.

859
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,230
Ow!

860
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,070
She's cut.

861
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,330
The patient's HIV-positive.

862
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,070
Ava?

863
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,110
It just nicked me.

864
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,110
It barely broke the skin.

865
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,110
I doused it with Betadine.

866
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,380
Doesn't matter.

867
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,380
Hospital protocol.

868
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,780
She's being sidelined?

869
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,050
Because the patient is

870
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,050
HIV-positive you need

871
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,050
to be seen

872
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,790
in the infectious disease

873
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,790
clinic, and start taking

874
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,790
antiretrovirals immediately.

875
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,120
Now the medication

876
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,120
can cause extreme nausea

877
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,690
so I want you off surgical

878
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,690
rotation, just for a few days,

879
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,690
until you acclimate.

880
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,930
And if I end up

881
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,930
contracting the virus,

882
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,930
what happens to my career?

883
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,980
There is such a small chance

884
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,980
of that happening,

885
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,770
you saw the patient's chart,

886
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,770
he has a low viral load.

887
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,840
Let's not get ahead

888
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,840
of ourselves.

889
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,070
Just start taking

890
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,070
the meds right away

891
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,950
and hopefully there won't be

892
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,950
anything to worry about, okay?

893
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,730
Ava, I am so sorry.

894
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,730
I don't even know what to say.

895
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,060
It's not your fault.

896
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,060
I was the one who reached

897
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,890
for the tray like

898
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,890
some idiot resident.

899
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,830
Well, let me at least

900
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,830
take a look at your hand.

901
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,030
No, it's okay.

902
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,030
I'll be fine, Connor.

903
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,930
Ethan, it's freezing.

904
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,930
Why'd you bring me up here?

905
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,200
I got a preliminary report

906
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,200
back from pathology

907
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,510
and there was evidence

908
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,510
Paul Kaminsky had high levels

909
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,510
of epinephrine

910
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,940
in his blood when he died.

911
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,000
So?

912
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,410
So I'm not sure he died

913
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,410
purely of natural causes,

914
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,310
and I need you to help me

915
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,310
understand what happened.

916
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,780
Understand? What...

917
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,650
Are you accusing me

918
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,650
of something?

919
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,420
We pushed one amp of epi

920
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,420
when he coded, right?

921
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,890
April, I found four

922
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,890
empty amps altogether,

923
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,890
in the trash afterwards.

924
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,830
I can't seem to account

925
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,830
for the other three.

926
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,660
Maybe another patient

927
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,660
coded in that room

928
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,890
right before Kaminsky.

929
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,890
Nothing was logged.

930
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,030
Maybe they forgot to log it.

931
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,030
I don't see what this has

932
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,030
to do with me.

933
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,440
You were in Kaminsky's room

934
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,440
just before he crashed.

935
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,000
You think I killed him?

936
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm just trying to understand

937
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,010
how so much epinephrine

938
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,010
got into his system.

939
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,980
I don't believe this.

940
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,980
April, please.

941
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,710
Just tell me what

942
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,710
you were doing in that room.

943
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,080
He was dehydrated.

944
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,080
I gave him

945
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,080
a glass of water.

946
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,780
So suddenly

947
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,780
you're Florence Nightingale

948
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,750
to this guy?

949
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,750
I think we're done.

950
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,280
April, April, please, just...

951
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,280
You gotta be straight with me.

952
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,220
I'm trying to protect you from

953
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,220
getting in any trouble here.

954
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,690
Really?

955
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,890
'Cause that's not

956
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,890
what it feels like

957
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,890
you're trying to do.

958
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,070
So?

959
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,070
It's hard to say.

960
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,170
I mean, if we're seriously

961
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,170
thinking Munchausen's here,

962
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,980
it's a diagnosis of exclusion,

963
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,980
and I would just need

964
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,490
a lot more time to eliminate

965
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,490
the entire differential.

966
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,820
Well, we don't have more time.

967
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,820
He wants to be discharged now.

968
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,260
Nat, I understand.

969
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,260
He needs to be put

970
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,260
on a psych hold.

971
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,920
Not only is he

972
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,920
poisoning himself,

973
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,620
but he is controlling

974
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,620
every aspect of his

975
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,620
girlfriend's life.

976
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,160
Possibly, but he also could

977
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,160
be a very sick guy

978
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,160
clinging to his girlfriend

979
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,000
during a traumatic period

980
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,000
in his life.

981
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,230
It all comes down to whether

982
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,230
we're willing to risk

983
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,540
locking up a legitimately ill

984
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,540
cancer patient on a hunch.

985
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,300
And I'm just not there yet.

986
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,300
But...

987
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,370
I'm sorry, Nat.

988
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,380
At this point we just don't

989
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,380
have enough information to do

990
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,380
anything but let him go.

991
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,880
One and Two,

992
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,880
you take this one.

993
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,050
Maggie?

994
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,050
Yup?

995
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,990
Dr. Halstead needs you

996
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,990
to page renal, stat.

997
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,980
Got it. Where to?

998
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,790
Treatment Three,

999
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,790
Sydney Hawkins.

1000
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,190
Sydney?

1001
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,130
Bolus, another liter

1002
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,130
of saline.

1003
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,530
What's going on?

1004
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,530
She's in septic shock.

1005
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,140
Wait, wait, she was fine

1006
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,140
a minute ago.

1007
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,300
Temp spiked

1008
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,300
out of nowhere,

1009
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,070
BP went in the tank.

1010
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,070
What?

1011
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,810
Systolic's down to 89.

1012
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,670
You can start an external

1013
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,670
jugular, stat.

1014
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,610
Here's a kit.

1015
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,610
Maggie.

1016
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,040
You gotta step back.

1017
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,980
Did we get the infection

1018
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,980
in time?

1019
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,020
I don't know.

1020
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,730
Lucy? You okay?

1021
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,380
What's wrong?

1022
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,380
My boss just fired me.

1023
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,350
What? Why?

1024
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,180
Because I missed

1025
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,180
that conference.

1026
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,720
They said they can no longer

1027
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,720
handle the unpredictability

1028
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,720
of my personal life.

1029
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,350
And this is the second job

1030
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,350
I've lost in a year.

1031
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,760
I'm so sorry.

1032
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,760
It's not fair.

1033
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,060
It's really hard

1034
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,060
trying to take care

1035
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,060
of a loved one

1036
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,330
going through

1037
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,330
something like this.

1038
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,730
I can imagine that going to

1039
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,730
the chemo treatments alone

1040
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,200
is like a full-time job.

1041
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,770
He actually doesn't let me

1042
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,770
go to chemo with him.

1043
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,170
Really? Why?

1044
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,080
Probably just trying

1045
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,080
to protect me.

1046
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,120
Maybe he thinks

1047
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,120
it'll stress me out too much.

1048
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,850
Hey, Dr. Manning.

1049
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,850
When can I get out of here?

1050
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,520
I'm sorry, Jared, but I can't

1051
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,520
officially discharge you

1052
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,520
without a CAT scan.

1053
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,190
Then I'll sign out

1054
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,190
against medical advice.

1055
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,530
If that's what you wanna do,

1056
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,530
but you're still

1057
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,530
pretty dehydrated,

1058
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,260
so I would like to hang

1059
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,260
one more liter of fluid,

1060
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,930
and then we will get you

1061
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,930
on your way.

1062
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,670
Sorry.

1063
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,540
What are you doing?

1064
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,670
Uh...

1065
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,280
Here you go.

1066
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,850
We'll get you discharged soon.

1067
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,250
You wanted proof?

1068
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,250
Here are the pellets.

1069
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,990
Don't tell me you just took

1070
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,990
those right out

1071
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,990
of Jared's bag.

1072
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,700
Given the circumstances

1073
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,700
I felt that I had to.

1074
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,100
Dr. Manning, I don't need to

1075
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,100
tell you that that's a very

1076
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,100
serious transgression.

1077
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,970
His girlfriend deserves

1078
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,970
to know the truth.

1079
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,810
I'm going to the lab

1080
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,810
to have these analyzed.

1081
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,450
Have a seat, please.

1082
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,920
The lab tested

1083
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,920
the pellets you took.

1084
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,880
They came back positive,

1085
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,880
didn't they?

1086
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,950
Yes.

1087
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,290
For high levels of spirulina.

1088
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,360
What?

1089
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,270
It's a vitamin supplement.

1090
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,270
Not arsenic.

1091
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,570
Jared realized

1092
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,570
you were suspicious

1093
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,630
so he gave us permission

1094
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,630
to access his medical records.

1095
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,940
His oncologist at East Mercy

1096
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,940
just emailed this over.

1097
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,480
All of Jared's

1098
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,480
appointments, prescriptions,

1099
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,580
chemo treatments,

1100
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,580
it's all there,

1101
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,680
including scans of

1102
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,680
the stage III malignant

1103
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,680
tumor in his colon.

1104
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,490
You were absolutely

1105
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,490
right about one thing,

1106
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,890
he was hiding something.

1107
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,290
The severity of his cancer.

1108
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:19,030
His prognosis is not good.

1109
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:19,030
I don't know what to say.

1110
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,330
This is awful.

1111
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,390
You're an excellent physician,

1112
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,390
Dr. Manning.

1113
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,960
I realize you've been through

1114
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,960
a lot lately,

1115
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,870
and against

1116
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,870
my better judgment,

1117
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,710
I'm going to bat

1118
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,710
for you on this,

1119
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,200
but it can't happen again.

1120
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,160
This is so insane,

1121
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,160
Dr. Charles.

1122
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,420
I don't know

1123
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,420
what I was thinking.

1124
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,620
When I ask myself

1125
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,620
that question,

1126
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,860
the answer usually ends up

1127
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,860
having something

1128
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,860
to do with me,

1129
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,630
you know, something

1130
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,630
going on in my life.

1131
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:04,000
Could you have been

1132
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:04,000
projecting onto Lucy something

1133
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:04,000
that might be true for you?

1134
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,710
I don't know.

1135
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,420
What I suspected. Sepsis.

1136
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,460
Yeah, from the little history

1137
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,460
I got from her, I'm guessing

1138
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,660
this started as a kidney

1139
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,660
or urinary tract infection.

1140
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,870
I should have known

1141
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,870
it was serious.

1142
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,600
I could have bumped

1143
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,600
Sydney up the list.

1144
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,700
Oh, come on, Maggie. No way

1145
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,700
you could have anticipated

1146
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,700
her being septic.

1147
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,570
What's your prognosis?

1148
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,570
She gonna have

1149
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,570
a full recovery?

1150
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,980
She's in acute renal failure.

1151
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,910
We'll take her up to the ICU

1152
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,910
and start her on dialysis

1153
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,910
right away,

1154
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,920
but there's a good chance

1155
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,920
her kidneys are shot

1156
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,010
and she'll need a transplant.

1157
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,890
Yeah.

1158
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,190
Oh...

1159
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,770
Maggie.

1160
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,770
Sydney.

1161
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,190
How are you doing?

1162
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,190
Can I get you anything?

1163
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,420
I thought I just had the flu.

1164
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,120
Sydney, I need you to know

1165
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,120
how sorry I am.

1166
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,220
No, no.

1167
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,630
I can't stop thinking about

1168
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,070
how if I wouldn't have come in

1169
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,070
today, I would've been dead.

1170
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,100
I'm grateful for you, Maggie.

1171
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,230
Least I know

1172
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,230
I'm in good hands.

1173
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,180
Connor?

1174
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,090
I thought that you would want

1175
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,090
to know that Bode's surgery

1176
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,090
was successful.

1177
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,760
He's already up and pain-free.

1178
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,260
Good, I'm glad. Come in.

1179
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,770
I also wanted

1180
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,770
to bring you this.

1181
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,470
Yamazaki 18?

1182
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,410
I figured the least I could do

1183
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,410
was help you numb the pain.

1184
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,680
Thank you. Sadly, can't have

1185
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,680
any with my meds, Doctor.

1186
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,840
Right, yeah.

1187
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,480
Well, maybe we can celebrate

1188
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,480
when you get the "all clear."

1189
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,680
Well, you can

1190
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,680
have some, right?

1191
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,920
You take it neat?

1192
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,190
I'm afraid

1193
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,190
I'm still on call.

1194
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,660
Actually, I have

1195
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,660
to get back to Med.

1196
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,120
Oh.

1197
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,690
Sure.

1198
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,560
Good night.

1199
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,910
Heads up, Choi.

1200
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,910
We're reviewing the Kaminsky

1201
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,910
case for tomorrow's M&M.

1202
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,970
Okay.

1203
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,070
I see you didn't put down

1204
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,070
a cause of death, yet.

1205
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,240
Something holding that up

1206
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,240
or is that just an oversight?

1207
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,920
Sorry, I just need

1208
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,920
to check something first.

1209
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,720
I need your John Hancock

1210
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,720
before the end of the shift.

1211
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,850
You'll have it.

1212
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,530
Well, if something caused

1213
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,530
this guy's epinephrine levels

1214
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,400
to spike, it's going to be

1215
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,400
on the adrenals,

1216
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,600
but I'm not seeing anything.

1217
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,670
Could you give them

1218
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,670
a closer look?

1219
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,580
Something's gotta be there,

1220
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,580
I know it.

1221
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,810
I'm not supposed to be doing

1222
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,810
this without a formal inquiry.

1223
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,820
I know, believe me.

1224
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,480
You're doing me

1225
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,480
a huge favor, Nina.

1226
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,560
You're gonna owe me

1227
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,560
for this one.

1228
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,590
All right, let's see.

1229
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,260
Well, I'll be darned.

1230
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,260
Huh. Look.

1231
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,830
I can't

1232
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,830
see anything.

1233
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,540
There's your culprit.

1234
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,540
Looks like a pheochromocytoma.

1235
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,840
It's too small

1236
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,840
to show up on the scans.

1237
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,980
Must have been what caused

1238
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,980
the high levels of epinephrine

1239
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,980
in this guy's system.

1240
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,650
So he died purely

1241
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,650
of natural causes.

1242
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,850
Sure did.

1243
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,850
Thank you.

1244
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,720
You're the best.

1245
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,630
Dr. Rhodes, hey,

1246
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,630
how's Dr. Bekker?

1247
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,630
Hey.

1248
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,970
She's hanging in there.

1249
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,970
I still can't believe it.

1250
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,370
She's usually

1251
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,370
the most careful

1252
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,370
surgeon at Med.

1253
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,880
Just not like her.

1254
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,880
Not at all.

1255
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,550
Anyway, good night.

1256
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,550
Yeah, good night.

1257
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,490
What's this?

1258
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,690
This is what killed

1259
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,690
Paul Kaminsky.

1260
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,030
An adrenal tumor.

1261
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,800
Okay.

1262
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,570
I am so sorry, April.

1263
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,570
That was wrong of me.

1264
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,830
No kidding.

1265
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,830
If I'm being honest

1266
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,830
with myself,

1267
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:06,610
I think I was hurt that

1268
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:06,610
you didn't trust me enough

1269
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:06,610
to read me in.

1270
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,480
And then I started

1271
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,480
to mistrust you as well.

1272
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,120
Well, maybe I shouldn't

1273
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,120
have cut you out.

1274
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:27,760
It's not easy working

1275
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:27,760
so closely with someone

1276
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:27,760
you've been involved with.

1277
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,260
But I'd like to think

1278
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,260
we can get past that

1279
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,540
and still be friends.

1280
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,710
I don't know, Ethan.

1281
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,750
You thought

1282
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,750
I could kill a patient.

1283
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,550
Is that someone

1284
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,550
I really want as a friend?

1285
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,660
I heard about

1286
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,660
what happened. You okay?

1287
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,500
What was stolen

1288
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,500
from your car today?

1289
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,370
Tell me the truth.

1290
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,340
Natalie, I don't know

1291
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,340
what you're talking about.

1292
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,610
All day I have been feeling

1293
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,610
like everything is a lie.

1294
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,170
It's the same feeling I had

1295
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,170
on our wedding day.

1296
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,840
Just tell me the truth.

1297
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,380
What was stolen

1298
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,380
from your car today?

1299
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,890
My gun.

1300
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,890
Your gun?

1301
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,950
You swore to me it was gone.

1302
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,260
I wanted to turn it in. I did.

1303
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,030
I just needed more time.

1304
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,400
Unbelievable.

1305
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,200
I didn't know

1306
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,200
how to tell you.

1307
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,670
I trusted you.

1308
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,070
You have every right

1309
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,070
to be angry with me.

1310
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,110
No, I don't want to hear

1311
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,110
any more lies.

1312
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,610
Natalie.

1313
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,610
It's over.

1314
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,950
You don't mean that.

1315
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,950
I do.

1316
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,120
Goodbye, Will.
