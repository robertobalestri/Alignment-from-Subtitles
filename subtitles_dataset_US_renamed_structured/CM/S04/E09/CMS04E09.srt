1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,740
Now keep your eyes

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,740
looking ahead. Both hands

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,740
under the pillow.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,610
Mmm-hmm.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,610
And stop.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,040
Then what?

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,580
Then you give the rings

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,580
to Mommy and me.

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,110
I'm gonna show her.

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,820
Mommy, Mommy!

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,410
Hey, you guys

12
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,410
aren't supposed to be in here!

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,820
You look beautiful.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,980
Aww. Thank you, my love.

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,460
Come here.

16
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,460
Give me a kiss.

17
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,590
I love you.

18
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,650
He's right.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,230
Don't you know it's bad luck

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,230
to see me before the wedding?

21
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,230
Yeah, sorry.

22
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,900
I'm not superstitious.

23
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,900
It's all right.

24
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,560
Wow.

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,270
Oh, don't step on it.

26
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,950
We're okay, right?

27
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,050
Yeah, we're okay.

28
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,130
I got to pick up my tux.

29
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,100
Hey, we're really

30
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,100
doing this, huh?

31
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,290
Absolutely.

32
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,130
Remember to make sure

33
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,130
your sleeves aren't too long.

34
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,230
Bye, Owen!

35
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,230
You're sure the sleeves

36
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,230
are the right length?

37
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,330
Not too long?

38
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,400
They're perfect.

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,640
What do you think?

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,640
Maybe different cuff links?

41
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,880
Okay.

42
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,880
Yeah.

43
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,020
Will, please.

44
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,290
Tim, I told you

45
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,290
over the phone, I can't.

46
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,590
You don't understand.

47
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,590
Pop fell again.

48
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,860
He's dizzy.

49
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,860
He's not walking right.

50
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,130
You gotta come see him.

51
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,790
You need to bring your dad

52
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,790
to the emergency room.

53
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,060
You know he won't do that.

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,830
You know

55
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,830
I'm getting married today.

56
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,900
This won't take long.

57
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,900
I promise.

58
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,040
Please, Will. He needs you.

59
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,720
All right,

60
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,720
let me get changed.

61
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,620
No, we don't have time.

62
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,620
Get the doc's stuff.

63
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,660
Come on, we'll drive you.

64
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,660
It'll be faster.

65
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,520
Come on.

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,550
Talk to me.

67
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,570
Knife in the upper chest.

68
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,570
GCS 12.

69
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,830
Passed out on the way in.

70
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,130
All right,

71
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,130
Trauma Two.

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,500
Minimal blood loss

73
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,500
in the field. BP 100/60.

74
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,870
86% on four liters.

75
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,630
How did this happen?

76
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,000
He broke into

77
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,000
some lady's house

78
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,000
and she stabbed him.

79
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,240
Ambo behind us is bringing

80
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,240
her in with a hand lac.

81
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,670
Not dressed

82
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,670
like a burglar.

83
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,010
More like a duffer

84
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,010
ready to tee off.

85
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,740
Ready? Let's go inside.

86
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,820
Let's transfer him

87
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,820
on my count.

88
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,350
Ready? One, two, three.

89
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,790
Okay, no breath sounds

90
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,790
on the right.

91
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,350
I need another 18 gauge line

92
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,350
in the chest tube

93
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,260
and let's get an AP

94
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,260
and a lateral chest X-ray

95
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,560
to see how deep

96
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,560
this knife goes.

97
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,560
Got it.

98
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,200
We got an ID on this guy?

99
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,260
No.

100
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,830
No, but we found this

101
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,830
in his pocket.

102
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,170
Can I see if I can get

103
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,170
an emergency contact off that?

104
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,940
Thank you.

105
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,670
Courtney, you're going to

106
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,670
Treatment Five.

107
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,180
The burglar's here,

108
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,180
too, isn't he?

109
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,810
Why was I brought

110
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,810
to the same hospital?

111
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,150
I assure you, ma'am,

112
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,150
you're completely safe.

113
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,950
Now please, walk me through

114
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,950
what happened again.

115
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,050
I was making breakfast

116
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,050
and then there he was

117
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
in the living room,

118
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
just rifling

119
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
through the cabinets.

120
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,150
Wait, where's my bag?

121
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,150
I have to call my husband.

122
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,490
I'll check the ambo.

123
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,950
Ready to transfer

124
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,950
on my count.

125
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,860
One, two, three.

126
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,260
Get it out.

127
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,490
Hello, Mrs. Young,

128
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,490
I'm Dr. Lanik.

129
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,130
How about I take a look

130
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,130
at that hand, hmm?

131
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,670
Please, can you call

132
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,670
my husband?

133
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,470
I have to make sure

134
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,470
he's okay.

135
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,100
His name is James.

136
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,100
James Young.

137
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
Calling him right now.

138
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,840
Here's her phone.

139
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,900
I'll take that.

140
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,390
Any luck

141
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,390
finding the husband?

142
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,060
Yeah.

143
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,290
That's him in Trauma Two,

144
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,290
the guy she stabbed.

145
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,630
What is this place?

146
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,290
One of my dad's

147
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,290
businesses.

148
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,270
Come on.

149
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,100
Pop?

150
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,870
The hell's he doing here?

151
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,530
I want him

152
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,530
to take a look at you.

153
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Today? With everything

154
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
that's going on?

155
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,210
Yeah, Mr. Burke, I got a few

156
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,210
things going on today myself.

157
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,550
This can't take long.

158
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,610
Well, you're already here.

159
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,610
So okay.

160
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,550
Let's have you sit down.

161
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,650
Got a John Doe.

162
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,220
GCS 3, intubated in the field.

163
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,630
Going to Baghdad.

164
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,060
Okay, BP 90/60,

165
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,060
heart rate 140s,

166
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,060
sats 99%.

167
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,360
Took three bullets. One

168
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,360
to the head, two to the torso.

169
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,400
Looks like some kind of

170
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,400
targeted hit.

171
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,670
Trigger the MTP.

172
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,230
All right.

173
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,710
Let's get him over

174
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,710
on my count.

175
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,070
One, two, three.

176
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,940
There we go.

177
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,340
Roll him.

178
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,480
Got one

179
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,480
through-and-through.

180
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,520
Don't see a second

181
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,520
exit wound. Back?

182
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,830
Bilateral breath sounds.

183
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,230
Let's get a fast scan

184
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,230
for his chest and belly.

185
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,860
And the head shot?

186
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,990
Wound is tangential.

187
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,990
Looks like he caught a break.

188
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,970
There's a lot of fluid

189
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,970
around his heart.

190
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,080
Same in the belly.

191
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,080
I got to open him up.

192
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,610
Tell them to prep

193
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,610
the hybrid OR.

194
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,670
Stapler?

195
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,880
It's not that

196
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,880
I don't want to go.

197
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,980
Of course not.

198
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,150
I'm fond of both

199
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,150
Dr. Manning and Dr. Halstead.

200
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,960
I want them to be happy.

201
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,960
Me, too.

202
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,960
But is it wrong

203
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,960
that I'm just

204
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,960
a little cynical

205
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,460
about the whole

206
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,460
institution?

207
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,620
Sharon,

208
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,620
I'm thrice-divorced.

209
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,220
Remember, you're preaching

210
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,220
to the choir.

211
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,430
How about this?

212
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,130
Hit the reception,

213
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,130
kiss-kiss,

214
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,370
sneak out to a movie.

215
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,570
Sounds like a plan.

216
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,570
Excellent.

217
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,450
Sharon.

218
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,450
Hey.

219
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,310
Weren't you trying

220
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,310
to get out of here

221
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,310
early today?

222
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,550
Yeah, I mean as soon

223
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,550
as all this gets squared away.

224
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,420
Police can't seem

225
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,420
to figure out

226
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,420
who the heck the victim is.

227
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,180
No, no, no, you go do your

228
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,180
maid-of-honor thing.

229
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,250
I'll take care of it.

230
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,250
Okay, thank you so much.

231
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,520
Listen.

232
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,260
I thought this was

233
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,260
a straightforward case

234
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,260
of self-defense.

235
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,700
Nothing straight forward

236
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,700
about it. That woman

237
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,700
is a nut job.

238
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,560
This is your department,

239
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,560
not mine.

240
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,640
I'm telling you, it's not him.

241
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,740
I mean, yes, that man looks

242
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,740
just like my husband, but...

243
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,970
But he's an imposter.

244
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,100
Exactly.

245
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,380
And you can

246
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,380
tell them apart how?

247
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,320
It's all the little things.

248
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,550
Like the way

249
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,550
he buttons his shirt

250
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,990
and the way

251
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,990
he nods his head.

252
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,490
It's not James. It's not

253
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,490
the man I love.

254
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,350
Anything like this

255
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,350
ever happened before?

256
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,450
No? Have you ever been

257
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,450
medicated for your thinking?

258
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,190
For hearing stuff

259
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,190
other people don't?

260
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,030
You think I'm crazy,

261
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,030
don't you?

262
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,300
Ah, it's not

263
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,300
my favorite term.

264
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,340
I'm a particle researcher

265
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,340
at Fermilab.

266
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,670
I do the Times crossword

267
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,670
every Sunday

268
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,370
without any help from Google

269
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,700
and I am well past the age

270
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,700
of onset for schizophrenia.

271
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,110
So how about you stop

272
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,110
trying to figure out

273
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,110
what's wrong with me

274
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,310
and help me figure out

275
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,550
what that imposter did

276
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,550
with my husband.

277
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,520
I told you. I don't want

278
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,520
to press charges.

279
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,680
Well, you have my card

280
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,680
if you change your mind.

281
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,250
Mr. Young?

282
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,230
I'm Dr. Charles

283
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,230
and I just talked

284
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,230
to your wife.

285
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,390
Is she okay?

286
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,390
No one's letting me

287
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,390
see her.

288
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,340
Her hand is fine.

289
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,340
I'm just still...

290
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,460
I'm still trying

291
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,460
to figure out

292
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,100
why she stabbed you

293
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,100
in the first place.

294
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,370
We've been happily married

295
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,370
for 29 years.

296
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,310
I have no idea why

297
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,310
she would do this.

298
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,550
Any changes to her health

299
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,550
recently of any kind?

300
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,550
Yes, Amber was diagnosed

301
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,550
with a pituitary adenoma

302
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,990
a month ago.

303
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,150
It's pushing

304
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,150
against her brain.

305
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,710
I'm very sorry

306
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,710
to hear that.

307
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,060
How is her treatment going?

308
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,060
Is the tumor operable?

309
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,720
Her doctors advised

310
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,720
against the surgery

311
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,260
because of where

312
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,260
it was located.

313
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,270
They're trying to shrink it

314
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,270
using medication.

315
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,160
Would one of those

316
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,160
medications,

317
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,160
by any chance,

318
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,970
be bromocriptine?

319
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,370
How do you know?

320
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,170
Bromocriptine

321
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,170
significantly boosts

322
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,170
the dopamine in the brain,

323
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,180
and that very well

324
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,180
could have something to do

325
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
with Amber's delusion.

326
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Delusion?

327
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,180
As strange

328
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,180
as it may sound,

329
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,050
your wife stabbed you

330
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,050
because, well,

331
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,020
she doesn't believe that

332
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,020
you are actually you.

333
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,350
She's under the delusion

334
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,360
that you've been replaced

335
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,360
by an imposter.

336
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,550
It's actually got a name,

337
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,550
too, in fact.

338
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,620
The Capgras delusion

339
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,620
and, well, imposter syndrome.

340
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,100
And this is all

341
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,100
a side effect

342
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,600
of the medication

343
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,600
she's taking?

344
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,300
I'm pretty sure

345
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,300
it is, yeah.

346
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,170
The doctor said her

347
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,170
medication's the only thing

348
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,930
keeping the tumor at bay.

349
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,300
What I want to do is put her

350
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,300
on a very mild antipsychotic

351
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,510
and I'd also like to have

352
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,510
one of our own neurosurgeons

353
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,810
review her scans.

354
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,740
Okay.

355
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,950
The longer a delusion lasts,

356
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,950
the harder it is to break.

357
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,420
Because this one

358
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,420
came on so suddenly,

359
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,190
I'm going to choose

360
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,190
to be optimistic

361
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,780
and I think that

362
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,780
you should, too.

363
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,570
Ethan is bringing

364
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,570
his ex to the wedding.

365
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,190
That doctor from the VA?

366
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,670
That sounds awkward.

367
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,140
That would make me insane.

368
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,140
If I were April, I wouldn't...

369
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,400
Doris, I can hear you.

370
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,400
Hmm?

371
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,040
We're just worried

372
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,040
about you, is all.

373
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,050
Don't be. I'm going

374
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,050
with Noah instead.

375
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,080
Okay.

376
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,080
April?

377
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,710
And we are going to

378
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,710
tear up the dance floor.

379
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,940
Okay.

380
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,120
Fire up the ultrasound,

381
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,120
would you?

382
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,680
So how long have you been

383
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,680
in labor, Lisa?

384
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,380
A couple of hours, maybe?

385
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,480
But the baby's not due

386
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,480
for three more weeks.

387
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,590
We decided to come

388
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,590
to Chicago as a mini-vacation

389
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,600
before the baby came,

390
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,600
but then this happened.

391
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's check

392
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,600
how far along you are.

393
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,400
Okay, so you're

394
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,400
really, really far along.

395
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,810
Nine centimeters?

396
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,180
Nope, fully dilated.

397
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,180
Ultrasound ready?

398
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,270
Yeah.

399
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,570
Ooh!

400
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,980
It's okay.

401
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,090
What?

402
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,090
What is it?

403
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,690
Your baby is

404
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,690
in a breech position.

405
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,490
It's upside down.

406
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,460
The baby is going

407
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,460
to be okay though, right?

408
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,260
We want to send you up

409
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,260
for a C-section.

410
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,770
I'll let OB know

411
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,770
we're on our way up.

412
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,630
Thanks.

413
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,630
It's gonna be fine.

414
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,900
I just felt something move!

415
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,760
Just breathe.

416
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,810
Okay, tell OB we need them

417
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,810
down here stat.

418
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,370
Lisa, your baby's coming

419
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,370
bottom first.

420
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,310
I can feel one leg

421
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,310
and not the other.

422
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,040
It's in

423
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,040
a very difficult position.

424
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,380
We don't have time

425
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,380
to go to the OR.

426
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,720
This baby has to be

427
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,720
delivered right here now.

428
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,500
Looks like a bullet

429
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,500
entered and exited

430
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,260
through the apex

431
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,260
of the left ventricle.

432
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,230
Heart's still beating,

433
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,230
but it looks empty.

434
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,360
This guy's a train wreck.

435
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,470
BP's dropping.

436
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,470
He's about to code.

437
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,570
All right, you got

438
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,570
a cross-clamp?

439
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,300
Here, do what I'm doing.

440
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,130
Clamp.

441
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,750
All right.

442
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,750
Pressure's better.

443
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,220
His belly's distended.

444
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,780
It's full of blood.

445
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,780
Give me a knife.

446
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,260
Got to find what's bleeding.

447
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,260
Page Dr. Bekker.

448
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,160
I need an extra set of hands.

449
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,450
Okay.

450
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,090
Extend your arms out

451
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,090
in front of you.

452
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,390
Palms up.

453
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,590
We done now?

454
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,260
You fell again, Pop.

455
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,260
It could be serious.

456
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,900
Joey?

457
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,960
Stop with the shredder.

458
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,960
It's giving me a headache.

459
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,070
How long have

460
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,070
you had the headache, Ray?

461
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,370
Eh, who knows?

462
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,140
Close your eyes.

463
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,180
Okay, relax.

464
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,660
Yeah, you have

465
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,660
some pronator drift.

466
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,250
It means your brain's

467
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,250
balance system is off,

468
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,890
which is consistent with

469
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,890
what we found on your MRI.

470
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,900
So the scans show old

471
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,900
subdural hematomas.

472
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,260
Hi, Tom.

473
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,560
What's he doing here?

474
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,040
I brought him here

475
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,040
to check on Pop.

476
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,010
You know what?

477
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,010
Good, good.

478
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,070
I swept the house.

479
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,470
Found this.

480
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,180
A bug?

481
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,480
How the hell did it get there?

482
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,040
I got a pretty good idea.

483
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,470
Agent Lee,

484
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,470
what the hell's going on?

485
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,970
Have you heard

486
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,970
from your brother?

487
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,260
No, not since

488
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,260
last night.

489
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,930
He wasn't answering his phone,

490
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,930
so we tracked it to here.

491
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,440
Found it

492
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,440
in the changing room.

493
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,840
Tailor said

494
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,840
he left in a hurry

495
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,570
with someone who fits

496
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,570
the description of Tim Burke.

497
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,080
Put out

498
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,080
an investigative alert.

499
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,270
I'm going to their house.

500
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,270
Already done.

501
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,370
Tim's not there.

502
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,370
None of them are.

503
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,310
We're fairly certain

504
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,310
Ray's found out

505
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,440
he's been under surveillance.

506
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,250
Do you know

507
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,250
where they are?

508
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,250
No.

509
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,980
I thought you flipped some guy

510
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,980
in Burke's organization?

511
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,420
We did, Shawn Corcoran.

512
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,420
But we can't reach him either.

513
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,410
Hey, Jay, I'm not sure

514
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,410
what you guys are up to,

515
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,440
but I'm thinking that

516
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,440
maybe Will lost

517
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,440
his phone or something

518
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,000
because he hasn't

519
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,000
returned my calls.

520
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,740
So if you could just

521
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,740
have him call me back,

522
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,680
that would be great.

523
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,680
Okay, thanks.

524
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,050
Honey, Will knows that

525
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,050
the photographer wants us

526
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,610
at St. Ursula's,

527
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,610
4:30, right?

528
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,020
I told you, Mom,

529
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,020
he's going to meet us there.

530
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,140
Okay.

531
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,650
Hey, there.

532
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,650
There she is.

533
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,280
Yeah.

534
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,280
No answer?

535
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,520
No, and if it was

536
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,520
just Will not answering,

537
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,960
it'd be fine,

538
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,960
but Jay, too?

539
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,430
I mean, what if they got into

540
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,430
an accident or something?

541
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,160
Oh, you really need to stop.

542
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,160
Maggie, I...

543
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,390
Look, your mother

544
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,390
just opened

545
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,770
a perfectly good

546
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,770
bottle of champagne.

547
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,140
Don't let it

548
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,140
go to waste. Come.

549
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,200
You know, I just...

550
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,870
I really don't have

551
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,870
a good feeling about this.

552
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,840
I mean, Will has been

553
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,840
so stressed lately.

554
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,610
You know, I'm gonna try him

555
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,610
just one more time.

556
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,840
No, you won't.

557
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,840
Just to be sure.

558
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,110
Natalie,

559
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,620
you're the one that

560
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,620
made a charge nurse

561
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,620
your maid of honor.

562
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,710
So this is what

563
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,710
you're gonna do.

564
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,080
You're gonna stop

565
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,080
freaking out

566
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,640
and you're gonna let

567
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,640
these ladies

568
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,090
turn you into

569
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,090
the most beautiful

570
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,090
bride ever.

571
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,620
Phone.

572
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,860
Yeah, and there's

573
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,860
the other arm.

574
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,530
Okay, Lisa, just give me

575
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,530
one more push.

576
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,830
I can't push any harder.

577
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,870
Yes, you can.

578
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,070
Breathe.

579
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,110
Dr. Patchefsky sent this

580
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,110
delivery tray down in advance.

581
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,010
Said she was on her way.

582
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,010
On her way?

583
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,140
Maybe 20 minutes or so.

584
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,480
Look, I don't have 20 minutes.

585
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,710
Yeah, I'll let her know.

586
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,810
What's happening now?

587
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,080
The head's entrapped.

588
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,350
I can't get it.

589
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,350
It won't flex.

590
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,480
Forceps.

591
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,490
Heart rate's

592
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,490
down in the 90s.

593
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,750
What does that mean?

594
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,050
The baby's just

595
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,050
a little in distress.

596
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,100
Her heart rate's dropping.

597
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,430
Come on, come on, come on.

598
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,700
Decels down to 75.

599
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,860
Okay, okay.

600
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,490
Breathe.

601
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,090
You're doing great.

602
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,610
Decels 63.

603
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,110
I think it's coming.

604
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,110
Yes.

605
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,110
Yes. There.

606
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,310
Okay.

607
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,110
Congratulations.

608
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,580
It's a baby girl.

609
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,520
Her head is so big.

610
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,620
That often happens

611
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,620
in delivery.

612
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,620
It's called molding.

613
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,420
Congratulations.

614
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,200
Nicely done.

615
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,200
You, too.

616
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,600
Dr. Choi,

617
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,600
something's happening.

618
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,810
Why is she shaking like that?

619
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,940
She's having a seizure.

620
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,070
Get me a neonate resuscitation

621
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,070
cart and 0.3 milligrams

622
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,070
of diazepam.

623
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,840
What's wrong with her?

624
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,410
We're going to find out.

625
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,610
I don't like this.

626
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,720
Tell me again,

627
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,720
tell me where

628
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,720
you're taking me?

629
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,090
Well, you took

630
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,090
the medication about

631
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,090
an hour ago, right?

632
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,920
So what are you

633
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,920
expecting to happen

634
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,330
aside from me feeling

635
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,330
a little sleepy?

636
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,590
Let's see, let's just

637
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,590
call it an experiment.

638
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,000
Amber, sweetie.

639
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,970
Oh, my God. I was

640
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,970
so worried about you.

641
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,910
What are you doing here?

642
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,840
What happened to you?

643
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,410
Amber,

644
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,580
you actually

645
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,580
did this to James.

646
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,480
You stabbed him.

647
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,480
You didn't know it was him.

648
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,450
What? No,

649
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,450
I stabbed an intruder.

650
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,820
It was me.

651
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,820
I would never do that.

652
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,150
You know

653
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,150
I would never...

654
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,320
I know. I know. I know.

655
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,590
It's not your fault.

656
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,650
I don't understand.

657
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,630
You experienced

658
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,630
a very rare side effect

659
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,670
from the medication

660
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,670
you're taking to control

661
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,670
the tumor in your brain.

662
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,400
It made you think that James

663
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,400
was somebody else,

664
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,740
an imposter.

665
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,710
He doesn't appear

666
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,710
that way to me now.

667
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,110
Well, that's because

668
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,110
I gave you a very mild

669
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,110
antipsychotic

670
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,650
to control the delusion.

671
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,020
So problem solved?

672
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,410
I told you.

673
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,980
Everything's going to be

674
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,980
all right.

675
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,800
Honey, are you okay?

676
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,090
Amber, what's the matter?

677
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,960
Amber!

678
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,660
Can I get a little help here?

679
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,660
A little help, please?

680
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,900
What's happening with my wife?

681
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,930
I've been racking my brain

682
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,930
as to how this bug got there.

683
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,440
Gotta agree with Tom.

684
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,480
You're the only person

685
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,480
who could've planted it.

686
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,610
That day

687
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,610
you gave me the EKG.

688
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,850
I could tell

689
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,850
you were nervous.

690
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,450
Ray, I swear I have never

691
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,450
seen that thing before.

692
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,920
I can't tell you how

693
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,920
disappointed I am.

694
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,530
I don't know

695
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,530
what to tell you.

696
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,030
Just know that while

697
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,030
I was treating you,

698
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,620
I was the best doctor

699
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,620
I could be.

700
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,600
That sounds like

701
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,600
a confession to me.

702
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,070
I wanted to give you

703
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,070
the MRI results.

704
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,470
You wouldn't answer

705
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,470
my calls.

706
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,940
Stop changing

707
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,940
the subject.

708
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,410
Listen to me, Ray,

709
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,410
you're slurring

710
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,410
your words.

711
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,040
Your balance is off...

712
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,040
That's enough.

713
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,740
We need to get you in

714
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,740
immediately to see

715
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,740
a neurosurgeon.

716
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,980
Stop.

717
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,880
You're not getting

718
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,880
yourself out of this.

719
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,680
Hey, Pop.

720
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,680
Not now, Tommy.

721
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,680
I'm busy.

722
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,790
What do you mean

723
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,790
he's in the hospital?

724
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,560
You said Corcoran

725
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,560
wasn't gonna be a problem.

726
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,100
I just found out myself.

727
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,040
I thought it'd been

728
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,040
taken care of.

729
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,200
We're not done here.

730
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,200
I want answers.

731
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,920
Throwing my last stitch now.

732
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,980
Let me know when I can remove

733
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,980
the cross-clamp.

734
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,050
Give me a second.

735
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,150
I'm still trying to locate

736
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,150
the source of this bleed.

737
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,030
Got it. Left kidney.

738
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,590
Metz?

739
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,370
All right.

740
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,500
There we go.

741
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,800
Clotting is still good.

742
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,540
I think we've got time

743
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,540
to close him up and

744
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,540
move him upstairs.

745
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,510
All right,

746
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,510
Number 1 Vicryl to me

747
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,980
and a looped monofilament

748
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,980
to Dr. Rhodes.

749
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,710
Dr. Rhodes, is your patient

750
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,710
stable at the moment?

751
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,780
I need to speak to you.

752
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,080
He is, but now's

753
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,080
not a good time, Jay.

754
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,650
This really can't wait.

755
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,020
I'll be done in an hour.

756
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,020
We can talk then.

757
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,490
Now, Connor. Right now.

758
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,830
What?

759
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,500
I need to speak

760
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,500
with your patient

761
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,500
as soon as possible.

762
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,730
Jay, you can't just

763
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,730
come in here

764
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,030
and interfere

765
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,030
with my surgery...

766
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,730
He's a material witness

767
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,730
in an ongoing investigation.

768
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,900
I don't care who he is.

769
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,900
Well, you need to.

770
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,440
His name is Shawn Corcoran

771
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,440
and the guys that shot him,

772
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,570
they're going to do

773
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,570
the same thing to Will

774
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,570
if I can't find him.

775
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,580
Will? What are you

776
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,580
talking about?

777
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,550
I can't get into the details,

778
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,550
but Will is missing

779
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,110
and this guy is our only lead

780
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,110
into where he might be.

781
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,890
This guy has just been

782
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,890
through a huge surgery.

783
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,260
I am really

784
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,260
not comfortable

785
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,760
waking him up

786
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,760
before he's ready.

787
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,090
I don't care, Connor.

788
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,090
Look,

789
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,000
even if I stop what I am doing

790
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,000
and lighten his sedation,

791
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,560
there is no guarantee

792
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,930
that he's going to be able

793
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,930
to communicate with you.

794
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,060
I'm sorry.

795
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,160
I get that it's a long shot.

796
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,160
I don't know what else to do.

797
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,600
I need your help.

798
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,080
All right, change of plans.

799
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,780
Let's pack, leave him open,

800
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,780
and get to the ICU.

801
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,380
I thought you wanted

802
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,380
to close and be done.

803
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,790
I reconsidered.

804
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,790
Patient's lost too much blood.

805
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,550
Best to get out and come back

806
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,550
another day.

807
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,950
Let's get

808
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,950
an abdominal VAC.

809
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,500
You guys got this?

810
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,500
Yeah.

811
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,660
So you just

812
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,660
changed your mind?

813
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,660
Yeah.

814
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,100
And that had nothing to do

815
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,100
with the conversation

816
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,700
you just had with Jay.

817
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,600
I don't like being

818
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,600
blind-sided like that

819
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,730
in the middle of the OR

820
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,510
and I really don't like

821
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,510
you shutting me out.

822
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,450
Trust me, it is better

823
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,450
you not knowing.

824
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,520
Why would you say that?

825
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,750
Because, Ava, if...

826
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,480
If something goes wrong,

827
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,280
you're going to want

828
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,280
deniability.

829
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,350
We're supposed to be

830
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,350
a team, Connor.

831
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,930
Fine. Let's talk in here.

832
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,700
Temp 102. Pulse 140s.

833
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,170
BP?

834
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,170
I don't know.

835
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,440
The reading's

836
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,440
all over the map.

837
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,810
160 over 101.

838
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,180
88 over 59.

839
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,440
Maybe I need

840
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,440
a different cuff.

841
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,540
No, it's labile.

842
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,350
What's happening to me?

843
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,150
You're having an adverse

844
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,150
reaction to the antipsychotic.

845
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,740
Okay, start a new IV.

846
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,690
Five liters of O2 bi-mask.

847
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,690
125 of dantrolene.

848
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,120
What? Does that mean that

849
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,490
the antipsychotic

850
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,490
doesn't work?

851
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,550
Based on the way

852
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,550
you're reacting,

853
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,620
I'd say, probably not.

854
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,860
But what about the delusion?

855
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,920
It'll likely return.

856
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,520
Here, I need you to breathe

857
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,520
into this, okay?

858
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,120
Tell the neurosurgeon to do

859
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,860
whatever he has to do

860
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,860
to take out the tumor.

861
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,910
Why don't we discuss this

862
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,910
after you're stabilized?

863
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,600
No, because

864
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,600
I'm clearheaded now.

865
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,600
I want the surgery.

866
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,670
You hereby have my consent.

867
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,040
Amber, your doctors have

868
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,040
advised against it.

869
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,100
It could kill you.

870
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,980
Even if the delusion

871
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,980
never goes away,

872
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,040
you could live

873
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,040
a long life.

874
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,350
We can figure out a way

875
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,350
for you and your husband

876
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,350
to coexist.

877
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,850
I don't want to coexist.

878
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,150
I want to love him.

879
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,230
Is our baby okay?

880
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,030
Did they say

881
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,030
when we'd be able

882
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,030
to bring her home?

883
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,440
I'm sure the doctors can

884
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,440
answer all of your questions.

885
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,570
We decided

886
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,570
to name the baby Esther.

887
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,040
It was Kevin's

888
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,040
grandmother's name.

889
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,670
It's very pretty.

890
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,370
Here she is.

891
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,080
Lisa, Kevin.

892
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,080
This is Dr. Watkins.

893
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,520
She's a neonatologist.

894
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,320
Hello.

895
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,150
How is she?

896
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,190
Mr. and Mrs. Jensen,

897
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,190
we've done some tests

898
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,190
on your daughter.

899
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,620
Your baby has something called

900
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,620
a Vein of Galen malformation.

901
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,060
It's a misconnection between

902
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,060
the arteries and the veins.

903
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,360
And that's why she had

904
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,360
the seizure?

905
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,800
Yes, in this case,

906
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,800
it caused a hemorrhage

907
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,800
that irritated the brain.

908
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,600
So you're saying she's sick.

909
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,610
What can you do

910
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,610
to fix her?

911
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,610
Normally, we could embolize

912
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,610
some of the vessels.

913
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,140
But I'm afraid the specific

914
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,140
anatomy of where they are

915
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,550
doesn't make that possible.

916
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,750
I don't understand.

917
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,420
It's not operable

918
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,060
and the bleeding

919
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,060
will only get worse.

920
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,390
We don't expect she'll survive

921
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,390
more than a day at this rate.

922
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,560
No. No. No!

923
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,030
Our baby's gonna die?

924
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,630
I'm afraid so.

925
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,070
I am so sorry.

926
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,210
There's a private room

927
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,210
next door.

928
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,080
We'll have her transferred

929
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,590
so you can be alone

930
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,590
with your daughter.

931
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,460
Pop! Go get Will!

932
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,460
No!

933
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,760
Get him now!

934
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,760
All right!

935
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,990
I got this!

936
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,360
Come here.

937
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,870
What's going on?

938
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,870
Now.

939
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,700
He just collapsed.

940
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,500
What the hell are we

941
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,500
supposed to do?

942
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,670
Check him out, Will.

943
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,270
Ray, can you

944
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,270
open your eyes?

945
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,640
I need a flashlight.

946
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,340
Your phone.

947
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,340
Oh, God.

948
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,620
His left pupil's sluggish.

949
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,210
Ray, did you hit your head?

950
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,390
He's unconscious.

951
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,390
It's getting worse.

952
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,520
What does that mean?

953
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,360
He's not responding

954
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,360
anymore.

955
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,330
There's a bleed in his head

956
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,330
putting pressure on his brain.

957
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,560
We have to get him

958
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,560
to the hospital now.

959
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,620
Call an ambulance.

960
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,170
Can't you fix him here?

961
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,190
You're kidding me. No.

962
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,170
The pressure in his skull

963
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,170
needs to be released.

964
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,230
Maybe we should take him

965
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,230
to the hospital, Tommy.

966
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,330
Don't be an idiot, okay?

967
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,330
Hospitals mean police.

968
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,570
Look, Pop is lying here.

969
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,570
No, no, no.

970
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,040
I'm making this decision.

971
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,650
Figure something out.

972
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,020
Now.

973
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,990
All right. I'm gonna need

974
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,990
a few things.

975
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,580
Then do it.

976
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,950
Oh...

977
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,050
I don't know

978
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,050
how much longer

979
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,050
I can work around

980
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,950
not having

981
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,950
a groom or best man.

982
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,080
Well, just take pictures

983
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,080
of the bride's family.

984
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,680
I don't have

985
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,680
a bride either.

986
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,530
Okay, we're...

987
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,500
We're working on it.

988
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,030
Hey. Come on.

989
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,010
Let's go get our

990
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,010
picture taken together.

991
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,200
I don't believe this.

992
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,210
Will was supposed

993
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,210
to be here an hour ago.

994
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,210
Is he standing me up?

995
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,210
No, no.

996
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,010
I'm convinced

997
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,010
that there's...

998
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,570
There's a logical

999
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,570
explanation to this.

1000
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,310
Like what, Maggie?

1001
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,780
I'm sorry.

1002
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,150
It's just, for the last month,

1003
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,150
he has been so secretive.

1004
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,660
Keeping things from me.

1005
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,280
I think he's backing out.

1006
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,530
Oh, my God.

1007
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,560
Oh, my God,

1008
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,560
all these people coming.

1009
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,000
Breathe.

1010
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,630
Am I gonna have to cancel...

1011
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,630
No.

1012
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,930
Am I gonna have to

1013
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,930
cancel the wedding?

1014
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,130
No. Give me a second,

1015
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,540
and let me see if I can get

1016
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,540
to the bottom of this.

1017
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,210
It's gonna be fine.

1018
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,410
Okay, turn around

1019
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,410
and sit down.

1020
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,510
Okay.

1021
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,640
Go ahead.

1022
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,220
Do the same

1023
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,220
with the bit.

1024
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,190
It'll be okay, Pop.

1025
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,190
Now just stay calm.

1026
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,980
All right,

1027
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,980
pass me the drill.

1028
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,940
How... How do you know

1029
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,940
where to put the hole?

1030
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,610
His MRI, the hematoma

1031
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,610
was just about here.

1032
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,020
It's just about?

1033
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,280
What, are you guessing?

1034
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,690
You want certainties?

1035
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,690
Let me bring him in.

1036
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,290
Will...

1037
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,470
You better guess right.

1038
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,970
Could you stop

1039
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,970
pointing that at me?

1040
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,600
It's best if my hands

1041
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,600
aren't shaking.

1042
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,580
Tim.

1043
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,490
I need you to hold his head

1044
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,490
as still as you can.

1045
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,790
There you go.

1046
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,960
If I go too deep, he's dead.

1047
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,290
My God.

1048
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,420
What did you do to him?

1049
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,430
What did you do to him, Will?

1050
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,070
You're all right, Pop.

1051
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,240
You're going to be all right.

1052
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,250
Temp's down to 99

1053
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,250
and her BP is normalizing.

1054
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,380
Thanks, Tanya.

1055
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,150
How long till you think

1056
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,150
she's stable enough

1057
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,150
for surgery?

1058
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,090
A couple hours, but

1059
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,090
take a look at these scans.

1060
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,030
Tumor's invading

1061
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,030
her cavernous sinus.

1062
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,030
There's a hell of a lot of

1063
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,030
blood vessels and nerves

1064
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,030
that pass through there.

1065
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,930
If you were to predict

1066
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,930
the likelihood of success...

1067
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,030
On a scale

1068
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,030
of one to 10, it sucks.

1069
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,700
Luckily, you're looking at

1070
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,700
the one guy in Chicago

1071
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,330
who might be able

1072
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,330
to pull it off.

1073
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,380
I understand your patient

1074
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,380
Amber Young wants to have

1075
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,180
an inoperable

1076
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,180
adenoma removed?

1077
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,380
Inoperable according

1078
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,380
to her primary surgeons.

1079
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,040
Sam here says he can do it.

1080
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,250
Ah, not so fast.

1081
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,340
No.

1082
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,090
I'm not okaying this until

1083
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,090
I hear it from her directly.

1084
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,590
I don't know

1085
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,590
if that's gonna be possible.

1086
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,990
She won't recognize you.

1087
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,690
If you do this surgery,

1088
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,690
she can die.

1089
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,430
Nope. I'm not gonna

1090
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,430
allow this.

1091
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,400
With all due respect

1092
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,400
Mr. Young,

1093
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,300
legally, it's not

1094
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,300
your decision to make.

1095
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,170
Just so we understand

1096
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,170
each other,

1097
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,500
I've already spoken

1098
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,500
with my lawyer.

1099
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,740
Understood.

1100
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,840
She completely

1101
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,840
understood the risks.

1102
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,150
I can't just unhear that.

1103
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,350
Are you absolutely certain

1104
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,350
that her Capgras

1105
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,910
has not impacted

1106
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,910
her decisional capacity?

1107
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,690
Look, I've been making

1108
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,690
these evaluations

1109
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,690
for 30 years.

1110
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,730
Sharon, I'm between a rock

1111
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,730
and a hard place here.

1112
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,990
I completely understand

1113
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,990
his point of view,

1114
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,500
but I'm legally and morally

1115
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,500
bound to honor her wishes.

1116
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,030
I'm sorry, Daniel.

1117
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,630
I can't open the hospital

1118
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,630
to a potential lawsuit.

1119
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,600
Without the husband's consent,

1120
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,270
it's not gonna happen.

1121
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,040
You sure we can't

1122
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,040
keep him here?

1123
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,710
He has a hole in his head.

1124
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,710
He's at risk of infection.

1125
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,580
He needs an ICU

1126
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,580
and antibiotics.

1127
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,640
Easy.

1128
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,590
Where do you think

1129
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,590
you're going?

1130
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,160
To the hospital.

1131
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,720
I gotta tell the doctors

1132
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,720
what we're looking at.

1133
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,390
No.

1134
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,200
Tommy, I swear,

1135
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,740
I'm not gonna say a word

1136
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,740
about this to anyone.

1137
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,970
Stay here.

1138
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,970
Clean this up.

1139
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,150
Wait!

1140
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,450
Tell the doctors he has

1141
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,450
a history of subdural

1142
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,450
hematomas.

1143
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,550
If they need to,

1144
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,550
they can call Med for the MRI,

1145
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,390
and keep him sitting up.

1146
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,190
April.

1147
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,190
Hello.

1148
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,800
Where are Kevin and Lisa?

1149
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,270
They left.

1150
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,800
But their baby's still alive.

1151
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,770
They just left her?

1152
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,770
How could they do that?

1153
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,280
They said it would be

1154
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,280
too painful to watch her die.

1155
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,310
So you spoke with them,

1156
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,310
and you let them leave?

1157
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,350
I would've stopped them

1158
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,350
if I could.

1159
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,620
How can they just

1160
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,620
abandon their child?

1161
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,380
They experienced

1162
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,380
a tragedy, April,

1163
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,220
and they couldn't cope

1164
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,220
with it,

1165
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,350
and there's no law

1166
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,350
to make them stay.

1167
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,860
This isn't right.

1168
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,860
No.

1169
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,520
But there's nothing

1170
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,520
we can do.

1171
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,800
I'm sorry.

1172
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,430
This baby's gonna die alone.

1173
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,070
She'll be on the monitors, and

1174
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,070
nursing will check in on her.

1175
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
No, that's not

1176
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
what I mean.

1177
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
You know that.

1178
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,650
She is alone.

1179
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,420
April, do you

1180
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,420
want me to stay?

1181
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,160
Go.

1182
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,710
Dr. Rhodes!

1183
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,880
I'm Mary Corcoran,

1184
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,880
Shawn's wife.

1185
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,040
When can I see him?

1186
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,380
I'm sorry,

1187
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,380
Mrs. Corcoran,

1188
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,280
but your husband's

1189
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,280
still in critical condition.

1190
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,150
We're certainly

1191
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,150
not out of the woods yet.

1192
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,350
Then why was he taken

1193
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,350
out of surgery?

1194
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,490
Um...

1195
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,000
We could only keep

1196
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,000
your husband on the table

1197
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,000
for so long.

1198
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,760
We did as much as we could,

1199
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,700
and then we had to give

1200
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,700
his body some time to recover.

1201
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,960
Now, hopefully, tomorrow

1202
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,960
we'll take him

1203
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,960
back to surgery,

1204
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,200
and we'll close him up.

1205
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,300
I have to run.

1206
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,310
I'm very sorry, but someone

1207
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,310
will come out and get you

1208
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,740
as soon as he's stable.

1209
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,520
We're running out of time.

1210
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,520
I gotta talk to this guy.

1211
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,780
I'm not sure

1212
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,780
how stable he is yet.

1213
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,520
You really want

1214
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,520
to wake him up?

1215
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,500
You got something

1216
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,500
he can write on?

1217
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,500
Mr. Corcoran, I'm

1218
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,500
Detective Jay Halstead.

1219
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,980
I gotta ask you

1220
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,980
a few questions, okay?

1221
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,540
Turn around.

1222
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,050
You don't have to

1223
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,050
do this, Tim.

1224
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,520
You know that.

1225
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,590
Yes, I do.

1226
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,520
Turn around.

1227
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,970
No.

1228
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,430
You don't think

1229
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,430
I'll do it? I will.

1230
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,410
I swear I will.

1231
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,270
This isn't who you are.

1232
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,270
Shut up!

1233
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,600
Shut up.

1234
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,480
You don't know me.

1235
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,980
I know you.

1236
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,020
We grew up together.

1237
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,320
Please, don't.

1238
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,090
Shut up!

1239
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,260
Will, are you all right?

1240
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,500
You okay?

1241
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,630
Call an ambulance.

1242
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,040
This is 21 George. Emergency

1243
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,040
shots fired by the police.

1244
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,100
Offender down.

1245
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,240
Call an ambo

1246
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,240
to our location.

1247
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,640
We're good.

1248
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,640
Let's go.

1249
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,110
Clear the building.

1250
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,790
Do we know what hospital

1251
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,790
Ray was taken to?

1252
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,390
Did you get the license

1253
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,390
of the car they were driving?

1254
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,800
No.

1255
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,030
Can this wait?

1256
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,730
We can still make it

1257
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,730
to the church.

1258
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,790
Come on.

1259
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,930
What is it that you guys

1260
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,930
aren't telling me?

1261
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,380
Dr. Rhodes?

1262
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,150
Detective Halstead asked me

1263
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,150
to forward a message.

1264
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,310
He says it's all good.

1265
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,480
Said you'd know

1266
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,480
what that means.

1267
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,580
I do. Thanks.

1268
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,690
Dr. Rhodes, your patient...

1269
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,460
What happened?

1270
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,970
Chest tube started

1271
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,970
dumping blood.

1272
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,270
Repair must have blown.

1273
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,370
He's still asystolic.

1274
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,370
Push another round of epi.

1275
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,140
He's already had four.

1276
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,880
There's nothing

1277
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,880
we can do, Connor.

1278
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,210
No...

1279
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,280
Time of death, 18:43.

1280
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,110
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1281
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,030
His blood pressure spiked.

1282
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,510
He came off the Diprivan

1283
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,510
pretty hard.

1284
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,610
Hey. Hey.

1285
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,290
You didn't really have

1286
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,290
a choice, Connor.

1287
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,460
How you feeling?

1288
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,200
Like I was hit by a truck.

1289
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,330
There is somebody outside

1290
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,330
who I think might make you

1291
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,330
feel a little better.

1292
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,240
Your husband.

1293
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,670
James.

1294
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,710
Hey, hon.

1295
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,590
How you feeling?

1296
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,590
You okay?

1297
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,260
You remember James.

1298
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,330
You look good.

1299
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,330
That's not my husband.

1300
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,460
Honey, please.

1301
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,130
That's not my husband.

1302
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,470
I thought you said

1303
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,470
my husband was here.

1304
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,340
Sweetheart,

1305
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,340
don't you see? It's me.

1306
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,240
It's not you!

1307
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,900
You are not my husband!

1308
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,280
No!

1309
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,280
Get away from me!

1310
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,380
That is not my husband!

1311
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,380
You are not my husband!

1312
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,820
It's okay. It's okay.

1313
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,360
That is not my...

1314
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,790
He's gone. He's gone.

1315
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,260
It's okay.

1316
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,530
James, I'm so sorry

1317
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,530
that that...

1318
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,870
It didn't go the way

1319
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,870
that we wanted it to.

1320
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,310
Don't be.

1321
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,570
You know how Amber and I met?

1322
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,750
It was April of '87.

1323
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,310
On a whim, I drove up

1324
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,310
by myself to Pontiac

1325
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,790
to catch a U2 concert.

1326
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,410
Scalped a nosebleed seat.

1327
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,980
Amber had done the same.

1328
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,980
The moment I saw her,

1329
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,980
I knew.

1330
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,830
Over 50,000 people,

1331
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,830
and I wind up sitting

1332
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,830
next to my soulmate.

1333
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,230
What are the odds of that?

1334
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,470
This won't stop us

1335
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,470
from being together.

1336
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,480
Maybe her tumor

1337
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,480
will go into remission.

1338
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,720
We'll find a way.

1339
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,960
I thought I was gonna be late.

1340
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,120
Oh...

1341
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,560
No.

1342
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,400
I heard somebody say

1343
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,400
the groom got delayed.

1344
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,960
Oh...

1345
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,340
What you got there?

1346
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,930
Rice?

1347
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,930
Millet.

1348
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,880
They say it's better

1349
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,880
for the birdies.

1350
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,940
I brought enough

1351
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,940
for you, too.

1352
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,210
Since when did you get

1353
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,210
so sentimental?

1354
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,780
Thank you, thank you,

1355
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,780
thank you.

1356
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,860
Natalie, it's Will!

1357
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,480
He's here. He's here.

1358
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,480
Will? Where?

1359
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,150
Right outside.

1360
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,490
Will?

1361
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,830
Oh, my God.

1362
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,130
Natalie!

1363
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,830
I didn't know what to think.

1364
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,370
I know. I'm so sorry.

1365
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,840
I'm so sorry.

1366
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,780
Are you bleeding?

1367
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,010
No, it's not mine.

1368
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,010
What happened?

1369
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,010
Where were you?

1370
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,450
There's so much

1371
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,450
I need to tell you.

1372
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,220
Dr. Halstead,

1373
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,220
we really need to go.

1374
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,320
"Go"? Go where?

1375
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,320
What is she talking about?

1376
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,160
They're taking me into

1377
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,160
protective custody.

1378
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,790
What? No!

1379
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,390
Will, come on.

1380
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,390
No!

1381
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,990
Jay, one minute.

1382
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,940
Will... No.

1383
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,840
I'll explain everything

1384
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,840
as soon as I can.

1385
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,500
Will...

1386
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,240
I love you, Natalie.

1387
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,710
Jay, what is happening?

1388
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,150
I'm sorry.
