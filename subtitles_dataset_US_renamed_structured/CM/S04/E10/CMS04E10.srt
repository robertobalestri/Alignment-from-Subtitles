1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,270
I thought

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,270
you'd never get up.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,270
Mmm. It's your fault.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,730
You kept me up too late.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,470
Mmm. Can you blame me?

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,530
Mmm-hmm.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,540
You didn't tell me

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,540
this thing tonight

9
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,540
was such a big deal.

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,310
Is it?

11
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,080
"City honors Gaffney Chicago

12
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,080
Medical Center tonight."

13
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,140
It's all about

14
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,140
your Hybrid OR.

15
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,590
Mmm. They must be

16
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,590
desperate for news.

17
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,120
The city officials

18
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,120
are gonna be there.

19
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,630
And the board.

20
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,530
Let's not go.

21
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,710
Let's stay home and...

22
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,830
No.

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,140
I am so with you there,

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,140
but we have to go.

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,210
At least make an appearance.

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,510
Couldn't you go without me?

27
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,310
Uh, no, absolutely not.

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,080
There wouldn't be Hybrid OR

29
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,080
if it wasn't for you.

30
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,620
I just don't feel like it.

31
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,860
I want you there.

32
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,330
You're my girl.

33
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,960
Then honor my wishes.

34
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,170
I'm not going.

35
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,750
I saw Ethan and Vicki

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,750
at Gibson's.

37
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,650
So?

38
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,650
Ethan's old girlfriend.

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,950
Or maybe new girlfriend.

40
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,780
I mean, she's beautiful.

41
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,750
A doctor and a naval officer.

42
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,020
How do you

43
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,020
compete with that?

44
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,790
I'm not competing

45
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,790
with that.

46
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,920
Ethan can see

47
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,920
whoever he wants.

48
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,860
Okay. So you're dating?

49
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,060
That's beside

50
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,060
the point.

51
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,120
So you're not.

52
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,670
It's so hard to meet people.

53
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,260
Get down!

54
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,850
My gun!

55
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,590
There's been a shooting.

56
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,760
Oh, my God! April? Brett?

57
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,760
Dennis Mitchell, 28,

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,040
unrestrained

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,040
motor vehicle collision.

60
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,600
You're going to Baghdad.

61
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,600
April?

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,800
April?

63
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,680
It's justice!

64
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm fine.

65
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,010
Bitches like you

66
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,010
just want me to suffer.

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,780
You're the enemy!

68
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,910
It's justice!

69
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,010
Patient is violent

70
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,010
and delusional. GCS 15.

71
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,610
BP is normal.

72
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,610
I'm gonna kill them all!

73
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,890
Dr. Choi, I need you

74
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,890
in Baghdad now.

75
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,020
What about April?

76
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,990
I'll take care of her.

77
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,990
Okay.

78
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,360
Dr. Charles.

79
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,630
Now!

80
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,630
Are you two all right?

81
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,890
Yeah.

82
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,890
Well, you've

83
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,890
been through

84
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,630
enough this morning.

85
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,630
Go home.

86
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,830
Yeah?

87
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,800
Thank you.

88
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,800
Okay, Monique?

89
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,930
Well, the ED's short now.

90
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,630
We'll manage.

91
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,940
I didn't get a scratch

92
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,940
thanks to April.

93
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,070
I don't feel right leaving.

94
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,010
Okay, it's up to you.

95
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,880
I'll take care of her.

96
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,880
Okay.

97
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,980
Left arm's deformed,

98
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,980
probably a humerus fracture.

99
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,020
Dr. Choi.

100
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,030
Fifty of fentanyl

101
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,030
for the pain.

102
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,860
They had it coming.

103
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,630
It's justice!

104
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,760
Dr. Charles, help me out.

105
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,570
Five of haloperidol.

106
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,630
They'll learn.

107
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,340
They'll all learn!

108
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,710
Breath sounds

109
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,710
present bilaterally,

110
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,710
multiple lacerations.

111
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,840
Looks like a displaced

112
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,840
chin implant.

113
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,080
Let's get his clothes off.

114
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,020
Gonna need X-rays.

115
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,690
Displaced pectoral implant.

116
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,190
Clear.

117
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,990
He's had a lot

118
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,990
of plastic surgery.

119
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,790
Chest is clear,

120
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,790
humerus fractures,

121
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,660
get a CVC, BMP, UA tox,

122
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,660
and order a CT head.

123
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,860
Got it.

124
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,540
Also a liver panel,

125
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,540
cardiac enzymes, and EKG.

126
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,910
A liver panel?

127
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,910
Gotta cover

128
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,910
all of our bases.

129
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,070
Dr. Choi.

130
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,770
Get that feminoid

131
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,770
out of here.

132
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,650
You're the enemy!

133
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,650
Okay. I was gonna

134
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,650
take him to lockup.

135
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,840
Sorry, Kim.

136
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,840
He's not ready yet.

137
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,580
Bitch!

138
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
While he's still here,

139
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,860
can we grab a psych eval?

140
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,620
Yeah, knock yourself out.

141
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,160
But I'm keeping

142
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,160
a police detail

143
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,160
on this guy.

144
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,370
Let me know

145
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,370
when I can talk to him.

146
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,570
I'm so sorry, April.

147
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,970
It's terrifying

148
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,970
to be shot at.

149
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,570
I can't believe

150
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,570
you were hit.

151
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,770
I'm fine.

152
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,640
Will you sign me off

153
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,640
to go back to work?

154
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,770
Really?

155
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,340
I don't even

156
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,340
need stitches. I...

157
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,340
I'd feel better.

158
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,720
Okay.

159
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,650
Just take it easy.

160
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,090
All right?

161
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,090
Thanks.

162
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,290
When are we gonna do something

163
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,290
about all these guns?

164
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,590
You all right, Miss Curry?

165
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,760
Everything okay?

166
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,600
My PhD project.

167
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,610
Reprogramming human

168
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,610
pluripotent cells into

169
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,610
hematopoietic stem cells.

170
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,610
Previous data had showed

171
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,610
successful induction of cells

172
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,610
into monocytes,

173
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,740
but I re-ran

174
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,740
the single-cell cytometry

175
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,880
and didn't detect any

176
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,880
CD34-positive cells, so...

177
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,110
I did something wrong,

178
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,110
I don't know.

179
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,880
It doesn't corroborate.

180
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,920
I didn't sleep

181
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,920
at all last night.

182
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,810
Hmm.

183
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,890
Didn't or couldn't?

184
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,590
What difference

185
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,590
does that make?

186
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,920
Dr. Charles,

187
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,920
while we're waiting

188
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,590
to get Dennis Mitchell to CT,

189
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,590
you can talk to him.

190
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,830
Why don't you take a break

191
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,830
from that and come help me

192
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,830
evaluate this patient?

193
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,670
The shooter? What do you

194
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,670
need to evaluate?

195
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,970
He's crazy.

196
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,740
Maybe, but, um, well,

197
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,740
there are different kinds

198
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,740
of crazy.

199
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,750
With very different

200
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,750
legal implications.

201
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,080
Mr. Mitchell.

202
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm Dr. Charles.

203
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,550
This is Student Doctor Curry.

204
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,550
You've had quite a day,

205
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,550
haven't you?

206
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,780
I bet you when you

207
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,780
woke up this morning

208
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,830
you didn't think

209
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,830
you were gonna end up here.

210
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,880
Does that feminoid

211
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,880
have to be here?

212
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,090
Excuse me?

213
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,730
Feminoid. Foid.

214
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,100
Tell her to get out.

215
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,960
Okay, you're gonna treat

216
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,960
Miss Curry with respect.

217
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,840
And you don't get to decide

218
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,840
who's in this room

219
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,840
or who isn't.

220
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,170
Do you understand me?

221
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,310
Okay, I'm gonna ask you

222
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,850
a couple of questions because,

223
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,850
well, 'cause I have to.

224
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,650
Um, just to check the boxes.

225
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,710
Have you ever been medicated

226
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,710
for your thinking?

227
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,980
No.

228
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,110
Have you ever heard voices

229
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,110
that other people don't?

230
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,660
No.

231
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,660
I do not hear voices.

232
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,660
Okay.

233
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,430
So, um, why don't you tell me

234
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,430
what happened this morning?

235
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,090
That Stacy got

236
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,090
what she deserved.

237
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,770
Bitch wouldn't even have

238
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,770
a cup of coffee with me.

239
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,640
Stacy?

240
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,640
They are in control.

241
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,830
They have sex

242
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,830
whenever they want it.

243
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,100
But no matter what I do,

244
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,910
they deny me.

245
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,680
Okay.

246
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,010
I deserve love.

247
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,740
But they won't

248
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,740
give it to me.

249
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,350
They only give it

250
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,350
to those shallow,

251
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,350
stupid alphas.

252
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,660
So besides being

253
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,660
a rabid misogynist,

254
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,660
what kind of crazy is he?

255
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,700
Well, he was using

256
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,700
certain buzzwords

257
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,700
that could be telling.

258
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,600
You know, Stacy, feminoid.

259
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,300
Made me wonder if he has

260
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,300
an online presence.

261
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,860
Could you check

262
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,860
that out for me?

263
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,740
Dr. Charles,

264
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,740
I am extremely busy.

265
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,870
Oh, okay.

266
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,310
Well, in that case, um,

267
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,070
I guess now

268
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,070
you're even busier.

269
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,550
Maggie.

270
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,550
Yeah.

271
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,150
I'm starting to think

272
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,150
that maybe this wasn't

273
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,150
a random shooting.

274
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,320
Could you look and see

275
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,320
if Mr. Mitchell

276
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,720
has ever been a patient

277
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,720
in this hospital before?

278
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,920
Sure thing.

279
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,120
Thank you.

280
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,390
Come in.

281
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,700
Dr. Manning,

282
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,700
this is Agent Lee.

283
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,000
I've been overseeing

284
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,000
Dr. Halstead's relocation

285
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,940
in Witness Protection.

286
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,470
I know who you are.

287
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,910
Well, I'll leave

288
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,910
you two to talk.

289
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,110
I know things have been

290
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,110
difficult for you.

291
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,880
You guys wouldn't tell me

292
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,880
where he was.

293
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,850
You wouldn't even

294
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,850
let me speak to him.

295
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,180
I'm sorry. That's

296
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,180
standard procedure.

297
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,880
Was it standard procedure

298
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,880
to take him away

299
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,880
on our wedding day?

300
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,450
It was for his own safety.

301
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,460
If it's any consolation,

302
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,460
Dr. Halstead did the FBI

303
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,460
a great service.

304
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,900
Because of him we were able

305
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,900
to bring some very bad people

306
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,900
to justice.

307
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,990
Why are you here?

308
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,660
The Burkes

309
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,660
are incarcerated.

310
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,640
We've determined it's safe

311
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,640
for Dr. Halstead

312
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,170
to return to Chicago.

313
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,880
Will's coming home?

314
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,640
Yes.

315
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,550
You should know there may be

316
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,550
a period of adjustment.

317
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,610
Meaning?

318
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,210
He's had a traumatic

319
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,210
experience

320
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,690
and he's been cut off

321
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,690
from his friends and family.

322
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,810
Some people

323
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,810
re-integrate easily.

324
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,650
Some don't.

325
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,560
Call me if you have

326
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,560
any questions.

327
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,430
Hey. You're working?

328
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,800
Yes, Natalie cleared me.

329
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,140
You should go home.

330
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,140
Ethan, I'm fine.

331
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,840
Leah? Talk to me,

332
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,840
what do we got?

333
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,580
Ivy Davis.

334
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,580
30 weeks pregnant,

335
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,580
pre-term labor.

336
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,120
All right. We're gonna

337
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,120
get you a doctor, okay?

338
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,810
Dr. Manning,

339
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,810
you're going to 6.

340
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,320
Page OB.

341
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,320
On it.

342
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,250
She can't have

343
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,250
this baby right now.

344
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,250
You have to stop it.

345
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,450
She has

346
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,450
a pre-existing aneurysm.

347
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,050
If she pushes,

348
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,050
it could kill her.

349
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,650
All right, help me

350
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,650
get her into the bed.

351
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,720
Why wasn't the aneurysm

352
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,720
treated earlier?

353
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,230
It's small.

354
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,960
She's not supposed to be

355
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,960
in labor right now.

356
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,120
We have a C-section scheduled.

357
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,290
But not for two more months.

358
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,390
Heart rate 97.

359
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,200
BP 128/73.

360
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,200
Shh.

361
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,260
It's okay. Breathe.

362
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,240
Let's start a magnesium drip,

363
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,240
embolus four grams.

364
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,900
Got it.

365
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,900
And 12.5 milligrams

366
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,200
of betamethasone IM,

367
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,110
and 100 milligrams

368
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,110
of indomethacin PO.

369
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,240
Ivy, we need to give you

370
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,240
this pill, okay?

371
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,250
It's gonna help stop

372
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,250
your contractions.

373
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,720
OB said that they'll be down

374
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,720
as soon as they can.

375
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,840
Okay.

376
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,410
Okay, hold on. You're okay.

377
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,320
You're doing great.

378
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,320
Just breathe.

379
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,790
Don't push, don't push!

380
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,060
No, no, no!

381
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,100
Dr. Manning, no pulse.

382
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,970
Bag her.

383
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,140
Ivy...

384
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,740
Still no pulse.

385
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,470
Ivy.

386
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,610
Ivy. Honey.

387
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,850
Asystole.

388
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,440
Take over compressions.

389
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,440
What is happening?

390
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,550
Honey, hey.

391
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,720
Her pupils are fixed

392
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,720
and dilated.

393
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,090
I am so sorry,

394
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,630
but her aneurysm

395
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,630
must have ruptured.

396
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,820
No, but she's still...

397
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,390
I'm sorry.

398
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,390
Your wife is gone.

399
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,560
But we need

400
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,560
to get the baby out.

401
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,400
It still has

402
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,400
a chance. Okay?

403
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,830
We got four minutes.

404
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,830
Start the four-minute clock.

405
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,200
Where is OB?

406
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,200
Can't wait.

407
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,900
I need to do

408
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,900
the C-section myself.

409
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,740
Angel, take over compressions.

410
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,900
Ivy. Ivy.

411
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,640
Honey.

412
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,640
Diane, get OB here.

413
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,840
Sir, I need you

414
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,840
to step out

415
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,310
so we can

416
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,310
deliver this baby.

417
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,310
Wait a minute.

418
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,850
Please save our baby. Please.

419
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,180
Get me a scalpel.

420
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,280
Scalpel.

421
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,040
Okay.

422
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,810
Suction.

423
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,620
She's cyanotic.

424
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,520
Ready to transfer.

425
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,930
Angel?

426
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,700
Sats at 78.

427
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,670
She's still unresponsive.

428
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,670
I might need to intubate.

429
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,570
Hold on.

430
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,480
Sats at 88 and climbing.

431
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,810
Heart rate 160.

432
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,680
She's coming around.

433
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,680
Call Neonatology.

434
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,980
Have them come meet us

435
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,980
in the NICU.

436
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,250
I'm on it.

437
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,250
Keep stimulating.

438
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,590
I want this baby

439
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,590
alert and moving.

440
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,590
Tell me.

441
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
You have a little baby girl.

442
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,330
We were able

443
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,330
to get her out in time,

444
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,560
but she does need

445
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,560
to go up to the NICU.

446
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,430
If you would like to spend

447
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,430
some time with your wife...

448
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,170
Monique can take you up

449
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,170
when you're ready.

450
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,780
I am so sorry for your loss.

451
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,900
Ethan! Ethan.

452
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,490
Hey.

453
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,490
Vicki.

454
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,870
I heard there was

455
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,870
a shooting

456
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,870
at the hospital.

457
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,930
They said

458
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,930
a nurse was injured.

459
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,130
It wasn't April, was it?

460
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,570
Yeah, it was.

461
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,970
She wasn't badly hurt.

462
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,580
Ethan, I...

463
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,580
Vicki.

464
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,580
It's over

465
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,580
between April and me.

466
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,310
Is it?

467
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,750
I mean, I know

468
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,750
it can't be easy.

469
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,020
You see her every day

470
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,020
and I completely understand...

471
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,720
It's over.

472
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,020
Okay?

473
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,900
Gotta get back to work.

474
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,690
Okay.

475
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,030
I'll see you for dinner.

476
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,070
Yeah.

477
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,290
Monique.

478
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,090
Did the shooter

479
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,090
Dennis Mitchell

480
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,090
look familiar to you?

481
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,460
I didn't really get

482
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,460
a good look at him.

483
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,460
Turns out

484
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,460
he was a patient here.

485
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,700
Oh, my God.

486
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,400
Maggie, I do remember him.

487
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,560
Yeah.

488
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,410
Your work-up

489
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,410
is negative.

490
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,610
He's cleared for you

491
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,610
to lock him up.

492
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,550
I'll call Burgess.

493
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,550
We'll get him out of here.

494
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,590
Dr. Choi, he was complaining

495
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,590
about his left hand.

496
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,850
Said it feels funny.

497
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,050
What do you mean funny?

498
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,560
It feels dead.

499
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,200
Pulse is diminished.

500
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,670
It's a soft sign

501
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,670
for a humerus fracture.

502
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,140
The artery needs

503
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,140
to be evaluated.

504
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,770
Can't release him yet.

505
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,880
Dr. Charles,

506
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,880
Dennis Mitchell

507
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,880
was a patient here.

508
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,620
Really?

509
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,620
Six months ago.

510
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,390
He came in with an infection

511
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,390
after some plastic surgery.

512
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,620
Monique was his nurse.

513
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,630
She asked to be replaced

514
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,630
by a male nurse

515
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,630
after Mr. Mitchell made a pass

516
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,630
at her insisting they go out.

517
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,190
Huh. Okay, thank you.

518
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,190
Yeah.

519
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,660
And order a CTA of his

520
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,660
left subclavian artery.

521
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,730
Hey, you do realize

522
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,730
it's upsetting to everyone

523
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,500
he's still in the hospital.

524
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,500
Can't help that.

525
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,340
It looks like you're

526
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,340
bending over backwards

527
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,340
to keep him here.

528
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,670
Are all these tests

529
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,670
really necessary?

530
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,740
He shot you, April.

531
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,740
He could have killed you.

532
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,340
I know that.

533
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,340
Don't tell me

534
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,340
how to practice medicine.

535
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,320
Okay.

536
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,750
Hey, Maggie, I just

537
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,750
heard about April.

538
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,750
Is she doing all right?

539
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,810
She said she's okay.

540
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,330
Back at work.

541
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,760
Yeah, what a thing

542
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,760
to go through.

543
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,020
Yeah.

544
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,660
Congratulations.

545
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,200
Front page of the Metro.

546
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,320
Wow.

547
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,870
Well, I'm sorry

548
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,870
we don't have any cases

549
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,870
worthy of your talents,

550
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,130
but since you're

551
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,130
still a trauma surgeon

552
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,130
on my service...

553
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,070
Kid in 5.

554
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,340
Goofing around

555
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,340
with a nail gun,

556
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,340
put one in his chest.

557
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,580
Hello, Mr. Bennett.

558
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,450
Hey, Davey. I'm Dr. Rhodes.

559
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,790
Am I gonna die?

560
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,790
No.

561
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,980
No, you're not.

562
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,980
No, your dad is right.

563
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,580
We're gonna fix you up

564
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,580
as good as new.

565
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,650
I thought the nail gun

566
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,650
was out of reach.

567
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,320
I should have

568
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,320
been more careful.

569
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,660
Really, he's gonna be fine.

570
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,340
So I see that Dr. Lanik

571
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,340
gave him some morphine.

572
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,460
How you feeling, Davey?

573
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,730
It hurts when I breathe.

574
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,800
My poor boy.

575
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,370
Well, that makes sense.

576
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,770
According to your X-ray,

577
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,340
the nail hit a rib.

578
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,340
A rib?

579
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,610
His vitals are fine.

580
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,580
There's no obvious blood

581
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,580
in his chest.

582
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,550
If you were an adult,

583
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,550
I would take the nail out

584
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,750
right here and now.

585
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,580
But given Davey's age, I would

586
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,580
rather do it up in the OR.

587
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,420
So it is serious.

588
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,820
Dad, I don't

589
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,820
want a surgery.

590
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,820
No, no, no.

591
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,560
I just think that Davey

592
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,560
would be more comfortable

593
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,760
if he were under

594
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,760
general anesthetic.

595
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,490
So as soon as an OR is open

596
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,490
and it's ready,

597
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,700
I'm gonna

598
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,700
take you upstairs,

599
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,700
all right?

600
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,570
And in the meantime, um,

601
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,070
I would try and stop

602
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,070
worrying so much, okay?

603
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,170
And you, I'm gonna

604
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,170
get you something

605
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,510
to make you feel

606
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,510
a little better.

607
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,950
So you hang in there, okay?

608
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,680
Dr. Charles, I, uh...

609
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,480
I have the stuff

610
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,480
on the shooter

611
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,480
that you asked for.

612
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,850
Oh, great.

613
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,650
Well, wait.

614
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,650
Where you going?

615
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,200
I don't know

616
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,200
how to work these.

617
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,590
Have a seat.

618
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,130
Okay.

619
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,170
Man, PhD and an MD

620
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,170
at the same time?

621
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,370
I mean, no wonder

622
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,370
you're exhausted.

623
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,700
I can only imagine.

624
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,840
Yeah, well, I'm used

625
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,840
to working hard.

626
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,010
Yeah, clearly. Show me.

627
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,780
Okay. So, um...

628
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,650
Dennis Mitchell has a history

629
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,650
on various message boards.

630
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,420
He calls himself

631
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,420
an "incel,"

632
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,480
an involuntary celibate.

633
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,450
Loser guys who think women

634
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,450
are unjustly denying them sex.

635
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,760
Yeah, ironically, the term

636
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,760
was coined by a woman.

637
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,690
She started a website

638
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,690
for lonely people.

639
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Uh, this is

640
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
one of his first entries.

641
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,390
"I can't attract girls.

642
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,530
"My legs are skinny.

643
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,530
My chest is weak."

644
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,800
Then he posts pictures.

645
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,810
And, um, some guy named

646
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,810
Apeman writes back...

647
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,310
"Bro, this is fixable.

648
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,640
"Pectoral augmentation.

649
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,640
Calf augmentation."

650
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,450
Yep, then he spends

651
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,450
over $10,000 on surgeries.

652
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,780
Rhinoplasty, the chin implant,

653
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,780
it's unbelievable.

654
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,190
He thinks this will make him

655
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,190
more desirable.

656
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,560
Yeah. People who

657
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,560
don't feel loved

658
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,560
will do some crazy things.

659
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,030
Well, it didn't work.

660
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,560
This is him a month ago.

661
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,390
"No matter what I do,

662
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,590
"women deprive me of my right

663
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,590
to sexual pleasure.

664
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,730
"They are the enemy

665
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,730
and it's time to get even."

666
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,730
Then he posted this

667
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,730
yesterday.

668
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,610
I'm 28 years old

669
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,610
and I'm still a virgin.

670
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,970
Women treat me like I'm scum.

671
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,570
I will slaughter them.

672
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,570
I am the true alpha male.

673
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,380
And I will make them pay.

674
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,310
It's an epidemic.

675
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,550
Wait, what is?

676
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,920
Loneliness.

677
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,660
Despite the intubation,

678
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,660
she's still not oxygenating.

679
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,430
I'm hearing a grade 3

680
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,430
systolic ejection murmur.

681
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,670
EKG shows left ventricular

682
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,670
hypertrophy.

683
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,230
Samantha, transducer.

684
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,580
Tricuspid atresia.

685
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,950
And an atrial septal defect.

686
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,460
Do you want to

687
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,460
tell the father,

688
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,460
or should I?

689
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,120
I will.

690
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,010
We never should have

691
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,010
tried to have kids.

692
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,780
But Ivy wanted

693
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,780
a baby so badly.

694
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,190
And now she's gone.

695
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,650
I'm so sorry.

696
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,060
There is something I need

697
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,060
to discuss with you.

698
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,920
We've examined

699
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,920
your little girl...

700
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,490
Sophie.

701
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,860
We were gonna

702
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,860
name her Sophie.

703
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,560
There's a problem

704
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,560
with Sophie's heart.

705
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,400
It's missing

706
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,400
its tricuspid valve.

707
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,200
Normally the valve opens

708
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,200
and closes like a door.

709
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,000
But Sophie's door is closed.

710
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,840
So when she's a little bigger,

711
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,840
she'll need a surgery.

712
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,240
But in the meantime,

713
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,240
she needs an operation

714
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,180
called pulmonary artery band.

715
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,770
It's urgent.

716
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,770
Urgent.

717
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,250
Do we have your consent?

718
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,350
Yes.

719
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,690
Thank you.

720
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,690
Yeah.

721
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,520
Doctor...

722
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,920
Please save my little girl.

723
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,040
Natalie. Trauma 2.

724
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,040
You got a chart?

725
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,140
Just go in.

726
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,440
Okay.

727
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,440
Yeah.

728
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,520
Will?

729
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,990
Natalie.

730
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,660
Agent Lee said

731
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,660
you were coming back.

732
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,500
I didn't know it was today.

733
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,370
Yeah.

734
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,570
I have been so angry at you.

735
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,070
I don't blame you.

736
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,180
I'm sorry.

737
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,720
For everything. All of it.

738
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,530
I didn't know how I'd feel

739
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,530
when I saw you.

740
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,730
And?

741
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,330
Will.

742
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,140
I've missed you so much.

743
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,210
It was terrible without you.

744
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,850
I thought about this moment

745
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,850
every day.

746
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,480
You're really here.

747
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,710
All right.

748
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,710
An OR opened up.

749
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,240
What do you say we get that

750
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,240
nail out of your chest, huh?

751
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,750
I don't want an operation.

752
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,840
Can't you just give me

753
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,840
some medicine?

754
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,180
He's really scared.

755
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,880
You're gonna be asleep.

756
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,880
It won't hurt a bit.

757
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,080
I promise you.

758
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,080
I tell you what.

759
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,880
How 'bout if I'm

760
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,880
right there with you?

761
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,580
Mr. Bennett, I'm sorry,

762
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,580
but that's not...

763
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,710
I want my daddy.

764
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,050
I've heard of parents

765
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,050
in the operating room

766
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,920
with their kids.

767
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,920
It's not a common practice,

768
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,720
and really it's only while

769
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,720
the child's being put under.

770
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,160
Okay, that's fine. Please.

771
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,890
I am all he has.

772
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,460
It's just the two of us

773
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,460
since his mom died.

774
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,040
Yeah. Okay.

775
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,600
But just until he's asleep.

776
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,600
Okey-dokey, let's go.

777
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,110
Sophie did really well.

778
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,380
She'll need to stay here

779
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,380
for a couple more weeks

780
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,120
and then you can

781
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,120
take her home.

782
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,920
Until she's big enough

783
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,920
to tolerate the surgery.

784
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,430
She's so little.

785
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,360
Yeah, but she's

786
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,360
gonna be fine.

787
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,200
Is there anyone you would

788
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,200
like us to call for you?

789
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,170
Family? Friends?

790
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,800
My wife's family, I...

791
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,100
I still have to tell them.

792
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,670
Do they live close by?

793
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,670
Can they come be with you?

794
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,150
No, we just moved to Chicago.

795
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,700
Is there anyone local

796
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,150
who could help you

797
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,150
with the arrangements?

798
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,780
No.

799
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,050
I know hardly anyone here.

800
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,020
I'll get you some information.

801
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,080
Okay?

802
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,080
Thank you.

803
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,690
So we watched

804
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,690
the last video

805
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,690
you posted.

806
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,730
Where you said

807
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,730
you wanted revenge.

808
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,590
People should pay

809
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,590
for what they did to me.

810
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,400
What they did to you?

811
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,670
I'm sorry, Mr. Mitchell. Um...

812
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,370
So obviously, you feel like

813
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,370
you've been wronged.

814
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,970
What I'm curious about is

815
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,970
if you're experiencing any...

816
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,940
Any regret for what

817
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,940
you did today.

818
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,690
Yeah.

819
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,190
I have regrets.

820
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,190
I wish I'd killed them all.

821
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,190
You're disgusting.

822
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,720
You are. You're...

823
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,720
Miss Curry.

824
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,820
Pathetic, you're lonely...

825
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,820
Miss Curry, enough.

826
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,300
Nobody loves you, poor you.

827
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,460
That doesn't give you...

828
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,460
You shut up!

829
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,560
...the right to shoot people

830
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,560
except maybe yourself!

831
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,100
What the hell are you doing?

832
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,800
How could you take

833
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,800
his side in there?

834
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,070
"Obviously you feel like

835
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,070
you've been wronged?"

836
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,800
I'm not taking his side.

837
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,710
I'm trying to determine

838
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,710
if he feels remorse

839
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,710
for his actions.

840
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,870
I hate him.

841
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,870
Well, this isn't about you.

842
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,210
This is a hospital.

843
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,050
And that's a patient

844
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,050
who I'm trying to evaluate.

845
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,850
A task you just made

846
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,850
infinitely more difficult.

847
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,750
No, you are not trying

848
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,750
to evaluate him.

849
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,260
You just are trying

850
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,260
to find some excuse

851
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,880
so that he doesn't pay

852
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,880
for what he did.

853
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,190
So that he doesn't

854
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,190
go to prison.

855
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,250
Miss Curry,

856
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,250
what he did was terrible.

857
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,090
But as abhorrent

858
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,090
as we find his actions,

859
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,000
our job is to try

860
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,000
and understand

861
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,000
his mental state.

862
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,360
I don't know what

863
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,360
you want from me.

864
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,800
All right? I... I...

865
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,800
I am doing the best

866
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,800
that I can.

867
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,100
I...

868
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,200
Dr. Choi?

869
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,870
Mr. Mitchell's scans.

870
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,210
Call Vascular, tell them

871
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,210
we're bringing a patient up.

872
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,020
We need to take him

873
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,020
to surgery right now.

874
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,720
One of your pectoral implants

875
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,720
damaged the axillary artery

876
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,850
and you've developed

877
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,850
what we call

878
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,850
a pseudoaneurysm.

879
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,290
If it ruptures,

880
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,290
you could bleed to death.

881
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,620
Bleed to death?

882
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,230
Go.

883
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,520
Davey, can you count down

884
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,520
from 10?

885
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,010
Ten.

886
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,780
Nine...

887
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,490
Okay, Beth, why don't you

888
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,490
show Mr. Bennett

889
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,120
the waiting room?

890
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,060
Sir, let's have you

891
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,060
wait outside.

892
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,060
Just...

893
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,670
I'm in.

894
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,670
Sir?

895
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,970
It's okay.

896
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,850
Airway pressures are up.

897
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,780
Having trouble ventilating.

898
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,720
BP 88/60, heart rate 144.

899
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,220
What's going on?

900
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,020
No breath sounds on the left.

901
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,020
Tension pneumothorax.

902
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,390
What is that?

903
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,900
Get me a needle to decompress

904
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,900
and open a chest tray.

905
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,060
I'm guessing the nail poked

906
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,060
a small hole in the lung

907
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,860
and the pressure from

908
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,860
the ventilator is forcing

909
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,860
air into his chest.

910
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,930
We can deal with it.

911
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,100
What... What are you

912
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,100
doing to him?

913
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,160
Sir...

914
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,160
Dylan, I need you

915
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,140
to get out of here.

916
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,140
I am not leaving!

917
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,940
Scalpel.

918
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,940
Sir!

919
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,740
Sir!

920
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,740
Tube.

921
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,710
No. No, no, no.

922
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,710
Sir, come!

923
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,010
No, take that out!

924
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,010
No, you are hurting him!

925
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,640
Stop! Let go!

926
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,640
You're killing him!

927
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,880
Marty, help me!

928
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,880
You are killing my son!

929
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,290
Come on, Marty...

930
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,960
Call security

931
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,960
and get him out of here.

932
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,400
He pushed

933
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,400
the tube in too far.

934
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,830
It caused a laceration

935
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,830
in the chest.

936
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,390
We need to open Davey up.

937
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,870
Hang a unit,

938
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,870
call the blood bank,

939
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,270
and page Dr. Bekker,

940
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,270
I need her now.

941
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,310
Watch his stats, Marty.

942
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,310
Pressure's good.

943
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,310
He's stable for now.

944
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,150
You allowed a parent

945
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,150
in the OR for a trauma case?

946
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,750
You can give me

947
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,750
the lecture later.

948
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,620
What have we got?

949
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,730
Chest tube lacerated

950
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,730
the left ventricle.

951
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,260
I've got my finger

952
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,260
in the dike,

953
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,260
I need you to sew.

954
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,730
Well, Daddy sure cocked

955
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,730
this up, didn't he?

956
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,100
Load up a 4-0 Prolene

957
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,100
with pledgets for Dr. Bekker.

958
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,330
All right.

959
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,170
Here you go.

960
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,170
Thanks.

961
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,260
Will.

962
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,260
Hey.

963
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,390
Sorry. Thanks.

964
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,990
Yeah, man. Sorry.

965
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,770
Oh, just a little

966
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,770
jumpy, I guess.

967
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,140
Welcome back.

968
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,210
Yeah, thanks.

969
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,110
Where were they

970
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,110
keeping you?

971
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,710
Phoenix.

972
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,640
Better weather

973
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,640
than Chicago, right?

974
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,950
I didn't get out much.

975
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,080
They kept me

976
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,080
pretty bottled up.

977
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,020
Hey. Just gotta

978
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,020
look something up

979
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,720
and then we can

980
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,720
get out of here, okay?

981
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,850
Yeah.

982
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,660
Mmm.

983
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,170
I missed that.

984
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,940
What are you doing?

985
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,380
Looking up funeral home

986
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,380
information.

987
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,920
This guy just lost his wife

988
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,890
and now their baby

989
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,890
is up in the NICU.

990
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,880
That's rough.

991
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,880
Yeah.

992
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,190
A single parent

993
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,190
with a newborn?

994
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,190
I know exactly

995
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,190
how he's feeling.

996
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,660
It's not easy.

997
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,960
ED?

998
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,570
I'll let him know.

999
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,570
Dr. Choi.

1000
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,370
Vascular called.

1001
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,680
They were able to stent

1002
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,680
Dennis Mitchell's

1003
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,680
axillary artery.

1004
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,780
He's headed to the ICU.

1005
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,950
Congratulations.

1006
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,950
You saved his life.

1007
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,680
April, don't you understand?

1008
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,460
The first thing

1009
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,460
I wanted was revenge.

1010
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,460
But I couldn't let

1011
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,460
myself go there.

1012
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,050
Then I wouldn't be

1013
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,050
any different than him.

1014
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,660
He hurt someone I care about.

1015
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,870
He hurt you.

1016
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,220
Mr. Bennett.

1017
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,010
Davey is out of surgery

1018
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,010
and he's gonna be fine.

1019
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,290
Thank God.

1020
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,030
I'm sorry.

1021
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,690
I am so sorry.

1022
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,690
Hey...

1023
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,000
You'll be able

1024
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,000
to see him soon.

1025
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,530
Thank you.

1026
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,830
For everything.

1027
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,670
You can give me

1028
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,670
the lecture now.

1029
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,910
Yeah, I could.

1030
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,910
But your intentions

1031
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,910
were good.

1032
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,000
You couldn't know that

1033
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,000
Dad would go mental.

1034
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,840
Come with me tonight.

1035
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,120
The board's gonna be there.

1036
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,750
That means your father's

1037
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,750
gonna be there.

1038
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,450
Oh, I know. I've got

1039
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,450
a mental dad, too.

1040
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,580
So what?

1041
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,150
It's uncomfortable.

1042
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,660
Being around the two of you.

1043
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,600
I know.

1044
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,160
But you can't

1045
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,160
avoid him forever.

1046
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,170
You and I are a couple.

1047
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,760
With a future, right?

1048
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,870
Between you and Dr. Choi,

1049
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,870
I've pulled

1050
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,870
some overtime today.

1051
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,470
Thank you.

1052
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,740
Any time.

1053
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,980
You're not putting him

1054
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,980
on a psych hold?

1055
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,050
Miss Curry, stop by my office

1056
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,050
on your way out today,

1057
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,050
would you?

1058
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,050
Okay.

1059
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,530
Just give me

1060
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,530
a minute, okay?

1061
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,370
Mr. Davis?

1062
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,930
Here's some

1063
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,930
funeral home

1064
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,930
information.

1065
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,640
They'll handle everything.

1066
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,540
Thank you.

1067
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,620
There's really

1068
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,620
no reason for you

1069
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,620
to stay here tonight.

1070
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,420
Why don't you go home?

1071
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,920
Try and get some sleep.

1072
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,450
I don't want to go home.

1073
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,600
You know, I...

1074
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,830
I was pregnant

1075
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,830
when my husband died.

1076
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,900
Your whole world

1077
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,900
falls apart.

1078
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,770
The person

1079
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,770
you loved so deeply,

1080
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,470
shared everything with,

1081
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,510
your worries,

1082
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,510
your sorrows,

1083
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,510
your joys...

1084
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,480
Is gone.

1085
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,880
And you feel so empty.

1086
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,440
And alone.

1087
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,720
But it will get better.

1088
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,720
I promise you.

1089
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,760
Oh, my God.

1090
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,760
Oh, God.

1091
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,970
In his twisted way,

1092
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,570
with all his plastic surgery,

1093
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,110
Mr. Mitchell was trying

1094
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,110
to make himself worthy

1095
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,110
of being loved.

1096
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,700
And, well,

1097
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,980
when he didn't get that love,

1098
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,980
of course, he blamed others.

1099
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,710
Of course.

1100
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,950
Well, it's not atypical.

1101
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,460
You know, men do tend to blame

1102
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,460
others for their depression

1103
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,890
and loneliness whereas women,

1104
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,090
sadly, are more likely

1105
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,090
to blame themselves.

1106
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,520
Why are you telling me this?

1107
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,590
You had a very strong reaction

1108
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,160
to Mr. Mitchell today.

1109
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,430
Yeah, I mean,

1110
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,430
who wouldn't?

1111
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,870
Fair enough, but it seemed to

1112
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,700
really touch a nerve,

1113
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,700
like it was almost personal.

1114
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,400
Sorry, I have...

1115
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,210
I have no idea

1116
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,210
what you're

1117
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,210
talking about.

1118
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,470
I'm seeing this

1119
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,470
extraordinarily talented,

1120
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,740
brilliant, hardworking

1121
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,740
young woman

1122
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,080
who is putting an immense

1123
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,080
amount of pressure on herself

1124
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,080
to succeed.

1125
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,420
You know, she's not sleeping,

1126
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,820
she hasn't necessarily plugged

1127
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,820
into a peer group for support,

1128
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,050
you know,

1129
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,050
she's doing it alone.

1130
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,620
Elsa, for what it's worth,

1131
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,620
I know a whole lot

1132
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,960
about depression

1133
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,960
and loneliness.

1134
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,000
Okay?

1135
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,030
Have you ever had any thoughts

1136
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,030
about hurting yourself?

1137
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,910
No, I... No, I've never...

1138
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,580
No, I mean, how...

1139
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,840
You have no right to ask me

1140
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,840
a question like that.

1141
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,390
None. I think maybe

1142
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,390
you're the one

1143
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,390
with the problem.

1144
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,390
Not me.

1145
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,920
Like, what kind of life

1146
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,920
do you have?

1147
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,150
What kind of friends?

1148
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,420
You're here all the time.

1149
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,430
You've been divorced,

1150
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,430
like, 50 times.

1151
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,470
Like, your last resident

1152
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,470
hated you so much

1153
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,470
she moved to Texas. I...

1154
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,590
I think

1155
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,590
you are the expert

1156
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,600
on loneliness

1157
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,600
and depression, okay?

1158
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,040
See you, guys.

1159
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,080
Good night, April.

1160
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,590
Good night, Ethan.

1161
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,710
Hey, Monique,

1162
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,710
your shift is over.

1163
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,240
Why don't you go home?

1164
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,480
Monique?

1165
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,980
I am so sorry

1166
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,980
for what happened.

1167
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,680
I'm so sorry.

1168
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,130
Okay, okay.

1169
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,130
I'm so sorry.

1170
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,200
Out. Everybody out now.

1171
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,910
Come on.

1172
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,180
It's my fault.

1173
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,580
It's all my fault.

1174
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,580
Your fault?

1175
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,170
He could have killed you.

1176
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,150
If I just had

1177
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,150
coffee with him...

1178
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,210
No.

1179
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,950
Monique. No.

1180
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,650
This had nothing

1181
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,650
to do with you.

1182
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
How can you

1183
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
even think that?

1184
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,050
'Cause I told him

1185
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,050
to leave me alone.

1186
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,690
I didn't want anything

1187
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,690
to do with him.

1188
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,690
So?

1189
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,700
Guys should shoot us

1190
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,700
for turning them down?

1191
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,860
Come on.

1192
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,860
You do realize

1193
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,860
how crazy that sounds.

1194
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,530
Don't you?

1195
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh.

1196
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,970
Come here.

1197
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,380
Is there someone at home

1198
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,380
that can come and get you?

1199
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,610
No.

1200
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,150
Maybe a friend?

1201
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,910
I don't have any friends.

1202
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,880
Yes, you do.

1203
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,350
Look at us.

1204
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,820
You do.

1205
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,990
Yeah. Come here.

1206
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,500
I finally got Owen to sleep.

1207
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,750
He's so excited

1208
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,750
to have you home.

1209
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,680
Well, not as excited as me.

1210
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,680
Mmm.

1211
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,950
We have to get the wedding

1212
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,950
back on the calendar.

1213
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,350
Yes, we do.

1214
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,480
What is that?

1215
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,480
Oh, careful.

1216
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,860
Let me put this away.

1217
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,830
It's a gun?

1218
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,130
Don't worry.

1219
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,130
Owen can't get into it.

1220
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,760
You're carrying a gun?

1221
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,100
After everything

1222
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,100
that happened,

1223
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,830
I thought we should

1224
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,830
have some protection.

1225
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,460
I can't believe this.

1226
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,740
I have a permit.

1227
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,740
I don't care.

1228
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,780
You can't bring

1229
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,780
that thing in our house.

1230
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,510
Natalie, this is

1231
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,510
for our protection.

1232
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,880
Will, you used to hate guns.

1233
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,350
That was before

1234
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,350
I had one pointed

1235
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,350
at my head.

1236
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,580
I'm sorry.

1237
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,710
But you cannot

1238
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,710
stay here with that gun.

1239
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,290
I won't have it

1240
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,290
in this house.

1241
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,370
We have a great reason

1242
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,370
to celebrate tonight

1243
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,610
and I am delighted to see

1244
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,610
all the members of our board,

1245
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,350
along with so many

1246
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,350
of our generous supporters.

1247
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,820
Gaffney Medical Center

1248
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,820
is on the cutting edge

1249
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,820
of urgent care,

1250
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,520
due in large part

1251
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,520
to the men and women

1252
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,520
who are here tonight.

1253
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,460
On behalf of them,

1254
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,460
I thank you.

1255
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,700
Congratulations

1256
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,700
to both of you.

1257
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,540
And to you.

1258
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,040
Don't you two look beautiful.

1259
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,910
I'm sorry,

1260
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,910
but I have to steal

1261
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,910
these two for a minute.

1262
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,450
They're gonna try to

1263
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,450
sneak in some questions

1264
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,920
about the shooter.

1265
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,010
But we're not here

1266
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,010
about that.

1267
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,720
We're here about you.

1268
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,660
And your OR room.

1269
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,970
Dr. Bekker.

1270
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,740
I love that perfume.

1271
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,830
Brings back

1272
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,830
such nice memories.

1273
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,540
Why don't we do it again?

1274
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,670
That was

1275
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,670
a very large check

1276
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,670
I wrote you.

1277
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,980
I think I deserve

1278
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,980
more than one night.

1279
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,610
I disagree.

1280
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,610
Does my son

1281
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,610
know about us?

1282
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,520
Thank you.

1283
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,520
Very nice meeting you.

1284
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,320
I think we should go.

1285
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,520
What, why?

1286
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,520
Your father.

1287
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,100
What about him?

1288
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,770
The night that I went to

1289
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,770
go see him to ask for money

1290
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,770
for the Hybrid Room?

1291
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,440
Yeah?

1292
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,040
He's... He's now saying

1293
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,040
the most hateful thing.

1294
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,550
He's telling people

1295
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,550
I slept with him.

1296
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,680
Thank you.

1297
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,960
Dr. Rhodes!

1298
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,160
What did she tell you?

1299
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,900
I can't wait to hear.

1300
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,010
I should never have

1301
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,010
made you come.
