1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,860
Can I confess something?

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,160
'Course you can.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,870
So I picked a coffee shop

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,870
for our first date

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,640
in case I needed to make

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,640
a quick getaway.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,770
In case I was a dud?

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,770
Smart.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,110
Very smart.

10
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,110
I get it, trust me.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,980
But I'm going to guess that,

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,980
because you're letting me

13
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,920
walk you home,

14
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,920
maybe not a dud?

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,930
You guessed right.

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,090
Yeah, I've been here

17
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,090
about nine years now.

18
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,090
Oh!

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,360
Love Lakeview.

20
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,360
Wrigley's right there.

21
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,300
Britt, what are you

22
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,300
doing out here?

23
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,030
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,870
I went to the store,

25
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,870
wanted some chocolate milk,

26
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,240
but I forgot my keys.

27
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,740
And your jacket?

28
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,580
This is my daughter, Britt.

29
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,580
Um...

30
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,850
She's supposed to be staying

31
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,850
inside the apartment.

32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,850
Please, Mom.

33
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,850
Can you just let me in?

34
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,080
Yes, Yes. Come on.

35
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,750
Um, Britt has a problem.

36
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,660
She's been clean a few

37
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,660
weeks now and doing great.

38
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,420
It's just the withdrawal

39
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,420
symptoms are hard.

40
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,950
Oh...

41
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,260
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

42
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,360
You okay?

43
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,100
My chest, it hurts

44
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,100
when I breathe.

45
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,800
Okay, um, we need to

46
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,800
get her to a hospital.

47
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,930
What? No.

48
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,530
I'll let 'em know

49
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,530
we're coming.

50
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,310
Incoming. Take Baghdad.

51
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,310
Yep.

52
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,340
Cesar?

53
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,340
Gabriel Park, 16,

54
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,250
single GSW to the abdomen.

55
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,250
GCS 15, BP 98/66,

56
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,850
heart rate 118, sats 100%.

57
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,120
I can't move my leg.

58
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,680
Gabriel, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

59
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,490
You hang in there.

60
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,490
What happened?

61
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,120
Gunman held up

62
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,120
the family store.

63
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,690
We were in the back,

64
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,690
stocking the freezer.

65
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
And Gabriel was

66
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
working the register.

67
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,460
Mr. and Mrs. Park,

68
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,460
why don't you come with me

69
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,200
and let Dr. Rhodes work, okay?

70
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,200
All right.

71
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,670
On my count. One, two, three.

72
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,510
Single bullet hole,

73
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,510
interior abdomen.

74
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,570
Let's get a chest X-ray

75
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,570
and log roll.

76
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,410
On my count, one, two, three.

77
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,010
There we go.

78
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,380
No exit wound. All right, back

79
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,380
down.

80
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,650
Let's find out

81
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,650
where this bullet is.

82
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,810
Everybody clear.

83
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,320
We're gonna take care

84
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,320
of you, Gabe.

85
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,450
X-ray's up.

86
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,450
There it is.

87
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,390
All right, trans abdominal

88
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,390
trajectory.

89
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,660
He needs surgery.

90
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,560
Please, my left leg,

91
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,560
I can't feel it.

92
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,930
Gabriel, I'm going to do

93
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,930
everything I can to fix

94
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,930
your leg,

95
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,100
but right now I need

96
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,100
to look inside your belly

97
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,370
and make sure that

98
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,370
everything is okay.

99
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,530
You understand me? Good.

100
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,940
Call for blood. Let's move him

101
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,940
over to the Hybrid OR.

102
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,480
Page my team. Let's go.

103
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,120
Will.

104
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,120
What's up, Jay?

105
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,480
They just brought that kid in.

106
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,150
He was shot in

107
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,150
a convenience store.

108
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,720
Okay.

109
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,720
So we caught the guy,

110
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,280
and we got the gun

111
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,280
that he used.

112
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,430
Good. Why are you telling me?

113
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,490
CPD ran the serial number

114
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,490
on it, and it's your gun.

115
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,830
The one that was stolen.

116
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,050
Hey. Any word on the boy?

117
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,590
I heard it was your gun.

118
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,590
Don't say it, okay?

119
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,590
The last thing I need

120
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,590
right now is a lecture.

121
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,680
I wasn't going to.

122
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,390
It's not like I put the gun

123
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,390
in the shooter's hand.

124
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,830
It was stolen from me.

125
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,830
I know that.

126
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,470
Look, I know this is

127
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,470
a terrible situation.

128
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,770
I just hope you're talking

129
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,770
to someone.

130
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,540
Your therapist or--

131
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,540
Why do you even care?

132
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,910
You said we were done,

133
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,910
remember?

134
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,080
Hey, any update on

135
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,080
Britt Mills?

136
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,620
Other than learning from

137
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,620
her mom you two were

138
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,620
on your first date?

139
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,720
It had to be awkward

140
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,720
to find her daughter

141
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,720
like that.

142
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,780
Yeah.

143
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,050
Britt's echocardiogram

144
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,050
is showing endocarditis.

145
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,490
It happens sometimes with

146
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,490
intravenous drug users.

147
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,900
I bet bacteria from a needle

148
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,900
worked its way to the heart.

149
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,690
What's cardiology saying?

150
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,260
They advise against surgery.

151
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,260
I think we should treat

152
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,270
with a six-week course

153
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,270
of antibiotics,

154
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,370
so we need to put

155
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,370
in a PICC line.

156
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,140
PICC line? I don't know.

157
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,610
I mean, she's only been

158
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,610
clean a few weeks.

159
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,740
Leaving a catheter in her arm?

160
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,510
That's almost an invitation

161
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,510
to relapse.

162
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,490
But if we don't, she'll have

163
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,490
to come into the hospital

164
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,490
twice a day for infusions.

165
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,020
Got to be another way.

166
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,610
Dr. Rhodes.

167
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,610
Thanks.

168
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,120
Connor, is the kid

169
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,120
gonna be okay?

170
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,200
Yeah, he'll definitely live.

171
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,860
We repaired a bunch of small

172
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,860
bowel where the bullet tore

173
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,860
through,

174
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,960
but it's still lodged in his

175
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,960
spinal canal.

176
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,060
How bad is it?

177
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,330
Too soon to tell,

178
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,330
but when he came in,

179
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,430
he said he lost feeling

180
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,430
in his left leg.

181
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,070
We're sending him up to CT,

182
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,940
get a better idea of what's

183
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,940
going on.

184
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,380
Neurology's gonna

185
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,380
take a look at him.

186
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,570
We got it.

187
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,150
Maggie, female mid-30s,

188
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,150
syncopal episode in the field.

189
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,250
Down maybe 30 seconds

190
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,250
before roused by bystanders.

191
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,350
Sydney?

192
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,520
Hey, Maggie.

193
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,520
Hey.

194
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,460
Dr. Lanik, you're going

195
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,460
to Treatment Three.

196
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,030
Went from GCS 12 to 14

197
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,030
with a sternal rub,

198
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,830
supplemental oxygen,

199
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,830
and 250 mils normal saline.

200
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,030
Monitor showing multiple PVCs.

201
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,130
I fainted.

202
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,640
Yes, and we're going to take

203
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,640
very good care of you.

204
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,800
BP's a little low,

205
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,800
100 over 66,

206
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,800
and heart rate, 78.

207
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
But I'm not sure

208
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
if she's beta blocked.

209
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,380
Okay, transfer on my count.

210
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,380
One, two, three.

211
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,920
She's got a tunneled cath

212
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,920
in the left upper chest.

213
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,290
That's for dialysis.

214
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,290
She's on the list

215
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,290
for a kidney.

216
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,650
Hey, order a 12-lead EKG.

217
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,650
All right.

218
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,420
Am I gonna be okay?

219
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,620
Yes, you are.

220
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,150
Where's that X-ray?

221
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,230
Okay, clear.

222
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,100
Ms. Curry?

223
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,410
Ooh, mild fluid overload.

224
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,820
So?

225
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,820
Cardiac enzymes,

226
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,250
BMP, CBC, blood cultures

227
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,250
times two.

228
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,550
Yeah, give her a dose of vanc.

229
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,550
25 milligrams per kilogram.

230
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,640
On it.

231
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,690
Repeat her vitals and let me

232
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,690
know when her labs are back.

233
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,750
Okay.

234
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,360
Okay.

235
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,260
You know this patient?

236
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,260
She grew up near me.

237
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,700
Came in a couple weeks ago

238
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,700
with sepsis.

239
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,940
I should have seen her

240
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,940
immediately.

241
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,820
Feels like somebody's

242
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,820
sitting on my chest

243
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,350
and my back at the same time

244
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,790
ever since we got back

245
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,790
from that cross-country

246
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,790
ski trip two days ago.

247
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,620
I never felt

248
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,620
anything like this.

249
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,460
This isn't like him.

250
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,460
Patrick's always so healthy,

251
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,720
even if he sort of let himself

252
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,720
go the last few years.

253
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,990
Really, Alice?

254
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,700
It's your medical history.

255
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,130
It's relevant, isn't it?

256
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,200
Uh, yeah.

257
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,650
Does the pain extend down

258
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,650
your arm or up to your jaw?

259
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,550
No.

260
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,550
Does this hurt?

261
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,280
Out of 10,

262
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,280
10 being the most painful.

263
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,120
Uh, I guess a five.

264
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,630
Okay, let's get a CBC, CMP,

265
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,630
troponins,

266
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,030
and set Mr. Novak

267
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,030
up for an EKG.

268
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,900
Patrick?

269
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,400
No pulse.

270
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,400
What?

271
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,810
He's not breathing, bag him.

272
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,810
Got it.

273
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,670
But he's got normal sinus

274
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,670
rhythm.

275
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,040
There's no pulse.

276
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,040
He's in PEA. Call a code.

277
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,170
Patrick?

278
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,170
We need help in here!

279
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,680
Need an airway!

280
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,680
Look.

281
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,920
He just opened his eyes.

282
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,920
He's breathing on his own.

283
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,960
Oh, thank God.

284
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,290
Honey, are you okay?

285
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,020
Patrick?

286
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,020
Asystole.

287
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,390
Milligram of epi, now.

288
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,000
Intubate him.

289
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,660
Hold off. Patient's

290
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,660
breathing on his own.

291
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,960
Can someone tell me

292
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,960
what is happening?

293
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,900
Your husband's

294
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,900
in cardiac arrest,

295
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,870
but as long as I'm doing

296
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,870
compressions, he's getting

297
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,870
oxygen to his brain.

298
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,970
We'll keep at it until

299
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,970
his heart takes over.

300
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,410
Honey, Patrick.

301
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,410
I'm right here.

302
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,650
You're saying it's not

303
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,650
just the withdrawal?

304
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,310
I have a heart infection?

305
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,450
Symptoms of endocarditis

306
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,450
usually come on slowly

307
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,360
and they're often mistaken

308
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,360
for heroin withdrawal.

309
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,360
The chest pains you were

310
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,360
feeling this morning.

311
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,660
We can treat endocarditis

312
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,660
with long-term antibiotics,

313
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,630
which normally involve leaving

314
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,630
a catheter in the arm.

315
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,860
A PICC line.

316
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,700
It's okay,

317
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,700
I'm used to needles.

318
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,340
Britt, we really get how

319
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,340
tricky early sobriety can be,

320
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,710
and we just want to put you

321
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,710
in the best possible position

322
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,710
to succeed.

323
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,070
So if we're gonna give you

324
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,070
this PICC line,

325
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,050
there's something else

326
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,050
we'd also like you

327
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,050
to consider.

328
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,910
What?

329
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,910
Well, it's a drug

330
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,320
called naltrexone that blocks

331
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,320
the effects of opioids

332
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,950
on the brain's limbic system,

333
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,950
essentially making it

334
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,950
impossible to get high.

335
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,550
There's a drug that'll stop me

336
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,550
from getting high?

337
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,490
Let's do that.

338
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,360
Listen, naltrexone is by

339
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,360
no means a magic bullet,

340
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,870
and it comes with certain very

341
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,870
real risks.

342
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,300
The thing is, Britt,

343
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,300
you can't take it

344
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,070
unless you've been opioid-free

345
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,070
for at least 14 days.

346
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,080
If there are any opioids

347
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,080
in your system,

348
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,700
the Naltrexone could trigger

349
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,700
severe side effects.

350
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,170
I'm clean.

351
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,880
For over two weeks.

352
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,110
Okay, well, it's also crucial

353
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,110
for you to understand,

354
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,180
if you were to use, it could

355
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,180
very well lead to an overdose.

356
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,280
I'm not going to. Ever.

357
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,020
She's been trying so hard.

358
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,930
Okay, well, we just need

359
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,930
to do a urine test

360
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,730
to be safe and...

361
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,730
And we're set.

362
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,030
Okay.

363
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,030
This is great,

364
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,030
I mean...

365
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,950
Ava.

366
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,950
Hello, Connor.

367
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,210
Um...

368
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,480
How's the hand?

369
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,690
It's much better.

370
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,120
It was my fault.

371
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,960
I should have gotten my hand

372
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,960
out of the way.

373
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,090
Well, maybe I could have

374
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,090
been a little more careful.

375
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,970
Look, I am sorry that

376
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,970
I haven't been able to

377
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,970
come by to check on you.

378
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,570
It's okay.

379
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,940
I know we're not in

380
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,940
the best of places right now.

381
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,980
Yeah.

382
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,980
Dr. Rhodes.

383
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,750
Once again, you are doing

384
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,750
your best to ruin my day.

385
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,550
Maybe I should go.

386
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,550
No, no, you stay, Dr. Bekker.

387
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,150
This concerns you, too.

388
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,230
Two months ago, you operated

389
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,230
on a gunshot victim,

390
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,230
a Shawn Corcoran?

391
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,290
Yeah?

392
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,290
And you assisted?

393
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,330
He died,

394
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,330
and someone is alleging

395
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,070
that you brought him to

396
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,070
the ICU with his abdomen

397
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,070
left open

398
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,770
when you should have

399
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,770
closed him.

400
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,010
And then, you lightened

401
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,010
his anesthesia prematurely

402
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,710
all contributing

403
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,710
to his death.

404
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,550
Who made these allegations?

405
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,410
It was an anonymous complaint.

406
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,750
Unfortunately, the hospital

407
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,750
oversight committee is obliged

408
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,310
to do a root cause analysis

409
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,310
into the case.

410
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,280
You'll both be interviewed.

411
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,080
And then what?

412
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,420
Well, if the committee finds

413
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,420
that the charges have merit,

414
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,230
you, Dr. Rhodes,

415
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,230
will be brought before

416
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,820
a peer review board.

417
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,300
But hopefully,

418
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,300
that does not happen.

419
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,300
Your Hybrid OR has cost

420
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,300
this hospital a fortune,

421
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,270
but it has made

422
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,270
for some good PR.

423
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,010
The last thing I need is

424
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,010
a scandal involving its chief.

425
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,440
Connor, peer review?

426
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,440
You could lose your license.

427
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,390
Yeah.

428
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,290
Mr. Davis, you're back.

429
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,130
Yeah, it's starting

430
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,130
to feel like we live here.

431
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,330
But I'm just a little bit

432
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,330
worried about Sophie.

433
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,370
What's the matter with her?

434
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,370
She's not eating

435
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,370
like she should,

436
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,140
and she's sleeping

437
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,140
more than usual.

438
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,540
All right. Well, why don't you

439
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,540
lay her down right here

440
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,600
and I'll take a look, okay?

441
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,200
Okay. You're okay.

442
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,280
Shh...

443
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,610
Just right here.

444
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,640
Hey...

445
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,990
100.1.

446
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,990
She is running a fever.

447
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,190
Okay.

448
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,170
I'm not seeing anything

449
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,170
unexpected.

450
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,300
Okay.

451
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,510
Don't worry,

452
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,510
we'll figure this out.

453
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,620
Put in an IV and check

454
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,620
the patency of the G-tube.

455
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,280
It could just be she's not

456
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,280
getting her fluids

457
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,280
and nutrition in.

458
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,050
Right.

459
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,050
This have anything to do

460
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,320
with her heart condition?

461
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,320
I don't know yet.

462
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,260
Um, it could just be that,

463
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,260
right now,

464
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,160
she's not getting

465
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,160
the nourishment she needs.

466
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,990
But let's just check

467
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,990
the tube first,

468
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,830
and then we'll go from there,

469
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,830
okay?

470
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,260
Okay.

471
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,260
All right.

472
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,170
Ms. Hawkins,

473
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,170
your tests show potassium 9.2,

474
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,540
chloride 115, BUN 105,

475
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,540
and creatinine 6.

476
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,700
What that mean?

477
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,270
It means your dialysis

478
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,270
hasn't been working.

479
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,370
When was the last time

480
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,370
that you went to the center?

481
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,720
A few days ago. Why?

482
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,150
And did they mention any

483
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,150
problems with your flow rates?

484
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,780
Because your catheter is

485
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,780
clotted.

486
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,060
Maybe told you to come to the

487
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,060
hospital and get it replaced?

488
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,150
Oh, something like that,

489
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,150
maybe, yeah.

490
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,300
But then I got too sick.

491
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,230
That's okay, we'll get it

492
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,230
all fixed up,

493
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,060
and get you emergency

494
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,060
dialysis.

495
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,200
Mmm-hmm. Meanwhile, we need

496
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,200
to lower your potassium.

497
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,100
Let's give her an amp

498
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,100
of bicarbonate,

499
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,230
10 units regular insulin,

500
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,230
an amp of D50,

501
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,540
and then 8.4 grams

502
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,540
of patiromer.

503
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,970
Got it.

504
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,450
All of that?

505
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,280
It's really bad, isn't it?

506
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,050
Mmm-hmm.

507
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,450
You need a new kidney.

508
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,790
I'm gonna see if I can

509
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,790
get you moved up on

510
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,790
the transplant list.

511
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,120
Maggie.

512
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,030
You're taking such

513
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,030
good care of me.

514
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,360
Thank you.

515
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,880
No more ski trips,

516
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,880
I promise.

517
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,980
I know you didn't want to go.

518
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,120
Dr. Halstead, should we

519
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,120
get him on ECMO?

520
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,710
We can't put a patient on ECMO

521
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,710
unless we have a plan to get

522
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,710
him off it.

523
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,380
Then what can we do?

524
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,380
This is it.

525
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,520
There's nothing else.

526
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,360
I'm not gonna stop

527
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,360
until his pulse comes back.

528
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,500
You need a break.

529
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,500
Let me take over for a while.

530
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,970
All right. Switch.

531
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,470
Hey, you good?

532
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,580
I'll be right back.

533
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,280
Based on my experience,

534
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,280
it's definitely the best

535
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,280
course of action.

536
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,520
Okay.

537
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,260
Hey, Sam.

538
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,260
What's the report

539
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,260
on the GSW victim?

540
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,500
Since when is he your patient?

541
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,930
Come on, Sam.

542
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,500
Bullet lodged in his cord

543
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,500
at T12,

544
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,010
hematoma surrounding the cord.

545
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,740
Kid's hemiplegic on his left

546
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,740
side, right leg still works.

547
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,370
Wait, so there's a chance

548
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,370
he'll regain feeling

549
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,910
in his left leg

550
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,910
when you pull the bullet out?

551
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,610
No, we're leaving it in.

552
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,610
Removing the bullet risks

553
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,020
substantial bleeding along

554
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,020
with more potential damage

555
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,490
to the spinal cord,

556
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,490
which could result

557
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,950
in the kid being paraplegic.

558
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,610
Well, isn't that

559
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,610
worth the risk

560
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,420
if it means he might gain

561
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,420
full function back?

562
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,330
Well, I'd rather have one

563
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,330
good leg than two bad ones.

564
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,690
Wait, look, we're talking

565
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,690
about a kid, here.

566
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,530
Okay? With his whole life

567
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,530
ahead of him.

568
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,470
Halstead, no one asked

569
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,470
for your uninformed opinion,

570
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,970
and the family's made their

571
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,970
decision.

572
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,530
Go back to the ED

573
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,530
and put a Band-Aid on someone.

574
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,650
Good news, the urine tox

575
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,650
screen came back clean.

576
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,750
I wasn't worried.

577
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,780
Monique, let's administer

578
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,780
the first dose of naltrexone,

579
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,990
then send her up

580
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,990
to the IR for a PICC line.

581
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,460
Could you turn on your side,

582
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,460
please?

583
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,690
Mmm-hmm.

584
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,270
Honey, are you...

585
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,270
Are you sure about this?

586
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,630
This is a really big step.

587
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,560
Yes, Mom. I'm sure.

588
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,170
Just a little pinch, okay?

589
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,370
That's it.

590
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,770
Thank you, both.

591
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,350
I understand what she does

592
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,350
for a living,

593
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,020
but she's been

594
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,020
responsible with her health.

595
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,920
She's not high risk.

596
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,160
Yes. I understand.

597
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,500
That about Sydney?

598
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,700
Yeah, she's on the bottom

599
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,700
of the transplant list

600
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,500
because she's a sex worker.

601
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,750
When she came in,

602
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,750
I kept her waiting.

603
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,940
I didn't take her seriously.

604
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,010
I didn't realize

605
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,010
that she was septic.

606
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,050
Maybe if I hadn't kept her

607
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,050
waiting, this wouldn't have

608
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,050
happened.

609
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,320
Maggie, you don't know that.

610
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,560
You know, we grew up a couple

611
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,560
blocks from each other.

612
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,260
Huge difference,

613
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,260
those couple blocks.

614
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,870
April?

615
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,310
I want you to do a blood

616
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,310
draw on me.

617
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,810
A blood draw?

618
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,710
Maggie, you cannot be serious.

619
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,920
Treatment Four's open.

620
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,920
Let's go.

621
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,550
She's not breathing.

622
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,430
Sats are down to 60%.

623
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,060
Start bagging.

624
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,760
Sats are coming back up.

625
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,240
88, 93.

626
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,240
Need to intubate.

627
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,140
I'm in. Bag her.

628
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,820
Call for a vent

629
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,820
and get a chest X-ray.

630
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,120
She's stable for now.

631
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,120
What's wrong with her?

632
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,930
I don't know yet, but we're

633
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,930
gonna get to the bottom of it.

634
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,700
Come back, Patrick.

635
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,700
Please?

636
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,260
Just come back.

637
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,740
Dr. Halstead,

638
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,740
it's been 10 minutes.

639
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,780
Stay with me, please, baby.

640
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,730
Excuse me.

641
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,730
Will, I need a word.

642
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,230
Gabriel and his parents

643
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,230
are now saying

644
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,360
they want the surgery

645
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,360
to remove the bullet.

646
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,100
Glad to hear it.

647
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,160
You had no right

648
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,160
interfering with my patient.

649
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,010
Hey, all I did was make sure

650
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,010
they knew their options.

651
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,510
No, you went in there

652
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,510
and advocated for a surgery

653
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,840
that they had decided against.

654
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,750
Connor, this kid shouldn't

655
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,750
have to live

656
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,750
the rest of his life

657
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,010
with only one good leg.

658
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
No, he shouldn't,

659
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
but what happened happened,

660
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,780
and we can't change that.

661
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,950
Well, maybe we can.

662
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,390
Maybe he can go back to

663
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,390
the way he was.

664
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,860
Will, I get it, man.

665
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,860
It was your gun.

666
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,920
You might have some messed up

667
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,920
idea that this was somehow

668
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,920
your fault,

669
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,590
but pushing for that surgery,

670
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,590
the kid could wind up in a

671
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,590
wheelchair.

672
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,830
Or he could be made whole

673
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,830
again.

674
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,560
I have a patient to attend to.

675
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,870
Help!

676
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,870
Somebody help my daughter!

677
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,010
Excuse me.

678
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,010
Need noodle.

679
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,290
Not noodle...

680
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,290
She's seizing, five milligrams

681
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,290
of Ativan.

682
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,080
Easy...

683
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,650
Meds are in.

684
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,830
Dan, help her! Help her!

685
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,830
Help her!

686
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,900
BP 154 over 94.

687
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,900
Heart rate 118.

688
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,900
Sats 92%.

689
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,940
She's stable.

690
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,910
How did that happen?

691
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,910
Was it the injection?

692
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,980
No, only if Britt had drugs in

693
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,980
her system.

694
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,040
But... But she didn't.

695
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,480
Did she?

696
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,720
Maggie, come with me.

697
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,500
We need the room.

698
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,900
I'm on the transplant

699
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,900
committee.

700
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,870
I am notified

701
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,870
about every HLA match.

702
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,170
Did you really think

703
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,170
I wouldn't find out

704
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,150
that you planned to donate

705
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,150
a kidney?

706
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,910
Well, I hoped you wouldn't,

707
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,680
because I didn't want to have

708
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,680
this discussion with you.

709
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,120
Maggie, undergoing surgery

710
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,120
for a patient,

711
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,160
an irreversible procedure,

712
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,430
is a violation of professional

713
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,430
boundaries.

714
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,400
I'm sorry, but I don't care.

715
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,630
So who are you doing it for?

716
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,900
For her or for you?

717
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,570
For me?

718
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,570
Well, look.

719
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,510
I've gone through Sydney's

720
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,510
records.

721
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,920
She was already in

722
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,920
septic shock

723
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,920
when she came in, Maggie.

724
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,510
We did everything

725
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,510
we could for her.

726
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,680
So if this is coming out

727
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,680
of some misplaced

728
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,680
sense of guilt--

729
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,850
She's at the bottom

730
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,850
of the transplant list.

731
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,790
She's never gonna get

732
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,790
a kidney,

733
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,590
and she's gonna die

734
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,590
if I don't give her mine.

735
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,570
But have you stopped

736
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,570
to consider your own health?

737
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,110
Wha--

738
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,110
Donating puts you at risk,

739
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,000
Maggie, for infection,

740
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,940
hypertension, intestinal

741
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,940
obstruction--

742
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,070
Those are very rare

743
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,070
side effects.

744
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,240
Okay, but what if

745
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,240
your remaining kidney fails?

746
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,790
People who donate kidneys do

747
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,790
just fine, and you know that.

748
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,890
It is still an ethical

749
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,890
violation

750
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,890
and I can't, I just...

751
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,130
I can't let you do this.

752
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,540
Sharon, there's nothing

753
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,540
that you can do

754
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,900
that's gonna stop me.

755
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,570
Actually, there is.

756
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,640
You're out of paid

757
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,640
sick leave days.

758
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,750
You can't take the time off

759
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,750
to recover.

760
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,980
Not without jeopardizing

761
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,980
your employment.

762
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,820
Lose my job?

763
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,820
You would do that?

764
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,020
Maggie...

765
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,630
Yes, I would.

766
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,600
She could have died.

767
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,880
My baby could have died.

768
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,180
I'm just stumped as to how...

769
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,380
How she passed the urine test.

770
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,380
I don't know.

771
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,090
Jackie.

772
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,000
It was mine. It was my urine.

773
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,970
She swore that she was clean,

774
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,970
and then, when you said

775
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,570
she was gonna have to do

776
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,570
a drug test, she told me.

777
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,740
She told me she'd shot up

778
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,740
a week ago.

779
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,810
And you went ahead anyway?

780
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,320
She...

781
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,320
She said that it

782
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,320
wasn't that much.

783
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,290
That it wouldn't matter.

784
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,120
You have to understand,

785
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,120
this has been going on

786
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,850
for such a long time.

787
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,850
I've tried everything.

788
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,730
I got her a therapist.

789
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,730
I got her a job.

790
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,270
I hardly ever leave her alone.

791
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,670
And still, every morning,

792
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,470
I wake up and I find

793
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,800
that she's figured out

794
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,800
some other way to get high.

795
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,380
The naltrexone gave me hope

796
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,380
that it would save her.

797
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,080
Also could've killed her.

798
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,120
Jackie, I cannot even imagine

799
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,120
how brutal this must be.

800
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,960
But I'm gonna be very honest

801
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,960
with you.

802
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,060
As a parent, I understand

803
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,060
the need to protect

804
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,060
your child,

805
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,330
and as long as you

806
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,330
keep doing that,

807
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,630
she's never going to

808
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,630
get better.

809
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,040
The committee's running

810
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,040
a little behind.

811
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,210
Ava, you are blameless

812
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,210
in all of this.

813
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,910
I made every decision

814
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,910
in the OR.

815
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,320
Dr. Bekker,

816
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,320
they're ready for you.

817
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,930
Hi.

818
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,880
Um, Sophie's MRI shows

819
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,880
an abscess.

820
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,620
An area of swelling

821
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,620
in the right frontal lobe

822
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,620
of her brain.

823
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,080
It's an infection.

824
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,720
How... Why...

825
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,820
It can happen in children

826
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,820
with congenital heart disease.

827
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,400
Bacteria originating

828
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,400
from the heart travels

829
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,400
up to their brain.

830
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,520
Mmm-hmm.

831
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,230
So the neurosurgeons

832
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,230
would like to take her

833
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,530
up to the operating room

834
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,530
to have a catheter placed

835
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,470
and the abscess drained.

836
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,260
A catheter in her head?

837
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,840
The good news is that

838
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,840
the abscess is small enough

839
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,570
so that she won't need

840
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,570
a craniotomy. Surgery.

841
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,220
When my wife found out

842
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,220
that she had a brain aneurysm,

843
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,280
the doctors said

844
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,280
it was small enough

845
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,980
that she didn't need

846
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,980
to have surgery,

847
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,820
and then it killed her.

848
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,060
I can't make you any promises,

849
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,770
but I can tell you that

850
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,770
this is an entirely

851
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,770
different situation.

852
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,260
I'm hopeful.

853
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,260
You should be, too.

854
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,470
Okay.

855
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,910
Let me check for a pulse.

856
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,420
Move.

857
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,420
Patrick, come back!

858
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,320
Oh, no.

859
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,120
No, you hang on, Patrick.

860
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,120
Please.

861
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,630
You hang on, Patrick.

862
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,560
Dr. Halstead.

863
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,560
Oh, God.

864
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,460
No...

865
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,810
I'm sorry.

866
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,750
It's my fault.

867
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,820
I did this to him.

868
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,950
Okay, we are ready to start

869
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,950
your dialysis.

870
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,960
Huh?

871
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,240
Sydney?

872
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,240
She's in v-fib.

873
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,760
It's her potassium.

874
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,760
Call a code.

875
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,770
Code Blue! Get Lanik in here.

876
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,210
Start bagging.

877
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,040
Still in v-fib.

878
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,040
Paddles.

879
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,590
Charge to 200.

880
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,010
Charged.

881
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,450
Clear.

882
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,900
Still in v-fib.

883
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,400
Milligram of epi.

884
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,700
Epi's in.

885
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,700
Charge again.

886
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,540
Charged.

887
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,540
Clear.

888
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,720
Back in sinus rhythm.

889
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,130
Another round of insulin,

890
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,130
glucose, and two amps

891
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,130
of bicarb.

892
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,180
Got it.

893
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,260
Sydney, I'm right here.

894
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,350
Sam, don't do the surgery.

895
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,150
Are you on drugs?

896
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,380
You're the one

897
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,380
who pushed for this.

898
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,450
I was wrong.

899
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,690
It wasn't a clinical decision.

900
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,690
It was emotional.

901
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,160
Yeah. Well, it's too late.

902
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,330
Please, talk to the family.

903
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,390
I already have.

904
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,300
You made such

905
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,300
a compelling case for surgery

906
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,930
that they're determined

907
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,930
to go through with it.

908
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,030
Well, tell them you refuse

909
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,030
to do the surgery.

910
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,230
I did.

911
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,280
They said they'd get

912
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,280
another surgeon.

913
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,940
At least if I do it, there's

914
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,940
a decent chance of success.

915
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,710
Come in.

916
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,420
Maggie?

917
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,230
I'm applying for the

918
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,230
Family Medical Leave Act...

919
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,730
To get the time off I'll need

920
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,730
for recovery from surgery.

921
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,270
You're determined to do this

922
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,270
no matter what I say?

923
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,530
Yes.

924
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,700
Why, Maggie?

925
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,450
Why is this patient

926
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,450
so different from any other?

927
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,550
She isn't.

928
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,030
I see so much

929
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,030
suffering every day.

930
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,500
Day after day, and there's

931
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,500
nothing I can do about it.

932
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,700
But this time I can.

933
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,470
This one time, I can.

934
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,020
It's just impossible to think

935
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,020
that I would stand by

936
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,680
and let her do this

937
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,680
to herself.

938
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,320
Well, it's completely

939
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,320
counterintuitive.

940
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,800
I mean, as parents, we're

941
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,800
programmed to fix our

942
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,800
children's problems, right?

943
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,130
Dr. Charles,

944
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,130
did you release Britt?

945
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,230
She's gone.

946
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,230
Britt?

947
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,130
Britt! Britt!

948
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,940
She took her clothes, too.

949
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,250
Where's she gonna go

950
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,250
with a PICC line?

951
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,110
She went to get high.

952
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,920
Let's just hope

953
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,920
she doesn't OD.

954
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,730
Hey.

955
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,800
You were right.

956
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,500
I felt guilty.

957
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,110
Hoped I could

958
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,110
turn back the clock.

959
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,270
Make it like the whole thing

960
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,270
never happened.

961
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,680
Yeah.

962
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,010
If he wakes up

963
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,010
worse than before,

964
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,750
I'll never forgive myself.

965
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,010
Let's just hope for the best.

966
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,560
Connor.

967
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,120
I heard you're facing

968
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,120
the oversight committee.

969
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,530
What's that all about?

970
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,440
I... Old case, pro forma.

971
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,440
It's no big deal.

972
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,710
She's not answering

973
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,710
any of my texts.

974
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,790
I knew I shouldn't have

975
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,790
taken my eyes off of her.

976
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,340
Jackie...

977
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,750
You don't understand.

978
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,750
I'm her mother.

979
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,980
I have to find her.

980
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,220
And how many times

981
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,220
have you done that already?

982
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,360
Dr. Rhodes?

983
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,050
Dr. Rhodes, please.

984
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,520
Dr. Latham, I want it

985
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,520
to be clear that I bear

986
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,890
full responsibility

987
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,890
for Mr. Corcoran's surgery

988
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,890
and its outcome.

989
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,580
Be that as it may,

990
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,580
we didn't call you in

991
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,580
to hear your statement.

992
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,360
We called you in to apologize.

993
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,820
Apologize?

994
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,830
Dr. Bekker made it

995
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,830
eminently clear that

996
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,830
all of your decisions

997
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,890
were sound, both medically

998
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,890
and ethically.

999
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,070
I reviewed Mr. Corcoran's

1000
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,070
chart and given the severity

1001
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,070
of his injuries,

1002
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,010
find no reason to disagree.

1003
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,280
I'm not sure that Dr. Bekker

1004
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,280
knows the details of the case.

1005
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,970
Dr. Rhodes, the committee

1006
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,970
has determined that

1007
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,140
you are not at fault

1008
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,140
for Mr. Corcoran's death.

1009
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,290
You may go.

1010
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,400
You told them that I did

1011
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,400
everything in the patient's

1012
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,400
best interest?

1013
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,700
Yeah.

1014
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,740
You and I both know that

1015
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,740
some of my actions were

1016
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,740
questionable.

1017
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,040
We have no way of knowing

1018
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,040
if they had any effect

1019
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,040
on the outcome.

1020
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,480
Still, the oversight

1021
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,480
committee should have heard--

1022
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,920
Why, so you can face peer

1023
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,920
review and lose your license?

1024
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,580
Connor, I did it for you.

1025
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,980
I'd do anything for you.

1026
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,030
I'll be back to

1027
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,030
check on you. Thank you.

1028
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,660
Sam?

1029
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,010
I was able to remove

1030
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,010
the bullet without causing

1031
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,010
any more trauma.

1032
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,510
So?

1033
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,280
He'll be fine.

1034
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,640
Thank you.

1035
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,720
You know, your behavior

1036
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,720
today has been

1037
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,120
erratic, irrational, and

1038
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,120
impulsive,

1039
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,160
hardly qualities one wants

1040
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,160
to see in a physician.

1041
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,890
You need to get your head

1042
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,890
out of your ass.

1043
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,310
There's nothing

1044
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,310
you can do right now.

1045
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,680
We just have to wait and see

1046
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,680
how Sophie responds

1047
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,680
to the antibiotics.

1048
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,790
Why don't you go home

1049
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,790
and get some sleep?

1050
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,390
Okay.

1051
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,820
Come in.

1052
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,200
Ms. Goodwin, um...

1053
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,870
I'm not entirely

1054
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,870
comfortable with

1055
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,430
how things were left

1056
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,430
with the oversight committee.

1057
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,640
I am.

1058
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,080
I just don't think

1059
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,080
that Mr. Corcoran's case

1060
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,980
was accurately presented.

1061
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,280
I'm guessing you're talking

1062
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,280
about when you lightened

1063
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,280
his sedation

1064
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,380
so Detective Halstead could

1065
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,380
interview him.

1066
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,780
Yes.

1067
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,780
And wasn't that done

1068
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,350
in an attempt to save

1069
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,350
Will Halstead's life?

1070
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,400
I assume when you made

1071
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,400
that decision,

1072
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,960
you hoped Mr. Corcoran

1073
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,960
would survive.

1074
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,560
Ms. Goodwin, lightening

1075
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,560
Mr. Corcoran's sedation

1076
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,660
might have contributed

1077
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,660
to his death.

1078
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,870
Might have.

1079
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,870
There's no way to know.

1080
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,380
He was gravely injured

1081
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,380
when he was brought in.

1082
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,310
You know,

1083
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,310
I was reminded today,

1084
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,480
in our effort

1085
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,480
to help people that

1086
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,720
we sometimes find ourselves

1087
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,720
in situations where

1088
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:12,360
what's right and what's wrong

1089
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:12,360
isn't entirely clear.

1090
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,200
And we can only hope

1091
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,200
that the decisions we do make

1092
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,500
are coming from

1093
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,500
the right place.

1094
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,510
Go home, Dr. Rhodes.

1095
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,150
Hey.

1096
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,820
Gabriel pulled through.

1097
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,930
He's gonna be fine.

1098
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,600
Glad to hear it.

1099
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,600
For both of you.

1100
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,220
Yeah.

1101
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,730
Sam Abrams told me

1102
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,730
to get my head out of my ass.

1103
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,130
He's right.

1104
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,410
Don't be too hard on yourself.

1105
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,340
It was a tough call. I get it.

1106
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,780
I gotta find Nat.

1107
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,780
Night.

1108
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,150
Congratulations, Connor.

1109
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,120
Heard you got a pass.

1110
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,770
And I'm sure you thought

1111
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,770
I was the snitch.

1112
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,940
You know,

1113
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,940
the thought crossed my mind.

1114
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,300
I wish I could

1115
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,300
take credit, but

1116
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,810
your patient croaked

1117
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,810
in the ICU and I didn't even

1118
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,810
know about it,

1119
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,850
so I guess the question is,

1120
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,850
who was the snitch?

1121
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,320
Why now?

1122
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,340
Months after the fact.

1123
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,790
Got an enemy out there.

1124
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,660
So you'll be in tomorrow?

1125
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,760
Yeah, I'll see you

1126
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,760
in the morning.

1127
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,920
Dr. Manning?

1128
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,370
You can call me Natalie.

1129
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,530
Natalie.

1130
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,240
If it weren't for you,

1131
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,240
I don't know how

1132
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,240
I would get through this.

1133
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,720
So thank you.

1134
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,720
Yeah.

1135
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,020
Have a good night.

1136
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,020
You too.

1137
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,220
Natalie.

1138
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,220
Yeah?

1139
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,760
What's going on?

1140
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,630
What?

1141
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,660
I came to apologize

1142
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,660
and tell you

1143
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,640
I wanna start taking

1144
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,640
therapy seriously.

1145
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,000
That's great.

1146
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,900
But I find you hugging

1147
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,900
this guy.

1148
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,880
Will, I--

1149
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,880
No, tell me something.

1150
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,970
Was it all really about me

1151
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,970
having a gun

1152
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,840
or was it about another guy

1153
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,840
and you just couldn't tell me?

1154
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,750
I don't even know

1155
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,750
what to say to that.

1156
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,790
That man just lost his wife.

1157
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,680
His baby could die.

1158
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,680
He is all alone.

1159
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,950
He needs someone

1160
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,950
to be there for him.

1161
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,720
So do I, Natalie.

1162
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,660
So do I.

1163
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,410
What are you doing out here?

1164
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,410
Aren't you going home?

1165
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,110
I've been thinking

1166
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,110
who was in the Hybrid OR

1167
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,850
who knew about my decision,

1168
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,850
who had the expertise

1169
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,850
to judge it?

1170
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,420
You think it was Marty?

1171
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,020
Or Sofia?

1172
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,890
No, if they'd had a problem,

1173
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,260
they would have raised it

1174
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,260
at the time.

1175
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,230
I think it was you.

1176
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,230
What?

1177
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,630
I... I defended you.

1178
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,570
Exactly. You're...

1179
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,610
You're like a pyromaniac

1180
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,610
that sets a fire just

1181
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,610
to put it out.

1182
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,620
Uh... Why in God's name

1183
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,620
would I do that?

1184
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,620
For the same reason

1185
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,620
you slept with my father

1186
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,120
and put your hand

1187
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,120
where you knew I would cut it.

1188
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,350
What?

1189
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,350
To keep me tied to you.

1190
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,360
Risk my health?

1191
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,860
Like you said,

1192
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,860
you'd do anything, right?

1193
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,330
This is insane.

1194
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,670
My God, can you hear yourself?

1195
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,730
Ava, I think you got a problem

1196
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,730
and I think you need to get

1197
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,730
some help.

1198
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:23,480
I've done nothing

1199
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:23,480
but support you and help you.

1200
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,610
You're the one

1201
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,610
with the problem, Connor.

1202
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,310
You're the one who

1203
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,310
should get some help.
