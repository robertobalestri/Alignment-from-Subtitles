1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,430
Truck 81, Squad 3, I need

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,430
search teams.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,170
It's a long way down.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,170
Can't we take the elevator?

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,900
Hey, you're in the way.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,710
She's alive!

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,550
Casey, what's it looking like

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,550
up there?

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,240
Mr. Halstead is

10
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,240
in rough shape.

11
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,240
I need a hand.

12
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,310
Dad.

13
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,690
Mayday, mayday!

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,450
It's Stella... Kidd.

15
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,510
She took in a lot of smoke.

16
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,190
How did you

17
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,190
let this happen?

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,960
She was trying

19
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,960
to save you.

20
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,330
Got another wave

21
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,330
of patients coming in.

22
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,530
Let's look alive!

23
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,530
Monique, what do we have?

24
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,070
I triggered

25
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,070
the mass casualty

26
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,070
protocol.

27
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,160
Yeah?

28
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,160
Everyone's prepped

29
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,160
and ready to go.

30
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,540
All right, let's continue

31
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,540
to decompress the ED.

32
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,200
Get all non-critical

33
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,200
admitted or discharged.

34
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
On it.

35
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
All right, Doris,

36
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
talk to me.

37
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm getting real-time

38
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,200
updates from the Office

39
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,200
of Emergency Management.

40
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,440
All right, I want to

41
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,440
know how many are still

42
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,280
down at the scene

43
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,280
and how many

44
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,280
we've got coming.

45
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,510
Copy.

46
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,510
All right, Dr. Manning.

47
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,820
Status on your burn patient?

48
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,780
I need to get her up to the OR

49
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,780
to have her burns excised.

50
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,160
Have you been able to

51
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,160
reach her parents?

52
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,750
We're still trying

53
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,750
to track them down.

54
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,390
Poor kid.

55
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,450
Maggie.

56
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,450
Yeah?

57
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,730
You page Dr. Rhodes

58
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,730
for my dad?

59
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,270
He's coming down

60
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,270
in five.

61
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,630
Hey, how are you

62
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,630
guys doing?

63
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,460
Choi kicked us out.

64
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,900
Yeah, he needs room

65
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,900
to work, Kelly.

66
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,340
Try to be patient.

67
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,840
Get her on the vent and make

68
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,840
sure she's 100% oxygenated.

69
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,100
Right.

70
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,340
She's waking up.

71
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,210
Push 4 milligrams

72
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,210
of midazolam.

73
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

74
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,610
Easy, easy.

75
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,380
Easy.

76
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,810
All right.

77
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,820
BP and heart rate are stable.

78
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,820
She's settling down.

79
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,260
Draw a blood gas with

80
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,260
carboxyhemoglobin.

81
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,620
Yes, Doctor.

82
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,590
Hey.

83
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,590
What's happening?

84
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,890
Her vitals are holding,

85
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,890
but she's in pretty bad shape.

86
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,800
We're running some tests

87
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,800
and should know more soon.

88
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,470
Blood pressure

89
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,470
and sats are dropping.

90
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,970
All right, she's bleeding

91
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,970
in her airway.

92
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,510
Hang a unit on

93
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,510
the rapid transfuser,

94
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,240
suction her ET tube,

95
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,240
and get a chest X-ray.

96
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,640
Yep.

97
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,420
Pop tried

98
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,420
to play hero.

99
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,050
He forgot he was

100
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,050
in his 60s

101
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,050
with a bum ticker.

102
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,420
Yeah, well.

103
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,160
This is your fault

104
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,160
to begin with.

105
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,660
Me?

106
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,660
Yeah.

107
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,930
Stick me in that fire trap.

108
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,930
Pop, stop talking.

109
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,970
You said

110
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,970
you liked the place.

111
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,260
You close on the EKG?

112
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,260
Just about.

113
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,530
What's the point of this?

114
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,530
Easy.

115
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,710
Paramedics said you were

116
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,710
complaining of chest pain.

117
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,680
Did you forget you had

118
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,680
a quadruple bypass

119
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,710
a few weeks ago?

120
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,710
Come on, stay still.

121
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,870
Hey, if it isn't

122
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,870
my favorite patient.

123
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,850
How you doing,

124
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,850
Mr. Halstead?

125
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,850
Fine.

126
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,220
So you felt some tightness

127
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,220
in your chest, huh?

128
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,450
It's nothing.

129
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,450
Well, you might be right.

130
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,120
I don't see any ST

131
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,120
elevation or depression.

132
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,520
No left

133
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,520
access deviation.

134
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,290
Looks like a strong

135
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,290
and healthy heart to me.

136
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,830
Yeah, good. We done?

137
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,830
Nope, not yet.

138
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,300
You still have a pretty

139
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,300
nasty inhalation injury.

140
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,840
Can I get a CBC, CMP,

141
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,840
and a carboxyhemoglobin?

142
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,100
And add a full

143
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,100
cardiac workup.

144
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,900
Dr. Rhodes?

145
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,900
Dr. Choi needs a consult.

146
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,950
Yeah. Mr. Halstead,

147
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,950
a pleasure as always.

148
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,170
Thank you, Connor.

149
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,470
I don't need all this.

150
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,810
Calm down, you're getting

151
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,810
yourself worked up.

152
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,910
What do you know?

153
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,910
You're no doctor.

154
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,280
Pop.

155
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,280
Forget it.

156
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080
You had no right

157
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080
to sell my house.

158
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,350
You want to talk

159
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,350
about this again?

160
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,190
It was a wreck. You couldn't

161
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,190
take care of the place.

162
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,990
You just wanted my money.

163
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,990
Hey.

164
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,560
You don't have any money,

165
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,560
you thankless old prick.

166
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,760
Whatever.

167
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,760
Jay.

168
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,000
Blood's coming too fast.

169
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,050
Every time I suction the tube

170
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,050
it fills back up again.

171
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,710
Hang another unit and just do

172
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,710
your best to keep up.

173
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,110
Where's the X-ray?

174
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,050
Here you go.

175
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,650
She's got

176
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,650
a massive hemorrhage

177
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,650
in her right lung.

178
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,320
It's impossible to say

179
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,320
where it's coming from.

180
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,720
All right,

181
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,720
call the blood bank,

182
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,720
trigger the MTP.

183
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,820
Can you stop the bleed?

184
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,120
First I've gotta find it.

185
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,530
Let's set up

186
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,530
for a bronchoscopy.

187
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,530
Okay.

188
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,770
We're already maxed out

189
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,770
on ventilators

190
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,830
and even

191
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,830
if I brought more down,

192
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,060
all my rooms are occupied.

193
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,300
I have nowhere

194
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,300
to put these patients.

195
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,340
And Rhodes' pet project

196
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,340
has us down a room.

197
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,670
This hybrid OR

198
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,670
was a terrible idea.

199
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,040
I told you.

200
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,040
Maggie, call Respiratory.

201
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,550
Tell them to send down

202
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,550
as many vents

203
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,550
as they've got.

204
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,280
Dr. Lanik, open up

205
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,280
the doctors' lounge

206
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,280
and the cafeteria

207
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,750
and get them equipped

208
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,750
for the overflow.

209
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,020
Maggie.

210
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,020
Yeah?

211
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,790
I need a nurse to help

212
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,790
with some dressings.

213
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,730
Take Doris with you.

214
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,730
She's with a patient.

215
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,590
Then Monique?

216
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,590
She is too.

217
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,530
All right. Go down

218
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,530
the phone tree again

219
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,530
and get us more nurses.

220
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,300
Meanwhile, I'll give you

221
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,300
a hand, Dr. Manning.

222
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,530
Thank you.

223
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,330
As soon as

224
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,330
an operating room

225
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,330
becomes available

226
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,170
your husband's gonna

227
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,170
go into surgery.

228
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,140
Can I get you

229
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,140
a bottle of water?

230
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,740
Yes, thank you.

231
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,740
Okay. Okay.

232
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,040
Damn it.

233
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,120
You all right, Otis?

234
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,060
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, fine.

235
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,230
Happens when I don't eat.

236
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,230
It's...

237
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,430
Low blood sugar.

238
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,430
Of course.

239
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,040
Dad's stable.

240
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,440
Why don't you go in

241
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,440
and talk to him?

242
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,310
You know, make up?

243
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,310
Well, he started it.

244
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,850
And thanks a lot.

245
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,520
We agreed that we were

246
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,520
gonna sell that place

247
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,550
and you just stood there.

248
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,550
You didn't say anything.

249
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,250
What's the point

250
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,250
in arguing with him?

251
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,220
He's old, he's sick,

252
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,220
just let it go.

253
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,560
That's fine for you to say.

254
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,560
You're not the bad guy here.

255
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,250
Jay, come on.

256
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,250
No, seriously.

257
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,160
All those times you were away,

258
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,160
and all those times you said

259
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,630
that you couldn't

260
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,630
leave the hospital,

261
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,960
who took care

262
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,960
of Dad?

263
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,290
Me.

264
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,530
I did plenty for Dad.

265
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,530
I still do.

266
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,900
Who goes

267
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,900
and checks on him?

268
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,340
Keeps him on his meds?

269
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,340
Yeah, all right.

270
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,740
Tell you what.

271
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,740
When he gets out of here,

272
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,540
you find him

273
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,540
his next apartment.

274
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,140
This is Leslie

275
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,140
and Ryan Scott.

276
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,680
Blair's parents.

277
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,310
I'm Ms. Goodwin,

278
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,310
this is Dr. Manning.

279
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,290
Hey.

280
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,290
We were both at work.

281
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,190
Heard there was a fire

282
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,190
at the apartment, but...

283
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,880
Never expected this.

284
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
Is she in pain?

285
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
No.

286
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,750
We've given her medication

287
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,190
to make sure

288
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,190
she's comfortable.

289
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,920
You've got to save her.

290
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,730
We're going to do

291
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,730
everything we can for her.

292
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
I've reviewed

293
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
the imaging.

294
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,430
This is Dr. Bekker.

295
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,430
She's a cardiothoracic

296
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,430
surgeon

297
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,200
we asked to consult.

298
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,710
One of your

299
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,710
daughter's injuries

300
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,680
is to her right

301
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,680
carotid artery.

302
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,510
What does that mean?

303
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,510
The artery is damaged.

304
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,180
Blocking blood flow.

305
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,180
Don't worry, I can repair it

306
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,180
while her burns

307
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,180
are being excised.

308
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,140
Is Blair going to...

309
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,140
No.

310
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,210
Blair's burns cover

311
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,210
almost 80% of her body.

312
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,950
Once her blood pressure

313
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,950
is stable enough,

314
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,290
we will take her

315
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,290
up to the OR

316
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,760
to begin excision

317
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,760
of her burn tissue.

318
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,990
I am afraid she will need

319
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,990
to remain in the ICU

320
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,090
for several months.

321
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,090
Several months?

322
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,760
While the doctors continue

323
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,760
to excise and graft her burns.

324
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,030
But then

325
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,030
can she come home?

326
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,840
Yes, however, your daughter

327
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,840
is going to need physical

328
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,350
and occupational therapy

329
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,350
to regain her ability to walk,

330
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,150
talk, eat,

331
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,150
even dress herself.

332
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,450
No...

333
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,310
We understand there are

334
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,310
many challenges ahead,

335
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,480
but with proper treatment

336
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,480
and patience,

337
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,830
Blair can recover.

338
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,970
Oh, my baby.

339
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,560
Oh...

340
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,270
Take this one.

341
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,710
Got one more for you.

342
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,310
Hey, Maggie. This one...

343
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,310
Yeah.

344
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,750
I'm gonna get some air.

345
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,750
You just...

346
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,690
You page me if

347
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,690
there's anything

348
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,690
happening with Stella, okay?

349
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,090
Will do.

350
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,250
Otis, you okay?

351
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,160
Yeah.

352
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,160
Otis?

353
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,920
Otis, you okay?

354
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,120
Get over here, Curly!

355
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,120
Get me a gurney.

356
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,820
Ooh.

357
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,820
Let's take you down.

358
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,890
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

359
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,930
Go get the gurney.

360
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,440
Yeah, I got this.

361
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,440
I got it.

362
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,170
Stay with me.

363
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,210
Stay with me.

364
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,210
I understand Otis

365
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,210
had some kind of episode?

366
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,980
Yeah, looks like

367
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,980
an inhalation injury.

368
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,420
I'm giving him

369
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,420
a neb treatment.

370
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,780
Took blood

371
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,780
to run an ABG.

372
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,880
He's doing much better,

373
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,880
but he needs an extensive

374
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,880
physical exam.

375
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,720
Dr. Choi, I need you.

376
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,850
You go ahead.

377
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,850
I'll take a look at him.

378
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,090
Like to keep my chops up.

379
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,090
Thanks.

380
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,190
We've got another burn

381
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,190
victim coming in.

382
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,530
Desmond! Talk to me.

383
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,570
Early 20s, female,

384
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,570
found down at the scene,

385
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,800
unconscious due

386
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,800
to smoke asphyxiation.

387
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,930
Intubated on the ride.

388
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,130
Mags, let's get her

389
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,130
in a room.

390
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,640
Afraid it's

391
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,640
the doctors' lounge.

392
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,730
Doctors' lounge?

393
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,440
Unless you want to go

394
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,440
to the cafeteria.

395
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,810
Doctors' lounge.

396
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,810
Okay.

397
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,370
We were taking her

398
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,370
to East Mercy

399
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,370
but they went on bypass.

400
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,140
No ID or identifying marks

401
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,680
so we're treating her

402
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,680
as a Jane Doe.

403
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,240
Right here, right here.

404
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,240
Yep.

405
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,390
Let's transfer her

406
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,390
on my count.

407
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,620
Everybody ready?

408
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,450
One, two, three.

409
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,320
Start a second IV

410
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,320
and get her on the monitors.

411
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,590
Right away.

412
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,590
What do we have?

413
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,720
No gross deformities,

414
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,460
but she's got some

415
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,460
pretty nasty burns,

416
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,160
including a full thickness,

417
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,160
near circumferential

418
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,530
on her lower left arm.

419
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,190
We need to get fluids in her.

420
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,970
Bolus 500 of ringers

421
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,100
at 200 per hour.

422
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,100
Got it.

423
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,640
Wait, shouldn't we

424
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,640
use Parkland?

425
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,040
Calculate fluid input based

426
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,040
on percentage of burn area.

427
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,510
First 24 hours are critical.

428
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,270
We should start with

429
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,270
a higher volume of fluid.

430
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,370
That's not standard procedure.

431
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,650
I've had experience

432
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,650
with burns in the military.

433
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,280
We can always titrate down

434
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,280
based on urine output.

435
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,750
Your party.

436
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,230
Thanks for that.

437
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,230
All right.

438
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,330
I really feel fine now.

439
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,990
You're a little

440
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,990
tachycardic.

441
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,900
Can you feel

442
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,900
your heart racing?

443
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,830
Yeah, it usually happens

444
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,830
when I get a physical.

445
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,930
You know,

446
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,930
what do they call it,

447
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,930
white coat syndrome?

448
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,300
You know,

449
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,300
doctors, needles...

450
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,400
I hear you.

451
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,910
Probably why your blood

452
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,910
pressure's a little high too.

453
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,100
You ever experience

454
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,100
this before?

455
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,250
Yeah, a couple times.

456
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,910
Nothing serious.

457
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,650
You know. Smoke.

458
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,780
Right.

459
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,910
Ever happen

460
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,910
when you're off duty?

461
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,490
No, why would it?

462
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,260
I'm just going

463
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,260
to make sure

464
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,590
that you don't

465
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,590
have a retinal

466
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,590
burn, all right?

467
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,130
You don't have to go

468
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,130
to all the trouble.

469
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,130
Just checking

470
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,130
all the boxes, bud.

471
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,590
Will you close

472
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,590
your eyes for me?

473
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,910
Doc Charles,

474
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,910
my eyes feel good.

475
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,870
Just humor me.

476
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,910
You see anything?

477
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,120
Colors? Patterns?

478
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,350
No.

479
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,910
Nothing.

480
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,050
Okay.

481
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,530
Just sorry you had...

482
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,900
Such a tough day

483
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,900
at the office.

484
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,940
I heard there were

485
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,940
a lot of victims.

486
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,070
We've got

487
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,070
16 critical patients,

488
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,070
24 stable,

489
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,800
and a dozen more

490
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,800
treated and released.

491
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,640
We've got the doctors'

492
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,640
lounge and the cafeteria

493
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,680
open and running

494
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,680
for the overflow.

495
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,970
What about fatalities?

496
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,280
We've taken three

497
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,280
down to the morgue.

498
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,580
We have two DOAs,

499
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,740
and one more that we weren't

500
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,740
able to resuscitate.

501
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,280
Good work keeping

502
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,280
the trains running.

503
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,850
Let me know

504
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,850
if anything changes.

505
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,260
Will do.

506
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,000
Mags.

507
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah?

508
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,500
The burn patient

509
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,500
we just brought in.

510
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,230
Early 20s, Latina,

511
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,230
no ID, and no family.

512
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,700
Can we make some calls

513
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,700
on a Jane Doe?

514
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,640
Yeah, I'll put out a bulletin

515
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,640
and see what I can find out.

516
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,900
Thanks.

517
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,340
Dr. Halstead, you got that?

518
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,340
Dad?

519
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,580
He was talking

520
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,580
just a minute ago.

521
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,110
No pulse. Bag him.

522
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,550
Wait, he's your dad.

523
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,420
Shouldn't another

524
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,420
doctor run the code?

525
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,790
You got one handy?

526
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,460
What's going on?

527
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,890
He's in V-fib.

528
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,590
Charge to 200

529
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,590
and give me the paddles.

530
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,960
Clear.

531
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
Still no pulse.

532
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
Push a milligram of epi.

533
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,430
Got it.

534
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,240
Will?

535
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,050
Charge to 200.

536
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,050
Charging.

537
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,810
Clear.

538
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,420
Nothing.

539
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,420
Another milligram of epi.

540
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,790
Yep.

541
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,460
Hi.

542
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,800
Good news.

543
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,800
An operating room

544
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,800
has opened up.

545
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,470
We'll be able to take

546
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,470
your daughter upstairs

547
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,470
for burn surgery.

548
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,380
And to repair

549
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,380
her carotid artery.

550
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,450
No. Please stop.

551
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,410
No treatments,

552
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,410
no surgeries.

553
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,410
What?

554
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,680
We don't want any surgeries.

555
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,420
I don't understand.

556
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,050
But if we don't take Blair

557
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,050
up to the OR now,

558
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,050
she won't survive.

559
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,960
My wife and I have

560
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,960
talked about it.

561
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,560
Blair wouldn't want this.

562
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,000
But with proper treatment

563
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,000
she could still have a life.

564
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,090
Look at her.

565
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,690
What kind of life?

566
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,030
These last few years

567
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,030
have been so hard for Blair.

568
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,340
She struggled with

569
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,340
body issues, bullying.

570
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,840
Just recently she was able

571
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,840
to lose weight,

572
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,840
change schools, and...

573
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,540
She finally felt good

574
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,540
about herself.

575
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,340
And now this.

576
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,390
Everything she's

577
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,390
been through...

578
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,550
We can't do this to her.

579
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,560
But people react

580
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,560
differently to trauma.

581
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,060
You don't know.

582
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,930
Surviving this might

583
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,930
actually make your

584
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,930
daughter more resilient.

585
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,910
We know our little girl.

586
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,540
Mr. and Mrs. Scott...

587
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,540
No.

588
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,040
We have to let her go.

589
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,050
Dr. Manning should be clear

590
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,050
about the parents' wishes

591
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,420
before calling me

592
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,420
in to consult.

593
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,650
It was a waste of my time.

594
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,650
I'm sorry?

595
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,060
They're withholding treatment.

596
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,400
How long before you

597
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,400
restored sinus rhythm?

598
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,270
He was down

599
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,270
around five minutes.

600
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,600
Well, that's consistent

601
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,600
with what I'm seeing.

602
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,470
Almost no EEG waveforms.

603
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,800
What does that mean?

604
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,080
You want to tell him?

605
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,910
Are we not seeing

606
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,910
some brain activity?

607
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,920
Artifacts.

608
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,890
Distortion, interference.

609
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,890
Dust on the window.

610
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,050
Okay, I am...

611
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,690
I'm not following.

612
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,120
Your father is brain-dead.

613
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,670
So he's just

614
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,670
not coming back?

615
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,640
Like, you... What,

616
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,640
you're saying that there's...

617
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,830
There's no chance?

618
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,970
If I had to calculate

619
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,970
the odds,

620
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,910
I'd say

621
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,910
1,000 to one against.

622
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,920
This vent could be

623
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,920
put to better use.

624
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,280
What?

625
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,050
Are you serious?

626
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,050
Jay.

627
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,590
The hell is wrong

628
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,590
with you, man?

629
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,180
Are you kidding me?

630
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,180
We'll talk about it.

631
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,560
Thanks, Sam.

632
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,410
She's lost

633
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,410
a significant

634
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,410
amount of blood.

635
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,950
Unfortunately,

636
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,950
the only way

637
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,950
we can be sure

638
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,350
to completely

639
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,350
stop her bleed

640
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,510
is to remove

641
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,510
her entire lung.

642
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,040
What?

643
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,040
Yeah.

644
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,960
Kelly, it's the best chance

645
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,960
we have of saving

646
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,960
Stella's life.

647
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,290
She can't be a firefighter

648
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,290
if she only has one lung.

649
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,560
There's gotta be something

650
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,560
else you can do.

651
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,520
April?

652
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,200
What if we tried ECMO?

653
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,170
It would rest her lung

654
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,170
so we have enough time

655
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,470
to locate the bleed...

656
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,470
No.

657
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,970
We'd have to give her

658
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,970
anti-coagulants to keep

659
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,970
the lines open.

660
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,840
It would make her

661
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,840
bleed even worse.

662
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,040
Isn't it worth a shot?

663
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,510
She's too unstable.

664
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,110
Believe me, Kelly, this is

665
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,110
the best course of action.

666
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,980
Sounds to me like

667
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,980
you've thrown in the towel

668
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,580
before you even tried

669
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,580
to save her lung.

670
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,650
Being a firefighter

671
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,650
is the only thing

672
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,650
Stella cares about.

673
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,750
I'm not gonna let you do it.

674
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,190
I'm sorry.

675
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,120
But it's not up to you.

676
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,060
We haven't been able

677
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,060
to reach her family

678
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,460
so it's our decision.

679
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,790
Get her upstairs.

680
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,270
I won't let you do this.

681
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,270
Kelly, please.

682
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,430
No. No.

683
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,430
Kelly, you have to let me...

684
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,940
No!

685
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,940
Get off! Hey!

686
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,670
Security!

687
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,670
Whoa,

688
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,670
whoa! Ethan?

689
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,760
No!

690
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,340
Kelly...

691
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,400
Come on!

692
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,340
Ethan...

693
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,740
Please escort this man out.

694
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,740
Ethan.

695
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,610
Sir, come with us.

696
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,610
Don't... Don't touch me.

697
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,050
I'm sorry, Kelly.

698
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,920
Don't do this.

699
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,790
Please, sir.

700
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,500
Excuse me.

701
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,470
I was at the fire

702
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,470
and I thought I was fine,

703
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,830
but...

704
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,530
I have a headache now

705
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,530
and I'm feeling

706
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,530
a little dizzy.

707
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,270
Fill this out

708
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,270
and we'll get to you

709
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,270
as soon as we can.

710
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,770
I appreciate it.

711
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,310
Thank you.

712
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,920
Hey, Mags.

713
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,920
Yeah?

714
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,480
Any luck on ID'ing

715
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,480
my Jane Doe?

716
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,750
Nothing yet.

717
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,290
I don't like that guy, man.

718
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,690
I want a second opinion.

719
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,920
He's our top

720
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,920
neurosurgeon.

721
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,100
So all your degrees,

722
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,570
all that money,

723
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,570
all those years in school,

724
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,110
this is the best

725
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,110
you can do?

726
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,980
Jay, Dad almost died

727
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,980
two years ago.

728
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,810
He's been living

729
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,810
on borrowed time.

730
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,350
Abrams didn't say

731
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,350
Dad had no chance.

732
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,720
A thousand to one

733
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,720
is no chance.

734
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,360
You just want

735
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,360
to give up?

736
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm trying to be realistic.

737
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,090
I've seen a lot of patients

738
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,090
in his condition.

739
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,100
There goes that doctor voice.

740
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,730
I'm sorry,

741
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,730
but I am a doctor.

742
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,770
Yeah, don't worry.

743
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,770
We got that message.

744
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,570
And Dad knew you thought

745
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,570
you were better than us.

746
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,440
We always came in second,

747
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,440
you weren't there,

748
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,370
and now you want to

749
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,370
decide what happens?

750
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,840
That is not true, Jay.

751
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,970
There you are.

752
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,380
Ms. Garrett,

753
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,380
this is my brother, Jay.

754
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,110
Yes.

755
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,110
I'm the hospital's C.O.O.

756
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,250
I heard about

757
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,250
your father.

758
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,880
I'm very sorry.

759
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,350
Thank you.

760
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,860
I want you

761
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,860
both to know

762
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,660
that there's no hurry

763
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,660
in making any decisions

764
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,660
about Mr. Halstead.

765
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,260
You have the full support

766
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,260
of this hospital.

767
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,040
And we will provide

768
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,040
your father with any

769
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,040
and all resources.

770
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,870
I appreciate that.

771
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,970
We take care of our own.

772
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,710
This...

773
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,190
Is my cell phone.

774
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,550
You call me

775
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,550
if you need anything.

776
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,590
It's decided.

777
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,330
We're not giving up.

778
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,380
Dr. Manning.

779
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,370
I have the consent form.

780
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,540
They're gonna

781
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,540
let her die.

782
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,180
I don't think

783
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,180
it's that simple.

784
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,550
You ready?

785
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,230
Mr. and Mrs. Scott,

786
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,230
per your request,

787
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,570
this form gives

788
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,570
the hospital consent

789
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,940
to remove Blair

790
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,940
from the ventilator.

791
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,880
I need you to sign it

792
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,880
in my presence.

793
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,510
You sure?

794
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,900
We'll leave you

795
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,900
with your daughter.

796
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,020
Kelly.

797
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,590
They shouldn't have

798
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,590
done that to you, man.

799
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,190
All I care about

800
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,190
is Stella.

801
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,660
She's lucky

802
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,660
to have you.

803
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,330
She loves

804
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,330
what she does, April.

805
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,730
It's her life.

806
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,730
They can't take

807
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,730
out her lung.

808
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,900
I get it.

809
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,400
But since we can't

810
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,400
reach her family,

811
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,970
it's up to the doctors

812
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,970
to make the decision.

813
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,810
But they don't know her.

814
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,080
There's nothing we can do?

815
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,150
Hey. There you are.

816
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,630
I just heard about your dad.

817
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,030
Are you okay?

818
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,590
Just hard to believe.

819
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,200
He was such a force.

820
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,740
How's Jay taking it?

821
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,800
Not good.

822
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,070
They're a lot alike.

823
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,440
Stubborn.

824
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,440
Gwen didn't help.

825
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,280
I mean, she said she would

826
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,280
use the hospital's resources

827
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,150
to keep Dad alive.

828
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,150
Really?

829
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,480
That doesn't

830
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,480
sound like her.

831
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,420
Yeah,

832
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,420
it surprised me too.

833
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,580
I love you.

834
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,750
Let me know if there's

835
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,750
anything I can do, okay?

836
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,000
Here are the ABG results

837
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,000
for Brian Zvonecek.

838
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,040
Thank you.

839
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,040
You're welcome.

840
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,040
Dr. Charles.

841
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,370
Mr. Zvonecek.

842
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,570
When can I get out of here?

843
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,910
So here's the thing.

844
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,470
Your blood gas

845
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,470
shows low CO2,

846
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,540
low carboxyhemoglobin,

847
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,540
and normal oxygen.

848
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,180
That's good, right?

849
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,490
Well, what it means

850
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,490
is that you didn't have

851
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,490
an inhalation injury.

852
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,360
More than likely

853
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,360
you passed out because

854
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,360
you were hyperventilating.

855
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,920
Huh.

856
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,360
All the same,

857
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,360
I'm not sick.

858
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,630
Okay, but...

859
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,860
Why were you

860
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,860
hyperventilating?

861
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,900
And when we can't find

862
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,900
a physical reason,

863
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,770
more often than not it's...

864
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,010
You know, due to

865
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,010
an emotional reaction

866
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,140
to some sort of...

867
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,140
Wait, wait, wait.

868
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,340
Where you going?

869
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,010
What, PTSD?

870
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,010
I didn't use

871
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,010
that label.

872
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,910
I'm just saying

873
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,910
it would explain

874
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,390
the tachycardia,

875
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,390
the elevated

876
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,390
blood pressure...

877
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,950
No. No way.

878
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,260
You know, full disclosure,

879
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,260
I noticed a little hand

880
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,260
tremor earlier today.

881
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,490
But I told you, that

882
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,490
was my blood sugar.

883
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,000
Otis.

884
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,520
You were shot

885
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,520
earlier this year.

886
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,990
I mean, that alone,

887
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,990
it's gonna precipitate

888
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,900
a little

889
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,900
post-traumatic stress.

890
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,800
And that I can tell you

891
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,800
from personal experience.

892
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,840
And after what you went

893
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,840
through today, I mean,

894
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,340
why don't you let me

895
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,340
take you upstairs

896
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,040
for a quick evaluation?

897
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,040
No.

898
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,510
I get it.

899
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,280
You're a shrink,

900
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,280
so everybody you see

901
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,870
has got to have some sort

902
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,870
of mental problem, right?

903
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,480
But not me.

904
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,490
I feel great.

905
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,400
I'm trying to help you.

906
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,400
It's just been...

907
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,660
Dr. Rhodes.

908
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,360
Sorry, guys,

909
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,360
I gotta get scrubbed.

910
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,300
We just want to talk

911
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,300
to you about Stella.

912
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,260
Really, April?

913
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,570
Just hear them out.

914
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,070
We don't want you

915
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,070
to remove her lung.

916
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,400
There has to be

917
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,400
another option.

918
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,600
Look, guys,

919
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,600
I understand your concerns.

920
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,810
But as her doctors,

921
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,810
we've decided on the best

922
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,810
course of treatment,

923
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,680
and only Stella's family

924
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,680
can override that decision.

925
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,110
Dr. Rhodes.

926
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,610
We are her family.

927
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,180
That's true.

928
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,720
She'd tell you

929
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,720
the same thing, Doc.

930
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,600
Another walk-away.

931
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,190
There's another way.

932
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,560
What do you mean?

933
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,320
The majority

934
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,320
of lung bleeds

935
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,990
originate in

936
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,990
the lower lobes, right?

937
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,120
So?

938
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,030
So what if I clamp at the base

939
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,030
of the pulmonary artery?

940
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,500
Connor, you made

941
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,500
the right call.

942
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,800
We have a good

943
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,800
surgical plan.

944
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,740
But what if we resect

945
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,740
the lower lobe first.

946
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,280
If the bleeding stops,

947
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,280
we won't have to remove

948
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,280
the entire lung.

949
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,240
No, it's too risky.

950
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,240
But if it doesn't work,

951
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,540
we can still remove the lung.

952
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,050
After wasting precious time.

953
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,340
Have you forgotten we're

954
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,340
trying to save her life?

955
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,350
I think we can do that

956
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,350
and give her the life

957
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,350
that she wants.

958
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,780
She's a young woman.

959
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,780
She can find

960
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,780
another career.

961
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,960
I have to try.

962
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,250
I owe it to her.

963
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,250
I owe it to them.

964
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,160
Connor, being a firefighter

965
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,160
isn't gonna mean a damn thing

966
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,130
if Stella dies

967
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,130
on the table.

968
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,500
I can do it.

969
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,500
Don't... Connor!

970
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,180
Time, Dr. Rhodes.

971
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,180
Where are we?

972
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,240
I'm almost there,

973
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,240
but every time

974
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,240
the lung inflates

975
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,810
it obstructs my view.

976
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,010
Marty, can we deflate

977
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,010
the lung

978
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,420
any further?

979
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,420
No way.

980
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,510
I'm barely keeping her

981
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,510
oxygenated as it is.

982
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,780
Take it down

983
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,780
another 20%.

984
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,980
It's too risky.

985
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,080
I only need to reach

986
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,080
the lower lobe.

987
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,890
I'll find the bleed

988
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,890
and make my resection

989
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,450
before you know it.

990
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,130
Make it fast.

991
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,240
You're quite the patient

992
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,240
advocate today.

993
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,540
Did you do it for Stella

994
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,540
or for Kelly?

995
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,680
I've known him

996
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,680
since we were kids.

997
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,450
You didn't answer

998
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,450
the question.

999
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,830
I did it because

1000
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,830
it was the right thing to do.

1001
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,420
Marty?

1002
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,190
BP's down to 88 systolic.

1003
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,660
I'm close.

1004
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,200
Let's hope so.

1005
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,770
You are not going

1006
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,770
to make it.

1007
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,570
We have to open her up

1008
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,570
and remove the lung.

1009
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,040
BP's at 82.

1010
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,040
Up her pressers.

1011
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,100
Can't, I'm already maxed-out.

1012
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,100
Connor, please.

1013
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,910
Just give me a second.

1014
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,350
The sats are at 78,

1015
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,350
that's all she can tolerate.

1016
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,880
I'm re-inflating the lung.

1017
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,890
No, wait. There.

1018
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,820
That's it.

1019
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,820
That's the bleed.

1020
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,150
You found it, but do you

1021
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,150
have time to fix it?

1022
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,750
What happened?

1023
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,700
Her hand's ice-cold,

1024
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,700
I can't get a pulse.

1025
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,320
The forearm's tight.

1026
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,320
She's got

1027
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,320
compartment syndrome.

1028
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,630
Get Maggie.

1029
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,100
I told you to use

1030
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,100
the Parkland formula.

1031
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,160
You gave her

1032
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,160
too much fluid.

1033
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,640
No. I've been monitoring

1034
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,640
her urine output.

1035
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,900
Everything's been normal.

1036
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,910
Then what's your explanation

1037
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,910
for this?

1038
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,730
What do you need?

1039
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,730
Find us an OR,

1040
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,840
this woman needs an

1041
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,840
emergency fasciotomy.

1042
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,740
I'll tell you right now

1043
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,740
all the ORs are occupied.

1044
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,010
You're gonna have to wait.

1045
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,010
How long?

1046
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,280
20 minutes?

1047
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,280
We can't.

1048
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,980
20 minutes, she'll end

1049
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,980
up with an amputation.

1050
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,580
Get me a soft tissue

1051
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,580
tray and a scalpel.

1052
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,950
We'll relieve

1053
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,950
the pressure now.

1054
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,350
Right here.

1055
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,760
Prep the patient.

1056
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,590
Come in.

1057
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,400
Ms. Goodwin.

1058
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,530
Oh, Dr. Halstead.

1059
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,470
I'm very sorry

1060
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,470
about your father.

1061
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,660
Did you know?

1062
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,830
Did I know what?

1063
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,070
Gwen Garrett made a special

1064
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,070
point of telling me and Jay

1065
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,340
that there was no hurry

1066
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,340
in taking my dad off the vent.

1067
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,470
Okay?

1068
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,940
My dad's chart. His bypass

1069
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,940
surgery was 29 days ago.

1070
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,580
Twenty-nine days ago.

1071
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,650
I see.

1072
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,050
I can't believe

1073
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,050
the hospital would do this.

1074
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,680
Not to me.

1075
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,290
Not to my family.

1076
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,480
Hey, Jay.

1077
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,910
We gotta take Dad

1078
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,910
off the vent.

1079
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,320
What?

1080
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,890
No, no, no. He...

1081
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,860
I've been sitting with him

1082
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,860
and he blinks his eyes.

1083
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,660
And I grabbed his hand

1084
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,660
and he squeezed my hand.

1085
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,460
He squeezed my hand.

1086
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,300
Those are just reflexes.

1087
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,430
They don't mean anything.

1088
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,630
I'm telling you, man,

1089
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,630
he knows that I'm here.

1090
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,840
He doesn't.

1091
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,770
He can't.

1092
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,050
We can't, he's...

1093
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,550
He's gotta come back,

1094
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,550
man, 'cause...

1095
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,980
That can't be

1096
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,980
the last conversation

1097
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,610
I ever have with him.

1098
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,890
Look, whatever regrets

1099
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,890
you have,

1100
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,420
you're not gonna

1101
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,420
resolve them here.

1102
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,020
You just gotta accept that.

1103
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,860
Don't tell me

1104
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,860
what I got to accept.

1105
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,970
Jay, the reason Gwen

1106
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,970
encouraged us to take

1107
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,970
our time with Dad?

1108
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,210
His bypass was

1109
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,210
29 days ago.

1110
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,170
If he dies

1111
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,170
before 30 days are up,

1112
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,210
regardless of why,

1113
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,210
it's a fatality

1114
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,210
for the hospital.

1115
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,410
So what?

1116
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,340
So Gwen's just trying

1117
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,340
to keep Dad alive

1118
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,340
for one more day

1119
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,440
so the hospital

1120
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,440
doesn't take the hit.

1121
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,220
I get it.

1122
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,220
You feel betrayed.

1123
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,260
I don't care.

1124
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,260
I care about Dad.

1125
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,290
And you think

1126
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,290
he'd want

1127
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,290
to be kept alive

1128
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,690
to buff some numbers?

1129
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,660
You need to get out.

1130
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,660
You got to get out, man.

1131
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,020
They're using him.

1132
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,960
That's your problem.

1133
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,660
Jay, he's gone.

1134
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,930
Doc, you okay?

1135
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,550
You got my discharge?

1136
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,760
Gotta be honest,

1137
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,760
I'm just not comfortable

1138
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,170
signing off on you

1139
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,170
going back to work yet.

1140
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,870
You're gonna

1141
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,870
keep me from working.

1142
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,000
Look, I'll make you a deal.

1143
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,680
Commit to some therapy.

1144
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,540
Twice a week.

1145
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,540
Once a week.

1146
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,640
You don't get it.

1147
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,020
I can't be a firefighter

1148
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,020
if I have PTSD.

1149
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,350
What, you can't be

1150
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,350
a firefighter

1151
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,350
and have feelings?

1152
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,720
Look, I have no problem

1153
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,720
keeping this out of your chart

1154
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,880
if that'll make

1155
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,880
you feel better.

1156
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,790
If I see a shrink,

1157
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,790
people are gonna

1158
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,790
find out.

1159
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,490
I can't have that.

1160
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,130
Tell me something.

1161
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,530
When I asked you

1162
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,530
to close your eyes

1163
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,530
earlier today,

1164
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,570
what did you see?

1165
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,130
What'd you really see?

1166
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,570
Otis, you can tell me.

1167
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,440
Okay.

1168
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
I had to get a mom

1169
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
and a baby out

1170
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
of the building.

1171
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,980
I lost contact.

1172
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,650
Told her not

1173
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,650
to get in the elevator.

1174
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,120
She got in the elevator.

1175
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,720
The elevator got stuck.

1176
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,230
When we finally

1177
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,230
got the doors open...

1178
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,360
There they were.

1179
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,240
Burned alive.

1180
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,570
Their faces were gone

1181
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,570
but I knew it was them.

1182
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,050
I can't get it

1183
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,050
out of my head.

1184
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,880
It's called

1185
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,880
an intrusive memory.

1186
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,680
I can help you with that.

1187
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,030
Doc Charles...

1188
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,070
It means life's not

1189
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,070
a stroll across a meadow.

1190
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,740
These things I see...

1191
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,670
They're part of the job.

1192
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,840
Every firefighter sees them.

1193
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,710
We cope.

1194
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,160
I'm out of here.

1195
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,720
You want to destroy my life,

1196
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,600
write whatever you want

1197
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,600
in your chart.

1198
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,840
Dr. Manning?

1199
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,500
Yes.

1200
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,500
We need you.

1201
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,880
Veronica.

1202
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,320
She's still breathing

1203
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,320
on her own.

1204
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,120
Yes. Her oxygen levels

1205
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,120
are good.

1206
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,250
It's been hours.

1207
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,320
Her heart rhythm

1208
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,320
is strong.

1209
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,570
She's holding on.

1210
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,240
She wants to live.

1211
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,540
My little girl,

1212
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,540
she wants to live.

1213
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,910
And we were going

1214
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,910
to let her go.

1215
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,580
What do we do?

1216
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,580
How can we help her?

1217
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,580
She needs to go

1218
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,580
to surgery right now.

1219
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,620
Do it. Help her.

1220
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,120
Tell the OR

1221
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,120
we're coming up.

1222
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,980
Scissors.

1223
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,840
Okay, pressure's

1224
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,840
been relieved,

1225
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,080
but that's not fluid.

1226
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,240
It's blood.

1227
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,560
Her ulna's broken.

1228
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,890
That's what caused

1229
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,890
the bleeding.

1230
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,130
Compartment syndrome

1231
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,130
was caused by fractured

1232
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,130
hematoma, not fluid.

1233
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,600
It wasn't

1234
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,600
your fault, Dr. Choi.

1235
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,440
They found her

1236
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,440
just outside the room

1237
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,440
where the fire started,

1238
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,030
so how would she

1239
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,030
have broken her arm?

1240
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,240
There's also

1241
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,240
extensive bruising

1242
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,240
around her ribs and pelvis.

1243
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,480
This woman wasn't just burned.

1244
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,590
She was beaten.

1245
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,300
You guys put me

1246
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,300
in a terrible position.

1247
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,650
But we were able

1248
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,650
to isolate the bleed,

1249
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,980
and we only had to take out

1250
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,980
a portion of her lung.

1251
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,380
It was a thoracoscopic

1252
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,380
procedure, minimally invasive.

1253
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,880
That's all to say that...

1254
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,250
She should be back

1255
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,250
to work in no time.

1256
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,780
Oh, my God.

1257
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,780
Hey...

1258
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,350
Dr. Rhodes...

1259
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,850
You're the man.

1260
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,830
Yeah, you guys are okay too.

1261
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,250
Thanks.

1262
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,360
Why don't you bring

1263
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,360
Kelly back in?

1264
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,260
Thanks, Doc.

1265
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,260
You got it, bud.

1266
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,680
You were extremely lucky,

1267
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,680
you know that?

1268
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,080
Extremely.

1269
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,620
Kelly.

1270
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,090
She's awake.

1271
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,990
Wants to see you.

1272
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,040
Stop.

1273
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,080
I'm so glad you're back.

1274
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,630
Of course.

1275
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,920
Come here.

1276
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,020
Hey.

1277
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,990
You okay?

1278
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,290
I could have been

1279
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,290
a better son.

1280
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,860
Could have been

1281
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,860
a better brother.

1282
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,200
Oh, Will...

1283
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,740
Your dad knew

1284
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,740
you loved him.

1285
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,740
And so does Jay.

1286
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,220
Oh, no.

1287
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,980
I got it.

1288
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,120
Here you go.

1289
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,120
Thank you.

1290
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,050
Sir,

1291
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,050
can I help you?

1292
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,520
My uncle was

1293
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,520
in the building

1294
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,520
with the fire.

1295
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,750
I thought they might have

1296
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,750
brought him here.

1297
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,190
Okay, sir, so I'm gonna

1298
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,190
need you to go back

1299
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,190
into the waiting room

1300
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,980
and give the nurse

1301
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,980
your uncle's name.

1302
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,360
She'll let you know

1303
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,360
if your uncle was admitted.

1304
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,660
All right.

1305
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,660
Thank you.

1306
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,320
Thank you.

1307
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,320
Yeah.

1308
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,770
Told you you were

1309
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,770
going home, huh?

1310
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,910
Dr. Choi discharged him?

1311
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,180
No, I did.

1312
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,520
Really?

1313
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,890
Yeah.

1314
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,010
He's in pretty good hands.

1315
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,690
For now.

1316
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,120
I'm sorry, Jay.

1317
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,860
For everything.

1318
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,660
For not being there

1319
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,660
for you and Dad.

1320
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,000
And for not giving

1321
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,000
you space to grieve.

1322
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,000
We'll keep him on the vent

1323
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,000
as long as you want.

1324
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,100
Who am I kidding, man?

1325
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,510
I know

1326
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,510
he's not coming back.

1327
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,690
Let him go.

1328
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,730
Just let him go.

1329
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,480
Take these too.

1330
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,150
Maggie?

1331
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,150
Yeah.

1332
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,850
What happened

1333
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,850
to our Jane Doe?

1334
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,190
Dr. Choi?

1335
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,930
She turned off

1336
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,930
the monitors.

1337
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,260
She has serious

1338
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,260
internal injuries.

1339
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,060
If we don't find her soon,

1340
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,060
she's gonna die.
