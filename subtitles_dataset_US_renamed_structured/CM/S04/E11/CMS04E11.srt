1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,660
Next.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,660
Yeah, can I get a...

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,040
Hey, there's a line.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,540
My shift starts in five.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,000
You understand.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,140
We've all got places

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,140
to be, I'm next.

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,540
Cut me a break, all right?

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,820
Can I get

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,820
a double espresso?

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,480
I said I was next.

12
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,040
What is your problem, man?

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,110
No problem.

14
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,350
Will, can I talk

15
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,350
to you a second?

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,390
What has gotten into you?

17
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,390
Guy's a dick.

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,830
I'm concerned about you.

19
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,230
Why? Because I wouldn't

20
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,230
let him cut in front of me?

21
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,960
No, because you're not

22
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,960
acting like yourself.

23
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,730
Yeah, well, maybe

24
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,730
I'm a little upset

25
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,100
about you throwing me out.

26
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,100
I didn't throw you out.

27
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,440
Right. The gun,

28
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,440
the gun, the gun.

29
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,870
Will, I think you should

30
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,870
consider talking to someone.

31
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,080
I think you're having

32
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,080
a hard time processing

33
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,080
all of it.

34
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,340
Anybody would.

35
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,940
Nat, I don't want

36
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,940
to process it.

37
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,250
I want to forget

38
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,250
it ever happened

39
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,550
and move on with my life.

40
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,150
Our life.

41
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,790
You were talking

42
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,790
in your sleep last night.

43
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,230
Really? I haven't

44
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,230
done that in a while.

45
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,400
Hmm.

46
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,870
What was I saying?

47
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,000
Your usual.

48
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,000
Barking orders

49
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,000
to subordinates.

50
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,610
Sounds like me.

51
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,910
Give me the box!

52
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,820
Hey, get back here,

53
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,820
that's mine!

54
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,280
You don't want that!

55
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,480
Hey, you okay?

56
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,290
Get off me, man!

57
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,660
Stay down.

58
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,090
Ethan!

59
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,790
Get out of here.

60
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,830
What happened?

61
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,030
He might be having

62
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,030
a heart attack.

63
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,300
His pulse is

64
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,300
through the roof.

65
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,040
I called an ambulance.

66
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,800
Here, here, here, here.

67
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,800
Let me do it. Let me do it.

68
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,370
Take deep breaths.

69
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,370
In and out.

70
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,380
Petechiaes all over

71
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,380
his chest, too.

72
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,320
Oh, my God.

73
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,590
Gangrene.

74
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,370
April, call General Surgery

75
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,370
for a consult.

76
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,940
He'll need to have

77
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,940
his leg debrided.

78
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,820
Meantime, start him on fluids,

79
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,820
hang a gram of vanc,

80
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,010
500 metronidazole,

81
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,010
order a CBC, CMP,

82
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,750
blood cultures,

83
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,750
and chest X-ray.

84
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,560
Add a cardiac panel and EKG.

85
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,560
Need to rule out his heart.

86
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,430
Dr. Choi, do you want

87
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,430
a cardiac panel and EKG?

88
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,640
Yeah.

89
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,730
Mags, any luck finding ID?

90
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,780
Not yet, and there was

91
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,780
nothing in his clothes.

92
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,080
I got some lock cutters.

93
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,780
Figured there might be

94
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,780
something inside.

95
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,710
Let me try.

96
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,730
He's a veteran.

97
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,730
Yeah.

98
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,030
Marks.

99
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,070
Reginald Marks.

100
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,400
Oh.

101
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,770
Silver Star.

102
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,770
Which one is that?

103
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,180
It's awarded for

104
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,180
heroism during combat.

105
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,770
Dr. Choi, CFD's coming in

106
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,770
with semi-conscious

107
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,770
26-year-old.

108
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,810
Ah, go.

109
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,810
I'll make a call

110
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,810
to the VA.

111
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,650
Find him

112
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,650
a housing placement.

113
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,820
Thanks.

114
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,220
All right, I got this.

115
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,890
I'm sure it's just

116
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,890
my asthma acting up.

117
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,300
It happened with the

118
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,300
last pregnancy, too.

119
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,770
Is this your second?

120
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,770
Yep.

121
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,170
Double the fun

122
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,170
this time. Twins.

123
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,900
Congratulations.

124
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,900
Thanks.

125
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,440
But actually,

126
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,440
they're not mine.

127
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,100
I'm a surrogate.

128
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,910
Usually, Nate and Stephanie,

129
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,910
the twins' biological parents,

130
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,920
come with me to all

131
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,920
my doctor's visits,

132
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,780
but I didn't want to

133
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,780
panic them over nothing.

134
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,650
Yeah, I hear some

135
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,650
scattered wheezes.

136
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,920
I think you're right.

137
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,190
Uterus is compressing

138
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,190
the lungs,

139
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,920
exacerbating your asthma.

140
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,160
Let's get a MedNeb

141
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,160
and 40 milligrams of IV

142
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,160
methylprednisolone.

143
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,330
Well, since you're here...

144
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,330
Ultrasound?

145
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,870
This isn't

146
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,870
your first rodeo.

147
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,800
Baby boy is doing

148
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,800
somersaults today.

149
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,640
Probably the salsa

150
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,640
I had with my eggs.

151
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,880
Spicy foods always

152
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,880
get 'em moving.

153
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,650
His sister,

154
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,650
on the other hand,

155
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,650
hardly ever kicks.

156
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,250
Celine, have you had your

157
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,250
anatomy ultrasound yet?

158
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,120
No, it's for next week.

159
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,280
Is something wrong?

160
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,560
The male fetus's

161
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,560
amniotic fluid is elevated.

162
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,170
But that can happen

163
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,170
with twins. I just...

164
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,930
I'd like to get

165
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,930
a better picture

166
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,930
of what's going on.

167
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,630
Well, should I call

168
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,630
Nate and Stephanie?

169
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,070
I think that'd be

170
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,070
a good idea.

171
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,270
Just take these three.

172
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,270
Yep.

173
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,900
Hey.

174
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,410
Will still crashing

175
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,410
at his brother's?

176
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,570
Mmm-hmm.

177
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,250
How long?

178
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,650
He can come home

179
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,650
whenever he wants.

180
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,120
Just not with that gun.

181
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,210
He's been through hell.

182
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,490
I get that.

183
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,320
He just needs time to get

184
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,320
reacclimated to his old life.

185
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,460
I hope so. I just wish

186
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,460
he'd let me in.

187
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,190
He'll come around.

188
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,130
Mr. Davis.

189
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,500
Hello.

190
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,470
Hey, Phillip.

191
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,470
Dr. Manning.

192
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,970
How's little Sophie doing?

193
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,070
She's good, she's good.

194
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,070
Um, they say that

195
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,070
we can, uh...

196
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,910
That I can

197
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,910
take her home soon.

198
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,850
I'm so glad to hear that.

199
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,850
Me, too.

200
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,390
I'm so sorry,

201
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,390
Dr. Manning. Heads up.

202
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,350
Ambo is in,

203
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,350
Treatment Six.

204
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,350
Okay.

205
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,290
Sorry about that.

206
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,290
I'm sorry, um...

207
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,990
It was good to see you.

208
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,990
You, too. Yeah.

209
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,260
Get the hell away from me!

210
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,630
Good Samaritan found her

211
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,630
wandering, called 911.

212
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,690
Fran Mooney,

213
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,630
83-year-old female

214
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,630
with Alzheimer's disease.

215
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,970
BP is 138 over 90.

216
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,630
I said let me go!

217
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,000
She was able

218
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,000
to tell you all that?

219
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,130
Medical alert bracelet.

220
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,700
Called the emergency contact

221
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,700
on the back.

222
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,870
Daughter should be

223
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,870
here any second.

224
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,180
Okay. Dr. Charles,

225
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,180
can I grab you?

226
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,810
All right, let's sheet

227
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,810
transfer on my count.

228
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,020
Ready. One, two, three.

229
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,920
Milty? Milty.

230
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,330
Tell these people

231
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,330
to get the hell away from me!

232
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,890
I'm actually Dr. Charles,

233
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,890
but could you tell me

234
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,990
a little bit more

235
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,990
about Milty?

236
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,760
Milton was her husband.

237
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,500
Who the hell are you?

238
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,500
Lungs are clear.

239
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,700
Mom, it's me. It's Alana.

240
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,610
Don't touch me!

241
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,670
2.5 haloperidol IM.

242
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,470
Help calm her down

243
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,470
a little bit.

244
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,250
I'm so sorry,

245
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,250
this is the third

246
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,250
time this month

247
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,910
she's wandered.

248
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,480
I don't know

249
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,480
how she keeps

250
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,480
getting out.

251
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,780
I always lock the door.

252
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,350
You notice any other

253
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,350
changes in her...

254
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,290
Her general disposition?

255
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,320
She's more agitated

256
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,320
than usual,

257
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,530
and she's lost

258
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,530
some weight, too.

259
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,600
All right, well,

260
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,600
we'll run some labs

261
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,070
and see if there's anything

262
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,070
out of the ordinary, okay?

263
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,730
Okay.

264
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,170
Might just have to

265
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,170
adjust her meds a bit.

266
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,240
Thank you.

267
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,450
Long night?

268
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,620
Exceptionally long.

269
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,620
Why don't you head over

270
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,620
to my place?

271
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,250
The new mattress just got

272
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,250
delivered this morning.

273
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,060
Don't you think that's

274
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,060
something we ought to

275
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,060
break in together?

276
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,000
I like where your head's at.

277
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,590
So listen,

278
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,590
we haven't really, um...

279
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,930
We haven't talked about

280
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,930
what happened at the gala.

281
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,900
Connor...

282
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,410
What Cornelius

283
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,410
told people...

284
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,270
It was vintage my father.

285
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,340
He's spreading lies

286
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,340
and using you

287
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,340
to get under my skin.

288
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,280
Look, he's a prick.

289
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,470
Bekker. Good.

290
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,520
There was a huge pileup on

291
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,520
the highway near East Mercy.

292
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,140
I had to send two surgeons

293
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,140
over there to assist.

294
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,410
Do you mind

295
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,410
sticking around the ED?

296
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,680
We could really use

297
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,680
the extra hand.

298
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,820
So much for sleep. Sure.

299
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,620
You hold onto those.

300
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,200
You two a thing?

301
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,200
What's it to you?

302
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,730
Well, give me a heads-up

303
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,730
when she dumps you.

304
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,240
Rhodes, head versus auto,

305
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,240
Trauma Three.

306
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,240
You got it. Courtney?

307
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,740
Leslie Taylor,

308
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,740
37-year-old female.

309
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,300
Car struck her

310
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,300
in the crosswalk.

311
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,400
GCS 12, heart rate 130.

312
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,780
BP 86 over palp.

313
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,870
Leslie, I'm Dr. Rhodes,

314
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,870
do you know where you're at?

315
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,850
Was there an accident?

316
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,720
You were hit by a car,

317
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,720
but now you're

318
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,720
in the hospital.

319
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,810
What happened?

320
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,810
Was I in an accident?

321
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,360
She lose consciousness

322
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,360
at any point?

323
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,950
Bystander said she was out

324
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,950
for a few minutes

325
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,950
after it happened.

326
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,090
I couldn't get

327
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,090
anything coherent

328
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,090
from her in the ambo.

329
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
All right. Let's get her

330
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
over on my count.

331
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,760
One, two, three.

332
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,100
There we go.

333
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,210
Her breath sounds clear

334
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,210
and present bilaterally.

335
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,140
Was I in an accident?

336
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,140
Maggie filled me in.

337
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,270
I'll clear the C-spine?

338
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,150
Can't. She's perseverating.

339
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,580
You gotta wait

340
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,580
until she's lucid.

341
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,880
Let's do a FAST scan.

342
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,690
She's jaundiced.

343
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,690
Yeah.

344
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,420
Maggie!

345
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,420
Yeah.

346
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,080
Check to see

347
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,080
if the patient's

348
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,080
in the system.

349
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,060
Look for anything that would

350
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,060
account for the jaundice.

351
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,190
Just pulled up her records.

352
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,260
She's got a lot of blood

353
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,260
in her belly.

354
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,270
All right, let's give her

355
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,270
a liter of fluid,

356
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,820
two units of plasma,

357
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,820
two units of blood.

358
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,960
Once her pressure stabilizes,

359
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,960
we're gonna move her to CT.

360
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,200
Yes, Doctor.

361
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,000
Jaundice is

362
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,000
from liver disease.

363
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,000
She's on the list.

364
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,300
Was I in an accident?

365
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,300
If her liver took the hit...

366
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,710
She doesn't have much time.

367
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,110
Yeah.

368
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,080
Dr. Halstead.

369
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,560
This is Nate

370
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,560
and Stephanie Addison,

371
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,560
the twins' parents.

372
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,820
Hi.

373
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,480
Hi, there.

374
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,480
Hi.

375
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,850
I'm afraid I have

376
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,850
some difficult news.

377
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,490
What's wrong?

378
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,170
The male fetus has something

379
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,730
called a congenital

380
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,730
diaphragmatic hernia.

381
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,130
His abdominal organs have

382
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,130
migrated into his chest

383
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,770
through a hole

384
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,770
in his diaphragm.

385
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,100
Oh, my God.

386
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,370
It's treatable, right?

387
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,640
There are surgical options

388
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,640
post-birth,

389
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,280
but due to the

390
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,280
severity of his case,

391
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,750
his prognosis is poor.

392
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,250
And unfortunately,

393
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,250
that is not all.

394
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,460
The increased fluid

395
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,460
is compressing

396
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,460
the female twin,

397
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,300
jeopardizing her growth.

398
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,770
So you're saying

399
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,770
she's in trouble, too?

400
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,240
There has to be

401
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,240
something you can do.

402
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,330
Yeah.

403
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,010
Selectively reducing

404
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,010
the male fetus

405
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,540
would give her

406
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,540
the best chance

407
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,540
of survival.

408
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,150
You mean...

409
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,150
Lose him.

410
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,840
I am so sorry.

411
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,390
Is there a chance

412
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,390
things could stabilize

413
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,620
on their own if we just wait?

414
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,450
It's possible,

415
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,450
but in all likelihood,

416
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,690
the fluid will

417
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,690
continue to build,

418
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,730
hindering her

419
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,730
lung development.

420
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,770
Oh, no.

421
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,730
But the earlier

422
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,730
we intervene,

423
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,730
the better.

424
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,750
Dr. Charles. I got

425
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,750
Fran Mooney's labs back.

426
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,360
Her TSH is really low,

427
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,360
so I ran some more tests.

428
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,520
It's likely due to an overdose

429
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,520
of her thyroid medication.

430
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,920
Huh.

431
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,520
Yeah, so I'm gonna

432
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,520
put her on beta blockers

433
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
and start detoxing her

434
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
with charcoal.

435
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,590
Let me talk to the daughter,

436
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,590
find out who's in charge

437
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,590
of the meds.

438
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,760
Okay.

439
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,770
Your EKG and labs

440
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,770
were negative.

441
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,710
You didn't have

442
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,710
a heart attack.

443
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,440
Have you ever had chest pain

444
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,440
like that before?

445
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,940
Yeah, I have.

446
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,650
Panic attacks?

447
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,210
Yeah.

448
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,950
When I got back

449
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,950
from my first tour,

450
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,680
I started talking

451
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,680
in my sleep.

452
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,710
Shouted out

453
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,710
orders, mostly.

454
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,090
It was like every night,

455
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,090
I went back to Afghanistan.

456
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,660
Army?

457
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,660
Navy.

458
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,260
Squid.

459
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,660
Reservist now.

460
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,660
Vicki's active duty.

461
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,340
How long did you serve,

462
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,340
Reginald?

463
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,370
Reggie, please.

464
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,340
I was 12 years in the Corps.

465
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,280
I made it all the way

466
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,280
up to Gunny.

467
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,470
Mmm.

468
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,550
Three tours in Iraq

469
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,550
and two in Afghanistan.

470
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,050
The last tour

471
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,050
was the roughest.

472
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,590
I had an IED

473
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,590
that took my leg.

474
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,990
Took three of

475
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,990
my Marines with it.

476
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,260
Sorry, man.

477
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,340
Sorry to interrupt.

478
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,340
Dr. Choi, can I

479
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,340
talk to you?

480
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,870
Yeah.

481
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,600
Be right back.

482
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,980
Got the rest of

483
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,980
Reggie's labs back.

484
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,280
White count is 18,000.

485
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,280
His platelets...

486
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,420
His platelets

487
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,420
are what?

488
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,210
I'm sorry, I can't share

489
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,210
test results with someone

490
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,550
who's not on staff

491
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,550
at the hospital.

492
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,860
You know, I'll, uh...

493
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,860
I'll head back to the VA.

494
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,560
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

495
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,560
Yeah.

496
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,940
Bye, April.

497
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,940
Bye.

498
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,100
His platelets are

499
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,100
really low. 30,000.

500
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,600
He's got thrombocytopenia.

501
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,600
Guy can't catch a break.

502
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,730
Puts him at risk

503
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,730
for bleeding.

504
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,940
Page Hematology

505
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,940
for a consult.

506
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,100
Okay.

507
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,100
Wait a second.

508
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,380
What's with the attitude?

509
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,380
What do you mean?

510
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,650
Why are you giving

511
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,650
Vicki a hard time?

512
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,650
I was just protecting

513
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,650
patient confidentiality.

514
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,810
Following the rules.

515
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,320
Dr. Halstead?

516
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,090
We've decided that, um...

517
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,800
Celine will have

518
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,800
the procedure.

519
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,100
We've tried

520
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,100
for six years

521
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,100
to have a child.

522
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,000
These were our

523
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,000
last two embryos.

524
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,840
We just can't risk

525
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,840
losing both of them.

526
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,080
I'll let Obstetrics know.

527
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,580
I give my mom her pills,

528
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,850
but I only give her

529
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,850
one tablet every morning.

530
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,690
That's what

531
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,690
the doctor prescribed.

532
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,090
You mind me asking,

533
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,090
where are the meds kept?

534
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,130
Are they locked away, or...

535
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,070
I came as soon as I could.

536
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,070
Had to leave a client meeting.

537
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,530
This is my husband,

538
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,530
Patrick.

539
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,770
Patrick, this is Doctor...

540
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,770
Sorry, remind me?

541
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,540
Dr. Charles.

542
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,540
Nice to meet you.

543
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,540
They think Mom overdosed

544
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,540
on her thyroid medication,

545
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,910
but I don't see how.

546
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,750
Maybe Fran got

547
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,750
into the pills?

548
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,370
No, of course not.

549
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,150
She can't even button

550
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,150
her own shirt.

551
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,210
There's no way she could

552
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,210
open a pill bottle herself.

553
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,420
She unlocked the front door.

554
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,230
You know, when Fran

555
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,230
was first diagnosed,

556
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,630
she begged Alana

557
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,630
to euthanize her.

558
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,120
She couldn't stand

559
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,120
the thought

560
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,120
of deteriorating.

561
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,400
But she's not lucid enough

562
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,400
to attempt suicide.

563
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,770
Is she?

564
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,100
Periods of lucidity aren't

565
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,100
uncommon with Alzheimer's,

566
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,880
and, you know, the increased

567
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,880
agitation, the weight loss,

568
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,710
I mean, those both,

569
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,710
they could be signs

570
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,710
of depression.

571
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,350
I told you. Your mother

572
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,350
shouldn't be living with us.

573
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,660
We are not having

574
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,660
this conversation right now.

575
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,120
Why don't you two

576
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,120
take a break?

577
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,650
Go grab a cup of coffee.

578
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,650
Let me have a chat with Fran.

579
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,430
Okay?

580
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,430
You go ahead.

581
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,990
I have to respond

582
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,990
to some client emails.

583
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,310
Celine, you all right?

584
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,310
He just kicked.

585
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,940
I know it's him,

586
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,940
he's always on the right.

587
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,260
Wait, wait. Stop.

588
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,260
What is it?

589
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,660
I can't do this.

590
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,660
What?

591
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,030
You heard Dr. Halstead.

592
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,030
We don't have a choice.

593
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,630
He said there's a chance

594
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,630
things could stabilize.

595
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,730
Celine, we can't risk

596
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,730
losing both of our babies.

597
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,040
How about

598
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,040
we talk this out...

599
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,580
I'm sorry, but I'm not

600
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,580
willing to let him go.

601
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,210
I can't do the procedure.

602
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,210
I just can't.

603
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,330
Okay, here's the clause

604
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,330
in the surrogacy contract.

605
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,130
The parents have

606
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,130
the right to request

607
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,130
a selective reduction

608
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,230
for any medical reason.

609
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,740
And the surrogate agreed

610
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,740
to defer to their wishes?

611
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,670
She signed the contract.

612
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,670
But she has since

613
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,670
very emphatically

614
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,670
changed her mind.

615
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,710
Okay, well, that's

616
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,710
the funny thing

617
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,710
about contracts.

618
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,210
They don't really care

619
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,210
if you change your mind.

620
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,810
Well, I don't care

621
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,810
if she signed

622
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,810
the thing in blood.

623
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,180
Celine is not

624
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,180
a human incubator.

625
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,950
I won't force

626
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,950
a procedure on her

627
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,950
without her explicit consent.

628
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,550
You're not gonna do

629
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,550
anything at all,

630
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,550
Dr. Halstead.

631
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,750
This is a legal matter now.

632
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,750
Let the lawyers hash it out.

633
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,130
Waiting room's jumping.

634
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,130
What's going on?

635
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,230
Mass casualty

636
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,230
over at East Mercy.

637
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,830
They went on bypass

638
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,830
about an hour ago.

639
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,200
Started diverting

640
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,200
patients here.

641
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,470
Hi.

642
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,670
Uh, I think

643
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,670
my sister's here,

644
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,670
Leslie Taylor.

645
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,870
She was hit by a car.

646
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,870
Yes, I'm the nurse

647
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,870
who left the message

648
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,970
but I'm taking that

649
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,970
you're not Paul Taylor?

650
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,990
No, that's Leslie's husband.

651
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,990
Ex-husband. He called me.

652
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,290
Okay, just give me a second.

653
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,290
I'll get her doctor.

654
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,110
Okay.

655
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,490
Dr. Choi! I need you.

656
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,970
BP's in the toilet.

657
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,970
Heart rate's 130.

658
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,560
Must be an upper GI bleed.

659
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,560
He's got thrombocytopenia.

660
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,800
He won't be able

661
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,800
to make a clot.

662
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,200
He needs blood

663
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,200
and platelets now.

664
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,760
Trigger the MTP,

665
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,760
I'm gonna intubate.

666
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,810
Twenty etomidate, 100 of sux,

667
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,810
and grab me an EGD scope.

668
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,500
Gotta find the source

669
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,500
of the bleed.

670
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,610
The impact from the accident

671
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,610
destroyed the right lobe

672
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,550
of Leslie's liver.

673
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,090
We will be able

674
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,090
to fix it for now,

675
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,590
but she's gonna need

676
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,590
a new liver urgently,

677
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,860
and because of her condition,

678
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,860
she's gonna move up

679
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,090
the transplant list

680
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,090
from her previous status.

681
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Wait, previous status?

682
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,160
What do you mean?

683
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,100
Leslie's already

684
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,100
on the transplant list.

685
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,260
You didn't know?

686
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,770
Right, right.

687
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,770
Of course I did.

688
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,470
I'm sorry. There's just

689
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,470
a lot to take in.

690
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,740
You were saying?

691
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,180
So if Leslie doesn't get

692
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,180
a new liver

693
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,870
in the next few days...

694
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,510
Oh, God.

695
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,510
There is another option.

696
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,120
A living donor.

697
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,680
Someone can donate

698
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,680
a lobe of their liver.

699
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,180
Really?

700
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,120
I'll donate, then.

701
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,120
What do I need to do?

702
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,100
First of all,

703
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,100
you should know

704
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,560
that there can be

705
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,560
complications

706
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,560
for the donor that...

707
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,760
I don't care.

708
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,900
Is there anybody that you need

709
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,900
to talk to about this?

710
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,100
No. There's no...

711
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,340
I need to do this

712
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,340
for my sister, Dr. Rhodes.

713
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,670
Okay. We'll get you

714
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,670
tested right away.

715
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,690
Fran, could you

716
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,690
open this bottle,

717
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,150
take out a pill,

718
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,150
and hand it to me?

719
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,050
Could you do that?

720
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,260
You do it, Milty.

721
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,340
Just pull down

722
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,340
the tab and press.

723
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,550
She's in a-fib with RVR.

724
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,110
Give me 10 of diltiazem.

725
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,110
Yes, ma'am.

726
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,520
Meds are in.

727
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,690
She's back

728
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,690
in normal sinus rhythm.

729
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,130
It's odd that she

730
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,130
flipped into a-fib.

731
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,290
We've already treated her

732
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,290
hyperthyroidism.

733
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,340
I'm gonna order an echo,

734
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,340
see what's going on.

735
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,670
Yeah, good idea.

736
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,370
But, um...

737
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,880
I think we might be

738
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,880
dealing with more than

739
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,880
just an overdose here.

740
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,610
April,

741
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,610
call the blood bank.

742
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,170
We're gonna need

743
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,170
more platelets.

744
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,620
Give the second dose

745
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,620
of TXA.

746
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,990
That's it.

747
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,550
That's where

748
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,550
he's bleeding from.

749
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,610
Epinephrine injector.

750
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,360
Ready?

751
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,360
Mmm-hmm.

752
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,870
There we go.

753
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,870
I think we got it.

754
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,880
Dr. Choi.

755
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,780
Damn it. It's not clotting.

756
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,870
They won't allocate

757
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,870
any more platelets for Reggie.

758
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,040
What? Why?

759
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,240
'Cause of the MCI

760
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,240
at East Mercy.

761
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,440
There's a citywide shortage.

762
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,280
Blood bank's been mandated

763
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,280
to dispense only to patients

764
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,280
who will benefit.

765
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,880
Go down there in person

766
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,880
and tell them the order's

767
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,880
coming from me.

768
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,050
Do not take no

769
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,050
for an answer.

770
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,720
We've given him

771
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,720
multiple doses.

772
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,020
It is not working.

773
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,220
I didn't ask

774
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,220
for your opinion.

775
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,890
Do it now, or I'll get

776
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,890
someone who will.

777
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,470
There's more.

778
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,970
I want to make sure

779
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,970
you understand you're in

780
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,970
clear breach of contract.

781
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,630
I'm sorry, but I think

782
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,630
we should just wait and see

783
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,610
if things stabilize

784
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,610
on their own.

785
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,670
With all due respect,

786
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,670
there is no we.

787
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,610
It's the Addisons' decision

788
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,610
and theirs alone.

789
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,250
It's her body.

790
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,980
That doesn't give her

791
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,980
the right to hold my clients'

792
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,980
fetuses hostage.

793
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,480
That's not my intention.

794
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,480
Listen.

795
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,890
I'd hate to have

796
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,890
to bring this to trial

797
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,760
because if I do,

798
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,760
you'll be facing

799
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,320
severe legal and financial

800
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,320
ramifications.

801
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,030
Let's take it

802
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,030
down a notch, okay?

803
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,160
You're not gonna force

804
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,160
her hand with intimidation

805
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,160
and scare tactics.

806
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,140
Why don't you stay

807
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,140
in your lane, Doctor?

808
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,630
This doesn't

809
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,630
concern you.

810
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,540
Oh, no, it does concern me,

811
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,540
because you're upsetting

812
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,540
my patient.

813
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,070
You need to leave.

814
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,170
Our lawyer

815
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,170
is not going anywhere

816
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,170
until we figure this out.

817
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,550
Celine, do you want her

818
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,550
to leave?

819
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,250
Excuse me.

820
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,750
I'm Sharon Goodwin,

821
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,750
Director of Patient

822
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,750
Medical Services.

823
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,420
Is there anything

824
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,420
I could help you sort out?

825
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,720
Yes. We'd like

826
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,720
a different doctor.

827
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,660
Dr. Halstead is clearly

828
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,660
biased against us.

829
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,730
That's not up to you.

830
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,730
I'm Celine's doctor.

831
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,670
Only she can make

832
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,670
that decision.

833
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,600
Dr. Halstead, can I

834
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,600
speak to you outside?

835
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,140
Ms. Goodwin...

836
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,140
Now.

837
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,820
You're wrong,

838
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,820
Dr. Halstead.

839
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,250
You know who else

840
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,250
can make that decision?

841
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,380
Me.

842
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,690
And if the Addisons

843
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,690
aren't comfortable

844
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,690
with you...

845
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,920
You're benching me?

846
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,920
I'm reassigning the case.

847
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,160
Yes.

848
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,100
Unbelievable.

849
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,070
When was the

850
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,070
prescription filled?

851
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,770
I don't remember.

852
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,070
I think Patrick picked up

853
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,070
the last refill.

854
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
It was about a month ago.

855
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,240
No good?

856
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,980
A little sweeter than I like.

857
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,580
Can I get you another cup?

858
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,580
No, no. It's fine.

859
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,520
Okay, so there's

860
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,520
20 pills left,

861
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,530
and the quantity

862
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,530
of the prescription was 90.

863
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,060
Sorry, I'm terrible at math.

864
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,600
It's okay.

865
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,600
There should be

866
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,600
60 pills remaining,

867
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,930
which means there's 40 pills

868
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,930
unaccounted for.

869
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,840
You think my mom

870
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,840
took 40 pills?

871
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,530
No, no, if she took

872
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,530
that many pills at once,

873
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,130
she would be in a coma.

874
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,270
The overdosing has to be

875
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,270
taking place over time,

876
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,370
like, a little bit each day.

877
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,740
And based on my evaluation,

878
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,010
your mom doesn't have

879
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,010
the cognition

880
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,140
to be able to carry out

881
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,140
a repetitive, multistep

882
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,140
task anyway.

883
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,280
Wait, you think someone's

884
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,280
doing this to her?

885
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,290
Is there anybody who comes

886
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,290
and goes from your home?

887
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,560
A part-time caregiver, or...

888
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
There was for a bit,

889
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
but she quit months ago.

890
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,290
And the only people with

891
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,290
access to my mom's pills

892
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,290
are me and...

893
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,930
My husband.

894
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,510
What if I don't get

895
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,510
a liver in time?

896
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,520
Well, the good news is that

897
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,520
we found you a donor already.

898
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,780
Really?

899
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,780
Mmm-hmm.

900
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,630
We tested your sister.

901
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,630
Turns out...

902
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,090
No, no. Wait, my sister?

903
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,390
Denise?

904
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,390
Yeah.

905
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,890
How did she know

906
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,890
I was here?

907
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,970
Hi, Leslie.

908
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,500
What are you doing here?

909
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,610
Leslie, please.

910
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,770
No, I told you to

911
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,770
stay away from me.

912
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,780
I just want to help you.

913
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,480
I don't want your help.

914
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,580
Leslie, hear me out.

915
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,580
Get out!

916
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,020
Whoa!

917
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

918
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

919
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,430
Here, let's step outside.

920
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,750
Um, take a deep breath.

921
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,890
Deep breath, that's it.

922
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,760
Look, Leslie, I don't know

923
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,760
what happened between you

924
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,760
and your sister, but she...

925
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,840
I'll tell you what happened.

926
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,410
She killed my little girl.

927
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,060
Mary was only

928
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,060
three years old.

929
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,460
Denise put her to bed.

930
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,820
Went downstairs,

931
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,900
lit her bong,

932
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,630
and smoked herself

933
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,630
into oblivion.

934
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,370
When she woke up,

935
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,370
the house was in flames.

936
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,680
She managed

937
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,680
to get herself out,

938
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,050
but she was too stoned

939
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,050
to remember

940
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,060
that Mary...

941
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,760
My Mary...

942
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,700
Was still upstairs.

943
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,770
I won't accept

944
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,770
anything from her.

945
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,710
I'd rather die.

946
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,090
That's all you can do.

947
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,330
I asked her

948
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,330
to stick around,

949
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,460
see if we can get Leslie

950
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,460
to change her mind.

951
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,030
Denise doesn't think

952
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,030
she'll budge.

953
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,570
Yeah, no,

954
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,570
she was quite adamant.

955
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,010
I mean...

956
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,540
I can understand.

957
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,600
Connor,

958
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,600
she's cheating herself

959
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,600
out of life to what?

960
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,880
Punish her sister?

961
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,610
Denise has already

962
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,610
done that to herself.

963
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,410
Every day of her life,

964
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,410
she has to reckon

965
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,410
with what happened.

966
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,510
What do you mean,

967
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,510
with what she did?

968
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,620
She's not shirking

969
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,620
responsibility.

970
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,850
The opposite.

971
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,690
That's why

972
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,690
she's so desperate

973
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,690
to make amends.

974
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,820
Well, look, regardless,

975
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,820
we can't force Leslie

976
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,800
to accept Denise's liver.

977
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,830
No. We just have to stand by

978
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,830
and watch her die.

979
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,430
We both know the likelihood

980
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,870
of another liver

981
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,870
coming through

982
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,870
in time is slim.

983
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,630
She's got days, at most.

984
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm gonna reach out

985
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,440
to the hospital's PR team,

986
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,180
get them to put out

987
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,180
an urgent public appeal

988
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,180
for a donor.

989
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,610
What?

990
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,610
Nothing.

991
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,910
No, that's a good idea.

992
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,600
Where are the platelets?

993
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,600
He's not getting any more.

994
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,600
They have to be conserved

995
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,600
for patients who have

996
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,600
an actual shot at survival.

997
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,570
He has a shot.

998
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,570
Once the meds kick in,

999
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,510
the platelets start holding,

1000
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,510
we can get him up to surgery.

1001
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,870
We both know

1002
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,870
that is not

1003
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,870
gonna happen.

1004
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,810
We take him up to the OR,

1005
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,810
he's gonna bleed out...

1006
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,280
You have no right

1007
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,280
to deny him treatment.

1008
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,780
Dr. Choi?

1009
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,680
He's bleeding

1010
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,680
from his IV, too.

1011
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,240
He's in v-fib.

1012
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,240
No pulse.

1013
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,520
April, charge to 200.

1014
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,520
Doris, start bagging.

1015
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,520
Charging.

1016
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,890
Charged.

1017
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,890
Clear.

1018
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,630
Dr. Choi.

1019
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,630
Amp of epi.

1020
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,690
Charging to 200.

1021
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,500
Clear.

1022
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,900
Doris?

1023
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,480
He's asystolic.

1024
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,480
Another amp of epi.

1025
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,670
Dr. Choi, enough!

1026
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,670
Another amp of epi!

1027
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,180
Give him an amp of bicarb

1028
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,180
and an amp of calcium.

1029
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,650
On it.

1030
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,650
Come on.

1031
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,650
Come on.

1032
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,600
Time of death, 16:48.

1033
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,780
The Addisons aren't

1034
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,780
speaking to me except

1035
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,780
through their lawyer.

1036
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,550
I don't know what to do.

1037
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,380
I can't afford to be in some

1038
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,380
long, drawn-out legal battle.

1039
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,120
Maybe I should just

1040
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,120
respect their wishes.

1041
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,360
But I know they don't

1042
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,360
want this either.

1043
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,900
That's why I'm here.

1044
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,900
I may have found another way.

1045
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,800
It's an investigational

1046
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,800
procedure called

1047
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,800
fetal tracheal occlusion.

1048
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,840
If successful, it would allow

1049
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,840
the twins to reach viability.

1050
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,770
I mean, it could even help

1051
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,770
improve the male fetus'

1052
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,770
lung function.

1053
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,410
Hold on, though.

1054
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,220
General anesthesia

1055
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,220
always carries risks.

1056
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,620
And because of your asthma,

1057
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,020
the potential

1058
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,020
complications

1059
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,020
are increased.

1060
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,450
You would be

1061
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,450
putting yourself

1062
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,450
on the line.

1063
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,700
I know they're not mine.

1064
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,900
And when it's time

1065
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,900
to hand them over,

1066
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,900
I'll be happy to,

1067
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,740
'cause I know how loved

1068
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,740
and wanted they are.

1069
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,240
But while they're

1070
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,240
still inside my body,

1071
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,840
while their lives

1072
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,840
depend on me,

1073
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,020
I have to do

1074
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,020
what I think is best.

1075
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,730
I want to do it, Dr. Halstead.

1076
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,760
This is absurd.

1077
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,870
I can't believe that

1078
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,870
you think I would do

1079
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,870
something like this!

1080
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,200
I don't know

1081
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,200
what to think.

1082
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,300
I know you resented my mom

1083
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,300
moving in with us.

1084
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,500
The imposition on our lives.

1085
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,840
So you think I'm trying

1086
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,840
to kill her?

1087
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,470
No one's

1088
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,470
accusing you

1089
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,470
of anything.

1090
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,840
Yes, you are.

1091
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,970
We're just trying

1092
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,970
to understand

1093
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,970
how this happened.

1094
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,660
Too sweet? Your coffee.

1095
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,660
Is your coffee too sweet?

1096
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,490
Yeah.

1097
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,290
Why?

1098
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,360
Alana, I'd like you

1099
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,360
to get an MRI.

1100
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,200
April, that man risked

1101
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,200
his life for all of us.

1102
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,300
We owed it to him to do

1103
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,300
everything we possibly could.

1104
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,640
Yeah, but we did, Ethan.

1105
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,340
The situation

1106
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,340
had become futile,

1107
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,340
you just couldn't see it.

1108
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,110
So you had to go

1109
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,110
snitch to Lanik?

1110
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,740
I was following

1111
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,740
the chain of command.

1112
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,180
Funny, you're such

1113
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,180
a stickler for the rules

1114
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,580
when they align

1115
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,580
with your agenda.

1116
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,950
My only agenda

1117
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,950
is the welfare

1118
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,950
of my patients.

1119
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,350
Then you wouldn't have

1120
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,350
interfered when I was trying

1121
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,350
to save Reggie's life.

1122
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,650
Did you go to Lanik

1123
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,650
to get back at me?

1124
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,820
Get back at you?

1125
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,620
You made it very clear

1126
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,620
you resent Vicki.

1127
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,650
Are you serious?

1128
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,090
You think I would

1129
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,090
jeopardize a patient

1130
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,090
to get even with you?

1131
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,040
You two need to take this

1132
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,040
outside right now.

1133
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,140
You're disturbing my ED.

1134
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,310
Sorry, Maggie.

1135
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,310
We're done.

1136
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,160
Alana. We have

1137
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,160
the results of your MRI,

1138
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,490
and we were just wondering

1139
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,490
if we could discuss...

1140
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,000
Please, just tell me.

1141
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,170
Your MRI shows atrophy

1142
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,170
to the hippocampus.

1143
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,860
It's the area of your brain

1144
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,860
associated with memory.

1145
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,270
Combined with some

1146
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,270
of the behaviors that

1147
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,270
we observed today,

1148
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,510
forgetting that you had

1149
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,510
already put sugar

1150
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,510
in your coffee,

1151
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,240
problems with simple math,

1152
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,440
the findings are consistent

1153
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,420
with the initial stages

1154
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,420
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

1155
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,280
Jesus.

1156
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,120
Wait.

1157
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,730
You mean

1158
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,730
I'm gonna end up

1159
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,730
like my mom?

1160
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,230
There are certain medications

1161
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,230
that help slow the disease's

1162
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,230
progression.

1163
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,430
Not to mention hundreds

1164
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,430
of new clinical trials,

1165
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,730
some of the results

1166
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,730
of which are promising,

1167
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,440
especially when

1168
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,440
started early.

1169
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,550
What... Wait,

1170
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,550
so it was me?

1171
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,440
I was...

1172
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,340
I was overdosing her?

1173
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,480
Accidentally.

1174
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,540
You were forgetting

1175
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,020
that you had already

1176
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,020
given her the medication.

1177
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,120
Oh, my God.

1178
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,300
What have I done?

1179
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,660
I'm so sorry. I...

1180
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,660
I can't believe

1181
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,660
I suspected you.

1182
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,870
Can you ever forgive me?

1183
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,060
Honey...

1184
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,540
It's okay.

1185
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,740
We'll give you both some time.

1186
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,940
Thank you.

1187
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,020
Hey. I have great news.

1188
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,750
We found a donor

1189
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,750
for Leslie.

1190
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,890
Someone answered

1191
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,890
the hospital's public plea.

1192
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,230
Really? That fast?

1193
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,260
It just went out

1194
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,260
a few hours ago.

1195
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,460
I could hardly

1196
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,460
believe it myself.

1197
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,500
Um, is it a living donor,

1198
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,330
or did the family

1199
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,330
of the deceased

1200
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,330
request it go to Leslie?

1201
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,540
Uh, I don't know.

1202
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,130
It's all anonymous, so...

1203
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,870
Right.

1204
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,840
Her disease

1205
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,840
was staring her

1206
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,840
in the face.

1207
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,180
But she was never

1208
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,180
gonna see it.

1209
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,180
Well, that's

1210
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,180
the kicker, right?

1211
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,220
I mean, a primary symptom

1212
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,220
of early Alzheimer's

1213
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,220
is anosognosia.

1214
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,350
Anosognosia?

1215
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,400
It's when you don't realize

1216
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,400
you have a disease.

1217
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,660
You can't recognize

1218
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,660
anything's wrong.

1219
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,700
Dr. Charles?

1220
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,570
Can I talk to you

1221
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,570
about something?

1222
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,040
Of course.

1223
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,140
Dr. Halstead.

1224
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,260
What part of

1225
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,260
"you are off the case"

1226
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,260
was unclear to you?

1227
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,980
I felt I had

1228
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,980
an ethical obligation

1229
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,930
to present Celine

1230
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,930
with all the options.

1231
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,830
While you had no qualms

1232
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,830
about leaving the Addisons

1233
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,990
out of the decision entirely.

1234
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,200
You know, this is

1235
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,200
the kind of behavior

1236
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,830
that almost got you

1237
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,830
kicked out of residency.

1238
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,810
You're an attending

1239
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,810
physician now.

1240
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,340
You know better.

1241
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,800
Dr. Halstead.

1242
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,470
Are you still planning

1243
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,470
to observe?

1244
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,810
We're about to start.

1245
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,480
We're not done.

1246
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,350
I'll deal with you after.

1247
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,860
Dr. Choi.

1248
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,200
I'm doing

1249
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,200
the nursing schedule

1250
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,200
for next month.

1251
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,960
Wanted to let you know

1252
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,960
that I'm putting you

1253
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,970
and Nurse April

1254
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,970
on alternate shifts.

1255
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,030
Did April request that?

1256
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,030
No.

1257
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,970
But until you two

1258
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,970
get your acts together,

1259
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,840
I'm not gonna risk

1260
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,840
another spectacle.

1261
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,410
That won't work

1262
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,410
for me, Mags.

1263
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,210
Unfortunately, Dr. Choi,

1264
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,210
it's not your decision

1265
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,210
to make.

1266
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,950
I understand.

1267
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,920
Unless April objects,

1268
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,810
I want her on my shifts.

1269
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,750
Excuse me.

1270
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,090
April.

1271
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,690
I'm leaving.

1272
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,690
Please don't.

1273
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,530
You know what,

1274
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,530
for the record,

1275
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,940
I would never let

1276
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,940
our personal history

1277
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,940
affect my decision-making

1278
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,940
when it comes to patients.

1279
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,070
I know. I shouldn't

1280
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,070
have accused you.

1281
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,010
I didn't report you

1282
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,010
to Lanik out of spite.

1283
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,480
You left me no choice.

1284
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,480
I'm sorry, April.

1285
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,470
And maybe I could be

1286
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,470
nicer to Vicki.

1287
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,850
But it's hard.

1288
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,690
Seeing you together is...

1289
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,350
It's hard, Ethan.

1290
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,330
April.

1291
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,770
Don't. No.

1292
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,780
Hey.

1293
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,120
You okay?

1294
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,120
What?

1295
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,190
Maggie told me about Reggie.

1296
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,330
Sounds like you did

1297
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,330
everything you could.

1298
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,830
I wish I could have

1299
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,830
done more.

1300
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,970
Come on.

1301
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,440
Let's go.

1302
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,930
What the hell

1303
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,930
were you thinking?

1304
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,990
If Leslie ever finds out...

1305
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,990
She won't.

1306
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,290
That's why

1307
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,290
it's so perfect.

1308
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,570
An anonymous,

1309
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,570
self-directed

1310
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,570
donation.

1311
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,470
Denise's identity can never be

1312
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,470
revealed without her consent.

1313
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,100
There is no justification

1314
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,110
for blatantly disregarding

1315
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,110
Leslie's wishes.

1316
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,340
Listen, I tried

1317
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,340
to keep you out of it.

1318
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,470
You kept me out of it

1319
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,470
because you knew

1320
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,470
I wouldn't be on board.

1321
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,210
Okay, so go on.

1322
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,210
Tell her the truth.

1323
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,350
I can take the hit,

1324
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,350
but her death,

1325
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,350
that'll be on you.

1326
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,980
We're saving her life.

1327
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,980
The end justifies the means.

1328
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,060
Oh, hey, Daniel.

1329
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,430
You got a minute?

1330
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,430
For you? Maybe.

1331
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,340
What's up?

1332
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,070
It's about Will Halstead.

1333
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,280
Popular topic of

1334
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,280
conversation today.

1335
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,280
Is that right?

1336
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,810
Did our babies make it?

1337
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,120
Dr. Dennis will be out to

1338
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,120
speak with you both shortly,

1339
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,680
but the surgery was a success.

1340
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,360
Yeah, both fetuses

1341
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,360
have strong heartbeats.

1342
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,290
Is Celine okay?

1343
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,290
Yeah, she did just fine.

1344
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,380
What, so I don't do

1345
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,380
what you want,

1346
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,380
and you force it on me?

1347
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,180
What are you talking about?

1348
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,550
Mandatory counseling,

1349
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,550
Goodwin's orders.

1350
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,850
Or I could take a leave

1351
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,850
of absence, my choice.

1352
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,580
Tell me

1353
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,580
this isn't your doing.

1354
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,090
I spoke with Dr. Charles

1355
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,090
because I'm worried.

1356
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,590
That's terrific.

1357
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,790
You told

1358
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,790
the Head of Psychiatry

1359
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,790
I'm unstable.

1360
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,060
You are the only one

1361
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,060
who doesn't see that

1362
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,060
there's a problem.

1363
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,900
Will, please.

1364
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,900
This is not you.

1365
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,340
Or maybe it's not

1366
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,340
the Will you want.

1367
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,040
What does that mean?

1368
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,910
I am done being

1369
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,910
everyone's puppet.

1370
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,440
How can you

1371
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,440
put that on me?

1372
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,950
I wasn't the one pulling

1373
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,950
the strings. How could I?

1374
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,810
You lied to me,

1375
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,810
you kept me

1376
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,810
in the dark.

1377
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,050
You're still keeping me

1378
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,050
in the dark.

1379
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,470
Well, well.

1380
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,900
Young Oedipus.

1381
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,720
Come to hit me again?

1382
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,120
What happened

1383
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,120
between you and Ava?

1384
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,000
Let me get you a drink first.
