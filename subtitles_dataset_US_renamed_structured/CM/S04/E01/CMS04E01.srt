1
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,300
I told them

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,300
that she can stay with us.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,840
You can't trust her.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,840
Look, I'm sorry,

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,000
but she's coming

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,000
home with us.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,550
No, Ethan,

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,550
she's going home

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,550
with you.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,780
Will you marry me?

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,410
This is Gwen Garrett,

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,410
our new C.O.O.

13
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,390
New? We never had

14
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,390
an old C.O.O.

15
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,920
We lose one girl,

16
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,920
we lose them both.

17
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,190
The VSD's repaired.

18
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,700
You got an offer tonight,

19
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,700
didn't you?

20
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,560
Mayo Clinic.

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,460
Of course

22
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,460
you're going to take it.

23
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,270
Would you?

24
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,560
You're suggesting

25
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,560
I'm a murderer.

26
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,170
You know what's

27
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,170
the most fascinating thing

28
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,170
about serial killers?

29
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,540
They all can't seem

30
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,540
to resist

31
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,140
taking a personal item

32
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,140
from their victims.

33
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,210
Bob?

34
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,520
Dad?

35
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,290
We need a crash cart.

36
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,290
Crash cart, now!

37
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,890
We need a crash cart

38
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,890
in here.

39
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,360
There's no pulse.

40
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,360
Take over

41
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,360
compressions.

42
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,630
Start bagging.

43
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,870
Charged to 200. Clear!

44
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,640
Clear!

45
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,280
Resume compressions.

46
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,280
Charged to 200.

47
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,880
Clear.

48
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,040
We need to talk.

49
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,420
Charge to 200.

50
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,030
This way.

51
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,700
This is my father's.

52
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,250
Appreciate your help,

53
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,250
Dr. Reese.

54
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,380
Forensics will gather

55
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,380
samples to collect

56
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,380
for DNA,

57
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,930
but they may need to take

58
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,930
a few of your father's

59
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,930
things to the lab.

60
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,630
I understand.

61
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,930
I know that

62
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,930
this isn't easy,

63
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,200
but... But it's the right

64
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,200
thing to do.

65
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,540
You're the last person

66
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,540
to tell me what's right.

67
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,350
Sharon.

68
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,350
Yo.

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,930
Have you heard

70
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,930
from Dr. Reese?

71
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,230
She's your resident.

72
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,230
Why would she call me?

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,230
Well, she's due back today,

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,230
but I was expecting her

75
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,860
at rounds first thing

76
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,860
this morning.

77
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,740
Well, she hasn't

78
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,740
been in touch.

79
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,340
Let's hope she's okay.

80
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,070
But don't you need to address

81
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,070
our new med students?

82
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,550
Yeah.

83
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,340
Ladies and gentleman,

84
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,340
this is Dr. Charles.

85
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,220
He's our Chief of Psychiatry.

86
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,550
Good morning,

87
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,550
and welcome.

88
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,790
First thing I want to

89
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,790
tell you about is...

90
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,900
Packing up?

91
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,900
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,200
Our days of butting

93
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,200
heads are almost over.

94
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,600
Oh, thank God for that.

95
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,170
By the way, did you know

96
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,170
that Rochester, Minnesota,

97
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,540
is the 14th coldest city

98
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,540
in the U.S.?

99
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,580
And Chicago's 48, you know.

100
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,580
It's much warmer.

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,710
Why don't you just admit it?

102
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,710
You don't want me to go.

103
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,910
Oh, please.

104
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,150
Oh, you're going to miss me.

105
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,120
Miss the most

106
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,120
egotistical, ambitious,

107
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,120
and arrogant man

108
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,360
I've ever met? Hardly.

109
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,160
Here.

110
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,530
Now that you are a big shot

111
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,530
attending, I'm going to leave

112
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,530
you with this.

113
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,940
"Cardiac surgeons

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,940
fix broken hearts."

115
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,490
We could have

116
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,490
had something.

117
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,850
You're the one

118
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,850
who's leaving.

119
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,420
Dr. Bekker, Dr. Rhodes.

120
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,420
They need you in the ED.

121
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,690
Suspected TRA coming in.

122
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,690
Yeah.

123
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,000
Trevor Keyes,

124
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,000
high-speed decelerating

125
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,940
motor vehicle crash.

126
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,940
Prolonged extrication.

127
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,570
Right arm BP 136/88.

128
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,570
Nothing in his left.

129
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,980
Wife was treated

130
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,980
on the scene.

131
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,740
Mr. Keyes, do you know

132
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,740
where you are?

133
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,850
Can you squeeze my hand?

134
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,850
All right, minimal response.

135
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,440
Let's transfer him

136
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,440
on my count.

137
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,980
One, two, three.

138
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,930
All right, let's go.

139
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,300
Okay, Mr. Keyes,

140
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,300
can you touch

141
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,300
your chin to your chest?

142
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,090
Any pain?

143
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,090
No.

144
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,830
Head side-to-side,

145
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,830
pain?

146
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,830
No.

147
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,890
Good, c-spine is cleared.

148
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,460
Let's get a chest x-ray

149
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,460
stat. Logroll.

150
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,300
Dr. Choi?

151
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,300
Dr. Bekker and Dr. Rhodes.

152
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,000
They're cardiothoracic

153
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,000
surgeons.

154
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,870
X-ray clear.

155
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,870
This is his wife.

156
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,140
Linda. Please,

157
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,140
help my husband.

158
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,880
There's weakness in Mr. Keyes'

159
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,880
left hand, and it's cold.

160
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,620
Wide mediastinum.

161
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,620
What's that mean?

162
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,090
There is a high probability

163
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,090
of a contained rupture

164
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,090
in his aorta.

165
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,020
We need to get Mr. Keyes

166
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,020
to the hybrid room right away.

167
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,720
Okay.

168
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,720
All right, let's go.

169
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,990
Have anesthesia

170
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,990
meet us upstairs,

171
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,960
and bring esmolol

172
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,960
for the road.

173
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,960
Right away.

174
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,700
Don't worry, baby.

175
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,700
It's gonna be all right.

176
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,110
It's gonna be all right.

177
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,510
Out of the way.

178
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,240
Out of the way!

179
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,240
Everybody out.

180
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,280
Out, out, out, out! Come on,

181
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,280
let's go, let's go, let's go.

182
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,150
Linda.

183
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,010
Linda.

184
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,260
I love you.

185
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,790
Trev, I love you, too.

186
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,060
But you're gonna be fine.

187
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,960
I...

188
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,160
Trev? Trevor?

189
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,570
Nothing.

190
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,570
What's happening?

191
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,330
No pulse.

192
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,330
Trevor.

193
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,140
Oh, God.

194
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,140
Come on.

195
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,670
Oh, God, Trevor.

196
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,140
Let's go.

197
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,140
Wrong floor.

198
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,370
This isn't surgery.

199
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,370
Can't wait.

200
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,780
Got to open his chest now.

201
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,050
Get me a scalpel.

202
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,050
Connor.

203
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,710
Check his pulse.

204
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,990
No.

205
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,990
Why? What's happening

206
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,990
to him?

207
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,820
His aorta ruptured.

208
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,820
I've got to get control.

209
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,050
Here.

210
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,030
Trevor, no, no!

211
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,790
No!

212
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,340
Help me spread his ribs.

213
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,540
Can you feel the hole?

214
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,650
There's too much blood.

215
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,650
Oh, God.

216
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,550
His aorta is wide open.

217
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,550
What do you mean?

218
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,050
I'm so sorry.

219
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,050
There's nothing I can do.

220
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,860
No, Trevor.

221
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,860
He's gone.

222
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,200
He's dead?

223
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,200
I'm sorry.

224
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,700
Trevor's dead?

225
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,200
No!

226
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,170
No, Trevor, no! No!

227
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,500
Trevor, no!

228
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,150
Time of death, 8:23.

229
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,000
We shouldn't have

230
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,000
lost the patient.

231
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,670
His aorta burst.

232
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,670
What could you have done?

233
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,140
When we were in the ED,

234
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,800
he hadn't yet suffered

235
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,800
the fatal rupture.

236
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,540
If we'd been able to

237
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,540
repair his injury there,

238
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,740
he'd still be alive.

239
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,340
The problem

240
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,340
was the time it took

241
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,850
transferring him upstairs.

242
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,640
But the ED isn't

243
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,640
equipped to perform

244
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,840
the kind of procedure

245
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,840
you're talking about.

246
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,910
That's Dr. Rhodes's point.

247
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,110
There needs to be

248
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,880
a hybrid operating room

249
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,880
in the ED.

250
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,650
Fully equipped to perform

251
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,650
emergency cardiac surgery.

252
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,320
An OR in the ED.

253
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
We have lost far too many

254
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
patients on the way

255
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
to the OR.

256
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,520
Actually, I like the idea,

257
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,570
but converting a trauma room

258
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,570
into a surgical suite...

259
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,570
It's not

260
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,570
an inexpensive proposition.

261
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,350
I'll tell you what.

262
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,350
Write up a proposal.

263
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,380
I'll have it on your desk

264
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,380
in an hour.

265
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,110
Dr. Rhodes, with

266
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,110
your background

267
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,250
in both trauma and CT,

268
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,250
you'd be the ideal person

269
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,220
to head a program like this.

270
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,060
If the board okays it,

271
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,060
I'd like you to stay.

272
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,190
I'm sorry, Ms. Goodwin,

273
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,190
but I start at the

274
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,190
Mayo Clinic on Monday.

275
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,540
Hey.

276
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,450
That looks so good on you.

277
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,680
I agree.

278
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,580
You know, we should get

279
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,580
serious about a date.

280
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,820
Book a venue.

281
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,820
A venue?

282
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,190
I was thinking more of like

283
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,190
a city hall-type thing.

284
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,590
I don't know,

285
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,590
a few friends.

286
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,590
Maybe dinner after.

287
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,360
What, no, I already

288
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,360
talked to Father Brady.

289
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,160
He promised us

290
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,160
a Saturday at St. Ursula's.

291
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,860
Nat, I got a whole

292
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,860
neighborhood to invite.

293
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,130
We need a hall.

294
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,170
Dr. Manning, Dr. Halstead,

295
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,170
with me.

296
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,540
Okay.

297
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,040
Desmond?

298
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,040
25-year-old deaf male

299
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,040
Peter Rush.

300
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,870
Intractable headache,

301
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,870
disoriented.

302
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,780
Sensitivity to light.

303
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,780
GCS 15.

304
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,580
Vomited times two

305
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,580
in the ambo.

306
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,480
Maggie,

307
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,480
will you help us?

308
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,480
Yep.

309
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,320
Would you like

310
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,320
an interpreter?

311
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,550
Yes.

312
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,550
She's certified.

313
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,030
Let's sheet transfer.

314
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,030
One, two, three.

315
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,290
Heart rate 112,

316
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,290
BP 122/76.

317
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,990
Normal sinus rhythm.

318
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,990
These two take care of you.

319
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,230
This is his fiancée, Bonnie.

320
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,700
Have you been deaf

321
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,700
since birth?

322
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,370
No, 14. Mumps.

323
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,750
She says he had cochlear

324
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,750
implant surgery a month ago.

325
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,750
It's due to be activated.

326
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,120
Chest is clear, regular

327
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,120
rate rhythm S1 and 2.

328
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,790
Sick!

329
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,690
And let's give him four

330
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,690
milligrams of ondansetron.

331
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,230
Got it.

332
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,590
She says it's meningitis

333
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,590
from the implant.

334
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,860
She warned him

335
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,860
not to get it.

336
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,420
We don't know

337
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,420
that he has meningitis.

338
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,730
His neck exam is normal.

339
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,330
And meningitis can occur after

340
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,330
surgery, but it's not common.

341
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,110
Let's get a CBC, BMP,

342
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,770
and cultures times two.

343
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,770
Right.

344
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,210
And let's send him up

345
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,210
for a head CT.

346
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,680
Okay, I'll put in the order.

347
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,580
Thank you.

348
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,580
Yeah.

349
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,350
April.

350
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,440
Hey, April,

351
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,440
can I get a second?

352
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,190
Emily's really turned

353
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,190
her life around.

354
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,730
She's clean, going to AA.

355
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,690
She's got a job,

356
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,690
sells cosmetics.

357
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,060
Oh. And you're telling

358
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,060
me this why?

359
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,460
I'm bringing Emily

360
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,460
to Connor's party,

361
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,230
and she'd like

362
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,230
to talk to you.

363
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,790
Why?

364
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,790
She feels bad.

365
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,830
She should.

366
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,210
Emily wants to make amends.

367
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,210
It's a part of the program.

368
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,980
Emily has a drug problem

369
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,980
and a gambling problem.

370
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,810
She stole opioids

371
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,810
from the hospital.

372
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,810
I know.

373
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,510
She needs to be in rehab.

374
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,750
I...

375
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,750
She needs psychotherapy...

376
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,620
I know.

377
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,620
But she's really trying.

378
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,450
One step at a time.

379
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,360
Mr. Jackson,

380
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,270
these are student doctors,

381
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,270
Curry and McNeal.

382
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,500
They're going to help me

383
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,500
sew you up.

384
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,940
Okay.

385
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,940
McNeal, glove up.

386
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,880
Curry, why don't you get

387
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,880
him an IV and hang a bag

388
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,880
of normal saline?

389
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,640
That's a nurse's job.

390
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm sorry?

391
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,510
I said,

392
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,510
that's a nurse's job.

393
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,410
Every doctor should know

394
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,410
how to put in an IV.

395
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,110
I do know how,

396
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,110
but I don't see

397
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,110
the point.

398
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,680
That's not something

399
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,680
I'm ever going to be doing.

400
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,810
I'm not going

401
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,810
into patient care.

402
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,690
Is there a problem?

403
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,690
No, sir.

404
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,520
Ms. Curry, when you are

405
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,520
on my service,

406
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,960
you will do exactly

407
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,960
what's expected of you.

408
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,360
Do you understand?

409
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,810
Mr. Jackson is a machinist,

410
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,810
and he cut his forearm

411
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,810
in the shop.

412
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,840
What do you make of the wound?

413
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,840
Pretty clean.

414
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,710
Edges are smooth.

415
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,710
Nylon suture?

416
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,010
You'd better

417
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,010
take another look.

418
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,150
Oh.

419
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,810
That's actually

420
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,810
a pretty deep cut.

421
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,510
So how do you obliterate

422
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,510
the dead space?

423
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,120
Absorbable stitch.

424
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,160
Right, right.

425
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,720
You're a doctor?

426
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,720
Medical student.

427
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,970
You're a big guy.

428
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,330
What's the matter,

429
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,330
couldn't play football?

430
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,900
Let's numb that arm.

431
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,440
You don't

432
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,440
have meningitis.

433
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,450
On the other hand,

434
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,450
we don't know why

435
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,040
you're having

436
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,040
these symptoms.

437
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,620
Your sensitivity to light

438
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,620
concerns us,

439
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,990
so we'd like to do

440
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,990
some more blood work,

441
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,360
including a genetic test,

442
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,360
just to cover our bases.

443
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,360
You'll have to stay

444
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,360
here overnight.

445
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,130
We'll try to find you

446
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,130
a bed upstairs.

447
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,830
Otherwise, we will

448
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,830
make you

449
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,170
as comfortable as

450
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,170
possible down here.

451
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,140
The good news is

452
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,140
we've talked to

453
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,140
your audiologist,

454
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,200
and we can turn on

455
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,200
your cochlear implant.

456
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,940
Yes, I want it.

457
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,940
Thank you.

458
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,050
Yes, I'm doing it.

459
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,590
They're having

460
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,590
an argument.

461
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,590
Yeah.

462
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,220
Maybe we should step out.

463
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,680
Yeah?

464
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,950
Dr. Reese, there you are.

465
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,020
I am very glad to see you.

466
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,360
I'm not staying.

467
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm leaving Med.

468
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm continuing

469
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,400
my residency at Baylor.

470
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,090
Oh.

471
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,690
I think people here would

472
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,690
always look at me and think,

473
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,000
"Oh, there's that doctor,

474
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,000
the one whose father

475
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,000
murdered those girls."

476
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,330
I could live with that.

477
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,070
It's you.

478
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,780
It's me?

479
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,780
All that time

480
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,050
you suspected my father,

481
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,050
you never told me anything.

482
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,950
Sarah, look,

483
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,950
I was trying to protect you

484
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,920
until I was

485
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,920
absolutely certain.

486
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,920
I mean, surely...

487
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,660
I can't trust you.

488
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,660
I can never trust you.

489
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,250
You have every

490
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,250
right to be upset,

491
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,300
and I hope that

492
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,300
we have some time

493
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,300
to talk through this,

494
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,630
but please, don't leave.

495
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,040
Every time

496
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,040
I'd see your face,

497
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,040
I would remember

498
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,640
when I walked into that room

499
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,640
and saw my father

500
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,640
on the floor.

501
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,740
I...

502
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,070
I saw it in your eyes.

503
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,950
You were going

504
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,950
to let him die.

505
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,010
Hi.

506
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,140
Hi, Peter,

507
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,140
this is Helen Moore,

508
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,680
the hospital's audiologist.

509
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,650
So, let me get this on you,

510
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,650
and then I can activate it.

511
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,220
No.

512
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,490
I don't want it.

513
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,490
I... I don't understand.

514
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,830
Bonnie, she thinks

515
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,830
because of this,

516
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,830
I don't love her.

517
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,500
I want Bonnie more

518
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,500
than my hearing.

519
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,810
If you change your mind,

520
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,810
let your doctors know.

521
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,750
Yeah,

522
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,750
I've seen this before.

523
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,380
Implants are controversial

524
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,380
among the deaf.

525
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,150
For Bonnie,

526
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,150
deafness is a culture,

527
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,150
a community.

528
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,230
She thinks we're trying

529
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,230
to fix a problem that

530
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,230
isn't a problem.

531
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,470
Courtney?

532
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,470
45-year-old female.

533
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,100
Found delusional and agitated.

534
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,100
Put her in treatment 4.

535
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,510
No obvious injuries,

536
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,510
no meds given in the field.

537
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,280
All right,

538
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,280
get ready to rotate.

539
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,010
Take them in,

540
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,010
Angel. Dr. Choi?

541
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,680
Can't leave this GSW.

542
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,680
Terry, start the work-up.

543
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,450
See if you can

544
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,450
get a history.

545
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,450
I'll be there soon.

546
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,990
I'm going to call Psych.

547
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,990
Where's Monique?

548
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,750
Monique, get in here.

549
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,030
Let's transfer on my count.

550
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,030
It's his fault.

551
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,090
It's his fault!

552
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,960
One, two, three.

553
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,500
Ma'am, can you tell us

554
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,500
your name?

555
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Do you know where you are?

556
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,310
Over there. Look.

557
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,310
It's his fault.

558
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,040
We need to sedate her.

559
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,040
It's his fault.

560
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,770
It's his fault.

561
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,770
You should wait for Dr. Choi.

562
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,040
He told me to work her up.

563
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,040
I can't with her like this.

564
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,810
10 of haloperidol.

565
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,810
Stop it before it's too late.

566
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,110
Stop him. Stop.

567
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,110
Stop him

568
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,110
before it's too late.

569
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,250
Stop him before it's too late.

570
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,850
Stop him... Stop him

571
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,850
before it's too late.

572
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,260
Stop him

573
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,260
before it's too late.

574
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,760
Let's let her calm down

575
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,260
before we take off

576
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,260
the restraints.

577
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,960
I thought this patient

578
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,960
was agitated.

579
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,200
She was.

580
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,200
I sedated her.

581
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,670
You sedated her?

582
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,670
Without waiting for me?

583
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,140
Well, I couldn't examine her.

584
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,140
Well now, neither can I.

585
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,510
You're a medical student.

586
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,880
You're not authorized

587
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,880
to order medication.

588
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,750
But she was delusional,

589
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,750
psychotic.

590
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,650
And you are not qualified

591
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,650
to make that diagnosis,

592
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,020
or any diagnosis.

593
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,580
The patient's emotional state

594
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,580
could have been

595
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,180
something entirely physical,

596
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,180
and therefore

597
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,780
easily treatable,

598
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,780
like a UTI, for instance.

599
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,060
But now, we can't

600
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,060
determine that

601
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,060
because you knocked her out.

602
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,420
You ought to be

603
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,420
written up for this.

604
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,190
Dr. Charles, it was my fault.

605
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,190
Be quiet. Where's Dr. Choi?

606
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm right here.

607
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,200
Supervise your

608
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,200
medical students!

609
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,440
I wasn't told the board

610
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,440
was in session.

611
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,550
Dr. Rhodes,

612
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,550
impressive proposal.

613
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,380
Unfortunately,

614
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,380
we have to pass.

615
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,780
And why is that?

616
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,560
A C-Arm. That's anywhere

617
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,560
from 1.7 million to 2.5.

618
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,300
Booms and lights, 200,000.

619
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,160
Two large ceiling-mounted

620
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,160
hi-def screens.

621
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,760
Do I need to continue?

622
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,760
No hospital I know of

623
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,860
has a hybrid OR

624
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,860
in the ED.

625
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,840
Not to mention

626
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,840
the huge PR benefit

627
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,030
in Med being the first...

628
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,740
The investment is not

629
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,740
worth the expense.

630
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,740
I recommended that

631
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,740
the board pass.

632
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,300
They agreed.

633
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,620
Well...

634
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,250
Thank you for trying.

635
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,490
I think it would be a mistake

636
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,490
for the hospital to lose this.

637
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,310
In Yiddish,

638
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,310
"bon voyage"

639
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,310
is for gezunterhait.

640
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,040
In Hebrew, however,

641
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,040
we say leich l'shalom,

642
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,580
which literally means

643
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,580
"go towards peace,"

644
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,750
but it has a deeper meaning

645
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,150
of going towards greater

646
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,150
spiritual perfection.

647
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,830
I'd like to wish

648
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,830
you that, Dr. Rhodes.

649
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,400
Leich l'shalom.

650
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,540
April.

651
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,540
Emily.

652
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,740
I want to apologize

653
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,740
for everything

654
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,740
that happened.

655
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,650
It was all my fault.

656
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,010
I'm trying to make up

657
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,010
for what I did.

658
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,050
I'm trying to turn my

659
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,050
life around, and...

660
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,280
A lot of that

661
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,280
is because of you.

662
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,750
You believed in me, and...

663
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,090
I'm... I'm really sorry

664
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,090
I disappointed you.

665
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,400
Be right back.

666
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,330
Can I get you a drink?

667
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,900
There you go.

668
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,900
Thank you.

669
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,450
Did you get a chance to

670
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,450
check out that venue?

671
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,050
No.

672
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,060
I'm sorry, I left it

673
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,060
at the hospital.

674
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,620
Yeah, well, I brought it.

675
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,890
Oh.

676
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,390
Natalie, look,

677
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,390
if you don't want

678
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,370
to get married, just say so.

679
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,370
What?

680
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,030
Where is this

681
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,030
coming from?

682
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,360
You don't seem to care

683
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,360
about the ceremony,

684
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,670
or the reception.

685
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,670
It took you a week

686
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,670
to say yes.

687
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,710
And I said yes,

688
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,710
and I meant it.

689
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,970
But you act like

690
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,970
our marriage is no big deal.

691
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,810
Of course it's a big deal.

692
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,910
But a church wedding,

693
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,910
a reception.

694
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,810
I've done

695
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,810
all that before.

696
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,190
I haven't been

697
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,190
married before.

698
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,920
I want the whole thing.

699
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,920
Just so you know,

700
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,230
a wedding

701
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,230
is not a marriage.

702
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,490
Glad you cleared

703
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,490
that up for me.

704
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,050
Will.

705
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,050
No, I'm just

706
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,160
overwhelmed with

707
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,160
your enthusiasm.

708
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,030
I'm going

709
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,030
to get some food.

710
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,240
Hey, Maggie.

711
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,240
Have you seen Ava?

712
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,710
Ms. Goodwin.

713
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,750
Hey, have you

714
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,750
seen Dr. Bekker?

715
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,010
She said

716
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,010
she was coming tonight.

717
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,980
No, I haven't.

718
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,150
Maybe she got

719
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,150
stuck in surgery.

720
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,590
Maybe.

721
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,630
So let's get

722
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,630
four of the flutes

723
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,630
over here, one more.

724
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,970
And then, we'll have

725
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,970
a nice arrangement

726
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,970
right here.

727
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,560
Great.

728
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,560
Mr. Rhodes?

729
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,710
Dr. Bekker.

730
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,710
Have you got a minute?

731
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,870
Of course, this way.

732
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,870
I'll be right back.

733
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,840
Creating a hybrid OR

734
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,840
in the ED

735
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,840
would be expensive,

736
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,280
and the hospital

737
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,280
is not willing

738
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,280
to make the commitment.

739
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,190
However, if private

740
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,190
donors such as yourself

741
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,420
would earmark

742
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,420
contributions

743
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,420
for the project,

744
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,090
the board

745
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,090
would be incentivized

746
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,090
to make the investment.

747
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,260
Right.

748
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,130
I wouldn't expect you

749
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,130
personally to fund

750
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,130
the entire project.

751
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,200
I would think

752
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,200
with your connections,

753
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,440
you could raise it

754
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,440
with just a few

755
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,440
phone calls.

756
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,770
Well...

757
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,680
And you'd be running

758
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,680
this project?

759
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,480
No, Dr. Rhodes...

760
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,480
Connor will be.

761
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,110
I thought he was off

762
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,110
to the Mayo Clinic.

763
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,020
I believe he'll stay

764
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,020
in Chicago if

765
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,020
the program gets funded.

766
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,790
Well, as I'm sure

767
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,790
you're aware,

768
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,490
my son and I have not had

769
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,490
the easiest of relationships.

770
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,930
I'd want my involvement

771
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,930
kept anonymous.

772
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,930
Of course,

773
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,930
I understand.

774
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,460
Let me think about it.

775
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm afraid

776
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,000
this is time-sensitive.

777
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,960
Oh.

778
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,500
You know what?

779
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,500
I have an idea.

780
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,380
Why don't we go to dinner,

781
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,380
discuss this further?

782
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,390
Hey, Peter Rush's

783
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,390
test results.

784
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,930
Oh, man.

785
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,930
Yeah.

786
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,140
What is it?

787
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,780
Peter, your deafness

788
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,780
wasn't caused by mumps.

789
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,080
It was caused

790
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,080
by a genetic disease

791
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,140
that you tested

792
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,140
positive for,

793
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,140
Usher syndrome.

794
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,520
And it's what caused

795
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,520
the symptoms

796
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,520
you are now experiencing.

797
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,050
What does that mean?

798
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,620
So some of your symptoms

799
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,620
can be addressed,

800
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,620
but Usher syndrome

801
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,620
causes a condition

802
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,890
called retinitis pigmentosa.

803
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,140
A progressive deterioration

804
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,140
of eyesight.

805
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,600
My eyesight?

806
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,600
I'm sorry, Peter,

807
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,140
but retinitis pigmentosa

808
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,140
is untreatable.

809
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,930
No cure.

810
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,910
I'm going blind?

811
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,920
Yes, you will experience

812
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,920
a significant loss in vision,

813
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,550
and maybe even blindness.

814
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,250
Oh, God.

815
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,060
We know this is a lot

816
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,060
to process.

817
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,590
A genetic disease specialist

818
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,590
will come down to discuss

819
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,460
what you can expect, and what

820
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,460
measures can be taken to help.

821
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,580
Maybe you want

822
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,580
Bonnie to come here

823
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,580
for that?

824
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,800
No, she can't find out.

825
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,280
But you're getting married.

826
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,280
She will find out.

827
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,110
She broke it off.

828
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,890
Now, it's all for the best.

829
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,590
I don't want her

830
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,590
coming back out of pity.

831
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,860
You don't...

832
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,860
She should be with someone

833
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,560
who won't be

834
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,560
a burden to her.

835
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,310
Yeah?

836
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,080
Hey, Dr. Charles?

837
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,080
Sarah called.

838
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,720
Asked me to send her stuff.

839
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,410
She thought maybe

840
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,410
she left her case log here.

841
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,120
Oh, yeah.

842
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,920
Right here.

843
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,290
Okay. You know,

844
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,290
I really liked Sarah.

845
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,170
I always hoped, you know,

846
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,170
something might happen, or...

847
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,140
But I guess with all that

848
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,140
she was going through,

849
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,370
never really had

850
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,370
a real chance.

851
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,370
Yeah.

852
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,300
I'm sorry

853
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,300
about that, Noah.

854
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,070
Yeah.

855
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,110
You know,

856
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,110
she once told me that

857
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,850
the way you brought her

858
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,850
into psych helped her.

859
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,920
That you were the dad

860
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,920
she always wanted.

861
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,390
Dr. Choi?

862
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,330
Emily, what's wrong?

863
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,130
I've just been dizzy,

864
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,130
real tired.

865
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,300
Getting these headaches.

866
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,360
She's also complaining

867
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,360
of diarrhea.

868
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,910
Vitals are mostly normal,

869
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,910
a little soft

870
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,910
on the pressure.

871
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,070
BP 95/58,

872
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,070
heart rate 110.

873
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,880
The patient is my sister,

874
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,980
so I'll leave you

875
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,980
and April to do the exam.

876
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,590
I'll be back

877
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,590
to look in on you.

878
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,590
Okay.

879
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,260
Ms. Curry?

880
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,260
What... Right.

881
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,720
I'm Elsa Curry,

882
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,720
third year

883
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,720
medical student.

884
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,170
I'm going

885
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,170
to examine you.

886
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,240
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

887
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,780
I'm sorry...

888
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,980
Peter's not up... For...

889
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,390
Okay.

890
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,040
Why are you here?

891
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,940
Who told you?

892
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,770
Did you?

893
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,770
No, no.

894
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,710
Did you?

895
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,710
No.

896
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,820
She wants to know

897
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,820
why Peter's acting like this.

898
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,890
It's up to Peter

899
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,890
to tell her.

900
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,870
You can tell her.

901
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,710
Peter has a condition

902
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,710
called Usher syndrome,

903
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,010
which caused him

904
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,010
to lose his hearing

905
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,140
and will also cause him

906
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,140
to lose his sight.

907
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,510
All right, now,

908
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,510
let's move on to the budget.

909
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,880
The first line item

910
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,880
to discuss

911
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,880
is marketing and PR.

912
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,580
Actually, let's table

913
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,580
that discussion.

914
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,790
Dr. Bekker, Dr. Rhodes,

915
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,790
thank you for joining us.

916
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,480
I have good news.

917
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,290
The hospital received

918
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,290
donations earmarked

919
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,730
for your ED hybrid OR,

920
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,990
and the Board has decided

921
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,990
to provide matching funds.

922
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,430
We're going ahead

923
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,430
with your proposal.

924
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,870
Well, I am very happy

925
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,870
to hear that.

926
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,930
But there is one

927
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,930
stipulation, Dr. Rhodes.

928
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,050
You have to stay

929
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,050
and run the program.

930
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,780
Emily's test results.

931
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,290
No.

932
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,730
You're not sick.

933
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,730
You're pregnant.

934
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,300
Really?

935
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,490
You didn't suspect

936
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,490
that might be the case?

937
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,010
I mean, I have been

938
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,010
throwing up a lot.

939
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,010
Do you even know

940
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,010
who the father is?

941
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,870
Yeah, of course

942
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,870
I know who the father is.

943
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,310
What do you think I am?

944
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,310
It's Bernie.

945
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,210
Who's Bernie?

946
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,210
He's in my AA group.

947
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,450
Your AA group?

948
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,290
You're not supposed to date

949
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,290
people in your AA group.

950
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,260
Look, he's been sober

951
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,260
for six years.

952
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,160
He's a responsible person.

953
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,160
Responsible?

954
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,520
You call this responsible?

955
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,260
I don't believe you.

956
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,040
Oh, God, I didn't

957
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,040
mean it to happen.

958
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,440
What am I going to do now?

959
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,210
You were right.

960
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,210
Everything you said

961
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,210
was right.

962
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,720
I'm an idiot, a total idiot.

963
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,720
Ethan, don't.

964
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,380
You were just

965
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,380
trying to help her.

966
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,720
You were trying to be

967
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,720
a good big brother.

968
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,950
And look at the mess

969
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,950
she's made.

970
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,220
I know.

971
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,060
Emily can't have this baby.

972
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,060
What?

973
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,190
Come on.

974
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,130
She has a history

975
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,130
of drug abuse.

976
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,830
She's sleeping

977
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,830
with some guy

978
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,830
in her AA group.

979
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,300
If you're going

980
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,300
where I think you're going...

981
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,430
April, two months ago,

982
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,430
Emily was homeless.

983
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,030
Who knows when

984
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,030
she'll run away again?

985
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,510
She's completely unstable,

986
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,510
and she might

987
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,510
start using again.

988
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,210
Harm the fetus.

989
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,210
And she might not.

990
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,410
What kind of life

991
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,410
can she give a child?

992
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,880
It doesn't matter.

993
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,880
Of course it matters.

994
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,180
No. You're not

995
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,180
a Catholic.

996
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,350
It's a life.

997
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,350
We have to protect it.

998
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,560
Mr. McNeal?

999
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,500
I want to apologize

1000
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,500
for earlier.

1001
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,930
You really need

1002
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,930
to learn how

1003
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,930
to follow protocol, okay?

1004
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,710
But I shouldn't have

1005
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,710
snapped at you like that.

1006
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,640
I'm dealing with a...

1007
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,640
With a loss.

1008
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,650
Thank you.

1009
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,990
Coming in.

1010
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,720
And your paperwork

1011
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,720
is done.

1012
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,820
I got to go tell Bernie.

1013
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,920
I don't know

1014
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,920
how he'll take it.

1015
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,030
I hope he's happy, but,

1016
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,030
God, what if he's not?

1017
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,540
I can't cope

1018
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,540
with this by myself.

1019
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,400
I... I can't have

1020
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,400
this baby alone.

1021
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,200
Emily, you're not alone.

1022
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,040
Oh, yeah,

1023
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,040
but Ethan's so mad at me.

1024
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,810
He'll come around.

1025
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,640
And I'm here for you.

1026
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,640
You are?

1027
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,550
We'll figure this out.

1028
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,950
Okay?

1029
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,950
Okay.

1030
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,500
Now, I'm going to be

1031
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,500
sending a series of beeps.

1032
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,090
First, very soft,

1033
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,090
inaudible.

1034
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,430
When you can hear

1035
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,430
the beeps, let me know.

1036
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,840
Wait, yes.

1037
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,780
I can hear it, yes.

1038
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,780
Good.

1039
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,310
Tell me, Peter,

1040
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,310
can you hear my voice?

1041
00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:00,020
Oh, God.

1042
00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:00,020
Yes, I can.

1043
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,960
I can hear again.

1044
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,830
She said that

1045
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,830
she'll be his eyes,

1046
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,370
and he'll be her ears.

1047
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,680
Ms. Garrett, I know

1048
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,680
we've had our differences,

1049
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,950
but I'm very happy

1050
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,950
you approved

1051
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,950
the hybrid OR down here.

1052
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,160
Are you, Dr. Stohl?

1053
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,490
Sharon, if you would.

1054
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,570
You go behind

1055
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,570
my back and get

1056
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,570
these token contributions

1057
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,510
for about a quarter

1058
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,510
of the cost.

1059
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,450
The hospital is out millions

1060
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,450
for your pet project.

1061
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,040
The Board could

1062
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,040
have refused the money.

1063
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,810
No, it couldn't,

1064
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,810
and you know that.

1065
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,380
These are some

1066
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,380
of our biggest donors.

1067
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,580
They want a hybrid OR,

1068
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,580
they get a hybrid OR.

1069
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,250
You locked us in.

1070
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,460
Are you going to fight me

1071
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,460
on every one of my decisions?

1072
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,720
Depends on the decision.

1073
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,170
Well, I'm glad I know

1074
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,170
where we stand.

1075
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,870
Our Chief

1076
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,870
of Emergency Medicine,

1077
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,870
Dr. Stohl.

1078
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,270
Very much your man.

1079
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,780
I think Dr. Stohl

1080
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,780
is very much his own man.

1081
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,320
I have not been happy

1082
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,320
with his performance of late.

1083
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,790
We're not going

1084
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,790
to renew his contract.

1085
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,820
Really, you'd take

1086
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,820
this out on him?

1087
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,220
Stay out of my way.

1088
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,100
They don't start serving

1089
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,100
for another hour.

1090
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,670
Sit.

1091
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,040
Hanger steak,

1092
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,040
planked whitefish,

1093
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,520
and for vegetarians,

1094
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,520
lentil and chickpea stew.

1095
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,920
Thank you.

1096
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,760
What's all this?

1097
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,690
Dishes to try

1098
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,690
for our reception.

1099
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,100
You take care of the venue,

1100
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,100
I'll take care of the caterer.

1101
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,730
You know, eyes and ears.

1102
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,500
Here, try.

1103
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,830
Mmm.

1104
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,470
That's really good.

1105
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,470
Yeah?

1106
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,120
Here you go, Dr. Rhodes.

1107
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,120
Thanks, man.

1108
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,750
Ava, hey.

1109
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,050
So I was... I was looking into

1110
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,050
what you were talking about,

1111
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,060
Rochester, and you are right.

1112
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,060
It is very cold.

1113
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,900
Yeah?

1114
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,900
Yeah, so anyway,

1115
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,490
I told the Board that I was

1116
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,490
going to stay here at Med.

1117
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,400
Really?

1118
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,570
Yeah, I mean,

1119
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,570
if the program is a success,

1120
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,840
then it could be

1121
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,840
a very big deal.

1122
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,510
It's a better career move

1123
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,510
than Mayo.

1124
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,120
Exactly.

1125
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,120
Okay.

1126
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,120
Well, I guess I don't

1127
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,120
need to remind you.

1128
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,890
You're no longer

1129
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,890
on the CT service.

1130
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,030
Yet, you did.

1131
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,190
From now on, when you

1132
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,190
bring a patient upstairs,

1133
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,560
I decide the course

1134
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,560
of treatment.

1135
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,860
Now, you see,

1136
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,860
if I'd gone to Mayo,

1137
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,990
that's exactly the kind of

1138
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,990
collegial interaction

1139
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,560
I would have missed.

1140
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,930
Dr. Charles.

1141
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,730
Here to gloat?

1142
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,730
No.

1143
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,810
Just dropped by to

1144
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,280
let you know

1145
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,280
Sarah's leaving Chicago.

1146
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,050
You'll probably

1147
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,050
never see her again.

1148
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,610
Is that supposed to wound me?

1149
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,880
My daughter?

1150
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,930
She put me here.

1151
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,930
Huh.

1152
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,090
I thought you put

1153
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,090
yourself here.

1154
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,800
It's all circumstantial.

1155
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,800
You know that.

1156
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,560
Where are the bodies?

1157
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,970
If I could get

1158
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,970
a halfway decent lawyer,

1159
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,270
instead of that idiot P.D.

1160
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,270
in his cheap suit.

1161
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,690
You know, when I was

1162
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,690
having my heart attack,

1163
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,780
you weren't

1164
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,780
going to save me,

1165
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,780
were you?

1166
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,990
You were going

1167
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,990
to let me die.

1168
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,740
All right, do it now.

1169
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,740
Kill me.

1170
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,490
You've had your fun.

1171
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,490
Enough.

1172
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,850
No one would want to go on

1173
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,850
living like this, anyway.

1174
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:35,060
I'm sorry you're having

1175
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:35,060
such a hard time.

1176
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,590
I'll talk to your doctor

1177
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,830
and see if he'll boost

1178
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,830
your anti-depressants.

1179
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,230
And I'm the one

1180
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,230
without a conscience?

1181
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,700
No, don't worry about it.

1182
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,700
It's gonna get better.

1183
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,140
It always does.

1184
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,440
Really.

1185
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,010
In my experience, psychopaths

1186
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,010
adjust extraordinarily well

1187
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,920
to almost any situation.

1188
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,590
Even, you know, this one.
