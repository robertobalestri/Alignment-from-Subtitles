1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,200
So, Mom, how were you

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,200
able to save the day?

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,430
Actually,

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,430
I didn't, you did.

5
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,430
Mmm.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,940
You took one look at the map,

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,940
and you could see connections

8
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,940
we couldn't.

9
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,170
I knew right then

10
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,170
you were gonna be

11
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,170
a scientist, I swear.

12
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,340
Did you...

13
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,340
Oh, I did.

14
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,440
Oh. Speaking of science,

15
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,440
this is the office calling.

16
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,080
Sorry, hold on two secs.

17
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,950
Hello?

18
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,090
You did good there.

19
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,090
We did good.

20
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,490
Danny, I have something

21
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,490
to tell you.

22
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,000
My lymphoma is back

23
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,000
and my old chemo regime

24
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,000
isn't working.

25
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,490
Okay.

26
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,330
I already got third

27
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,330
and fourth opinions

28
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,000
and the only thing left

29
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,000
is clinical trials.

30
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,770
Gaffney has a promising

31
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,770
new drug study I might

32
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,770
qualify for,

33
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,180
and they're screening

34
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,180
me for it today.

35
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,340
Does Robin know?

36
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,340
Mmm-hmm.

37
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,740
Well, why'd you wait

38
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,740
so long to tell me?

39
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,340
I was married

40
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,340
to you, remember?

41
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,480
I know that your

42
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,480
first instinct is to

43
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,480
think the worst,

44
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,580
and I'm not going there.

45
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,890
Okay, I just want you

46
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,890
to remember I work here.

47
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,890
All right?

48
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,730
Anything you need, anything...

49
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,960
I know.

50
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,960
Do you hear me?

51
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,470
I hear you. Thank you.

52
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,570
Apartment app again?

53
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,410
No go on that place

54
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,410
in River North?

55
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,080
Well, it turns out by "one

56
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,080
bedroom," they meant closet.

57
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,610
Pretty fussy for a guy

58
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,740
who's been on his brother's

59
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,740
couch for a few weeks.

60
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,080
I'm just saying.

61
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,520
Your patient came in

62
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,520
with shortness of breath,

63
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,030
pleural effusions

64
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,030
on the right side.

65
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,580
EKG unchanged from his

66
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,580
previous trip to the ED.

67
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,190
The cardiac labs

68
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,190
are mildly elevated.

69
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,390
Diuretics aren't doing enough.

70
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,450
No.

71
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,130
I got it from here, thanks.

72
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,530
Hey, Francis. Kathleen.

73
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm worried, Dr. Rhodes.

74
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,440
I heard that.

75
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,940
Bump in the road,

76
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,940
Kathleen, that's all.

77
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,940
So, I am going to

78
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,940
admit you, Francis.

79
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,780
We're gonna do an echo, we'll

80
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,780
tap the fluid off your lungs,

81
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,840
so you can breathe easier.

82
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,820
And then we're gonna try

83
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,820
a new combination of meds

84
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,440
to help your heart

85
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,440
until a new one's available.

86
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,780
We've been on the waiting list

87
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,780
for over a year.

88
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,650
Any update on when

89
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,650
a transplant might happen?

90
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,920
I'm sorry, but no.

91
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,360
Is there someone we can call?

92
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,360
Let them know our situation?

93
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,030
I'm not checking

94
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,030
out yet, Kathleen.

95
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,860
I've still got

96
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,860
big plans for us.

97
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Techs are gonna be by soon,

98
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,200
they'll take you upstairs.

99
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,640
Hang in there, Kathleen.

100
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,640
Thank you.

101
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,440
It's the middle of the winter

102
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,440
and there's a street fair.

103
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,510
South Side gets a bad rap.

104
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,170
Oh, look at that.

105
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,740
What do you think?

106
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,810
Well, I like that

107
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,810
it's strapless.

108
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,880
Yeah?

109
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,940
But it's a summer dress,

110
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,320
it's just gonna sit in

111
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,320
your closet, you know?

112
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,520
You're right.

113
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,590
I'll be back in the Spring.

114
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,590
Okay.

115
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,120
Thank you.

116
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,350
What's up?

117
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,190
It's Philip. Another long

118
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,190
night with baby Sophie.

119
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,960
Whoa.

120
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,400
You gave him your number?

121
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,800
He's living out

122
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,800
of a PICU recliner.

123
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,340
I wanted him to know

124
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,340
he's not alone.

125
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,440
You're his daughter's doctor.

126
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,440
You're crossing boundaries.

127
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,540
You know what?

128
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,740
I don't think you're qualified

129
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,740
to lecture about boundaries

130
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,510
after you gave your kidney

131
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,510
to someone who you

132
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,510
barely know.

133
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,350
Okay?

134
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,350
Oh, you're throwing

135
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,350
that back at me?

136
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,050
You're the one who

137
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,050
started pointing fingers.

138
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,990
What's happening?

139
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,490
Natalie, watch out!

140
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,980
It's gonna be okay.

141
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,980
Hang in there.

142
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,410
Oh, my God.

143
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,710
Get a half-inch line

144
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,710
on the crashed vehicle

145
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,310
in case it goes up, and have

146
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,310
PD set up a perimeter.

147
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,110
Boden.

148
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,110
Hey.

149
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,050
We've got red tags

150
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,050
all over the place

151
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,780
and more trampled victims

152
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,780
than we can count.

153
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,490
We triggered a plan three,

154
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,250
response teams are en route,

155
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,250
ten ambos.

156
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,390
You okay?

157
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,390
Coping.

158
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,260
Maggie, I need help.

159
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,260
Coming.

160
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,590
Open tib-fib fracture.

161
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,360
No pulse in the foot,

162
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,360
I need to reduce it.

163
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,260
All right. Sir,

164
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,260
look at me, look at me.

165
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,460
This is gonna hurt.

166
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,160
One, two...

167
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,700
Got it.

168
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,070
You got a pulse?

169
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,070
Yeah.

170
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,300
Okay, okay.

171
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,300
They're gonna

172
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,300
take care of you.

173
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,710
There are more ambos

174
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,710
on the way,

175
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,780
but it's not gonna be enough.

176
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,610
As long as we get

177
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,610
the red tags to the ED,

178
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,120
we should be able to manage

179
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,120
the yellow tags

180
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,210
until reinforcement gets here.

181
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,990
Natalie, not outside,

182
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,990
it's too cold.

183
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,490
What about that?

184
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,550
Get the victims ready to move.

185
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,020
Who's the manager?

186
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,020
That's me.

187
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,700
I'm a doctor, we need

188
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,700
your place to treat

189
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,700
the injured.

190
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,740
Yeah, I... Okay, okay.

191
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,640
Everybody, we need

192
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,640
to make some space.

193
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,570
Here, help me.

194
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,070
Come with me.

195
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,970
Move back, move back.

196
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,210
This way.

197
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,480
Monique. Trauma bays

198
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,480
turned over?

199
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,450
Yeah, one, two,

200
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,450
and Baghdad are ready to roll.

201
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,460
Okay, perfect. Go help Leah

202
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,460
triage the waiting room.

203
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,120
ED's staying open

204
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,120
for walk-ins.

205
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,560
What do we got?

206
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,860
Thirty-three year old female,

207
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,860
got pinned beneath the car.

208
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,400
Treatment Four.

209
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,400
Got it.

210
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,900
Twenty-eight year old male,

211
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,900
dragged by the vehicle.

212
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,130
Treatment Five.

213
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,760
Baghdad's all yours.

214
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,760
Yep.

215
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,930
Jada Harris, 18 years old,

216
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,930
GCS 3. Couldn't get an airway.

217
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,110
Witnesses said she took

218
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,110
a direct hit from the truck

219
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,110
and was thrown.

220
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,550
That's her mom,

221
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,550
Jalissa Harris,

222
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,280
got clipped by the truck's

223
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,280
side view mirror.

224
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
Ms. Harris, let me take you

225
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
to a treatment room.

226
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,650
I'm fine.

227
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,090
My daughter, Jada, she wasn't

228
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,090
breathing in the ambulance.

229
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,720
Our trauma team

230
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,720
is treating her.

231
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,720
Let me look at you and then...

232
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,260
No, I need to see her now.

233
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,760
Ms. Harris, Sharon Goodwin,

234
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,760
come with me.

235
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,660
I'll take you to see

236
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,660
your daughter.

237
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,130
Jada just got accepted

238
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,130
to Northwestern.

239
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,900
We were at the fair

240
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,900
celebrating and then this...

241
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,130
Come.

242
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,700
I'm in. There we go.

243
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,670
Hang two units of O-neg.

244
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,670
Yup.

245
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,980
Trigger the MTP.

246
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,980
Let's get a chest

247
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,980
and pelvis x-ray.

248
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,140
Hank, get the ultrasound

249
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,140
ready. What are vitals?

250
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,650
BP 75/40, heart rate 133.

251
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,480
All right, everybody clear.

252
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,890
Left side's whited out.

253
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,890
Give me a chest tube.

254
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,460
Scalpel.

255
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,460
Here's a ten.

256
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,270
Oh, my God, my baby.

257
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,980
Aw, man. Okay, okay.

258
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,770
Ultrasound.

259
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,770
Ultrasound's ready.

260
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,250
Her belly's full of blood.

261
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,250
I can't fix this here.

262
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,250
Let's page my team,

263
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,250
get her over to the Hybrid OR.

264
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,350
Let's go.

265
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,660
I love you, Jada.

266
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,660
Ms. Harris.

267
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,730
Let them take her to surgery.

268
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,730
I love you.

269
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,160
No.

270
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,440
They're gonna take

271
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,440
good care of her.

272
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,470
Kenneth Baker, 53, GCS 8.

273
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,310
BP's 144/86, pulse 88.

274
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,050
Superficial head laceration.

275
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,980
Hit by the car

276
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,980
or trample victim?

277
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,390
He's the driver,

278
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,390
plowed through half the fair

279
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,690
and wrapped his truck

280
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,690
around a pole.

281
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,090
Unconscious

282
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,090
the whole ride over?

283
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,760
Yeah, it might not have

284
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,760
been from the crash.

285
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,760
Pharmacy in his backpack.

286
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,600
On my count.

287
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,600
One, two, three...

288
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,610
Accident scene's a war zone,

289
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,610
gonna make a few round trips.

290
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,800
Thanks, Brett.

291
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,440
Breath sounds are good.

292
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,440
Monique, dig in his backpack.

293
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,080
See what he's on.

294
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,080
On it.

295
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,020
Pupils are equal

296
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,020
and reactive.

297
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,990
I want trauma labs,

298
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,990
a tox screen,

299
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,990
chest and pelvis x-rays,

300
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,550
and send him over to CT

301
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,550
for a pan scan.

302
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,290
A lot of pain meds,

303
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,290
oxycodone, naproxen...

304
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,200
Phenytoin, that's

305
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,200
an anti-epileptic.

306
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,400
If he had a seizure

307
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,400
while driving, he wouldn't

308
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,400
even know what happened.

309
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,400
Here you go.

310
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,400
Thank you.

311
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,410
Hey, down to our last ambo

312
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,410
for a bit. It's our call

313
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,410
who needs to go now.

314
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,440
Well, this is Grace.

315
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,020
She helped a woman

316
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,020
who had fallen,

317
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,020
but got trampled herself.

318
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,620
Clear head trauma.

319
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,620
Did you get knocked out?

320
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,790
I don't think so,

321
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,790
but everything

322
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,790
is a little blurry.

323
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,790
We got one more spot

324
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,790
in the ambulance,

325
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,790
it's yours.

326
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,960
We need to get you

327
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,960
to the ED for a head CT.

328
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,730
But I don't have insurance,

329
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,730
I can't afford it.

330
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,290
I understand, but since you

331
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,290
don't know if you blacked out,

332
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,390
it's best to be overcautious.

333
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,600
I think

334
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,600
I feel better already.

335
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,040
I swear,

336
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm not just saying it.

337
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,440
Okay, hold on to this.

338
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,670
A trip to the ED

339
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,670
is gonna cost a fortune.

340
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,750
Look, her GCS is 15,

341
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,750
her pupils are clear,

342
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,640
and she has a good

343
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,640
recollection of the incident.

344
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,280
Let's hold her off

345
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,280
for the next set of ambos,

346
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,280
if she even needs one.

347
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,480
Keep an eye on her

348
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,820
and I'll take a second look

349
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,820
at our yellow tags.

350
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,220
Give the spot to one of them.

351
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,220
Okay.

352
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,930
A lot of whispers

353
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,930
the driver was high.

354
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,430
He wasn't.

355
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,130
Metastatic cancer.

356
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,900
Terminal.

357
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,900
What all those

358
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,900
meds were for.

359
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,000
Just extubated, but no one's

360
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,000
told him what happened,

361
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,020
that people have died.

362
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,020
Or that he's responsible.

363
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,550
Getting news like this

364
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,550
can really break someone.

365
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,750
Let me take the lead?

366
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,860
How did it go?

367
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,160
I had to remove her left

368
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,160
kidney, spleen, and a portion

369
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,160
of her small intestine.

370
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,330
She needed 15 units of blood,

371
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,330
another 15 of plasma.

372
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,070
What about head trauma?

373
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,500
She was too unstable

374
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,500
for CT before surgery.

375
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,140
She's going up for one now.

376
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,810
You're concerned.

377
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,810
Yeah.

378
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,150
I'm gonna change

379
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,150
and fill in the mom.

380
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,750
Well, I'd like to be

381
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,750
there when you do.

382
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,580
Jada's all she's got,

383
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,520
she shouldn't have to go

384
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,520
through this alone.

385
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,990
How many people died?

386
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,990
Seven.

387
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,990
But many more are injured.

388
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,040
So, they may die also?

389
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,430
There are likely to be

390
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,430
more fatalities.

391
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,110
I'm very sorry.

392
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,110
Don't be.

393
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,770
They had it coming. They're

394
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,770
trying to deny our heritage...

395
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,750
All this mixing,

396
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,750
they wanna eliminate us.

397
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,390
"Us"?

398
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,590
The white race.

399
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,760
But before cancer takes me,

400
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,760
I'm taking some of them.

401
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,800
Was hoping for 20,

402
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,800
but the day's not over yet.

403
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,410
Okay, everybody

404
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,410
clear the scene.

405
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,410
Get back now.

406
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,780
What the hell is going on?

407
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,150
The truck is loaded

408
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,150
with explosives.

409
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,660
We are pulling out

410
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,660
and locking down.

411
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,420
But you can't.

412
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,420
We have victims that need

413
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,420
to go to the hospital.

414
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,460
They have to wait.

415
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,460
Nobody in or out until

416
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,460
the bomb squad says it's okay.

417
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,690
How long is that gonna take?

418
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,060
I don't know, but you

419
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,060
have to get inside

420
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,530
and stay away

421
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,530
from the windows.

422
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,570
Go, right now. Go.

423
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
Two kits?

424
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
That's all you could get?

425
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,510
Ambos got pushed

426
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,510
off the scene.

427
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,440
I go to them,

428
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,440
I don't get back in.

429
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,110
All right.

430
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,110
Golden hour's almost up.

431
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,310
Our yellow tags

432
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,310
are at risk of becoming reds.

433
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,190
Divide and conquer?

434
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,780
Yeah.

435
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,780
Okay.

436
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,060
Did you get the results

437
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,060
of Jada's head CT?

438
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,670
Diffuse blood throughout

439
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,670
the brain, catastrophic.

440
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,910
She's brain-dead.

441
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,110
Oh...

442
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,940
Have you told her mother yet?

443
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,080
Not yet, but I think

444
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,080
she already feels it.

445
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,750
Let's tell her together.

446
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,070
You're being moved

447
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,070
to the jail ward.

448
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,110
I want the head nurse.

449
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,110
I am the head nurse.

450
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,180
One of those bossy blacks,

451
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,180
aren't you?

452
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,400
That's right.

453
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,760
Just finished the eval

454
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,760
on a walk-in patient.

455
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,870
I'm ready to present.

456
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,870
Okay, let's go take a look.

457
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,000
I know I said

458
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,000
I'd put on the gown,

459
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,080
but then I realized

460
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,080
just because I feel like crap,

461
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,580
doesn't mean I have

462
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,580
to look like it.

463
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,710
I'm more concerned

464
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,710
with your pain

465
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,710
than your outfit.

466
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,610
Dr. Choi, Sebastian Lopez.

467
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,680
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lopez.

468
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,680
Sebastian.

469
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,290
And I'm sorry for

470
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,290
taking you away

471
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,880
from all the people injured

472
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,880
in the street fair.

473
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,930
I didn't wanna come in, but...

474
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,930
I can't take the pain anymore.

475
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,190
It's like...

476
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,190
It's like I'm getting stabbed.

477
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,460
The pain's confined

478
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,460
to the right flank.

479
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,230
It's been steady

480
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,230
the last two days,

481
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,230
became severe overnight.

482
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,040
This morning he noticed

483
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,040
his urine was cloudy

484
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,040
and malodorous.

485
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, just tell

486
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,000
the whole world.

487
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,770
Fever?

488
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,770
Low grade.

489
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,870
I'm thinking pyelonephritis.

490
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,870
It fits. Labs?

491
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,070
CBC, CMP, UA

492
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,070
and an ultrasound.

493
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,310
Agreed, run them.

494
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,620
I know it's painful,

495
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,620
but if left untreated,

496
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,310
a kidney infection can lead

497
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,310
to permanent damage.

498
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,380
It's good you came in.

499
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,620
I'm glad I did... Now.

500
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,290
Keep me posted, Terry.

501
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,930
Oh, my...

502
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,440
Tall, dark and intense.

503
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,440
Mmm. Gets me every time.

504
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,640
Amari Moore, 35,

505
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,640
severe blunt force trauma.

506
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,980
Pushed his son

507
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,980
out of the way of the truck,

508
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,420
took the hit for him.

509
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,710
He refused a board and collar,

510
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,780
wouldn't let us take him

511
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,780
with the first wave of ambos.

512
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,290
Barely got him out

513
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,290
before they locked

514
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,290
up the scene.

515
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,920
Off-duty cop,

516
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,920
could hardly breathe,

517
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,390
still wanted to stay and help.

518
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,120
My son, Andre...

519
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,120
Where's Andre?

520
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,000
He rode up front,

521
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,000
Stacy's with him.

522
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,660
I think he hurt his arm.

523
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,660
Take care of him first.

524
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,640
I'm staying with you,

525
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,640
but Andre will be safe.

526
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,730
I promise.

527
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,930
On my count.

528
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,930
One, two, three...

529
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,610
Get a second line

530
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,610
and a chest x-ray.

531
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,540
I want my dad.

532
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,540
Andre Moore, eight.

533
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,610
Fell on his arm,

534
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,610
no visible deformities,

535
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,610
doesn't complain of pain.

536
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,670
Where's my dad?

537
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,310
Your dad is with the doctor

538
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,310
right now, honey.

539
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,320
Let me take a look

540
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,320
at your arm.

541
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,320
No!

542
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,410
I need him.

543
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,410
Dad, where are you?

544
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,580
Hey, hey, hey. How you doing?

545
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,580
I'm Dr. Charles,

546
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,580
tell me your name.

547
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,390
Andre.

548
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,390
Andre, really nice

549
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,390
to meet you.

550
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,030
How about I take you

551
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,030
to where we can see

552
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,030
what's going on with your dad?

553
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,120
Okay?

554
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,120
Okay.

555
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,290
Okay. T-Two ready?

556
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,560
Yep.

557
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,560
Okay, come on.

558
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,540
Dad?

559
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,540
Okay, okay, you can

560
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,540
see him right here.

561
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,270
Okay?

562
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,770
What are they doing?

563
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,770
Well, they're helping him.

564
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,550
You see the plastic mask over

565
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,550
his nose? That's to help him

566
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,550
breathe easier.

567
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,990
And that machine can actually

568
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,990
look inside his chest.

569
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,690
It's got x-ray vision

570
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,690
just like Superman.

571
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,230
Now, that woman,

572
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,230
she's a very special

573
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,230
kind of doctor.

574
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,860
If they find

575
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,860
something in his chest,

576
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,860
she's trained to fix it.

577
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,040
What are they doing?

578
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,040
Where are they taking him?

579
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,040
Dad, Dad,

580
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,040
where are you going?

581
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,210
I have to go upstairs

582
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,210
with the doctor.

583
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,810
I wanna go.

584
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,810
No.

585
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,810
I need you to stay here

586
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,810
and be brave.

587
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,720
Come here.

588
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,360
Andre, I know you're scared...

589
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,490
But I believe in you.

590
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,390
Okay, I can do it.

591
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,390
I'll be brave.

592
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,770
Be brave.

593
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,770
We gotta go.

594
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,640
Not heading home

595
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,640
today, am I?

596
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,640
No.

597
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,950
Your echo showed an ejection

598
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,950
fraction rate of 12%.

599
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,120
Your heart is failing

600
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,120
and the meds aren't working.

601
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,590
Ticker's on its last legs.

602
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,260
That's gotta move me up

603
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,260
the transplant list, huh?

604
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,610
Straight to the top,

605
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,610
status 1A.

606
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,010
Well, next in line,

607
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,010
can't beat that.

608
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,480
It's gonna work out, Kathleen,

609
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,480
just like it always has.

610
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,940
'Cause what are we?

611
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,280
Blessed.

612
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,160
I will be back to check

613
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,160
on you guys in just

614
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,160
a little bit, okay?

615
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,170
Ms. Goodwin,

616
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,170
may I have a moment?

617
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,230
Excuse me, Ms. Harris.

618
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,670
I have a patient,

619
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,670
Francis Buckley,

620
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,010
with biventricular

621
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,010
heart failure.

622
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,080
Now, I know that Ms. Harris

623
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,080
has just lost her daughter,

624
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,590
and she hasn't had

625
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,590
any time to grieve...

626
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,320
But Jada's heart

627
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,320
could save his life.

628
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,650
They have

629
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,650
the same blood type,

630
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,620
it's the first step

631
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,620
towards her heart

632
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,620
being an HLA match.

633
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,920
If it is, with it being

634
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,920
right across the hall,

635
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,120
Francis will get it.

636
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,500
I'll ask her if she'll

637
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,500
speak to the Gift of Hope.

638
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,560
Thank you.

639
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,280
The man who did this,

640
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,280
he didn't even know Jada.

641
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,690
Just wanted to hurt her.

642
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,690
All of us.

643
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,120
Yes, I know.

644
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,290
But there's a way

645
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,290
she can live on...

646
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,290
Through organ donation.

647
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,330
You mean cut Jada up

648
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,330
even more? As if she hasn't

649
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,330
already given enough.

650
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,510
Well, nothing about today

651
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,510
is fair, Ms. Harris.

652
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,640
Not just today.

653
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,450
How does it work?

654
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,450
Donation?

655
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,580
Well, transplants

656
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,580
are overseen

657
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,630
and managed

658
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,630
by an organization

659
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,630
called Gift of Hope.

660
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,630
They'll take over

661
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,630
and guide you

662
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,630
through the process.

663
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,500
What will they use from her?

664
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,810
The doctors will make

665
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,810
that assessment.

666
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,410
Just make sure her organs

667
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,410
go to someone like us.

668
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,680
Ms. Harris, I don't

669
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,680
have any control

670
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,680
over the organ donor list.

671
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,120
So, Jada's organs

672
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,120
can go to anyone,

673
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,330
even some racist

674
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,330
like the man who did this?

675
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,570
Then, no. I can't

676
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,570
give permission.

677
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,510
Oh, God.

678
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,890
I am so sorry. Just hold

679
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,890
pressure right there, okay?

680
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,860
My kit is down to

681
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,860
a few pieces of gauze.

682
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,560
Yeah, well,

683
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,560
more than I've got.

684
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,400
I just flushed shrapnel

685
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,400
from a woman's eye with this.

686
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,230
Help. He can't breathe.

687
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,970
I'm holding pressure

688
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,970
just like you said,

689
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,970
but he keeps gasping.

690
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,280
Sucking chest wound.

691
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,280
He needs a chest tube.

692
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,780
But we don't have any,

693
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,780
but I saw something

694
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,780
that we can use.

695
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,970
Yeah?

696
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,970
Natalie.

697
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,480
Okay, got it.

698
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,880
Look at me, I know you're

699
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,880
uncomfortable right now,

700
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,150
but just try and relax,

701
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,150
keep looking at me

702
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,150
and breathe in nice and easy.

703
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,850
You're gonna be okay.

704
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,850
Plastic wrap and duct tape.

705
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,820
That should do it.

706
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,820
Do what?

707
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,330
Every time he breathes in,

708
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,330
air gets in through the wound,

709
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,830
and it gets caught

710
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,830
in his chest,

711
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,830
compressing on his lungs.

712
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,330
The plastic wrap reverses it.

713
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,770
It acts as a one-way valve.

714
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,630
It seals the wound

715
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,630
when he inhales

716
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
and lets out the air

717
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
from the open end

718
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,830
when he exhales.

719
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,710
There you go.

720
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,710
Okay, just breathe.

721
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,120
I can breathe better.

722
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,120
Good. Nice job.

723
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,520
You need a break?

724
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,520
Me?

725
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,060
I saw you working

726
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,060
out your shoulder.

727
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,170
Hey.

728
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,170
Dr. Choi, we have to stop

729
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,170
meeting like...

730
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,730
Well, there's the pain again.

731
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,730
So much for being smooth.

732
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,500
So, your labs don't support

733
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,500
a kidney infection.

734
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,270
Student Doctor McNeal

735
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,270
has a new theory

736
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,270
about what's going on.

737
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,010
Do you mind if I take a look?

738
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,010
Well, I thought

739
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,010
you'd never ask.

740
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,110
All right, have at it.

741
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,990
I agree,

742
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,990
most likely kidney stones.

743
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,990
How would you confirm?

744
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,820
CT with contrast

745
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,820
of the right ureter.

746
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,820
Perfect, get it going.

747
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,660
We'll figure this out,

748
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,660
get you fixed up.

749
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,700
Uh, Dr. Choi, before you go...

750
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,060
How about we grab

751
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,060
a drink sometime?

752
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,660
I'm your doctor.

753
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,660
Better if we kept it at that.

754
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,430
Well, that's not exactly a no.

755
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,470
You know this...

756
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,470
Hold on a second, Mom.

757
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,820
Hi.

758
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,820
Hey, Robin.

759
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,990
Thank you for the text.

760
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,990
I didn't know if...

761
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,280
No.

762
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,100
Connor, this is

763
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,100
my mom, Caroline.

764
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,540
Caroline, this is Connor.

765
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,540
Pleasure to meet

766
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,540
you, Caroline.

767
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,210
Connor. I have

768
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,210
wanted to meet you

769
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,210
for a very long time.

770
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,840
Thank you so much

771
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,840
for taking such good

772
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,840
care of my girl

773
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,110
when she needed you.

774
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,750
Uh, this is for you.

775
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,750
It's a list of mindless

776
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,750
but very entertaining apps.

777
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,920
I figured some games

778
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,920
might make the waiting

779
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,920
room purgatory

780
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,720
go by a little faster.

781
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,720
Now this gonna be fun.

782
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,060
See, this is what I need

783
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,060
to keep my mind off things.

784
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,250
Oh. What are we,

785
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,250
chopped liver?

786
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,460
Anyway, now that you're

787
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,460
occupied, I'm gonna

788
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,460
check in with the ED.

789
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,960
And Mom, we'll be

790
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,960
right over here.

791
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,960
Mmm-hmm.

792
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,030
Still saving the day, I see.

793
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,030
And now with a beard.

794
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,100
Change of pace.

795
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,940
Connor, I'm sorry.

796
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,940
I should've stayed in touch.

797
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,950
No, it's okay.

798
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,950
Out of sight,

799
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,950
not out of mind.

800
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,410
Eh.

801
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,920
It's the ICU.

802
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,790
I have a patient

803
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,790
with questions that I don't

804
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,790
have answers to.

805
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,430
Look, if there's anything

806
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,430
that Caroline needs,

807
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,470
you just let me know.

808
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,470
And the same goes

809
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,470
for you, too.

810
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,530
Thank you.

811
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,400
You know, I'll be in town

812
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,400
for a little while.

813
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,210
Let's catch up.

814
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,040
I'd love that.

815
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,040
Okay.

816
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,190
Sebastian's CT

817
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,190
results are back.

818
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,190
Mildly dilated ureter.

819
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,020
No evidence of acute

820
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,020
obstruction, but several

821
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,020
stones in the bladder

822
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,790
causing significant clot.

823
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,760
So you have

824
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,760
your diagnosis,

825
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,760
what's next?

826
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,130
IV Ketorolac for the pain,

827
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,600
3-way Foley catheter

828
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,600
to irrigate the clot.

829
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,890
Good.

830
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,900
Ethan, patient in Two

831
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,900
has questions about meds.

832
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,030
Let the pharmacy handle it?

833
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,030
Yeah, thanks.

834
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,230
Actually, the pharmacy

835
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,230
takes forever to respond.

836
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,570
I'll speak with the patient.

837
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,570
Okay.

838
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,710
What about Sebastian's Foley?

839
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,710
You're not gonna supervise me?

840
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,140
Grab Nurse Doris.

841
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,920
She's done a thousand more

842
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,920
than I have anyway.

843
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,480
Ms. Goodwin.

844
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,480
Yes?

845
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,610
You said that

846
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,610
you were gonna speak

847
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,630
to Jalissa Harris

848
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,630
about donating Jada's organs.

849
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,790
I haven't heard

850
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,790
from Gift of Hope.

851
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,790
I did speak with Ms. Harris.

852
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,160
She's not consenting

853
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,160
to organ donation,

854
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,000
because she can't have a say

855
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,000
in who the recipient is.

856
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,100
Well, no one has a say,

857
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,100
that's the whole entire point.

858
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,230
I know.

859
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,910
Francis Buckley

860
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,910
is running out of time.

861
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,100
If he doesn't get

862
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,100
Jada's heart, he might not

863
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,100
live long enough to get one.

864
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,810
I understand, Dr. Rhodes.

865
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,950
But for Ms. Harris,

866
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,950
this has become

867
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,950
a racial issue.

868
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,840
Ms. Goodwin, I know

869
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,840
that she is hurting,

870
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,360
but what happened today

871
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,360
was the act of one,

872
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,360
ignorant, violent man.

873
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:36,490
Yes, but for her,

874
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:36,490
this decision goes deeper

875
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:36,490
than one man, one action.

876
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,300
So then what do we do?

877
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,300
I don't know, Dr. Rhodes.

878
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,760
I don't know.

879
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,320
Andre's dad didn't

880
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,320
survive the surgery?

881
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
His aunt's on the way,

882
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
but she won't be here

883
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
for hours.

884
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,170
This kid is desperate

885
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,170
for information about his dad.

886
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,300
Did she give us permission

887
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,300
to tell him?

888
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,300
Yeah.

889
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,940
Let's go do it.

890
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,320
Where's my dad?

891
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,320
Sit down a second.

892
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,990
So I gotta tell you something

893
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,990
really sad, okay?

894
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,800
No. No, he didn't! No!

895
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,670
Dad!

896
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,970
He didn't die!

897
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,970
He didn't, no!

898
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,460
Thank God, Herrmann, supplies.

899
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,460
We literally have

900
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,460
nothing left.

901
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,460
This is it?

902
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,260
It's the best

903
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,260
I can do right now.

904
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,260
Any word from the bomb squad

905
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,420
about when the scene's

906
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,420
gonna be cleared?

907
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,030
Help me!

908
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,030
Maggie! Maggie,

909
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,030
I need help.

910
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,230
Soon as I know, you'll know.

911
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,230
All right.

912
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,970
She's seizing.

913
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,970
Damn it.

914
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,170
I should have put her

915
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,170
in that last ambo

916
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,170
when I had the chance.

917
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,650
Not on you. We made

918
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,650
a judgment call.

919
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,650
Come on, sweetie.

920
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,080
She stopped seizing.

921
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,080
She's got a pulse,

922
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,080
but she's not breathing.

923
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,550
All right,

924
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,550
there's an airway kit.

925
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,760
There.

926
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,760
Yeah.

927
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,860
Got it.

928
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,880
Hey. You okay?

929
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,260
Some days it seems

930
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,260
like we do nothing

931
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,260
but give bad news.

932
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,590
I was hoping to see

933
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,590
CeCe before her exam.

934
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,030
Where's Robin?

935
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,700
Getting a bite.

936
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,700
Have you eaten, Daniel?

937
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,200
You know, I keep thinking

938
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,200
about when CeCe and I told

939
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,200
our parents we were engaged.

940
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,170
They were not too happy,

941
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,170
to say the least.

942
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,980
You remember, they didn't even

943
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,980
come to the wedding.

944
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:47,610
I remember,

945
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:47,610
but it's their loss.

946
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:47,610
That reception was the bomb.

947
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,560
All of your friends

948
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,560
and CeCe's friends, it was

949
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,560
like the last days of disco.

950
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,900
More like Soul Train with

951
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,900
a few extra Caucasians,

952
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,900
as I recall.

953
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,830
Long time ago.

954
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,160
You're still not in touch

955
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,160
with your mother?

956
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,270
A cousin told me she is in

957
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,270
a nursing home around here

958
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,270
somewhere, that's all I know.

959
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,640
I tell you what,

960
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,640
CeCe was as whole lot better

961
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,620
when it came to

962
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,620
forgiving her parents.

963
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,620
I just... I couldn't...

964
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,490
I couldn't let it go.

965
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,960
We're all

966
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,960
gonna have to let it go

967
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,960
at some point, Daniel.

968
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,260
It'll just go on and on.

969
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,440
Tell CeCe that

970
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,440
I'll come back later.

971
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,640
You bet.

972
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,220
I said no. I'm not speaking

973
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,220
with Gift of Hope.

974
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,710
I thought you

975
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,710
would understand.

976
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,710
I do, Ms. Harris.

977
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,390
I understand

978
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,390
you're devastated,

979
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,390
you're angry.

980
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,490
I have every right to be.

981
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,390
Especially today.

982
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,390
Yes, you do.

983
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:11,360
But please don't let Jada's

984
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:11,360
legacy be one of hate.

985
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,840
His is.

986
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,500
But it doesn't

987
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,500
have to be yours.

988
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,810
Ms. Harris, you have the power

989
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,810
to gift life to someone else.

990
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,510
Please use it.

991
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,830
Oh, baby.

992
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,480
All went well

993
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,480
with Sebastian.

994
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,180
Foley's in and he said

995
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,180
he's feeling better already.

996
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,380
Good.

997
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,420
Dr. Lanik's doing

998
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,420
an intraosseous line insertion

999
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,010
in Trauma Three,

1000
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,010
go check it out.

1001
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,010
Okay.

1002
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,450
Skipping out on the Foley,

1003
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,450
were you confident

1004
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,450
in my ability

1005
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,090
or just uncomfortable

1006
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,090
Sebastian was flirting

1007
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,090
with you?

1008
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,160
I would never ask you

1009
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,160
to do anything

1010
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,160
you're not ready for.

1011
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,810
Same time, yeah,

1012
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,810
I was kinda relieved when

1013
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,810
something else came up.

1014
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,140
You know the feeling.

1015
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,940
Wouldn't you be

1016
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,940
a little thrown by a guy

1017
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,940
blatantly hitting on you?

1018
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,280
No. I mean, it doesn't

1019
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,280
bother me when women do it.

1020
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,620
What do you mean?

1021
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,360
I thought you knew. It's no

1022
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,360
secret in the ED, I'm gay.

1023
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,330
No, uh, I wasn't aware.

1024
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,200
So, I'm gonna go check in

1025
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,200
on Dr. Lanik's intraosseous

1026
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,200
line insertion.

1027
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:17,960
Gift of Hope.

1028
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:17,960
Whatever you said, thank you.

1029
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,200
My brother was a single dad,

1030
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,200
yet never missed

1031
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,200
a teacher's conference,

1032
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,740
a flag football game,

1033
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,740
trick or treating...

1034
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,220
I don't know

1035
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,220
how to replace that.

1036
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,560
You know, I would really

1037
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,560
like to help.

1038
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,490
I hope that you'll

1039
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,490
call me. Anytime.

1040
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,620
Really.

1041
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,220
Andre, let's go, honey.

1042
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,070
What you got there, Andre?

1043
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,540
I'm gonna grow up

1044
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,540
and be brave,

1045
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,540
just like my dad.

1046
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,570
I think that's

1047
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,570
wonderful idea.

1048
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,350
Guys, guys, listen up!

1049
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,820
Hey, we got the all clear,

1050
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,820
all right?

1051
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,960
Calvary's rolling in,

1052
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,960
dozen ambos, more on the way.

1053
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,160
Who's going to the hospital?

1054
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,960
Everyone,

1055
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,960
and I'll take a sling.

1056
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,160
All right, you got it.

1057
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,160
Thank you.

1058
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,560
We did it.

1059
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,200
Maggie, you okay?

1060
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,980
What's wrong?

1061
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,980
I don't know.

1062
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,340
Oh, my God.

1063
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,410
Natalie...

1064
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,410
Maggie.

1065
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,280
No... Oh, my God.

1066
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,050
Help! I need help.

1067
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,720
Maggie, open your eyes.

1068
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,420
Oh, whoa. What happened?

1069
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,790
She had surgery last week,

1070
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,790
her incision opened up.

1071
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,670
God, she must have been

1072
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,670
in pain all day.

1073
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,370
All right, let's get her

1074
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,370
on a backboard and loaded.

1075
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,800
I want IVs in and fluids

1076
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,800
running now, let's go.

1077
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,140
All right, ready?

1078
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,140
On my count.

1079
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,180
One, two, three...

1080
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,570
All right.

1081
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,950
Robin.

1082
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,950
Oh, hey, Ava.

1083
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,650
You back working

1084
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,650
at the hospital?

1085
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,660
No, no, my mom's

1086
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,660
a patient here,

1087
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,660
or might be a patient.

1088
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,850
Oncology.

1089
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,250
I'm sorry to hear that.

1090
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,250
Yeah.

1091
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,490
Have you seen Connor yet?

1092
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,260
Briefly.

1093
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,260
We've made loose plans

1094
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,260
to get together soon.

1095
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,660
It's uncertain times,

1096
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,660
so I'm thankful to have

1097
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,660
a friend close by.

1098
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,810
Anyway, I gotta get

1099
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,810
back upstairs.

1100
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,810
Of course.

1101
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,980
Hey, Terry.

1102
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,980
Hey, man.

1103
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,920
Look, I am sorry

1104
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,920
for being such a dope earlier.

1105
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,080
Hey, don't worry

1106
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,080
about it, man.

1107
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,090
You didn't know I was gay.

1108
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,090
No, still I'm not that guy.

1109
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,550
We're good.

1110
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,320
Being an alpha male myself,

1111
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,320
I know the difference

1112
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,860
between bigotry

1113
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,860
and being caught off guard.

1114
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,030
Appreciate that.

1115
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,030
Yeah.

1116
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,100
But truth be told,

1117
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,100
Sebastian was laying

1118
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,100
it on pretty thick.

1119
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,370
If I was in your shoes,

1120
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,370
I might have been

1121
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,370
flustered, too.

1122
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,770
He's not my type, either.

1123
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,580
Where's Mom?

1124
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,580
She needed a moment.

1125
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,490
Didn't get into the study.

1126
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,490
I mean, not the one

1127
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,490
she wanted, anyway.

1128
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,030
Doctor said she was a good

1129
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,030
candidate for this new

1130
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,030
experimental trial, but...

1131
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,670
It wasn't our first choice,

1132
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,670
but it's something.

1133
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,140
Yeah, but experimental

1134
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,140
means Phase 1.

1135
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,140
You know?

1136
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,470
A lot of bugs, unknown

1137
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,470
side effects, dosing

1138
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,470
problems, safety issues...

1139
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,340
Dad, it's okay.

1140
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,250
We've beaten cancer before,

1141
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,250
we can beat it again.

1142
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,380
Mom needs us.

1143
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,380
How'd you get so brave?

1144
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,660
Come here.

1145
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,660
I'm gonna.

1146
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,300
Don't tell me.

1147
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,300
I popped some stitches.

1148
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,100
Yeah.

1149
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,150
And you lost a lot of blood,

1150
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,150
plus you were dehydrated.

1151
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,270
All right.

1152
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,110
Go ahead, give me the "I told

1153
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,110
you to take it easy" look.

1154
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,510
I'm not really one

1155
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,510
to gloat today.

1156
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,520
Philip?

1157
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,830
Go up and see him.

1158
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,970
You're not wrong

1159
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,970
about crossing boundaries...

1160
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,180
But I don't care.

1161
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,920
And I love you for that.

1162
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,960
Man. His owner?

1163
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,960
Yeah.

1164
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,330
So, what? You just take

1165
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,330
him to a shelter?

1166
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,440
Yeah, but he's

1167
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,440
an older dog, so...

1168
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,480
I'll take him.

1169
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,020
You sure?

1170
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,020
Yeah.

1171
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,380
Hi.

1172
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,000
Hey, come on.

1173
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,000
Let's go, boy.

1174
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,430
She's right there.

1175
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,130
Hi, Mom.

1176
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,830
Daniel.

1177
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,080
Do you mind if I sit down?

1178
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,590
It's been so long.

1179
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,590
Yeah.

1180
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,120
Um...

1181
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,590
Thirty... Thirty-five years.

1182
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,170
Why are you here?

1183
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,170
I wanna show you something.

1184
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,150
This is your granddaughter.

1185
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,150
Her name is Robin.

1186
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,170
She's beautiful.

1187
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,170
Yeah.

1188
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,610
I would, um...

1189
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,610
I would very much

1190
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,610
like you to meet her.
