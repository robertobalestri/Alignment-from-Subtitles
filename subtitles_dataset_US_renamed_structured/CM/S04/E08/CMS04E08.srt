1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,110
I asked you

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,110
to plant one bug

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,110
then walk away.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,540
But, no,

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,540
you couldn't

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,540
do that.

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,870
Hell, you don't

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,870
seem to get it.

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,610
As a physician, I have

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,610
a responsibility...

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,910
I'm so tired

12
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,910
of hearing that.

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,580
After the MRI fiasco,

14
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,580
Ray Burke said

15
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,820
he was done with you

16
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,820
and still you called him.

17
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,090
Well, I need to speak to him

18
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,090
about his MRI results.

19
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,390
I'm concerned.

20
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,980
Concerned how?

21
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,350
There are some old subdural

22
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,350
hematomas and plaques

23
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,350
in both his carotids.

24
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,390
It could mean

25
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,390
he's at risk

26
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,390
for a stroke.

27
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,460
Could?

28
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,830
I can't make a diagnosis

29
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,830
without more of a work-up.

30
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,740
In that case, there's nothing

31
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,740
to report to Ray about.

32
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,510
We could have nailed

33
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,510
that scumbag a week ago

34
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,070
if you hadn't

35
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,070
screwed things up.

36
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,370
No more calls.

37
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,810
I can't just walk away.

38
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,770
You can and you will.

39
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,840
It's over, Dr. Halstead.

40
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,680
Hey, you made this mess

41
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,680
when you took Ray's kickback.

42
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,010
This is on you.

43
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,020
Will, who was

44
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,020
that woman?

45
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,160
Oh, just a drug rep.

46
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,670
They just won't

47
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,670
leave me alone.

48
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,530
Really? I've never

49
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,530
seen her before.

50
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,430
So, listen,

51
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,430
the DJ texted me.

52
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,870
Uh, the wedding's only

53
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,870
three weeks away.

54
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,340
We haven't given him

55
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,340
a song list.

56
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,600
What was she pushing?

57
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,230
The drug rep.

58
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,010
Oh, just some

59
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,010
calcium channel blocker.

60
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,840
Um, so about the DJ...

61
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,910
It's Maggie.

62
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,910
Yeah, me too.

63
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,280
Father and daughter

64
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,280
hit-and-run victims.

65
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,220
This is Abigail Jones,

66
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,220
two years old.

67
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,780
GCS 9, blunt head trauma

68
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,780
with lacerations.

69
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,230
IO line in the left leg.

70
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,130
Abigail, it's gonna be okay.

71
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,260
Where's the father?

72
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,260
En route.

73
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,930
Other ambo was trying

74
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,930
to get an airway

75
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,230
when we rolled away

76
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,230
from the scene.

77
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,000
They were in crosswalk.

78
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,000
They had the signal.

79
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,600
Car plowed

80
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,600
right through them.

81
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's transfer on my count.

82
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,000
One, two, three.

83
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,170
Abigail? Abigail?

84
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,910
She's unresponsive.

85
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,910
I need to intubate.

86
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,010
Broselow tape.

87
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,280
And a chest X-ray.

88
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,560
Just about 12 to 14 kilos.

89
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,720
Yellow drawer.

90
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,530
4 of etomidate, 20 of sux.

91
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,260
BP 100 over 70.

92
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,660
Heart rate 136.

93
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,020
Sats 88.

94
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,160
X-rays in place.

95
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,160
Nat, tell us when.

96
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,800
All right, I'm in.

97
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,260
Go.

98
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,340
Clear.

99
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,710
Right side's

100
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,710
whited out.

101
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,710
Chest tube.

102
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,680
Ultrasound.

103
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,020
Sats down to 80.

104
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,730
FAST scan's negative.

105
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,730
No blood in the belly.

106
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,590
Tube's in.

107
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,800
Sats coming back up. 100%.

108
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,570
BP and heart rate

109
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,570
stabilizing as well.

110
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,330
Pupils are reactive,

111
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,330
but sluggish.

112
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,210
Heads up,

113
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,210
paramedics are coming in

114
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,210
with the father right now.

115
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,610
You go take him.

116
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,610
I'll finish this.

117
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,440
Marc Jones, 32.

118
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,250
GCS 3,

119
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,250
intubated in the field.

120
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,180
Suspected C-spine injury.

121
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,850
There's a step off

122
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,850
on the back of his neck.

123
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
All right. Let's transfer him.

124
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,960
One, two, three.

125
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,900
Thank you, Cesar.

126
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,900
Yep.

127
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,070
Good breath sounds

128
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,070
bilaterally.

129
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,840
BP 88 over 58.

130
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,840
Heart rate 120.

131
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,000
Should we start a neo bag?

132
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,550
Yes, titrate

133
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,550
to a pressure of 110.

134
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,140
Need a chest X-ray

135
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,140
and an ultrasound.

136
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,210
Yep.

137
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,150
Oh, my God.

138
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,190
Dr. Halstead.

139
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,920
Hold on.

140
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,120
How's the little girl?

141
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,420
Her vitals are stable

142
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,420
and no long bone fractures.

143
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,690
But CT head shows diffuse

144
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,690
intraparenchymal bleeding.

145
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,290
And what did neuro say?

146
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,690
I just got off

147
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,690
the phone with them.

148
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,860
They put in

149
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,860
a pressure monitor,

150
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,860
and they agreed with me

151
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,520
to treat with

152
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,520
hyperventilation

153
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,520
and mannitol

154
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,130
to reduce

155
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,130
the intracranial pressure.

156
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,570
And what about the father?

157
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,100
Intubated but unresponsive

158
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,100
without sedation.

159
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,070
So, a brain injury?

160
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,070
I'm not sure.

161
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,110
Pupils are

162
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,110
equal and reactive,

163
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,110
so that's a good sign.

164
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,910
We're just waiting

165
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,910
on scan results to see

166
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,910
how bad the injuries are.

167
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,540
Look, Marc's stable now,

168
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,540
but what if he goes downhill?

169
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,410
He's wearing a lot of ink.

170
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,650
Is this "Do No Resuscitate"

171
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,650
a legit advance directive?

172
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,920
The hospital's got

173
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,920
a team of lawyers trying

174
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,920
to figure that out.

175
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,290
What about his family?

176
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,720
Do they know

177
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,720
if he meant it or not?

178
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,090
We're looking for them too.

179
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,620
It seems it's just Mr. Jones

180
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,620
and his daughter, Abigail,

181
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,620
in the world.

182
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,360
He had on a wedding ring.

183
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,360
There's no wife?

184
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,330
There was, Melinda.

185
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,330
Legal found an obituary.

186
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,770
She died last year.

187
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,770
Ovarian cancer.

188
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,380
If his wife had to be

189
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,380
intubated and wasn't able

190
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,380
to get off the vent,

191
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
seeing her like that could be

192
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
why he got that tattoo.

193
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,010
Yeah, maybe that's what

194
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,010
he was feeling then,

195
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,170
but what about now?

196
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,240
He's all Abigail has.

197
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,440
I can't see him not wanting us

198
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,440
to do everything in our power

199
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,820
to keep him alive for her.

200
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,880
Well, the truth is,

201
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,880
we don't know why

202
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,880
Mr. Jones got the tattoo

203
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,480
or how he feels

204
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,480
about it now.

205
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,120
So, let's not jump

206
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,120
to conclusions until

207
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,120
we have real facts.

208
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,290
And in the meantime?

209
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,660
While the hospital

210
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,660
does their due diligence,

211
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,200
err on the side of life.

212
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,030
Thank you.

213
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,070
Keegan and I

214
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,070
have been neighbors

215
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,070
for a few months.

216
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,340
Since I moved back.

217
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,880
I'm only here

218
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,880
'cause Vicki

219
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,880
talked me into it.

220
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,850
At this point,

221
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,850
I've given up on doctors.

222
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,550
No, no, no.

223
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,550
No more scratching.

224
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,890
I can't help it.

225
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,890
It's been three years.

226
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,980
Three years. Never stops.

227
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,220
And it started with

228
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,220
a MRSA infection?

229
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,690
The antibiotics to treat it.

230
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,230
Linezolid. Side effect

231
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,230
was pruritus.

232
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,060
Bad itch, huh?

233
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,060
Mmm. The worst.

234
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,770
Everywhere.

235
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,770
And I mean everywhere.

236
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,000
But the reaction went away

237
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,000
when she stopped

238
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,000
taking the pills.

239
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,060
Except for right here,

240
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,940
and it is killing me

241
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,940
not to scratch it right now.

242
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,770
The itch never lets up?

243
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,640
In the shower?

244
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,640
When you're sleeping?

245
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,700
Never.

246
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,740
I've used toothbrushes,

247
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,740
pencils, even steel wool once.

248
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,740
Nothing stops the itch.

249
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,280
Easy, Keegan. Keegan.

250
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,980
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

251
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,980
I know it's hard.

252
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,220
Just try not to scratch.

253
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,560
All right,

254
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,560
I'm gonna clean it out

255
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,120
and apply some steroid cream.

256
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,190
Should help calm it down.

257
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,000
That won't do anything.

258
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,390
I've tried creams

259
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,390
and antihistamines,

260
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,390
acupuncture.

261
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,270
I've seen dozens of doctors,

262
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,270
dermatologists, allergists.

263
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,500
Nothing helps.

264
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,170
I just can't stop.

265
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,040
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

266
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,050
Doesn't that hurt?

267
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,050
All I feel is the itch.

268
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,240
It's all day, every day.

269
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,110
Please just find it

270
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,110
and cut it out.

271
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,220
Okay.

272
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,550
Let's get a full set of labs

273
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,550
and go from there.

274
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,730
I'll be back with the results.

275
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,530
No more scratching.

276
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,930
Thank you.

277
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,730
I've never seen

278
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,730
anything like this.

279
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,100
She's down to the muscle.

280
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,800
And she was serious

281
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,800
about trying everything.

282
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,400
I looked inside her medicine

283
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,400
cabinet, it's like a pharmacy.

284
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,180
I tried to help her,

285
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,180
but she didn't serve,

286
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,580
so I can't bring her

287
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,580
to the VA.

288
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,410
How much do you know about

289
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,410
Keegan outside of the itch?

290
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,870
Is she...

291
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,210
Crazy?

292
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,450
I don't think so,

293
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,450
but an itch

294
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,450
for three years...

295
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,510
Yeah.

296
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,630
I'm gonna get psych involved.

297
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,630
Thanks for bringing her in.

298
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,690
Thanks.

299
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,690
Yeah.

300
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,830
So, Vicki's here.

301
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,700
She just brought in a patient.

302
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,740
This is the only

303
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,740
hospital in Chicago?

304
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,010
You trying to

305
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,010
tell me something?

306
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,410
No.

307
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,250
Okay.

308
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,220
April, I appreciate you

309
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,390
covering for me

310
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,390
every time I'm in

311
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,390
the Hybrid OR.

312
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,090
Of course I don't expect you

313
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,090
to know everything

314
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,090
that I've learned,

315
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,720
so I made

316
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,720
a reference guide for you.

317
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,460
Well, I haven't had

318
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,460
any problems.

319
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,700
Well, not yet,

320
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,700
but it's good to be prepared.

321
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,300
"Obligations and Proficiencies

322
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,300
of the Charge Nurse."

323
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,640
People don't realize

324
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,640
how complex the job can be.

325
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,910
How many pages

326
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,910
is this thing?

327
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,180
Is there a PowerPoint

328
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,180
presentation to go with it?

329
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,620
Is that gonna be a problem?

330
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,650
No problem.

331
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,790
Vicki brought in

332
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,790
the patient.

333
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,190
Vicki. Your, uh...

334
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,190
Your friend, Vicki?

335
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,520
Former friend.

336
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,520
Yeah.

337
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,520
Keegan. I'm Dr. Charles.

338
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,520
How you doing?

339
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,570
Of course. The shrink.

340
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,070
Look, this isn't because of

341
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,070
feelings and it's not OCD.

342
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,670
I don't have

343
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,670
delusional parasitosis

344
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,670
or a conversion disorder.

345
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,980
And the itching didn't start

346
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,980
after my dad died

347
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,980
or my boyfriend left me.

348
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,040
Look, I'm not insane.

349
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,780
My head just itches

350
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,780
and I want it to stop.

351
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,540
Okay.

352
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,650
Well, um, let's try

353
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,650
to make that happen.

354
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,420
Really?

355
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,460
Usually docs are writing me

356
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,460
a referral, so I'll leave.

357
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,090
Well, you came to us for help,

358
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,090
so we're gonna help you.

359
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,360
Just for now, though,

360
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,360
do you think you can keep

361
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,360
your hand away from the wound?

362
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,090
I can't help it.

363
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,330
Okay.

364
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,640
So Dr. Choi told me

365
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,640
that you've tried OTCs,

366
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,270
prescriptions,

367
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,270
host of home remedies.

368
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,270
Mmm.

369
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,000
How about bupivacaine?

370
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,170
What's that?

371
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,010
A local anesthetic.

372
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,340
5 mil should do it.

373
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,710
I'd like to apply

374
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,710
a little bit to the area.

375
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,080
If it provides relief,

376
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,080
it would suggest

377
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,520
that the problem

378
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,520
might lie in your

379
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,520
cutaneous nerve endings.

380
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,080
And that would help

381
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,080
suggest a treatment plan

382
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,080
going forward.

383
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,760
Then stop talking

384
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,760
and get to it.

385
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,260
You're gonna

386
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,260
feel a pinch.

387
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,790
Do it.

388
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,200
Whoa.

389
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,260
Okay.

390
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,630
It feels different.

391
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,030
Different how?

392
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,670
Better.

393
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,340
I mean, it tingles a little,

394
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,340
but it itches less.

395
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,980
Hmm. It's a good start.

396
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,780
Yeah.

397
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,180
We'll check on you

398
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,180
in a bit.

399
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,220
So, anesthetic should

400
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,220
provide relief for like,

401
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,220
three or four hours.

402
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,190
Itch doesn't come back,

403
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,190
then set her up with some

404
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,190
topical patches to take home.

405
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,250
Sounds good.

406
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,090
Mannequins?

407
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,800
Look, I was

408
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,800
a department store

409
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,800
latchkey kid.

410
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,530
So, I took

411
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,530
what I could get.

412
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,300
Jenny was basically

413
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,300
my first girlfriend.

414
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,400
Which is why I am

415
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,400
such a good kisser.

416
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,070
I don't think I know

417
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,070
how to feel about this.

418
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,510
On the one hand,

419
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,510
it's very disturbing.

420
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,100
On the other, I should

421
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,100
probably be thanking Jenny

422
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,120
for those, uh...

423
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,120
For those years of practice.

424
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,050
Hold on. It wasn't

425
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,050
years, okay?

426
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,910
Dr. Rhodes,

427
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,910
was looking for you.

428
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,920
I wanted to tell you

429
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,920
before you got the memo.

430
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,480
The Hybrid Room

431
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,480
will be used

432
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,860
for general surgeries

433
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,860
when needed.

434
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,160
General surgeries?

435
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,860
Appendectomies,

436
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,860
gallbladders...

437
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,100
So, everything but trauma,

438
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,100
which is why we built it

439
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,100
in the first place.

440
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,040
Look, the Hybrid Room

441
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,040
was expensive.

442
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,040
It came in over budget.

443
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,900
Using it when we can

444
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,900
will help balance the books.

445
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,030
You mean, pad them?

446
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,670
Well, profit's

447
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,670
not a bad thing.

448
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,300
Ms. Goodwin,

449
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,300
this is Chicago.

450
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,970
We get six traumas

451
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,970
before lunch.

452
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,410
What are those patients

453
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,410
supposed to do?

454
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,780
I don't know, take a number?

455
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,950
Well, your displeasure

456
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,950
is noted, Dr. Rhodes.

457
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,810
And overruled.

458
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,490
When does all this start?

459
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,520
Today.

460
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,900
In fact, Dr. Lanik

461
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,900
will take the lead.

462
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,740
This is a terrible idea.

463
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,040
It's gotta be Gwen Garrett.

464
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,770
Let it go. This isn't

465
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,770
a hill to die on.

466
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,240
Damn it!

467
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,680
Call Dr. Charles.

468
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,360
Keegan, stop.

469
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,360
Don't scratch.

470
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,220
Oh, the itch is back

471
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,220
and it's worse than before.

472
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,390
You have to stop scratching.

473
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,230
Then you have to tie me down.

474
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,330
5 milligrams of diazepam.

475
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,330
On it.

476
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,800
I can't live

477
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,800
like this anymore.

478
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,230
I'd rather be dead.

479
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,900
What happened?

480
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,330
Oh, God.

481
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,410
She scratched through

482
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,410
to her skull.

483
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,420
How's Abigail?

484
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,320
Fighting.

485
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,320
How's the dad?

486
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,490
Scans are back. CT brain

487
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,490
revealed no bleeding,

488
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,560
and there's no obvious

489
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,560
brain trauma.

490
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,170
Well, that's good news.

491
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,570
Yeah, except the CT C-spine

492
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,570
revealed a subluxation

493
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,570
at C3 and 4.

494
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,470
MRI confirmed?

495
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,240
Complete spinal cord

496
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,240
transection.

497
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,340
He's paralyzed

498
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,340
from the neck down.

499
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,780
I'm sorry.

500
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,450
I just spoke with Jay.

501
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,450
PD caught the driver

502
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,450
who hit them.

503
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,660
He blew through a red light

504
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,660
because he was texting.

505
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,520
BP's spiked, 146 over 94.

506
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,520
Heart rate's down, 54.

507
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,720
Cushing's Reflex.

508
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,700
Her intracranial pressure

509
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,700
is worsening.

510
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,900
She needs

511
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,900
more hyperventilation.

512
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,900
Get her off the vent.

513
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,370
Heart rate's still dropping.

514
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,570
47.

515
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,010
2 milligrams of atropine.

516
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,610
It's in.

517
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,840
Come on. Come on.

518
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,550
Heart rate's coming

519
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,550
back up. 49...

520
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,740
51...

521
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,420
Come on. Come on.

522
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,190
Come on, Abigail.

523
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,030
Dr. Rhodes,

524
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,030
you're going to Baghdad.

525
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,430
Yep. Talk to me.

526
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,930
James Brice, 24.

527
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,870
GCS 7. Hypotensive.

528
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,630
Intubated en route.

529
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,630
Belly's distended.

530
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,800
What happened?

531
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,340
He was putting in

532
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,340
storm windows

533
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,340
for the nursery.

534
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,710
He fell off the ladder.

535
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,710
At least 20 feet.

536
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,750
I was worried the baby

537
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,750
would be cold this winter.

538
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,910
It's okay. Don't worry.

539
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,140
It's not your fault. Maggie?

540
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,410
I got her.

541
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,850
Mrs. Brice, why don't you

542
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,850
come with me, and let the

543
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,850
doctors work, okay?

544
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,150
He keeps trying to die on us.

545
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,550
All right. On my count.

546
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,410
One, two, three.

547
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,520
Good breath sounds

548
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,520
on the left and the right.

549
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,960
Let's get a chest X-ray.

550
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,970
Field IV's blown.

551
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,970
We don't have access.

552
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,230
All right.

553
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,670
Ava, can you get a line in?

554
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,570
Give me a kit.

555
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,270
X-ray's up.

556
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,730
Everybody clear.

557
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,640
Looks good.

558
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,610
Belly's hard as a rock.

559
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,610
Give me a FAST scan.

560
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,690
It's full of blood.

561
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,690
I need to get in there

562
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,690
and find the bleed.

563
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,560
We'll use the Hybrid OR.

564
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,330
We can make it upstairs.

565
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,330
There are operating rooms

566
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,330
available.

567
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,670
There's also one

568
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,670
right across the ED.

569
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,500
Much closer.

570
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,500
Connor, Goodwin

571
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,500
just told you...

572
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,560
I know what she said.

573
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,370
Find Maggie. Have her

574
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,370
page my team.

575
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,840
It's probably CT

576
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,840
looking for you.

577
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,900
I got this.

578
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,170
You're going to

579
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,170
get yourself

580
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,170
into trouble.

581
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,440
I can't worry about that now.

582
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,070
Get James ready to go.

583
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,620
Lanik. I'm taking

584
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,620
the Hybrid OR.

585
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,680
My patient is on the table.

586
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,190
His gallbladder can wait.

587
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,190
Bring him back next week.

588
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,590
I'm not your resident, Connor.

589
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,590
You can't order me around.

590
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,990
Is your patient

591
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,990
about to die?

592
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,990
Because mine sure is.

593
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,730
Get Dr. Lanik's patient out

594
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,730
and re-prep the room for mine.

595
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,650
Natalie.

596
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,780
I just need a moment.

597
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,880
Yeah, of course.

598
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,060
All right. Thank you.

599
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,290
April, I'm getting

600
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,290
pulled into surgery.

601
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,890
Okay, I'll hold it

602
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,890
down out here.

603
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,710
Oh, and I've got a delivery

604
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,710
of NG tubes, Hep-Locks

605
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,710
and ABD pads coming in.

606
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,900
I called it in

607
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,900
late last night.

608
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,770
I'll double-check the order

609
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,770
against the invoice,

610
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,110
make sure it's all there.

611
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,110
All right.

612
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,510
Oh! And it's payroll week,

613
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,510
so it means that you have...

614
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,710
All the nurses

615
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,710
need to sign off

616
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,710
on their time cards.

617
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,950
Maggie, you're

618
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,950
driving me crazy.

619
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,850
If anything happens,

620
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,850
I'll handle it.

621
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,180
Okay, and you've got

622
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,180
the reference guide that

623
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,180
I wrote, so we're all good.

624
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,160
All good.

625
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,160
Good, good, good.

626
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,090
You want some company?

627
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,760
I get it if you'd

628
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,760
rather be alone.

629
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,200
No, I'm glad to see you.

630
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,260
How's Marc?

631
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,440
No change.

632
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,440
Still unconscious.

633
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,440
Abigail was only two.

634
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,950
And now she's gone.

635
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,820
All because some guy couldn't

636
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,820
look away from his phone.

637
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,650
But maybe something good

638
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,650
could come from all of this.

639
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,060
I mean, all these kids

640
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,060
waiting for transplants.

641
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,790
There are so few

642
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,790
pediatric donors

643
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,730
in comparison to the thousands

644
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,730
of children in need.

645
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,930
Abigail could be

646
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,930
an organ donor.

647
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,500
As a minor, you know,

648
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,500
she's gotta get a parent

649
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,500
or guardian to sign off

650
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,560
before she can donate.

651
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,730
Yeah, I know that.

652
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,700
And if Goodwin

653
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,700
can't track down

654
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,700
any of her other family,

655
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,680
then all that's left

656
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,680
is her father.

657
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,040
Do you think

658
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,040
Marc will wake up?

659
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,250
I've seen patients

660
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,250
in worse shape turn around.

661
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,360
Well, that's a new one.

662
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,370
Usually I have to

663
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,370
cut them open myself

664
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,370
to get to the brain.

665
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,490
So, what do you think?

666
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,630
Well, for whatever reason,

667
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,630
the cutaneous nerves

668
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,140
in that part

669
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,140
of her scalp

670
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,140
went haywire.

671
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,640
It makes them

672
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,640
always feel itchy,

673
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,640
so she keeps scratching.

674
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,770
There a fix?

675
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,770
Yeah, surgery.

676
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,830
Sever the nerve.

677
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,180
No more feeling,

678
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,180
no more itching.

679
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,510
And no more scratching.

680
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Yeah, and possible serious,

681
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,580
irreversible side effects.

682
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,710
Facial paralysis,

683
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,710
blurred vision.

684
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,090
Worst case, she ends up

685
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,090
in a wheelchair.

686
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,720
I'm not cutting her open

687
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,720
in an alley, Daniel.

688
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,850
The risks you're describing

689
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,850
are dwarfed by the reward.

690
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,590
Yeah, we hope.

691
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,590
What do you suggest?

692
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,150
Twice-a-week

693
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,150
counseling sessions?

694
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,830
Of course, we'd have to put

695
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,830
a cone around her neck

696
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,090
to keep her from scratching.

697
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,070
Sam, all those

698
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,070
years of scratching,

699
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,070
those nerves are shot.

700
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,360
There's nothing left

701
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,360
to go haywire.

702
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,840
Dr. Charles, if that

703
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,840
were the case,

704
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,030
Keegan shouldn't

705
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,030
feel anything.

706
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,100
Let alone an itch.

707
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,160
If those nerves were active,

708
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,770
that anesthetic would've

709
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,770
provided relief for hours.

710
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,180
It didn't.

711
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,180
You only used 5 mil.

712
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,710
It wasn't enough.

713
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,710
I agree.

714
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,580
The anesthetic didn't work

715
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,580
for long, but it did work.

716
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,880
Proves the nerves

717
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,880
are involved.

718
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,850
Great, we have a majority.

719
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,850
Not that I care.

720
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,250
We done?

721
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,250
Sam?

722
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,320
All I'm saying,

723
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,290
I don't think

724
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,290
operating is gonna do

725
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,290
a damn thing.

726
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,950
Thanks

727
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,950
for your input.

728
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,490
But the last time I checked,

729
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,490
I was the neurosurgeon.

730
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,720
Put her on the schedule.

731
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,200
Isn't surgery supposed to be

732
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,200
the last option?

733
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,700
Dr. Charles, she scratched

734
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,700
into her skull.

735
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,210
What happened?

736
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,380
He suddenly went into v-fib.

737
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,550
Shocked him multiple times

738
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,550
and then he went asystolic.

739
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,640
Another round of epi.

740
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,680
It's in.

741
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,920
Check for a pulse.

742
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,890
Nothing.

743
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,560
Come on, Marc.

744
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,030
Don't you give up.

745
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,840
Pulse is back. Sinus tach.

746
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,670
He's back.

747
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,100
All right.

748
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,070
Prep him to move.

749
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,070
I'll call ICU,

750
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,340
tell them we're

751
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,340
sending him up

752
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,340
for cooling.

753
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,250
How long was he asystole?

754
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,910
Almost 10 minutes.

755
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,180
What's your

756
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,180
boyfriend thinking?

757
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,120
This guy's not waking up.

758
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,410
Hey, is your ulcer

759
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,410
getting worse?

760
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,940
Today's not helping.

761
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,040
Yeah.

762
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,350
So, I looked at

763
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,350
the paramedic's report

764
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,350
from the accident scene.

765
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,450
Marc was down

766
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,450
at least five minutes

767
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,450
before help arrived.

768
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,290
And after this last code

769
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,290
it was almost 10.

770
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,960
I mean, that's almost

771
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,960
15 minutes with no oxygen.

772
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,120
I know.

773
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,860
Increases the chances

774
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,860
the brain function he has

775
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,860
is now compromised.

776
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,330
But we won't know

777
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,330
if that's the case

778
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,330
until he wakes up.

779
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,360
You think he really will?

780
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,500
After he coded?

781
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,770
I don't know.

782
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,610
Maybe it's time to start

783
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,610
thinking about honoring

784
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,610
his advance directive.

785
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,070
Advance directive?

786
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,410
Nat, it is a tattoo,

787
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,410
not a legal document.

788
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,910
It might be

789
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,910
a proxy to one.

790
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,220
And what if Marc does have

791
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,220
the paperwork to back it up?

792
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,720
I mean, it could be

793
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,720
at home in a file

794
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,720
or in a safety deposit box.

795
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,690
If something binding exists,

796
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,690
the hospital's lawyers

797
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,690
will find it,

798
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,990
and I'll obey

799
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,990
whatever it says.

800
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,190
But until then, it's just

801
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,190
a tattoo, and one of many.

802
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,830
Will, Abigail's organs

803
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,830
are still healthy.

804
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,890
But they won't be

805
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,890
viable for long.

806
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,200
Without Marc or any family to

807
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,200
consent, we can't donate them.

808
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,340
But if we honor his tattoo

809
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,340
and we let him go,

810
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,110
then the hospital

811
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,110
can petition to become

812
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,110
Abigail's legal guardian,

813
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,380
and we can make the decision

814
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,380
to donate her organs

815
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,380
before they go to waste.

816
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,750
Natalie, you are asking me

817
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,750
to let Marc die.

818
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,880
I can't do that.

819
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,190
Well, if by some miracle

820
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,190
he does wake up, it'll be

821
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,190
to brain damage, paralysis,

822
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,730
and the loss of his daughter.

823
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,560
So, please

824
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,560
help me understand

825
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,230
why you won't

826
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,230
even consider this.

827
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,460
I have a responsibility

828
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,460
to my patients

829
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,370
to do everything I can

830
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,370
to save their lives.

831
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,700
Anything less,

832
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,700
then I am failing them.

833
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,170
Okay.

834
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,750
He's losing blood faster

835
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,750
than I can replace it.

836
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,990
Massive bleed from

837
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,990
behind the liver.

838
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,990
There must be a hole

839
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,990
in the vena cava.

840
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,920
Long Allis clamps.

841
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,800
Damn it,

842
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,800
this isn't working.

843
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,500
I can't reach the tear

844
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,500
without making it worse.

845
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,200
All right, Maggie,

846
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,200
get your hands in here.

847
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,440
Push on these packs.

848
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,440
Press hard. All right.

849
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,000
That'll buy us some time.

850
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,050
Call Dr. Lanik,

851
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,050
get him in here.

852
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,520
I don't care

853
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,520
what he's doing.

854
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,020
Just make sure

855
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,020
he's scrubbed up

856
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,020
and ready to work.

857
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,690
Give me an 8 ET tube

858
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,690
and a sternal saw.

859
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,850
Sternotomy? You're gonna

860
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,850
open up his chest?

861
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,520
I gotta get

862
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,520
to the bleed somehow.

863
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,990
Hey, got your page.

864
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,220
Come on in.

865
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,330
Dr. Abrams is in

866
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,330
surgery right now.

867
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,960
As soon as he's done,

868
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,960
Keegan's next.

869
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,560
Uh-huh.

870
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,430
What's all this?

871
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,430
It's an experiment.

872
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,260
For what?

873
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,780
Well, you don't think that

874
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,680
Keegan can experience her itch

875
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,680
without cutaneous nerves.

876
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,770
And I do. I think

877
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,770
I can prove it.

878
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,570
Have a seat.

879
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,080
Okay.

880
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,720
So, can you take

881
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,720
your left arm

882
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,660
and put it on the other side

883
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,660
of the partition here?

884
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,250
Thank you.

885
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,890
So, is this

886
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,890
like a magic trick?

887
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,160
Yeah, kind of.

888
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,140
Okay, so I'm gonna start

889
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,140
to brush your real hand

890
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,270
and the fake hand

891
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,270
simultaneously.

892
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,140
But I just want you to look

893
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,140
at the fake hand.

894
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,380
Okay?

895
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,440
Whatever you say.

896
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,910
So, amputees sometimes

897
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,910
still feel the missing limb,

898
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,910
right?

899
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,150
Yeah. A phantom limb.

900
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,750
The nerves are transmitting

901
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,750
confusing signals.

902
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,130
Or do amputees still feel

903
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,130
missing limbs

904
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,670
because the brain

905
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,670
is just assuming that

906
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,670
it's still there?

907
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,530
'Cause if that

908
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,530
were the case,

909
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,260
the nerves

910
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,260
would be irrelevant.

911
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,330
Right?

912
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,100
So, you're suggesting

913
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,100
Keegan's got a phantom itch?

914
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,270
Her brain

915
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,270
is telling her it's there,

916
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,270
even though it isn't?

917
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,440
Yeah.

918
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,570
Just like amputees perceive

919
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,570
a limb that used to be there.

920
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,780
Keegan still perceives an itch

921
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,780
that she got three years ago

922
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,290
from a drug reaction.

923
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,950
I mean, the brain's basically

924
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,950
playing a trick on her.

925
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,750
Interesting theory.

926
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,090
Where are you going

927
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,090
with all this?

928
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,220
That's not your hand. Right?

929
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,960
But the more you stare at it,

930
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,330
while feeling me brush

931
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,330
your real hand,

932
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,160
the more your brain

933
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,160
might start to

934
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,160
blend them together.

935
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,730
Well, I guess I can buy that.

936
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,260
Yeah.

937
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,100
Very powerful,

938
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,100
the connection between

939
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,510
what we see

940
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,510
and what we feel.

941
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,940
But, Dr. Charles, I still know

942
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,940
which one's my arm.

943
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,510
Huh.

944
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,840
Do you?

945
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,890
Uh, for a second there...

946
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,090
You felt the hammer.

947
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,350
Yeah, I did.

948
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,690
Yeah.

949
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,560
Well, and we both know

950
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,560
there aren't any nerve endings

951
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,560
in this thing, right?

952
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,610
Amazing the tricks

953
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,610
the brain can play on us.

954
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,240
Keegan. Keegan, wait.

955
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,110
I've changed my mind.

956
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,110
I don't think you should

957
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,110
have surgery just yet.

958
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,340
Oh, here we go.

959
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,410
What crazy idea

960
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,410
has Dr. Charles

961
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,410
talked you into?

962
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,250
It may not be

963
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,250
a nerve problem.

964
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,250
It could be

965
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,250
a perception problem.

966
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,960
In fact, I'm not sure

967
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,960
your itch is real.

968
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,820
Not real?

969
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,820
Are you two serious?

970
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,880
Look at me.

971
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,190
I have to be tied to the bed

972
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,090
so I don't scratch

973
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,090
a bigger hole in my head.

974
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,530
If surgery will work,

975
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,530
I have to do it.

976
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
But what if it doesn't?

977
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,030
What if you wake up

978
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,030
and nothing's changed?

979
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,130
It has to work.

980
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,610
Because I can't live

981
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,610
like this anymore.

982
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,610
I want my life back.

983
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,170
Surgery will give it to you.

984
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,870
All right, let's go.

985
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,610
Wait, Keegan. Wait, wait.

986
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,620
The brain can change

987
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,620
in response to experience.

988
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,080
It's called neuroplasticity.

989
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,380
Three years ago,

990
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,380
a drug reaction

991
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,380
created a chronic itch

992
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,650
that you can't

993
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,650
seem to satisfy,

994
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,250
because it rewired your brain.

995
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,920
No surgery is gonna

996
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,920
fix that. Trust me.

997
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,980
Daniel.

998
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,860
Please. Please, Keegan.

999
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,920
Let me try something before

1000
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,920
you go under the knife.

1001
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,600
It's been three years.

1002
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,730
What can you do for me that

1003
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,730
no other doctor has tried?

1004
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,530
A trick.

1005
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,580
What the hell's going on?

1006
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,140
I was told you needed help

1007
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,140
with a liver bleed.

1008
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,880
Retrohepatic cava tear.

1009
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,180
Can't fix anything

1010
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,180
until I control the bleed.

1011
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,310
I'm gonna do that

1012
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,310
with an atrial caval shunt.

1013
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,780
You gotta be kidding.

1014
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,990
Nope, I'm gonna snake

1015
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,990
an ET tube down his heart

1016
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,990
and bypass the tear.

1017
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,030
What, you couldn't think

1018
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,030
of a riskier move?

1019
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,930
Atrial caval shunts have

1020
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,930
an abysmal success rate.

1021
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,630
Yep, I'm aware.

1022
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,630
Then you also know that he's

1023
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,630
cold and coagulopathic.

1024
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,640
So, if you don't pack him up,

1025
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,640
and get him up to the ICU

1026
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,640
to be warmed,

1027
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,300
he's gonna die here

1028
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,300
on this table.

1029
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,670
At least

1030
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,670
this gives him a shot.

1031
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,080
If we send him up

1032
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,080
to the ICU,

1033
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,740
he bleeds out

1034
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,740
and dies for sure.

1035
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,610
Scissors and ET tube.

1036
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,010
If you cut into that heart,

1037
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,010
there is no going back.

1038
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,210
Yeah, I know.

1039
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,620
Don't do it.

1040
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,120
God damn it.

1041
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,160
You kick me out of here

1042
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,160
only to force me

1043
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,160
to help you kill this guy.

1044
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,100
You're a prick, Rhodes.

1045
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,710
If her father

1046
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,710
doesn't wake up,

1047
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,080
what happens

1048
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,080
to Abigail's organs?

1049
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,750
They're no good to anyone.

1050
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,460
Ms. Goodwin, can I speak

1051
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,460
to you about something?

1052
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,730
Could've driven a truck

1053
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,730
through this hole.

1054
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,600
He never would have

1055
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,600
survived in the ICU.

1056
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,500
It's the right call.

1057
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,980
Don't act like you didn't

1058
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,980
get lucky as hell.

1059
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,340
Let's finish this up.

1060
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,540
What do I do?

1061
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,180
I don't know how long

1062
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,180
I can go without scratching.

1063
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,310
Okay.

1064
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,590
I want you to look

1065
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,590
at your reflection

1066
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,490
and scratch the non-itchy

1067
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,490
side of your head.

1068
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,060
In the mirror, the image

1069
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,060
is gonna be reversed.

1070
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,190
It's gonna look like

1071
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,190
you're actually scratching

1072
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,190
the itchy side.

1073
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,360
Oh, I see it.

1074
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,130
But how is scratching

1075
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,130
this side of my head

1076
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,800
gonna make the itch go away

1077
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,800
on the other side?

1078
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,970
Keegan, trust me.

1079
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,770
We know that you've been

1080
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,770
feeling this thing.

1081
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,940
But I just want you to

1082
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,940
consider the possibility

1083
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,940
that maybe,

1084
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,380
just maybe that

1085
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,380
this itch isn't real.

1086
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,340
And no amount of scratching

1087
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,340
is gonna satisfy it.

1088
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,010
Well, then what the hell

1089
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,010
am I doing?

1090
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,220
Giving your brain

1091
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,220
new visual input

1092
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,720
to the override the experience

1093
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,720
you had three years ago,

1094
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,820
so it can begin

1095
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,820
to rewire itself.

1096
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,020
Okay, you're losing me.

1097
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,420
By feeling yourself

1098
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,420
scratch one side of your head

1099
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,830
while you're seeing yourself

1100
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,830
scratch the other,

1101
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,930
your brain'll be tricked.

1102
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,400
It'll realize

1103
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,400
something's not right.

1104
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,770
Now, hopefully,

1105
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,770
that experience will force you

1106
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,280
to perceive a new reality.

1107
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,680
A reality in which

1108
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,680
the itch doesn't exist.

1109
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,450
So you say,

1110
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,450
but nothing's changing.

1111
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,080
And I feel stupid.

1112
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,990
The exercise is designed

1113
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,990
to confuse your brain,

1114
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,350
so don't worry about that.

1115
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,350
Just keep scratching.

1116
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,890
Like this?

1117
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,890
Harder? Softer?

1118
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,360
Just like you're doing.

1119
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,830
Be patient.

1120
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,570
Good. Give it a chance.

1121
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
Keegan, we'll be

1122
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
just outside.

1123
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,940
You're doing great.

1124
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,410
How long are we gonna

1125
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,410
let her keep scratching?

1126
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,980
She's been dealing with this

1127
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,980
for, what, three years?

1128
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,190
I mean, honestly, Ethan,

1129
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,190
I don't know how long

1130
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,190
it might take.

1131
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,420
If it takes.

1132
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,190
The phantom itch theory

1133
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,190
makes sense,

1134
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,390
but it's still just a theory.

1135
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,400
I just really don't wanna

1136
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,400
give her any false hope.

1137
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,160
Dr. Charles.

1138
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,430
Something's

1139
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,430
definitely happening.

1140
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,700
The itch is less.

1141
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,670
Okay.

1142
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,110
All right,

1143
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,110
I'll be back in five.

1144
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,020
I'm gonna run these over

1145
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,020
to sterile processing.

1146
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,620
Hey. Have you seen April?

1147
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,220
I wanted to

1148
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,220
check in on her.

1149
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,220
Nope.

1150
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,430
She's probably putting out

1151
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,430
a fire somewhere.

1152
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,830
That girl is on it.

1153
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,270
So, things went well

1154
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,270
while I was in surgery?

1155
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,670
Yeah, didn't even realize

1156
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,670
you were gone.

1157
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,200
Oh.

1158
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,970
That's great.

1159
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,070
Yeah.

1160
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,350
Dr. Halstead,

1161
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,350
could I have a moment?

1162
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,510
Of course.

1163
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,750
An emergency ethics committee

1164
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,750
was formed to evaluate

1165
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,120
Marc Jones' current condition

1166
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,120
and future prognosis.

1167
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,660
Wait, "was formed"?

1168
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,660
Who asked for that?

1169
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,460
Between his spinal cord injury

1170
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,460
and his high probability

1171
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,470
for irreparable brain damage,

1172
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,470
the committee concluded

1173
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,090
with reasonable

1174
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,090
medical certainty

1175
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,400
that he has

1176
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,400
no quality of life.

1177
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,460
No.

1178
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,810
Listen, the hospital

1179
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,810
will honor

1180
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,750
Mr. Jones's tattoo

1181
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,750
as an advance directive.

1182
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,810
If he codes again,

1183
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,810
you will not resuscitate.

1184
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,850
I cannot just walk away.

1185
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,250
I'm sorry,

1186
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,250
but it's over,

1187
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,250
Dr. Halstead.

1188
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,400
I wanna talk to you.

1189
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,300
An emergency

1190
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,300
ethics committee?

1191
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,370
What, I don't bow down to

1192
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,370
your decision on my patient,

1193
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,030
so you go over me

1194
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,030
to Goodwin and bench me?

1195
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,740
You forced my hand.

1196
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,740
I tried talking to you.

1197
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,740
You shut me down.

1198
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,010
Because you'd already decided

1199
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,010
Marc should die.

1200
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,380
He has a tattoo

1201
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,380
across his chest that says,

1202
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,040
"Do Not Resuscitate."

1203
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,880
We don't know

1204
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,880
that's how he feels.

1205
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,480
We don't know he doesn't.

1206
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,530
But what I do know is that

1207
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,530
if we don't act now,

1208
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,490
we will lose

1209
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,490
Abigail's organs.

1210
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,390
Those are children's lives

1211
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,390
in our hands.

1212
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,450
No, don't turn this on me.

1213
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,590
Don't guilt me into thinking

1214
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,590
that I'm the bad guy.

1215
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,460
You don't think I know

1216
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,460
the stakes of this case?

1217
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,600
I am sick of everyone

1218
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,600
telling me what I can

1219
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,600
and what I cannot do.

1220
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,200
I am just trying

1221
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,200
to save my patients.

1222
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,940
What are you talking about?

1223
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,940
Who is everyone?

1224
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,580
You betrayed me.

1225
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,910
How can I ever trust you?

1226
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,780
How can I trust you?

1227
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,750
In the past, you have let

1228
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,750
patients go who you knew

1229
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,750
were hopeless.

1230
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,590
But you know what?

1231
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,590
It is more than that.

1232
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,290
No, look at me.

1233
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,290
It is more than that.

1234
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,460
You have been

1235
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,460
acting strange for weeks.

1236
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,600
And this morning,

1237
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,600
that ridiculous story

1238
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,600
about a drug rep, really?

1239
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,830
Well then, here we are.

1240
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,830
And about to get married.

1241
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,480
Maggie.

1242
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,480
Yep.

1243
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,610
Thanks for approving my PTO

1244
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,610
for next month.

1245
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,720
I didn't think there was a way

1246
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,720
to make it happen.

1247
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,660
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1248
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,350
April.

1249
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,460
Did you sign off on Monique's

1250
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,460
paid time off for next month?

1251
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,520
Yeah.

1252
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,970
Saw her request had been

1253
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,970
siting there for three weeks.

1254
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,770
I hate it when I put in

1255
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,770
for vacation times

1256
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,770
and nothing happens.

1257
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,300
It takes a long time

1258
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,300
because someone's always

1259
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,300
asking for PTO.

1260
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,710
Especially Monique. She took

1261
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,710
eight days off last month.

1262
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:41,380
Well, her sister is pregnant,

1263
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:41,380
on bed rest and needs help.

1264
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,120
So, how could I say no?

1265
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,170
What?

1266
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,170
Lisa.

1267
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,380
I'm talking to you.

1268
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,350
I have a system

1269
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,350
for handling PTOs.

1270
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,360
You can't take time off

1271
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,360
if you're out of vacation.

1272
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,890
Monique was out.

1273
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,020
Doris gave her

1274
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,020
some of hers.

1275
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,060
Oh, my God.

1276
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,060
You let them swap?

1277
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,660
Doris said she wasn't

1278
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,660
gonna use them.

1279
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,430
No sense letting them

1280
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,430
gather dust.

1281
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,800
You know what's

1282
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,800
gonna happen now?

1283
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,800
I'm gonna get hammered

1284
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,800
with requests from nurses

1285
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,300
who wanna swap days.

1286
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,170
Thanks a lot.

1287
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,170
You know what?

1288
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,540
You don't like the way

1289
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,540
I handle things when

1290
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,540
I'm doing you a favor...

1291
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,980
A favor?

1292
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,240
This is a privilege.

1293
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,240
Give your privilege

1294
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,240
to someone else.

1295
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,870
Time of death, 19:22.

1296
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,650
There, he's gone.

1297
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,620
You won.

1298
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,660
I was about to give up,

1299
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,340
but then there was

1300
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,340
this moment.

1301
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,900
Look at me,

1302
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,900
I'm not scratching.

1303
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,470
I am so happy for you.

1304
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,980
Dr. Choi, I can keep

1305
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,980
these mirrors, right?

1306
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,910
It's so much better.

1307
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,740
Of course. And keep it up.

1308
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,910
Over time, the itch should

1309
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,910
fade away completely.

1310
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,580
Excuse me.

1311
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,520
Dr. Charles,

1312
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,520
surgery would have

1313
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,520
been a mistake.

1314
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,630
Good call steering her away.

1315
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,490
Yeah, but, you know,

1316
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,490
I certainly understood

1317
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,860
her desperation for relief.

1318
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,130
Do you know that,

1319
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,130
scientifically,

1320
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,500
itching is ranked

1321
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,500
as one of the most

1322
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,500
distressing sensations

1323
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,830
a human being

1324
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,830
can experience?

1325
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,260
Really?

1326
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,080
You know what, Dr. Charles,

1327
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,080
maybe it's not a good idea,

1328
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,840
but some itches

1329
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,840
you just have to scratch.

1330
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,620
Vicki. Hey.

1331
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,550
What do you say

1332
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,550
we go for a run?

1333
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,550
Like old times?

1334
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,930
Sure. Call me sometime.

1335
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,130
My shift's over.

1336
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,530
How about now?

1337
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,000
Okay. Let's do it.

1338
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,780
Okay, look, my way

1339
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,780
isn't the only way.

1340
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,450
You're doing a good job.

1341
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,180
Thanks.

1342
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,920
And I confess, it sucks

1343
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,920
when you realize that

1344
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,920
you can be replaced.

1345
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,960
Yeah, I know.

1346
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,160
Oh.

1347
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,600
Wanna get a drink?

1348
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,930
Maybe two?

1349
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,370
Yeah.

1350
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,180
Sam.

1351
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,190
You'll be happy to hear that

1352
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,190
Keegan's feeling much better.

1353
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,560
Your smoke and mirrors?

1354
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,090
Temporary fix.

1355
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,270
She'll be back here

1356
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,270
in six weeks

1357
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,270
to get that surgery.

1358
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,430
Well, that's the way

1359
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,430
you see it, I, uh...

1360
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,970
I guess I see it

1361
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,970
a little differently.

1362
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,240
Until next time, Daniel.

1363
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,470
Good night.

1364
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,920
An atrial caval shunt.

1365
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,450
My cowboy.

1366
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,490
Dr. Rhodes.

1367
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,390
Three operating rooms

1368
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,390
upstairs were open.

1369
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,730
You could have

1370
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,730
treated your patient

1371
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,730
in any one of them.

1372
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,700
Maybe, but I didn't want to

1373
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,700
risk him dying in transit.

1374
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,860
That is why

1375
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,860
we have a Hybrid OR.

1376
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,730
The gallbladder surgery

1377
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,730
you interrupted,

1378
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,800
I'm rescheduling it

1379
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,800
for tomorrow.

1380
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,210
In the Hybrid OR.

1381
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,800
Ms. Goodwin, this idea

1382
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,800
to repurpose my room

1383
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,180
is misguided and reckless.

1384
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,240
Your room?

1385
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,150
Well, the board is considering

1386
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,150
closing your room

1387
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,380
unless it starts

1388
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,380
proving its worth.

1389
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,220
That's why I'm gonna make sure

1390
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,220
it is always earning money.

1391
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:25,460
Great. Then I'm gonna keep

1392
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:25,460
fighting back, because I'm not

1393
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:25,460
gonna let Gwen Garrett

1394
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,260
turn the Hybrid OR

1395
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,260
into an ATM.

1396
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,330
Gwen Garrett has nothing

1397
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,330
to do with this.

1398
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,570
I decided to put

1399
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,570
general surgeries in there.

1400
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,440
So, you pull

1401
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,440
this little stunt again,

1402
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,540
and I'll show you the door.

1403
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,950
I don't care what she says.

1404
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,840
I saved his life.

1405
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,840
I'd do it again.

1406
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,480
Come here.

1407
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,240
We're a lot alike,

1408
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,240
you know.

1409
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,400
You'd do anything

1410
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,400
to get what you want.

1411
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,410
You're that bad, huh?

1412
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,110
I'm that bad.

1413
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,900
Abigail's organs

1414
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,900
are off to recipients.

1415
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,140
That's good.

1416
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,960
Maybe you want this back?

1417
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,070
No, I don't.

1418
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,320
Natalie, I wanna marry you.
