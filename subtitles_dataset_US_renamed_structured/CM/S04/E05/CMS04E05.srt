1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,090
It can be stressful

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,090
planning a wedding.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,700
Had a couple last year

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,610
almost come to blows

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,610
over the table centerpieces.

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,110
We called it

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,110
the War of the Roseses.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,270
Uh...

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,150
How are things

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,150
going for you all?

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,610
Will, Natalie?

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,050
I think we're coping

13
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,050
just fine.

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,420
Don't you think, Nat?

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,420
Mmm-hmm.

16
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,790
I mean, we work together

17
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,790
all the time, so that helps.

18
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,390
By that she means we're used

19
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,390
to fighting and stress.

20
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,590
I always tell couples

21
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,590
during Pre-Cana

22
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,460
that it's not the fighting

23
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,460
that undermines a marriage.

24
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,100
It's the not fighting.

25
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,570
Sorry, forgot

26
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,570
to put it on vibrate.

27
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,010
It is impossible to overstate

28
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,240
the importance

29
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,240
of communication

30
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,580
in building and sustaining

31
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,580
a healthy marriage.

32
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,310
Do you need to get that?

33
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,450
No, it's nothing.

34
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,350
I swear,

35
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,350
no more interruptions.

36
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,410
Where were we?

37
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,880
Yes... Uh...

38
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,050
Where were we?

39
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,760
Getting marriage advice

40
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,760
from a celibate man

41
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,230
is kind of hysterical.

42
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,870
Although

43
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,870
I didn't know that

44
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,870
"Don't go to bed angry"

45
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,700
dates back to Saint Paul.

46
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,700
I always thought

47
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,300
it was something from

48
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,300
Dear Abby or someone.

49
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,670
What's that about?

50
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,010
It's just Jay. I got

51
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,010
some errands to run.

52
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,380
How about I catch up

53
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,380
with you later at work?

54
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,040
Why don't I take you?

55
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,040
I've got time.

56
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,280
That's okay,

57
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,280
I can get an Uber.

58
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,680
Don't be silly. I like

59
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,680
running errands.

60
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,680
You know that.

61
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,880
I do.

62
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,620
Just the kind that

63
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,620
a bride-to-be shouldn't

64
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,620
necessarily be aware of.

65
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,880
Okay.

66
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,150
See you.

67
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,600
You need to keep

68
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,600
your phone on.

69
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,770
I told you I had

70
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,770
the Pre-Cana.

71
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,310
What couldn't wait?

72
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,310
Ray Burke.

73
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,370
You got to go see him today.

74
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,910
Yeah, we're

75
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,910
picking up chatter.

76
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,610
He's hosting some

77
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,610
thing tonight. We want

78
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,610
to get ears on it,

79
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,580
so come on. Let's go.

80
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,580
We gotta get you prepped.

81
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,880
Cesar, what do you got?

82
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,980
Forty-nine-year-old male,

83
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,980
high-speed motor vehicle

84
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,980
collision, GCS 9.

85
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,120
Baghdad.

86
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,120
You got a name?

87
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,360
Keith Yates, BP 94/70,

88
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,360
heart rate 122,

89
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,260
sat 93%

90
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,260
on a nasal cannula.

91
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,300
Mr. Yates, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

92
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,800
Can you understand

93
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,800
what I'm saying?

94
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,060
He's not lucid enough

95
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,060
to clear the C-spine.

96
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,600
Board and collar stay on.

97
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,400
Let's get him in there.

98
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,270
All right, on my count.

99
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,310
One, two, three.

100
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,250
All right,

101
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,250
multiple facial lacs,

102
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,290
open fracture

103
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,290
of the right tibia,

104
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,150
muffled breath sounds

105
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,150
on the left. Let's get

106
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,150
a chest X-ray.

107
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,090
Sternum took a lot of impact

108
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,090
here, guys. What happened?

109
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,250
He hit a stanchion

110
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,250
head on.

111
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,730
For some reason,

112
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,730
the airbags didn't deploy.

113
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,160
No seat belt either?

114
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,530
Mmm-mmm

115
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,530
Clear.

116
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,720
X-ray's up.

117
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Big hemothorax on the left.

118
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Let's set up for a chest tube.

119
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,600
Give him five of morphine,

120
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,600
two of midazolam.

121
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,770
Lidocaine.

122
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,400
Scalpel.

123
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,080
Tube.

124
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,220
Oh, glad to see

125
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,220
you're with us, Mr. Yates.

126
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,690
Bolus a liter of saline,

127
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,390
hang two units

128
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,390
of uncrossed blood.

129
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,160
I'm still alive.

130
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,160
Yes, you are.

131
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,530
I'm gonna do

132
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,530
a quick ultrasound

133
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,530
of your belly, okay?

134
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

135
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,460
Okay. Okay. Okay.

136
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,140
Let me go!

137
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,470
I wanna die.

138
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,710
Why won't you let me die!

139
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,860
Have you ever seen

140
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,860
anything so beautiful?

141
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,860
Look.

142
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,130
Has your smile.

143
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,160
Mmm, I don't know.

144
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,160
Yes. Yes. I can tell.

145
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,640
I'm gonna go discharge

146
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,640
room three, okay?

147
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,130
I'm really happy

148
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,130
for you guys.

149
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,400
Thanks, April.

150
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,880
Can't believe how real

151
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,880
this is getting.

152
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,980
Well, I better get back

153
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,980
to the office.

154
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,310
Ethan.

155
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,310
Bernie.

156
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,790
Call me later, okay?

157
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,790
Okay.

158
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,850
Bye.

159
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,220
Bernie said you two

160
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,220
had a nice chat.

161
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,530
Not sure I'd describe it

162
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,530
as a chat per se,

163
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,930
but, yeah,

164
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,930
I heard him out.

165
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,760
God, you know,

166
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,760
I'm kind of blown away,

167
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,760
to be honest.

168
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
I mean,

169
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
you meet a guy in AA,

170
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,100
you got to be

171
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,100
a little reticent, right?

172
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,200
It's good he came in

173
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,200
with you today.

174
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,930
Thanks for

175
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,930
giving him a chance, Ethan.

176
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,110
Oh!

177
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,110
Hi.

178
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,590
Hey. So, is it

179
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,590
as awkward

180
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,590
as I imagined?

181
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,020
Eh. Father Brady was a doll.

182
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,020
Will, on the other hand...

183
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,290
What'd he do now?

184
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
I don't know.

185
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,220
It's like I was supposed

186
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,220
to be there for him,

187
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,860
and yet he was

188
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,860
barely there.

189
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,330
Probably just

190
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,330
pre-wedding jitters.

191
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,970
Unless you think

192
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,970
it's something

193
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,970
more serious?

194
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,030
No.

195
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,200
All right, then.

196
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,200
Okay.

197
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,200
Yeah.

198
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,580
It's bigger

199
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,580
than I thought.

200
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,580
It's small enough.

201
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,440
Trust me, you want it

202
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,440
to have a little heft

203
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,440
'cause it's easier to palm.

204
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,250
We up to speed?

205
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,250
Yeah.

206
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,520
Special Agent Ingrid Lee,

207
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,520
this is my brother, Will.

208
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,720
Hello, Will.

209
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,720
Hello.

210
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,290
You're not

211
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,290
supervising this?

212
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,800
I told you,

213
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,800
it's a joint task force,

214
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,390
so the FBI's gonna be

215
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,390
taking the lead.

216
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,660
The Bureau frowns on CIs

217
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,660
being handled by their own

218
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,660
family members.

219
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,200
It'll be cleaner this way.

220
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,570
All right, so the key

221
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,570
for you, Will,

222
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,510
will be to find a place

223
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,510
to stash the bug

224
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,070
so it's as close as possible

225
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,070
to where Ray likes to sit.

226
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,670
Anywhere

227
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,670
in the vicinity, bam,

228
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,810
open mic night

229
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,810
at the Ray Burke Comedy Club.

230
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,610
How am I supposed to do that

231
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,610
if he's sitting there?

232
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,650
Can't you find a way

233
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,650
to get him out of the room?

234
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,660
Have him go pee

235
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,660
in a cup or something.

236
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,690
You don't think

237
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,690
he's gonna be

238
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,690
suspicious?

239
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,590
Just me calling him

240
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,590
out of the blue,

241
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,590
telling him

242
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,750
I need to make

243
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,750
a house call?

244
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,290
This isn't out of the blue.

245
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,960
It's a pre-existing

246
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,960
heart murmur

247
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,960
you're following up on,

248
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,300
and Ray's the one

249
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,300
who said he prefers

250
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,300
house calls.

251
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,390
He also knows

252
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,390
I'm related to a cop.

253
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,560
You're his doctor.

254
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,070
That's why

255
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,070
this is so perfect.

256
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,440
People inherently

257
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,440
want to trust their doctor.

258
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,840
Yeah, and I'm breaking

259
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,840
that trust.

260
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,380
He thinks I'm coming there

261
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,380
to help him.

262
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,970
I thought you said

263
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,970
he was totally on board.

264
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,520
We are. He is.

265
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,390
My gut was telling me

266
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,390
he was a suicide risk

267
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,190
as soon as I heard

268
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,190
about the air bag.

269
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,490
I should have taken

270
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,490
more precaution.

271
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,530
You're a doctor,

272
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,530
not a clairvoyant.

273
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,790
Don't beat yourself up.

274
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,930
Mr. Yates continues

275
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,930
to dump blood, and

276
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,930
it's not slowing down.

277
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,300
Heart puts 350 cc per hour,

278
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,300
base deficits already at 12.

279
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,570
He needs surgery now.

280
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,740
Can't do that.

281
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,740
He refused consent.

282
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,830
If we operate without

283
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,830
his permission,

284
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,830
it's considered assault.

285
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,900
He also is refusing to

286
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,900
let us hang any more blood.

287
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,610
He would rip that tube

288
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,610
out of his own chest

289
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,910
if he wasn't in restraints.

290
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,010
He's aware he'll die

291
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,010
without intervention?

292
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,640
Pretty sure

293
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,640
that's the point.

294
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,320
So, uh,

295
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,320
no immediate family?

296
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,190
Both parents deceased,

297
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,120
says he never married,

298
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,120
no kids.

299
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,490
He's refusing

300
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,490
any outside visitors.

301
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,590
Huh.

302
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
How soon do you think

303
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
I might be able

304
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
to talk to him?

305
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,170
Uh, I gave him five of Ativan,

306
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,170
so I guess another

307
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,170
half hour or so.

308
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,640
I'm gonna have him

309
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,640
moved upstairs

310
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,730
in case you can get him

311
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,730
to change his mind.

312
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,940
I'll check in

313
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,940
with you guys later.

314
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,070
Okay.

315
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,070
Thanks.

316
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Hey, Ava, you got a second?

317
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
I need a signature.

318
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,380
What am I signing?

319
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,440
It is a petition

320
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,620
for a dedicated

321
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,620
bypass machine

322
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,620
for my satellite OR.

323
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,920
The board's never gonna

324
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,920
approve an outlay like that.

325
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,690
But maybe they will give me

326
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,690
the name of the donor

327
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,490
who spearheaded the campaign

328
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,490
in the first place,

329
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,620
and then I can go

330
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,620
hit him or her up

331
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,620
for more money.

332
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,200
I thought the donor wanted

333
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,200
to remain anonymous.

334
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,500
Look, I am sure

335
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,500
whoever it is

336
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,500
will be flattered

337
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,040
when I come

338
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,040
groveling for more.

339
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,170
Ah, thank you.

340
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,170
You are a prince.

341
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,610
Dr. Choi,

342
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,350
48-year-old male, signs of

343
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,350
acute alcohol toxicity.

344
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,480
Is he conscious?

345
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,720
A&O times two and

346
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,720
wouldn't let the medics

347
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,720
take his vitals.

348
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,880
Mags, there isn't a resident

349
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,880
you could fob him off on?

350
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,450
And deprive you

351
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,450
of all the fun?

352
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,760
Sir, I'm Dr. Choi.

353
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,130
I understand you've had

354
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,130
a bit too much to drink.

355
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,230
Can you look at me?

356
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,030
Tell me how many fingers

357
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,030
I'm holding up?

358
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,580
Bernie.

359
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,580
Ethan.

360
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,410
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

361
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,310
I told the ambulance

362
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,310
not to bring me here.

363
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,810
I need to get out of here.

364
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,150
I don't feel so good.

365
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,880
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

366
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,620
April, give me hand.

367
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,560
My stomach.

368
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,000
Bernie?

369
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, Bernie.

370
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,490
Let's clean him up,

371
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,490
get him some fluids,

372
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,100
and order an ultrasound.

373
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,100
Let me know when he sobers up.

374
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,840
I'm telling you she needs

375
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,840
to see a doctor right away.

376
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,210
Dr. Manning, this is

377
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,210
Tonya Griggs, and this is

378
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,210
her daughter Neela.

379
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,040
I don't need to be here.

380
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,040
She needs to be here.

381
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,880
Look at that bruise

382
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,880
on her neck.

383
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,810
She came in last night

384
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,810
and went straight to bed.

385
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,010
Didn't even say good night.

386
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,490
This morning, I found her

387
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,490
crying in her room.

388
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,080
I tried talking with her,

389
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,080
but she won't tell me

390
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,080
what happened.

391
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,280
Okay.

392
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,960
Hi, Neela, I'm Dr. Manning.

393
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,150
Can you tell me

394
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,150
how you got

395
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,150
these bruises?

396
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,920
I was just messing around

397
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,920
with some friends.

398
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,430
It's really not

399
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,430
that big of a deal.

400
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,160
I'm telling you,

401
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,160
she's not acting herself.

402
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,100
Mom, please.

403
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,670
Maybe you should wait outside.

404
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,640
Okay.

405
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,640
Thank you.

406
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,380
Okay, Neela, I'd like to

407
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,380
get you changed into a gown.

408
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,580
Monique here can help you

409
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,580
if you prefer that.

410
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,340
I can do it myself.

411
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,340
Sure.

412
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,680
Thanks.

413
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,430
You said you were feeling

414
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,430
some dizziness last time

415
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,430
I was here.

416
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,170
Not anymore. It went away.

417
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,670
You at all

418
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,670
out of breath lately?

419
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,670
Mmm-mmm.

420
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,740
Any chest pain,

421
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,740
headaches?

422
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,770
Honestly, Doc,

423
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,770
I never felt better.

424
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,310
Yeah, my father's

425
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,310
a freaking bull.

426
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,480
What's going on, Doc?

427
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,380
You seem a little tense.

428
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,760
Just a little

429
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,760
too much coffee, I guess.

430
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,430
Damn it. Sorry.

431
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,160
Wedding jitters.

432
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,930
We're all set here.

433
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,840
Hey, Tommy, you wanna

434
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,840
do me a favor

435
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,840
and push that green button

436
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,840
on the EKG machine,

437
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,740
the green one, and then

438
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,740
I'll tell you again

439
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,740
when to stop it.

440
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,180
This button here?

441
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,180
That's the one.

442
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,590
Is it supposed to be

443
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,590
doing that?

444
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,350
Yep.

445
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,520
The miracles

446
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,520
of modern science, huh?

447
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,630
Right here in your

448
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,630
living room, Pop.

449
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,130
Don't mean to bust your balls,

450
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,500
but we're gonna need

451
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,500
a final head count soon.

452
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,500
What's that?

453
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,640
For the wedding reception.

454
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,640
We need a head count.

455
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,050
Of course,

456
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,050
this week for sure, yeah.

457
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,840
Okay, well,

458
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,840
we're done.

459
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,750
Tom, would you

460
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,750
push it again?

461
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,450
All that for ten seconds?

462
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,920
That's it.

463
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,190
You gonna tell me

464
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,190
what it says?

465
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,390
I gotta confer

466
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,390
with the cardiologist,

467
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,020
and I'll get back to you

468
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,020
soon as I can.

469
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,670
He assured me

470
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,670
he was committed

471
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,670
to his sobriety,

472
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,670
then he falls off the wagon

473
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,670
after seeing an ultrasound.

474
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,570
What happens when there's

475
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,570
an actual mouth to feed?

476
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,770
He's an addict whose life

477
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,770
just got turned upside down.

478
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,570
Yes, he faltered,

479
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,780
but right now what he needs

480
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,780
is understanding and support.

481
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,580
Tomorrow,

482
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,580
you can kick his ass.

483
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,880
Here, the scans.

484
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,430
Let's go check on our patient.

485
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,700
How are you feeling?

486
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,700
Been better.

487
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,160
Any idea when

488
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,160
I can get out of here?

489
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,170
Not right away.

490
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,170
The abdominal CT we took

491
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,570
revealed a mature

492
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,570
pancreatic pseudocyst.

493
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,400
Have you had problems

494
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,400
with your pancreas before?

495
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,410
Twelve years ago.

496
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,410
I had a bout

497
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,410
with pancreatitis.

498
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,410
One of the multitude

499
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,410
of reasons why I decided

500
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,410
to get sober.

501
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,640
I'm keeping you

502
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,640
under observation tonight

503
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,310
to make sure

504
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,310
it doesn't rupture.

505
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,510
I feel so humiliated.

506
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,780
Look, this is not

507
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,780
the impression

508
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,950
I wanted to make

509
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,950
to my future brother-in-law.

510
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,290
I'm such a loser.

511
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,130
Just say it. Just tell

512
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,130
me I'm a loser.

513
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,760
You've had a lot

514
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,760
put on your plate.

515
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,510
We all make mistakes.

516
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,510
Thank you.

517
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,770
Thank you both.

518
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,510
I hate to put you guys

519
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,510
in this position,

520
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,840
but can you not tell Emily

521
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,840
any of this?

522
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,280
You're not gonna tell her?

523
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,150
I'm really sorry.

524
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,550
Oh, my God, Bernie,

525
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,550
how could you slip?

526
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,320
After all this time.

527
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,660
Are you his doctor?

528
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,660
Yes.

529
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,420
He told you about

530
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,420
the pancreatitis, I assume?

531
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,830
His doctors told him he could

532
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,830
never, ever drink again.

533
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,920
Oh, Bernie.

534
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,230
I'm sorry,

535
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,230
who are you exactly?

536
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,610
I'm Ashley Kim,

537
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,610
Bernie's wife,

538
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,070
and this our daughter,

539
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,070
Jamie.

540
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,740
Hey, Dad.

541
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,800
Hi, sweetie.

542
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,280
Stop with the questions.

543
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,880
Can't you just let me

544
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,880
die in peace?

545
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,520
Just answer me this.

546
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,860
You say that

547
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,860
you don't want

548
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,860
any visitors,

549
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,860
but according to your chart

550
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,860
you're pretty much alone

551
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,860
in the world,

552
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,950
so I'm just curious

553
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,970
who is it that

554
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,970
you are hoping not to see?

555
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,470
Freeze, stop it.

556
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,430
Freeze?

557
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,930
What?

558
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,710
You said "freeze."

559
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,680
Please? Did you mean to say

560
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,680
please stop it?

561
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,740
No.

562
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,080
Keith, you've been...

563
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,910
You been having a hard time

564
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,910
mispronouncing words,

565
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,910
repeating words?

566
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,880
No.

567
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,450
You know, you seem

568
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,450
a little agitated.

569
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,450
Why don't we...

570
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,190
Why don't we get

571
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,190
rid of these for now.

572
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,920
No, no, I'm okay.

573
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,920
No. No.

574
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,550
I just wanna give you

575
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,550
a little break.

576
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,650
You got a little spasm.

577
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,650
No, no, freeze, stop it!

578
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,990
Get a little spasmy.

579
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,880
Keith, that's not

580
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,880
a muscle spasm.

581
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,150
That's...

582
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,150
It's chorea.

583
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,420
You have

584
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,420
Huntington's Disease,

585
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,420
don't you?

586
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,690
They say it only gets

587
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,690
worse from here.

588
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,450
Good enough reason

589
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,450
to wanna kill myself?

590
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,560
Monique.

591
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,860
How is she?

592
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,540
Good news is, there are

593
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,540
no signs of concussion.

594
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,970
However, I would like

595
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,970
to discuss with you

596
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,640
the kinds of injuries

597
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,640
I am seeing. The bruises,

598
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,950
they're not consistent

599
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,950
with having fallen down.

600
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,640
Normally we'd find

601
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,640
more abrasions,

602
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,690
and they'd be located

603
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,690
more on her joints,

604
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,380
like her knee or her elbow.

605
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,380
Neela's look like

606
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,380
she was being held down.

607
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,120
Oh, my God.

608
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,030
I haven't been able to do

609
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,030
a complete pelvic exam,

610
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,900
but if I had to guess...

611
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,900
I knew it.

612
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,790
I didn't want to think it,

613
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,790
but it's true, isn't it?

614
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,560
I do suspect some type

615
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,560
of sexual assault,

616
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,940
but like I said,

617
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,940
without a complete exam...

618
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,030
My baby...

619
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,080
Oh, my poor baby.

620
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,420
You were supposed to check in

621
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,420
as soon as you were done.

622
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,330
Sorry. Nothing went the way

623
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,330
you said it would.

624
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,960
And still you made it happen.

625
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,630
The techs tell me

626
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,630
we're getting

627
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,630
clean audio already.

628
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,470
Hey, you did good.

629
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,400
Well, I don't feel good.

630
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,300
I'm not being

631
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,300
a good doctor

632
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,300
to my patient,

633
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,240
and, you know,

634
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,240
I happen to like the guy.

635
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,940
You need reminding

636
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,940
what kind of guy

637
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,940
Ray Burke really is?

638
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,040
You know, I'm also keeping

639
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,040
secrets from my fiancée,

640
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,640
and she's gonna ask

641
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,640
where I was today.

642
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,240
What am I

643
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,240
supposed to tell her?

644
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,720
From what I understand,

645
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,720
she knows you've been

646
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,720
treating Burke, correct?

647
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,760
So, tell her the truth.

648
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,190
You're making a house call.

649
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,120
That's not the truth.

650
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,530
You can't read her

651
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,530
all the way in.

652
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,560
Trust me, it's better for

653
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,560
everyone her not knowing.

654
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,390
Better for you.

655
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,640
How many times

656
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,640
do I have to tell you?

657
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,640
Nothing happened.

658
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,380
It's okay, Neela,

659
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,380
I'm not going

660
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,380
to be angry with you,

661
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,820
but I need you

662
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,820
to tell me the truth.

663
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,820
Why do you think I'm lying?

664
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,820
Because she said I was?

665
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,880
Neela,

666
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,720
please.

667
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,520
Isn't there an exam you do

668
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,520
to determine if an assault

669
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,520
happened?

670
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,720
A rape kit, yes.

671
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,790
We'd start Neela first

672
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,790
with a pelvic exam...

673
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,570
No, I don't want anyone

674
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,570
to touch me.

675
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,440
Neela, you have to

676
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,440
do this exam.

677
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,740
Mom, I said no!

678
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,070
Mrs. Griggs, can I talk to you

679
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,070
outside for a moment?

680
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,910
Just so you know,

681
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,860
I can't administer a rape kit

682
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,860
against Neela's will.

683
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,760
She's 15. I am her mother.

684
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,760
I decide what's best for her.

685
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,130
The exam

686
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,130
is very intrusive,

687
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,030
and if Neela isn't willing

688
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,030
to cooperate,

689
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,760
we would need to

690
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,760
restrain her.

691
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,530
Can't you just

692
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,530
put her to sleep?

693
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,370
I'm sorry,

694
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,370
it's not that simple.

695
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,670
I don't care.

696
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,140
Whoever did this

697
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,140
to my little girl

698
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,940
will pay for what he did.

699
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,380
Oh, Dr. Bekker,

700
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,380
it's just been confirmed

701
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,050
Mr. Yates has

702
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,050
Huntington's Disease.

703
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,680
The poor man.

704
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,200
So given his underlying

705
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,200
condition and his lack of

706
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,200
immediate family,

707
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,430
we've decided not to

708
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,430
surgically intervene

709
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,940
and try to make him

710
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,940
as comfortable as possible.

711
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,070
Of course.

712
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,070
All right.

713
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,670
While I have you here.

714
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,670
Mmm-hmm?

715
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,200
Not sure if you've heard,

716
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,300
but Connor's making

717
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,300
a lot of noise about...

718
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,280
The bypass machine,

719
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,280
I heard.

720
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,290
He is looking to make his case

721
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,290
to the lead donor directly.

722
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,150
It's hospital policy

723
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,160
not to divulge the identity

724
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,160
of any donor who wishes

725
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,160
to be anonymous.

726
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,280
Is that an ironclad thing?

727
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,550
You're worried how

728
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,220
he'll react to you going to

729
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,220
his father for the money.

730
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,100
Yeah, I'd prefer

731
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,100
he not find out.

732
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,160
Dr. Bekker?

733
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,510
I heard you were

734
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,510
treating my father,

735
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,510
Keith Yates.

736
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,540
I'm sorry, how did you say

737
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,540
you were related?

738
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,270
I'm his son, Max.

739
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,270
This is my fiancée, Elodie.

740
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,080
We literally just arrived

741
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,080
from the airport.

742
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,450
You're his son?

743
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,450
Yes.

744
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,220
His neighbor said she heard

745
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,220
something about a car crash.

746
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,690
I been calling hospitals.

747
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,690
They said he was here.

748
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,850
Uh...

749
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,490
I'm sorry, Max, your father

750
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,490
was in an accident.

751
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,120
He's stable now,

752
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,930
but have you been in contact

753
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,930
with your father?

754
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
We email,

755
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
we talk on the phone.

756
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,170
I haven't seen him

757
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,170
in a couple of years.

758
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,170
I've been away

759
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,170
at culinary school in France.

760
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,210
I need to see him.

761
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,210
I need to see him now.

762
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,760
I'm sorry, Max,

763
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,760
your father's made it clear

764
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,240
he doesn't want any visitors.

765
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,140
Well, I'm his son.

766
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,740
This is insane. I just spoke

767
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,740
with my father yesterday.

768
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,610
He knew we were

769
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,610
flying home today.

770
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm sorry, I have to go.

771
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,080
Doctor, please.

772
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,150
You need to help me figure out

773
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,150
what's going on here.

774
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,160
I'll do what I can.

775
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,900
His sats are dropping.

776
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,900
Down to 87 now.

777
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,660
Chest tube must have

778
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,660
clotted off.

779
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,770
Your son is here

780
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,770
in the hospital.

781
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,970
He wants to see you.

782
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,240
No.

783
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,750
That's why you crashed

784
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,750
your car, isn't it?

785
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,150
You wanted to die

786
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,150
before your son

787
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,150
could find out.

788
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,280
Sats at 85.

789
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,950
84.

790
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,950
I can't strip it.

791
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,490
Lidocaine, please.

792
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,490
What are you doing?

793
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,690
I'm placing a second tube.

794
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,700
Patient has a DNR

795
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,700
and a DNI.

796
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,250
That does not mean

797
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,250
do not treat.

798
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,730
Dr. Bekker, for God's sake,

799
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,730
let him go.

800
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,790
Scalpel.

801
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,970
Any idea what might have

802
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,970
led to this?

803
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,700
Are you aware of additional

804
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,700
stress factors in

805
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,700
Bernie's life recently?

806
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,270
Actually, yes.

807
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,310
The new house.

808
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,410
You just bought a house?

809
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,420
Well, we're still

810
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,420
in escrow, but, yeah.

811
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,480
Speaking of, I got to go

812
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,480
meet the contractor

813
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,480
over there.

814
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,190
Some kind of

815
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,190
plumbing emergency.

816
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,620
When it rains, it pours.

817
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,960
Unless you think

818
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,960
this is a bad time?

819
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,470
No, we're just monitoring him.

820
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,290
Okay. Jamie, do you want

821
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,290
to come with me

822
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,000
or do you want stay

823
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,000
with your father?

824
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,770
Go with you.

825
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,770
Okay, come on.

826
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,240
Call me if anything

827
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,240
comes up.

828
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,540
Sure.

829
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,540
Okay.

830
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,610
Ethan, you need to

831
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,610
sign off this case.

832
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,810
Ethan!

833
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,150
Look, before

834
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,150
you say anything...

835
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,590
You have a wife and kid?

836
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,590
No, hear me out.

837
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,220
You don't think that's

838
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,220
something my sister

839
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,220
needed to know?

840
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,160
I swear,

841
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,160
hear me out, okay?

842
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,790
I swear, Ethan. Look,

843
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,990
Ashley and I,

844
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,990
we're on our last legs, okay?

845
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,400
You just bought

846
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,400
a new house together.

847
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,200
Yeah, I know.

848
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,200
That was a bad idea.

849
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,400
I love your sister,

850
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,400
Ethan,

851
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,530
and I'm gonna be

852
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,530
a good father to that baby.

853
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,770
I just need to figure out

854
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,770
how to tell my wife.

855
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,090
I'm gonna kill him.

856
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,620
Do you think

857
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,620
he'll tell Emily?

858
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,280
What do I care?

859
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,280
I'll tell her.

860
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,220
You can't, Ethan. HIPAA.

861
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,050
Why are you

862
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,050
protecting this guy?

863
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,690
I am not protecting him.

864
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,690
I'm protecting you.

865
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,110
Well, sats are back up.

866
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,110
At least he's breathing again.

867
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,270
What the hell

868
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,270
are you thinking?

869
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,540
You wondered who it was Keith

870
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,540
didn't want to come and visit?

871
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,110
It was his son, Max.

872
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,480
Yeah. He's in the surgical

873
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,480
waiting area right now.

874
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,650
He's here?

875
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,750
Yeah. That young man has

876
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,920
a 50/50 chance

877
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,920
of inheriting

878
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,920
a fatal disease,

879
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,360
and he needs to be tested.

880
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,020
We need to convince Keith

881
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,020
to tell him so that

882
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,020
can happen.

883
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,430
Yeah, but what if

884
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,430
we can't convince him?

885
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,300
We can't keep him alive

886
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,300
indefinitely.

887
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,830
Well, then we need to

888
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,830
tell Max ourselves.

889
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,200
We're morally negligent

890
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,200
if we didn't.

891
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,430
Divulging a patient's

892
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,430
confidential medical

893
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,430
information

894
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,700
is a federal offense.

895
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,140
Not long from now

896
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,140
I'm gonna be sitting

897
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,140
across from Max

898
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,840
as he asks me

899
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,840
why his father died,

900
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,900
and all I'm gonna be

901
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,900
able to do is shrug.

902
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,010
You were called in just

903
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,010
to fill out claim forms?

904
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,920
Yeah, I don't know why

905
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,920
I couldn't have

906
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,920
done this earlier.

907
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,390
Leah made it sound

908
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,390
like it was an emergency.

909
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,480
Don't be angry with Leah.

910
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,110
Must be a lot of turnover

911
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,110
recently in Billing.

912
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,620
I'll talk to someone

913
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,620
upstairs about it.

914
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,680
Okay.

915
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,630
Bernie?

916
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,820
Babe, are you okay?

917
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,820
What happened?

918
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,060
What are you doing here?

919
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,060
Ethan, what did you do?

920
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,120
Ethan!

921
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,830
We talked about this.

922
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,830
You have a desire to drink,

923
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,030
you call me or your sponsor

924
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,030
first thing.

925
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,540
Come on, babe,

926
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,540
we had a pact.

927
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,100
We tell each other everything.

928
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,170
I know, baby.

929
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,840
You want to tell her

930
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,840
what's going on, Bernie?

931
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,220
I was just about to ask you

932
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,220
the same question.

933
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,350
I'm sorry, who are you?

934
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,080
Why don't you tell me

935
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,080
who you are,

936
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,320
since you have your hands

937
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,320
all over my husband?

938
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,020
Bernie, tell me this bitch

939
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,020
is as crazy as I think she is.

940
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,690
Oh, my God. Okay.

941
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,920
Bernie.

942
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,300
I...

943
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,300
Say something.

944
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,790
Bernie?

945
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,570
Oh, my gosh.

946
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,630
Ultrasound.

947
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,010
A lot of free fluid here.

948
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,010
The pseudocyst

949
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,010
must have ruptured.

950
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,670
Brittany!

951
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,670
Bolus two liters of LR.

952
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,340
Push 100 micrograms

953
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,340
fentanyl.

954
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,750
Tell the OR

955
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,750
he's coming up.

956
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,650
He's hypotensive.

957
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,710
BP's dropping, 92/66.

958
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,050
Heart rate's up to 130.

959
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,310
Hey, what'd I miss?

960
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,310
Hmm. Way too much

961
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,310
to go over now.

962
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,840
Sorry about

963
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,840
cutting out earlier, I'm...

964
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,310
Errands, right?

965
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,310
What are you gonna do?

966
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,510
Dr. Manning.

967
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,510
Hmm?

968
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,780
What the hell is holding up

969
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,780
the rape kit?

970
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,910
We'll catch up later.

971
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,750
Mrs. Griggs,

972
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,750
I already told you.

973
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,020
I am not gonna authorize it

974
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,020
without Neela's consent.

975
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,460
Then I want her discharged

976
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,470
so I can take her

977
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,470
to someone who will.

978
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,030
Okay, then.

979
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,040
You must think

980
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,040
I'm some kind of monster.

981
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,930
No.

982
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,200
Not at all.

983
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,370
I think you are trying to do

984
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,370
what's best for your daughter

985
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,210
in the midst of

986
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,210
a horrible situation.

987
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,720
I was raped when I was

988
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,720
Neela's age.

989
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,450
I'm so sorry.

990
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,690
I didn't tell anyone

991
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,690
what had happened,

992
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,660
not even my mother.

993
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,560
I was so ashamed.

994
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,530
So I'm guessing

995
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,530
you never told Neela

996
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,530
about this?

997
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,590
Mmm-mmm.

998
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,610
Don't you think she might be

999
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,610
feeling what you felt?

1000
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,010
Why she's denying

1001
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,010
what happened?

1002
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,410
If we are gonna help

1003
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,410
your daughter,

1004
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,110
you need to

1005
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,110
share this with her.

1006
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,160
What, so he told you

1007
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,160
he loved you?

1008
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,070
Who do you think you are,

1009
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,070
wrecking this family?

1010
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,800
Em.

1011
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,440
Em...

1012
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,620
Mrs. Kim, due to

1013
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,620
the emergent nature

1014
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,620
of the procedure,

1015
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,860
the surgeons were forced

1016
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,860
to open your husband's abdomen

1017
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,130
to drain his pancreas.

1018
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,190
I expect a lengthy recovery.

1019
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,100
Don't waste your breath.

1020
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,100
Come on. We're leaving.

1021
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,900
Bernie's no longer

1022
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,900
my problem.

1023
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,070
Your sister can sit with him

1024
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,070
and wipe his ass,

1025
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,070
if she wants.

1026
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,120
Vitner's Triple Cheese,

1027
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,120
nice.

1028
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,190
Tom. Tim.

1029
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,190
Everything okay?

1030
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,360
How's your dad doing?

1031
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,700
You can ask him yourself.

1032
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,260
He's outside.

1033
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,260
He sent us in

1034
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,260
to get you.

1035
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,570
Well, it's not really

1036
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,570
a good time for me, guys.

1037
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,940
It'll only take

1038
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,940
a minute.

1039
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,500
I have a patient

1040
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,500
I need to see.

1041
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,100
You got time

1042
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,100
to stuff your face.

1043
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,540
Come on.

1044
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,540
Sooner you see him,

1045
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,540
sooner you're back.

1046
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,180
So, where

1047
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,180
are we going exactly?

1048
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,560
Just up over here.

1049
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,660
Wanted to leave the car

1050
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,660
running out front.

1051
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,720
Douchebag valet

1052
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,720
wouldn't let me.

1053
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,710
Will, thanks for

1054
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,710
seeing me again

1055
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,710
on such short notice.

1056
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,650
Get in.

1057
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,920
So, listen.

1058
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,830
I wasn't happy with the way

1059
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,830
the exam went earlier.

1060
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,790
No?

1061
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,540
I didn't want to say anything

1062
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,540
in front of the boys,

1063
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,400
but when you asked how

1064
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,400
I was feeling, I lied to you.

1065
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,600
I still got

1066
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,600
those dizzy spells,

1067
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,080
and it's getting

1068
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,080
harder for me

1069
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,080
to remember things.

1070
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,080
Not sure if it's related

1071
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,080
to the murmur or not,

1072
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,380
but I just thought that...

1073
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,610
Will?

1074
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,410
Hey.

1075
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,080
You with me?

1076
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,490
I always counsel

1077
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,490
my patients not to get

1078
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,490
ahead of themselves.

1079
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,090
Let's review the EKG

1080
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,090
and go from there, okay?

1081
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,570
So, you think

1082
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,570
it might be serious?

1083
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,400
Don't worry, Ray,

1084
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,400
I'm gonna get

1085
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,400
to the bottom of this.

1086
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,100
You're a good kid.

1087
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,610
Hey.

1088
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,340
I heard our suicide

1089
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,340
has Huntington's.

1090
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,120
That's a tough beat.

1091
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,120
Yeah.

1092
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,120
So, I just met

1093
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,120
with the board.

1094
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,160
What'd they say?

1095
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,160
No.

1096
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,350
Wouldn't give me the names

1097
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,350
of the donors either.

1098
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,360
Something about

1099
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,360
a cloak of anonymity.

1100
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,600
Well, you tried.

1101
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,600
Oh, trying.

1102
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,830
Present tense.

1103
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,830
That's why I came

1104
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,830
to you, actually.

1105
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,100
Figured you could help me

1106
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,100
find out who the number one

1107
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,100
donor was.

1108
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,860
Why would you think that?

1109
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,270
Well, I've seen you

1110
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,270
at these mixers.

1111
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,570
You got most of these guys

1112
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,570
wrapped around your finger.

1113
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,870
I assure you,

1114
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,870
I don't.

1115
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,140
Hey, just ask around.

1116
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,210
Come on. You can do this

1117
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,210
one thing for me.

1118
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,640
One thing?

1119
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,650
Really?

1120
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,250
You don't need a dedicated

1121
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,250
bypass machine.

1122
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,790
You only want one

1123
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,790
'cause you hate it

1124
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,130
when you have to

1125
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,130
bring patients upstairs to me.

1126
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,700
You have everything you need

1127
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,670
right in front of you

1128
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,670
to make this thing work.

1129
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,030
Stop always grasping

1130
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,030
for more and appreciate

1131
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,030
what you've got.

1132
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,410
You're still here?

1133
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,390
Well, if you're not gonna

1134
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,390
let your son sit vigil,

1135
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,980
I'm afraid

1136
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,980
you're stuck with me.

1137
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,460
Although I really wish

1138
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,460
you'd rethink your position.

1139
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,960
Keith, Max needs to know

1140
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,960
about your condition

1141
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,060
so he can be tested.

1142
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,160
No.

1143
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,460
You know that he has

1144
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,460
a right to know.

1145
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,810
Max has already been tested.

1146
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,640
When I was diagnosed,

1147
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,640
I took him in secretly.

1148
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,070
My ex-wife never knew.

1149
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,870
Max was seven.

1150
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,740
I hoped the news

1151
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,740
would be good.

1152
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,610
And it wasn't?

1153
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,960
Max is 25.

1154
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,390
I was his age when

1155
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,390
I found out I had it.

1156
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,360
I lost my purpose in life.

1157
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,670
It all seemed so pointless.

1158
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,240
I don't want that for my son.

1159
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,080
How's he doing?

1160
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,640
BP's 80/43.

1161
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,750
Ten of morphine.

1162
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,020
Listen, Keith, you don't know

1163
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,020
how he's gonna react.

1164
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,610
He might surprise you,

1165
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,130
and medicine is advancing

1166
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,130
so rapidly, Keith,

1167
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,490
that there could be a cure

1168
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,490
by the time he contracts

1169
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,490
the disease.

1170
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,160
Sir, you can't go in there!

1171
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,160
No visitors allowed!

1172
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,960
Let me in there...

1173
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,960
That's my father.

1174
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,930
Dad, it's me, Max. Max.

1175
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,630
What's happening?

1176
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,970
Sir, you're not supposed

1177
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,970
to be in here.

1178
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,100
72/30.

1179
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,580
Look, do something.

1180
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,580
He can't breathe!

1181
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,010
He asked not to be

1182
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,010
intubated, Max.

1183
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,640
Dad, please,

1184
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,640
listen to me.

1185
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,650
I proposed

1186
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,650
to a girl at school,

1187
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,650
and she said yes.

1188
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,380
Okay? Her name is Elodie.

1189
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,380
I know you'll like her.

1190
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,980
She's just outside now.

1191
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,980
I want you to meet her.

1192
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,890
Just please,

1193
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,890
let the doctors save you.

1194
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,150
Is anyone

1195
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,150
gonna do anything?

1196
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,160
Bring him back.

1197
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,200
Bring him back!

1198
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,010
Time of death, 19:13.

1199
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,940
So sorry.

1200
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,540
Do you need any help

1201
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,540
finding a mortuary after

1202
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,540
the ME releases his body?

1203
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,100
I already contacted one.

1204
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,040
I realize it was frustrating

1205
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,040
being refused access

1206
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,040
like you were.

1207
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,710
You know, he also

1208
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,710
stipulated that

1209
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,410
his medical records be sealed

1210
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,410
for the next 50 years.

1211
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,640
Fifty years.

1212
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,910
What was he so afraid of me

1213
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,910
finding out?

1214
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,590
I love my dad. I did.

1215
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,030
Always felt like he was

1216
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,030
hiding something from me,

1217
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,330
but I'm not gonna be

1218
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,330
that way with my kids.

1219
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,400
I don't even know

1220
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,400
how my father died.

1221
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,060
Are you aware, Max,

1222
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,840
that you can ask

1223
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,840
the medical examiner

1224
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,840
to perform an autopsy?

1225
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,850
As the next of kin,

1226
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,850
you have that right.

1227
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,540
Doesn't he, Dr. Bekker?

1228
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,080
Yes, he does.

1229
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,080
Yeah.

1230
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,480
You never know,

1231
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,480
you might get a couple answers

1232
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,920
to some of those questions

1233
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,920
you have.

1234
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,190
Maybe I will.

1235
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,580
Thank you.

1236
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,490
An autopsy?

1237
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,700
That'll tell Max the truth.

1238
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,400
He's planning

1239
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,400
on having children.

1240
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,840
He needs to know the risk.

1241
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,210
Despite Keith's

1242
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,210
good intentions,

1243
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,210
I don't know.

1244
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,170
Maybe some secrets

1245
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,170
you just don't get to keep.

1246
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,360
How you doing, Em?

1247
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,060
Can't even imagine

1248
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,060
how you must be feeling.

1249
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,570
And here I was wondering

1250
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,570
if he was marriage material.

1251
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,710
Guess we answered

1252
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,710
that question.

1253
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,240
I wish you didn't have

1254
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,240
to find out this way,

1255
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,540
but at least now

1256
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,540
you can make

1257
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,980
plans for your baby

1258
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,980
in your life

1259
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,980
without Bernie.

1260
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,810
I'm not leaving Bernie.

1261
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,350
He's the father

1262
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,350
of my child, Ethan.

1263
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,360
I have to make this work.

1264
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,600
But he lied to you.

1265
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,460
And so did you.

1266
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,460
I'm pretty sure

1267
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,430
I didn't need to fill out

1268
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,430
all those forms today.

1269
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,400
You orchestrated this

1270
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,400
huge public confrontation,

1271
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,340
humiliating me,

1272
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,930
jeopardizing Bernie's health.

1273
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,980
No, I was trying

1274
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,980
to protect you.

1275
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,380
Yeah, I don't know.

1276
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,210
Think you're just trying

1277
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,210
to rub my nose in it.

1278
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,570
Hey, that's not

1279
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,570
why he did it.

1280
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,150
He's had your back

1281
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,150
this whole time, Emily.

1282
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,150
You got to know that.

1283
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,250
I don't know.

1284
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,090
That was all you could do.

1285
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,700
Here's the discharge

1286
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,700
paperwork.

1287
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,440
I told Neela the truth,

1288
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,380
and she told me

1289
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,380
what really happened.

1290
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,320
She went to a party,

1291
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,320
and there was this boy.

1292
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,920
It's my fault.

1293
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,920
No.

1294
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,120
No, honey, it's not,

1295
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,390
and I won't let you

1296
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,390
think it is.

1297
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,890
Do you hear me?

1298
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,130
This boy attacked you.

1299
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,640
He's the only one responsible.

1300
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,770
Is it too late to do the exam?

1301
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,570
That's for Neela to decide.

1302
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,550
It's what I want.

1303
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,350
I'll go get things started.

1304
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,730
Hey,

1305
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,060
there you are.

1306
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,530
I was hoping

1307
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,530
you hadn't left yet.

1308
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,600
Actually, I was...

1309
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,600
I was just about to come

1310
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,600
looking for you.

1311
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,100
I wanted to apologize.

1312
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,970
You're right.

1313
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,150
A lot of people

1314
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,150
have invested

1315
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,990
a lot of energy

1316
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,990
to make this room a reality,

1317
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,720
and all I've done is complain

1318
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,720
about how it's not enough.

1319
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,990
I have been making it seem

1320
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,600
like I settled by deciding

1321
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,600
to stay here,

1322
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,730
but truth is,

1323
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,660
I was looking for an excuse

1324
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,660
not to take the job at Mayo

1325
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,840
because I didn't wanna

1326
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,840
leave you.

1327
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,210
Oh?

1328
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,880
Yeah.

1329
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,650
I'm just putting it

1330
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,650
out there on the table.

1331
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,350
I felt like...

1332
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,590
I felt like

1333
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,590
I should come clean.

1334
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,560
Anyway, you said you were

1335
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,560
looking for me.

1336
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,670
Yeah, um...

1337
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,100
I wanted to tell you...

1338
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,370
We lost Keith.

1339
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,580
I heard. Thanks.

1340
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,750
Um, well, I have

1341
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:21,320
an M&M tomorrow

1342
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:21,320
I have to prepare for, so...

1343
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,300
Yeah, I've got some

1344
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,300
protocols to run myself.

1345
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,730
Okay.

1346
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,050
What are you looking at?

1347
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,160
EKG. This patient's

1348
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,160
pretty clearly

1349
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,620
in Type 2 second-degree

1350
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,620
heart block.

1351
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,690
Then you should probably

1352
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,690
follow up with an echo.

1353
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,860
Whose chart is it?

1354
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,000
Don't know.

1355
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,000
One of the med students

1356
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,000
asked me to look at it.

1357
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,000
Hey.

1358
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,770
You remember how Father Brady

1359
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,770
talked about communication

1360
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,770
today?

1361
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,720
What the hell, Will?

1362
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,790
The texts, the errands,

1363
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,790
whoever's EKG this is,

1364
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,990
and who were those

1365
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,990
two guys that you

1366
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,990
disappeared with today?

1367
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,820
Look, I am excited to spend

1368
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,820
the rest of my life with you,

1369
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,020
but I don't want you

1370
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,020
holding back.

1371
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,320
I don't want any secrets.

1372
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,660
The EKG is Ray's.

1373
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,800
Ray Burke's?

1374
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,800
From the reception hall?

1375
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,210
I made another

1376
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,210
house call today

1377
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,210
to check his heart.

1378
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,270
Those were his sons,

1379
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,270
Tom and Tim.

1380
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,370
Ray needed

1381
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,370
to talk to me, so...

1382
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,310
So, why wouldn't you

1383
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,310
just tell me that?

1384
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,110
I don't know.

1385
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,110
Maybe because I feel guilty

1386
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,850
about what

1387
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,850
I'm really doing there.

1388
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,460
Well, you're making

1389
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,460
a house call.

1390
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,150
What's there

1391
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,150
to feel guilty about?

1392
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,330
I'm using him, aren't I,

1393
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,330
to get the reception hall?

1394
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,190
I guess it makes me feel

1395
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,190
a little dirty.

1396
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,170
I'm... I'm sorry.

1397
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,640
I turned what should have been

1398
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,640
nothing into a big deal.

1399
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,300
It's okay.

1400
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,410
Put your work away.

1401
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,070
All right.
