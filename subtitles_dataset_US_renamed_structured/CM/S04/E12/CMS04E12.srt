1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,330
Touching down at Med

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,330
in eight minutes.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,070
Sounds good.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,050
Hey, Daniel.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,170
What's up?

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,170
How was your weekend?

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,190
I actually went out on a date.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,520
Nice!

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,520
Mmm.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,380
With that guy you met

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,380
at the jazz club? At Andy's?

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,790
Nope, I met him online.

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,950
Online?

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,260
I thought

15
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,260
I'd give it a shot.

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,620
Wow.

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,630
I don't know, man.

18
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,030
Placing the deepest core

19
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,030
of my innermost self

20
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,760
in the hands

21
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,760
of an algorithm?

22
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,430
Not sure

23
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,430
I'm there yet.

24
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,440
Well, where else am I

25
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,440
gonna meet anybody?

26
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,840
Are you gonna go out

27
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,840
with him again?

28
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,640
Nah, but I'm gonna

29
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,640
keep trying.

30
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,080
NICU wants to know

31
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,080
how he's looking.

32
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,540
Uh...

33
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,290
He's tolerating the ECMO

34
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,290
and his vitals are good.

35
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,080
All right, we'll be there

36
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,080
in about two minutes.

37
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,790
What's going on?

38
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,790
Power's gone.

39
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,330
What do you mean

40
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,330
the power's gone?

41
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,920
We lost an engine.

42
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,920
We're gonna have to land.

43
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,430
Brace yourself.

44
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,140
Hold on tight!

45
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,800
Are you guys okay?

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,770
Yeah. Uh...

47
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,830
Cody's foot is jammed,

48
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,830
and I think I dislocated

49
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,830
my shoulder.

50
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,040
You?

51
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,040
My leg's stuck,

52
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,040
but I'm okay.

53
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,870
You guys just sit tight.

54
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,870
I'm gonna call for help.

55
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,940
Okay. Ow.

56
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,750
This is November Hotel

57
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,750
6-3-2-0-1.

58
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,510
We've made

59
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,510
an emergency landing

60
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,510
in Townsend Quarry.

61
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,140
Looks like we've got

62
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,140
a bent airframe.

63
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,550
We're gonna need assistance

64
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,550
evacuating the aircraft.

65
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,390
His sats are down to 94.

66
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,390
His oxygenator's not working.

67
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,990
He won't make it

68
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,990
to the hospital.

69
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,230
Call Med, we need to get

70
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,230
a new oxygenator

71
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,230
out here fast.

72
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,700
This is November Hotel...

73
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,160
Vicki and I just hung around

74
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,160
the apartment, nothing big.

75
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,710
You okay?

76
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,710
Yeah.

77
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,900
I've been crashing

78
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,530
on my brother's couch.

79
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,530
It's like a pile of rocks.

80
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,770
You're still not back

81
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,770
with Nat? What's going on?

82
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,680
She kicked me out.

83
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,680
You got to ask her.

84
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,910
Dr. Manning's helicopter

85
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,910
just went down hard

86
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,910
outside of the city.

87
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,970
Is Natalie hurt?

88
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,580
Nothing serious,

89
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,580
dislocated shoulder.

90
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,120
The patient's okay,

91
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,120
but they're stuck.

92
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,680
The oxygenator on

93
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,680
the ECMO is damaged.

94
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,380
We need to get a new one

95
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,380
out to her, now.

96
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,950
Okay, Dr. Choi,

97
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,950
grab an ambulance.

98
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,120
No, I'll go.

99
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,120
No.

100
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,460
I just put a patient in Five.

101
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,460
Let Choi do it.

102
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,390
No way, I'm going.

103
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,390
And I'll cover for him.

104
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,930
Thanks.

105
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,930
Suit yourself.

106
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,640
Mr. Green? Hi, I'm Dr. Choi.

107
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,270
Yeah, it's Bruce.

108
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,270
This is Carol and Jesse.

109
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
Nice to meet you.

110
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,310
So, what seems to be

111
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,310
the problem?

112
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,110
My belly

113
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,110
is killing me, man.

114
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,950
He's been throwing up a lot.

115
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,950
It's getting worse.

116
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,810
My mouth is dry.

117
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,420
Hey, Jesse, could you grab

118
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,420
my water bottle?

119
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,050
Thanks, bud.

120
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,530
What happened to you?

121
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,330
Broke my arm.

122
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,920
That's a bummer.

123
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,940
I think Monique might have

124
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,940
some cool stickers to

125
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,940
put on your cast.

126
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,370
Want to go take a look?

127
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,340
Sure.

128
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,340
Nice.

129
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,840
I'll run some tests,

130
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,820
but everything I'm seeing

131
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,820
points to liver failure.

132
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,950
Any history of hepatitis?

133
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,950
No.

134
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,450
How about alcohol abuse?

135
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,090
Couple of drinks

136
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,090
here and there.

137
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,490
How many drinks is a couple?

138
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,660
I don't know, two or three

139
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,660
while I'm watching the game.

140
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,720
Honey...

141
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,230
Carol, we...

142
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,340
I'd like to take some blood

143
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,340
and get a CT,

144
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,390
then go from there.

145
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,170
We can discuss this more

146
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,170
once I have the results.

147
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,470
Okay.

148
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,210
Dr. Choi?

149
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,780
He drinks more

150
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,780
than he says he does.

151
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,950
It's a problem.

152
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,790
Look, we'll do everything

153
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,790
we can for him,

154
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,060
but he won't get any better

155
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,060
unless he stops drinking.

156
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,790
I tried. Nothing works.

157
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,930
Let me have one of

158
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,930
our psychiatrists talk to him.

159
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,020
He might be able to help.

160
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,860
Thank you.

161
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,860
Sure.

162
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,800
What, no coffee today?

163
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,940
All that vanilla syrup's

164
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,940
going to go to waste.

165
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,540
What are you going to do?

166
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,950
Connor, what's going on?

167
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,950
Nothing.

168
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,010
It's not nothing. You've been

169
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,010
distant and aloof for weeks.

170
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,780
Can you please tell me

171
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,780
what's going on?

172
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,920
There's nothing to tell.

173
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm fine.

174
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,620
Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Bekker,

175
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,620
your patient's here.

176
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,620
We're in Trauma Two.

177
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,690
Thank you.

178
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,820
I've got Barbara Duncan,

179
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,820
Down syndrome,

180
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,820
21 weeks pregnant,

181
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,870
passed out, and is stable now

182
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,870
on five liters O2.

183
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,960
This is her mother, Kathy.

184
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,030
Hi.

185
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,160
Hey, Barbara,

186
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,160
I'm Dr. Rhodes,

187
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,730
I'm gonna take

188
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,730
good care of you, okay?

189
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,070
Okay.

190
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,070
Good.

191
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,200
All right, let's transfer

192
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,200
on my count.

193
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,180
One, two, three!

194
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,810
There we go.

195
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,150
So, what happened?

196
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,150
I got dizzy.

197
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,850
She fainted in art class.

198
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,850
This is the second time

199
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,850
this week.

200
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,030
I have a baby in me.

201
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,030
Congratulations.

202
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,760
I'm gonna be a great mom,

203
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,760
just like my mom.

204
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,500
I am certain

205
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,500
that you will.

206
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,670
So, I spoke

207
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,670
with Barbara's cardiologist.

208
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,040
He said that she has

209
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,040
a congenital heart defect?

210
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,700
Tetralogy of Fallot.

211
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,340
It wasn't that severe,

212
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,340
so they decided

213
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,340
not to repair it.

214
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,910
It's possible

215
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,910
the extra load

216
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,910
from the pregnancy

217
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,920
is starting to cause

218
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,920
too much strain.

219
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,250
Well, her lungs are wet.

220
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,650
So, Barbara,

221
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,630
we would like to run

222
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,630
some tests to figure out

223
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,630
what's wrong.

224
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,630
Is that okay?

225
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,630
Sure.

226
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,150
Good deal.

227
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,150
We will check

228
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,150
on you soon.

229
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,670
Doctor, is she gonna

230
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,670
need surgery?

231
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,670
It's possible, but we need

232
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,670
to wait and see her

233
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,670
test results first.

234
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,570
Fine, just let me know

235
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,570
as soon as you can

236
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,980
in case I have

237
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,980
to make arrangements,

238
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,740
or bring in special equipment

239
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,740
to the house.

240
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,840
Look, I know that

241
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,840
this is all a lot,

242
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,910
so is there

243
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,910
anybody else

244
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,910
that we can call?

245
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,420
Maybe the baby's father?

246
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,420
He took off. It's just

247
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,420
the two of us.

248
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,090
Excuse me.

249
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,010
Ethan, I just talked

250
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,010
to the Greens.

251
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,170
Any luck?

252
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,180
He doesn't seem

253
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,180
to think he has a problem.

254
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,910
I think the wife's been trying

255
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,910
to get through, but...

256
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,040
Yeah, but what can she do?

257
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,040
She's a victim in this, too.

258
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,750
Yeah, family dynamics

259
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,750
can be crucial when it

260
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,750
comes to recovery.

261
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,990
You just don't tend to get

262
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,990
results by maintaining

263
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,990
the status quo.

264
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,290
In my experience,

265
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,290
something pretty drastic

266
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,290
has to happen

267
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,090
to get the drinker

268
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,090
to realize

269
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,090
they hit rock bottom

270
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
and start looking

271
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
for a solution.

272
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,100
Dr. Charles, he's got

273
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,100
portal hypertension,

274
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,230
esophageal varices,

275
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,230
and LFTs through the roof.

276
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,840
This is rock bottom.

277
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,840
You'd think.

278
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,610
Hey, guys, I need to get

279
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,610
this oxygenator down there.

280
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,020
It's gonna be a minute.

281
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,640
We gotta get our extrication

282
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,640
equipment down first.

283
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,450
Natalie's got a dislocated

284
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,450
shoulder and her patient's

285
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,450
in trouble.

286
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,990
All right, we'll send it

287
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,990
down in the basket.

288
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,780
No, I'm going, too.

289
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,780
Doc, come on.

290
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,490
We don't even have

291
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,490
our guys down there yet.

292
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,120
I have to get to Natalie.

293
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,230
Send me down now.

294
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,490
You okay?

295
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,490
I'm fine.

296
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,020
How's the boy?

297
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,020
Sats are down to 82.

298
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,590
What about your shoulder?

299
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,590
It's all right. I'm fine.

300
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,220
Got it?

301
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,220
Yeah.

302
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,390
Wait, stop. Let me see

303
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,390
if I can pry open

304
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,390
another window.

305
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,300
I told you I'm fine.

306
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,030
Natalie, just hold on.

307
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,030
You don't have to be a hero.

308
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,260
Ow.

309
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,260
Come on. What, do you want

310
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,260
to damage the nerve?

311
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,410
I don't need your

312
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,410
medical advice, Will.

313
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,210
Mr. Flores, can you tell me

314
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,210
how long you've been in pain?

315
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,940
Just since last night.

316
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,880
Usually, her cooking wears off

317
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,880
by the morning.

318
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,020
Okay. Have you ever

319
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,020
had pain like this before?

320
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,720
No.

321
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,590
Any history of abdominal

322
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,590
conditions or surgeries?

323
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,720
No.

324
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,030
Okay, based on your

325
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,030
positive McBurney's sign

326
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,430
and rebound tenderness,

327
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,870
I suspect

328
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,870
you have a routine

329
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,870
case of appendicitis.

330
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,440
Do you have any allergies?

331
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,440
Not that I know of.

332
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,200
Then we're going

333
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,200
to order some tests

334
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,200
and call Surgery.

335
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,770
Surgery?

336
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,770
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

337
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,310
If necessary,

338
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,410
an appendectomy is

339
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,410
a very simple procedure.

340
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,810
You'd most likely be out

341
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,810
of the hospital by tomorrow.

342
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,250
Okay.

343
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,310
Here you go.

344
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,750
Oh, thank you.

345
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,750
Yeah.

346
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,420
I like to keep notes

347
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,420
on all my cases.

348
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,850
Tell radiology we need a CT

349
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,850
with contrast, stat.

350
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,990
Nah, keep it.

351
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,090
Turns out people don't hire

352
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,090
a flooring company

353
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,360
'cause you give 'em

354
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,360
free pens.

355
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,330
Who knew?

356
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,240
Yeah, that does

357
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,240
seem unlikely.

358
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,080
And for the pain?

359
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,080
I think it's time

360
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,080
to think about

361
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,210
ibuprofen 600.

362
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,210
Okay.

363
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,810
Would you excuse me

364
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,810
for a second?

365
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,810
Of course.

366
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,490
Oh, yeah, snack time.

367
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,450
Yeah.

368
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,630
I would stay away from those

369
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,630
apple slices. They don't

370
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,630
change them out that much.

371
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,790
Okay, thanks.

372
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,570
Ooh, I got you. I got you.

373
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,830
That's an excellent cast.

374
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,830
What did you do to your arm?

375
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,540
I broke it.

376
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,940
What, bear attack?

377
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,940
Motorcycle?

378
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,940
It was nothing. I just...

379
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,940
You know, I fell.

380
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,680
From my treehouse.

381
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,320
Oh.

382
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,820
Excellent choice.

383
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,230
So, what happened?

384
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,230
What, rainy day?

385
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,440
Rotten plank?

386
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,940
Oh, I... You know,

387
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,940
I was just playing around.

388
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,780
I got to get back

389
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,780
to my mom and dad.

390
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,080
So, Barbara,

391
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,650
your tests are showing

392
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,650
that you are in heart failure,

393
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,600
and we have every reason

394
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,600
to expect

395
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,110
that it will get worse

396
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,110
as the pregnancy progresses.

397
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,440
How much worse?

398
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,700
It's impossible to say,

399
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,270
but the odds of you having

400
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,270
a life-threatening event

401
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,270
are quite high.

402
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,270
So, she needs

403
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,270
the surgery.

404
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,510
That would be

405
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,510
my recommendation, yes,

406
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,180
but you should know,

407
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,450
the surgery is long

408
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,450
and difficult

409
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,750
and it could pose a risk

410
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,750
to the baby.

411
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,520
It's gonna hurt my baby?

412
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,520
It's possible.

413
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,320
And, unfortunately,

414
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,320
if it does,

415
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,260
your baby is too small

416
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,260
to survive on its own.

417
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,300
He'll die?

418
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,300
He may.

419
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,200
No, I don't want the surgery.

420
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,460
Barbie, I don't think they're

421
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,460
saying that we have a choice.

422
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,300
Yes, we do.

423
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,300
Honey...

424
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,770
You don't want to take care

425
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,770
of this baby.

426
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,770
Barbara...

427
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,740
You think it's going

428
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,740
to be a problem like me.

429
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,470
I know this is difficult

430
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,470
and painful,

431
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,170
but you have to let me

432
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,170
handle this.

433
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,110
No, this is my decision!

434
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,280
You're not capable

435
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,280
of making this decision!

436
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,890
Look, why don't you two

437
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,890
take some time?

438
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,190
You can think about it,

439
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,190
and we will come back

440
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,190
in just a bit.

441
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,800
Excuse me.

442
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,040
I have Barbara's

443
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,040
medical power

444
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,040
of attorney.

445
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,040
Do the surgery.

446
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,210
Ms. Duncan, I really think

447
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,210
that the two of you

448
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,210
should discuss this.

449
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,480
If she doesn't have

450
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,480
the surgery,

451
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,480
she could die.

452
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,420
Do the surgery.

453
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,220
I'll go put her

454
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,220
on the schedule.

455
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,220
No, you won't.

456
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,460
You heard her mother,

457
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,460
she has power of attorney.

458
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,060
I heard my patient

459
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,060
and she doesn't want it.

460
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,740
Got it.

461
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,840
Are you okay?

462
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,840
Yeah, thanks.

463
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,010
Hey, Cruz.

464
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,010
Yeah.

465
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,380
Help me try

466
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,380
and get this kid out.

467
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,380
On my way.

468
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,250
How's Cody doing?

469
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,340
His sats are improving,

470
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,780
but the battery

471
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,780
is running low on the ECMO.

472
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,890
Looks like they should

473
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,890
have him out soon.

474
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,010
Let me reduce your shoulder.

475
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,560
No, we'll do it

476
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,560
when we get back.

477
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,530
We still have to get him

478
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,530
out of here, back

479
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,530
to the ambulance,

480
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,530
and all the way to Med.

481
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,530
You're gonna need your arm.

482
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,860
Fine.

483
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,000
No, I think

484
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,000
you're a little too

485
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,000
high on the forearm.

486
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,510
Natalie, I've done

487
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,510
this before.

488
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,110
I know, but this is

489
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,110
the arm that...

490
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,640
You broke in college

491
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,640
when Lisa Gates ran into you

492
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,640
with her bike.

493
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,840
I know.

494
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,980
All right,

495
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,980
you're gonna feel this.

496
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,140
Just be still.

497
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,140
Okay, but I still think

498
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,140
you're too...

499
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,610
Ow.

500
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,550
There, try it out.

501
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,590
It's good. Thank you.

502
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,060
I'm gonna go check on Cody.

503
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,690
Dr. Choi?

504
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,440
Is my dad gonna die?

505
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,210
We're doing everything we can

506
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,210
to help him get better.

507
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,850
So, he might?

508
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,020
Give us a chance.

509
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,020
We still have

510
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,020
some things we can try.

511
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,270
Doc, that thing for me?

512
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,310
Once we drain the fluid

513
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,310
from your abdomen,

514
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,310
it'll be easier to breathe.

515
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,510
And then what happens?

516
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,910
We'll start you

517
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,910
on a diuretic.

518
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,680
Then have you evaluated

519
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,680
for an intrahepatic

520
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,680
portosystemic shunt.

521
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,420
That sounds serious.

522
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,320
It is, but here's

523
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,320
the thing...

524
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,290
If you keep drinking,

525
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,290
none of it will work.

526
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,990
Come on, Doc, I told you...

527
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,930
You'll lose

528
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,930
your mental status first.

529
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,160
Confusion, memory loss.

530
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,170
That's when your kidneys

531
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,170
start to fail.

532
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,000
Your lungs fill

533
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,000
with fluid.

534
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,210
Then it's either

535
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,210
heart failure,

536
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,210
infection, or coma.

537
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,780
Probably two,

538
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,780
three months tops.

539
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,880
Okay, I get it,

540
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,880
it's your job to scare me.

541
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,590
My job is to try

542
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,590
to keep you alive,

543
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,130
and, from what I can tell,

544
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,130
you have a lot to live for.

545
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,500
But it's up to you whether you

546
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,500
want to do that or not.

547
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,230
Let me know when

548
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,230
the drainage stops.

549
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,540
Bruce.

550
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,480
Okay, you're right.

551
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,810
Clearly, I drink too much.

552
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,920
She's always telling me that.

553
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,850
That's it.

554
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,850
I'm done.

555
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,120
Quitting doesn't mean

556
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,120
just saying it.

557
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,990
It means going

558
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,990
through detox, A.A.

559
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,020
Doc, I got a boy

560
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,020
I love, my wife.

561
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,100
I am telling you,

562
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,100
I have taken my last drink.

563
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,870
Okay, let's get

564
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,870
you stabilized.

565
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,680
Then I'll have a social worker

566
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,680
come down to go over

567
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,680
the next steps.

568
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,740
Thank you.

569
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,790
A code in radiology?

570
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,760
Let's go.

571
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,570
Did he get contrast?

572
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,570
Just a minute ago.

573
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,940
Okay, it's an

574
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,940
allergic reaction.

575
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,040
His throat's swelling.

576
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,040
.3 milligrams of epi IM.

577
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,850
Okay, Pete, just relax.

578
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,850
Try and take a deep breath.

579
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,150
Epi's in.

580
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,260
I need to intubate.

581
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,260
Laryngoscope and ET tube.

582
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,060
He said he didn't

583
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,060
have any allergies.

584
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,600
Well, you don't

585
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,600
always know

586
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,600
until they happen.

587
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,860
Tube's in. Start bagging.

588
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,800
He's in v-fib.

589
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,640
Grab the paddles.

590
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,640
Curry, run the code.

591
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,510
What? No, I...

592
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,510
Curry!

593
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,250
Okay, um, charge to 200.

594
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,610
Clear?

595
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,690
Still in v-fib.

596
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,690
Giving an amp of epi.

597
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,950
Again.

598
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,560
Charging to 200.

599
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,560
Clear!

600
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,000
Charge it again.

601
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,000
April, 200.

602
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,200
It's over.

603
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,710
What?

604
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,710
Call it.

605
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,950
Time of death, 13:06.

606
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,770
And this young woman

607
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,770
with Down syndrome is 25?

608
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,630
Yes, she is an adult and

609
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,630
does not want the surgery.

610
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,730
Barbara has a life-threatening

611
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,730
condition. She needs

612
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,730
this procedure.

613
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,610
And what happens

614
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,610
if she doesn't get it?

615
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,080
We will put her on medication.

616
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,910
We'll have her

617
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,910
get weekly checkups

618
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,910
from her cardiologist.

619
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,510
And she'll likely still die

620
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,510
from heart failure.

621
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,680
Barbara's mother has spent

622
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,150
her entire life caring

623
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,150
for her daughter.

624
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,520
Everything she's done,

625
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,520
she has done for her.

626
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,990
We need to trust her judgment.

627
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,850
We need to let people

628
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,850
make their own decisions,

629
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,360
not have them made

630
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,360
against their will.

631
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,550
I understand your concerns,

632
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,550
Dr. Rhodes,

633
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,500
but the patient's mother

634
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,000
does have legal

635
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,000
decision-making power.

636
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't see any choice

637
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,000
but to authorize the surgery.

638
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,500
Thank you.

639
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,230
Okay.

640
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,810
We should give Barbara

641
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,810
some credit for knowing

642
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,810
what she wants.

643
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,040
What is going on with you?

644
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,740
I want to honor

645
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,740
my patient's wishes.

646
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,980
No, we've had professional

647
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,980
disagreements before.

648
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,280
This is different.

649
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,280
This feels personal.

650
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,580
All right.

651
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,160
My father told me

652
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,160
his version

653
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,790
of how he came to donate

654
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,790
money for the Hybrid OR.

655
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,200
Yeah, he said I slept

656
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,200
with him. He's lying.

657
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,100
He said that you were

658
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,100
the instigator,

659
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,100
that you seduced him.

660
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,370
It sounded like

661
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,370
he was telling the truth.

662
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,880
Patient is out

663
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,880
and we're on the move.

664
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,010
Copy that, Squad 3.

665
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,010
We'll notify Chicago Med.

666
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,810
I know you didn't want to go,

667
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,810
but how's therapy going?

668
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,050
Only gone once,

669
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,050
but Dr. Moore seems fine.

670
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,730
Good. Well, I mean,

671
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,730
I'm glad you like her.

672
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,760
She spent a lot of time

673
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,760
waiting for me

674
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,760
to say something,

675
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,600
but I didn't know what

676
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,600
I was supposed to talk about.

677
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,660
What happened, happened.

678
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,300
Dr. Manning!

679
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,870
His sats and heart rate

680
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,870
are tanking!

681
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,880
No breath sounds

682
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,880
on the left.

683
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,150
The bag must've

684
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,150
blown out the lung.

685
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,020
We need a chest tube.

686
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,020
No, he's too anticoagulated.

687
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,650
A chest tube might cause

688
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,650
a major bleed.

689
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,710
I'm doing a needle.

690
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,950
Wait, a needle is only

691
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,950
temporary. He's still gonna

692
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,950
need a tube.

693
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,080
We can deal with that

694
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,080
when we get there.

695
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,090
He needs decompression now.

696
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,090
Natalie...

697
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,830
You know what? You're right.

698
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,830
Let's do a needle.

699
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,930
Sats are back in the 80s.

700
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,630
Breath sounds are better.

701
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,630
Let's get him out of here.

702
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,810
Barbara, I'm very sorry,

703
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,080
but we do have to take you

704
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,080
up to surgery now.

705
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,250
No, I don't want to go.

706
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,590
Everything is only getting

707
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,590
worse. I'm afraid

708
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,590
we don't have a choice.

709
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,850
But my baby!

710
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,990
We're going to do everything

711
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,990
that we can to make sure that

712
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,990
your baby is safe.

713
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,750
You said you can't!

714
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,520
You said my baby might die!

715
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,930
Mom, make them stop!

716
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,700
Sweetie, it's going

717
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,700
to be okay.

718
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,970
Dr. Rhodes?

719
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,970
We're taking her

720
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,970
up to surgery now.

721
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,740
They're gonna kill my baby!

722
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,870
Everything's gonna be okay.

723
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,870
It's my baby, Mom!

724
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,550
No, I don't wanna go! No!

725
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,950
No, no!

726
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,350
You still haven't told her

727
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,350
about her husband.

728
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,460
Uh...

729
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,630
No, I was just about to.

730
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,240
Is this the first patient

731
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,240
you've lost?

732
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,970
Yeah.

733
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,870
You want to go over

734
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,870
what you should say?

735
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,170
No, no, I'm fine.

736
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,580
We had a lecture on this

737
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,580
in second year.

738
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,050
Why don't I come with you?

739
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,050
Okay.

740
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,380
I got worried.

741
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,380
It was taking so long.

742
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,190
Mrs. Flores, I'm afraid

743
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,190
there was a complication.

744
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,250
"Complication"?

745
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,120
Your husband had

746
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,120
an allergic reaction

747
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,120
and stopped breathing.

748
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,560
We tried to save him,

749
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,470
but his heart went into

750
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,470
an arrhythmia and he died.

751
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,860
What?

752
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,840
Ventricular fibrillation.

753
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,840
He died.

754
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,340
That doesn't make any sense.

755
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,570
You said that it was just

756
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,080
his appendix, and it was

757
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,080
a simple procedure!

758
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,450
Yes, but this was a contrast

759
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,450
reaction, which had

760
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,450
nothing to do with...

761
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,180
He can't be dead!

762
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,180
I'm afraid he is.

763
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,420
His heart went into

764
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,420
a fatal arrhythmia.

765
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,580
That's not true!

766
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,580
He's not dead!

767
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,530
Mrs. Flores.

768
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,660
Mrs. Flores, it is true.

769
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,070
We did everything

770
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,070
that we could,

771
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,330
but your husband is gone.

772
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,870
I am so sorry.

773
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,030
No.

774
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,030
I am so sorry.

775
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,600
No!

776
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,600
So sorry.

777
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,870
Oh, God.

778
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,710
No.

779
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,950
Help! We need help!

780
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,950
He's been throwing up.

781
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,320
Go to the MTP

782
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,320
and get me an AGG.

783
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,690
He's bleeding! Please!

784
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,090
He has enlarged vessels

785
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,090
in his esophagus.

786
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,790
They must've torn

787
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,790
from the vomiting.

788
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,790
All right, Bruce,

789
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,790
this is gonna

790
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,790
be uncomfortable,

791
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,770
but I need you

792
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,770
to swallow for me, okay?

793
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,130
Hang on, Mr. Green.

794
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,130
This'll only take a second.

795
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,540
Have you been drinking?

796
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,540
Have you been drinking

797
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,540
this whole time?

798
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,250
Call GI. We gotta send him

799
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,250
upstairs for ligation.

800
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,850
How could you?

801
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,850
You're killing yourself!

802
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,910
Bruce, we can't stop

803
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,910
the bleeding.

804
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,720
We have to send you upstairs

805
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,720
for a procedure. Let's go!

806
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,160
This is what you get!

807
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,270
The procedure could

808
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,270
take a while.

809
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,130
I'll bring you to a room

810
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,130
where you can wait.

811
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,070
It's fine. Bastard.

812
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,700
Where's Jesse?

813
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,880
Jesse? Where is he?

814
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,470
Jesse!

815
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,140
Hank, have you seen her son?

816
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,140
Broken arm?

817
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,580
I didn't see him.

818
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,620
Where did he go?

819
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,620
Let's check the waiting room.

820
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,930
You seen a kid with a cast?

821
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,160
Yeah, he was going

822
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,160
towards the elevators.

823
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,370
Call security right now.

824
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,480
Stay there.

825
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,130
Ooh.

826
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,060
It's cold out here.

827
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,530
Leave me alone.

828
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,100
Jesse, I want you

829
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,100
to know that I really...

830
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,850
I really understand

831
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,850
how hard this all

832
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,850
is for you.

833
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,650
You've been

834
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,650
put in a really

835
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,650
tough situation.

836
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,520
I know it sucks.

837
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,060
You know I got this hunch...

838
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,660
Maybe, you didn't fall

839
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,660
out of your treehouse.

840
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,500
That maybe you jumped

841
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,500
because you just

842
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,560
wanted all the pain

843
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,560
to go away.

844
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:24,270
You didn't want to feel

845
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:24,270
all those helpless

846
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:24,270
feelings anymore.

847
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,340
I get that.

848
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,550
I think that

849
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,190
probably your dad

850
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,190
feels that way

851
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,390
when he wants to drink.

852
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,760
You might think

853
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,760
that your dad

854
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,330
acts the way he does 'cause

855
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,330
he doesn't care about you.

856
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,570
Nothing could be

857
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,570
further from the truth.

858
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,410
Your dad drinks

859
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,410
'cause he's trying

860
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,410
to get away

861
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,240
from the

862
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,240
difficult feelings,

863
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,450
and not wanting

864
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,450
to feel those feelings,

865
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,040
I mean, it's the most

866
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,040
normal thing in the world.

867
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,790
Yeah.

868
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,490
Thing is, it turns out

869
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,490
that the only way

870
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,490
to make them go away,

871
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,000
is to talk about them.

872
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,800
Yeah, talking about them,

873
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,800
it can make bad feelings

874
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,800
go away

875
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,430
and it also helps

876
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,430
you understand them better

877
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,430
if they come back.

878
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,270
You know, so

879
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,270
if you're up for it,

880
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,340
I'd be really interested

881
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,340
to talk about that stuff

882
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,340
with you, if you want.

883
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,850
I mean, think about it.

884
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,980
In the meantime,

885
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,350
what I really want to do,

886
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,350
I want to get you back inside,

887
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,410
so your mom and dad

888
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,410
know that you're safe.

889
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,360
They're really

890
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,360
worried about you.

891
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,260
You know why?

892
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,920
It's just they love you

893
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,920
so much.

894
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,510
So, what do you say?

895
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,240
Do you wanna go back inside?

896
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,860
Ms. Duncan?

897
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,190
Sharon Goodwin,

898
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,190
Director of Patient Services.

899
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,530
I wanted to return

900
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,530
your legal documents.

901
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,530
Have you heard anything?

902
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,530
Is Barbara okay?

903
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm sorry. I don't have

904
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
any news yet,

905
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,300
but could I get someone

906
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,300
to bring something for you

907
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,300
from the cafeteria?

908
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,310
A sandwich or some coffee?

909
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,110
I'm not hungry. Thank you.

910
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,280
Yeah, I'm sure

911
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,280
this isn't easy.

912
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,190
If the baby dies,

913
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,420
I don't think Barbara

914
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,420
will ever forgive me.

915
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,360
Do you have children,

916
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,360
Miss Goodwin?

917
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,400
I do, three.

918
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,400
But they're all grown.

919
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,370
With Barbara,

920
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,370
it's like having

921
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,370
a child who never grows up.

922
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
Don't get me wrong.

923
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,210
I wouldn't trade it

924
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,210
for the world.

925
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,340
It's just the possibility

926
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,340
of having another one...

927
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,480
It's a lot.

928
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,650
The baby doesn't have

929
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,650
Down syndrome, it's not that.

930
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,650
It's just...

931
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,220
I'm not 30 anymore, and...

932
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,990
You don't feel up to it.

933
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,590
So, I keep asking myself,

934
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,590
when I pushed so hard

935
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,590
for this surgery...

936
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,440
Did you do it

937
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,440
for your daughter,

938
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,440
or yourself?

939
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,170
Now, come.

940
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,340
Scalpel and DeBakeys?

941
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,340
Scalpel and DeBakeys.

942
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,550
Marty?

943
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,250
Fetal heart rate

944
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,250
is down to 115.

945
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,090
Can you get it back up?

946
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,360
Transfusing her.

947
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,360
We're down to 109.

948
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,460
103.

949
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,460
We're going to lose the fetus.

950
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,130
Where are we at on the bypass?

951
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,400
4 liters.

952
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,200
Crank it up to six.

953
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,200
Wait, what are you doing?

954
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,570
The fetus needs more blood.

955
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,110
Connor, our priority

956
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,110
is to save the patient,

957
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,110
not the fetus.

958
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,370
We can save both.

959
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,070
If you flood too much blood

960
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,070
to Barbara's brain,

961
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,550
she could have permanent

962
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,550
neurological damage.

963
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,080
It could put her into a coma.

964
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,380
Fetal heart rate's

965
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,380
down to 86.

966
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,980
Connor, it's too dangerous.

967
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,380
Dr. Rhodes?

968
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,920
It's what Barbara wants.

969
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,420
Turn the bypass up to six.

970
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,990
Curry, write some

971
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,990
admissions orders

972
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,990
for Mr. Banes in Six.

973
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,330
Okay.

974
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,290
I'm so sorry, Will...

975
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,490
For the way things

976
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,490
got between us.

977
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,330
Yeah.

978
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,300
You went through

979
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,300
something terrible,

980
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,030
and I never even asked you

981
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,030
what it was like

982
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,800
to have your life

983
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,800
in danger.

984
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,700
I can't even imagine.

985
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,190
You know, when I was

986
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,190
in that room, afraid

987
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,190
I was going to die,

988
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,390
all I could think was...

989
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,450
I'd never see you again.

990
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,680
I can't believe it.

991
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,680
My baby...

992
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,550
My baby tried

993
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,550
to kill himself.

994
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,520
We're going to keep Jesse

995
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,520
here for a few days,

996
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,680
if that's all right.

997
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,130
You know, see how he does,

998
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,130
come up with a treatment plan

999
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,130
for him.

1000
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,320
But then what?

1001
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,960
After we get home,

1002
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,960
I already missed this once.

1003
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,840
The signs aren't always

1004
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,840
so apparent. You got to

1005
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,840
take it easy on yourself.

1006
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,740
It's not like you haven't

1007
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,740
had other stuff going on.

1008
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,540
Oh, God.

1009
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,070
How do I help him?

1010
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,310
You wanna communicate

1011
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,310
with him.

1012
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,320
Talk to him, listen,

1013
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,010
have honest conversations

1014
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,010
about what's going on

1015
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,010
in your family.

1016
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,290
I think for Jesse,

1017
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,290
just knowing

1018
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,290
that you're there,

1019
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,260
it'll go a very long way.

1020
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,460
You ready?

1021
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,460
Yeah.

1022
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,770
Jesse...

1023
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,770
Hey, Mom.

1024
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,040
We're gonna

1025
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,040
get through this.

1026
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,040
I promise.

1027
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,970
Mrs. Green, we heard

1028
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,970
your husband's procedure

1029
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,970
went well.

1030
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,830
I'm leaving him.

1031
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,740
We're gonna go stay

1032
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,740
with my sister.

1033
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,740
Okay.

1034
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,810
Bruce says he'll go to rehab,

1035
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,810
that he'll stop drinking,

1036
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,370
but I cannot risk Jesse's life

1037
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,370
on the chance that he doesn't.

1038
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,320
And if he can stay sober

1039
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,320
for three months,

1040
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,420
I'll go back to him.

1041
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,670
It takes a lot of courage

1042
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,670
to make a sacrifice like that.

1043
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,330
Yeah.

1044
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,500
Maybe now,

1045
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,500
that'll finally get

1046
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,500
his attention.

1047
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,510
Let's hope so.

1048
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,320
Dr. Rhodes,

1049
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,320
she's waking up.

1050
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,580
Barbie, it's me, Mom.

1051
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,420
Barbie?

1052
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,420
Mom?

1053
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,230
Barbara, do you know

1054
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,230
where you are?

1055
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,160
Hospital?

1056
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,160
Mmm-hmm.

1057
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,490
How is my baby?

1058
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,320
Why don't we find out?

1059
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,670
Can you help me out there?

1060
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,840
All right.

1061
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,910
Good, and...

1062
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,880
there he is.

1063
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,580
Look at him.

1064
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,740
Look at his little hand.

1065
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,990
Mom, isn't he cute?

1066
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,430
He's beautiful. We're going

1067
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,430
to have a beautiful baby.

1068
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,910
Looks like the fever's

1069
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,910
starting to break.

1070
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,540
He should be

1071
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,540
off ECMO soon.

1072
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,650
Good.

1073
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,860
Have a good night.

1074
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,860
Will?

1075
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,470
I want you

1076
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,470
to come back home.

1077
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,900
To me.

1078
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,740
You do?

1079
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,980
The thing is, you have

1080
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,980
to get rid of your gun.

1081
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,080
I'm sorry, but that's just

1082
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,080
how it has to be.

1083
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,050
Okay.

1084
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,350
I'll take it to

1085
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,350
the police station tonight,

1086
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,350
and turn it in.

1087
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,210
April.

1088
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,210
Have a good night.

1089
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,910
April... April.

1090
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,910
We should talk

1091
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,910
about that kiss.

1092
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,510
I'm sorry that happened.

1093
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,510
I know you're with Vicki now.

1094
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,420
There's nothing for us

1095
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,420
to talk about.

1096
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,890
I cannot believe that

1097
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,890
you are even considering

1098
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,960
taking your father's word

1099
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,960
over mine.

1100
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,100
Ava, every step of the way,

1101
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,100
you have lied to me.

1102
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,800
About going to my dad, about

1103
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,800
knowing that he cut the check.

1104
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,070
How am I supposed to believe

1105
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,070
anything that you have to say?

1106
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,840
Because I care about you,

1107
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,520
and he doesn't!

1108
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,480
He never has.

1109
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,990
Your whole life, he's tried

1110
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,990
to keep you under his thumb.

1111
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,390
He's attempted to undermine

1112
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,390
everything you do.

1113
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,500
He's trying to drive a wedge

1114
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,500
between us.

1115
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,160
He said that

1116
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,160
he liked your perfume.

1117
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,890
That it smelled

1118
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,890
like lilacs. It does.

1119
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,910
So, what? I was standing

1120
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,910
over him.

1121
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,970
I was showing him

1122
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,970
the prospectus.

1123
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,970
That doesn't mean anything.

1124
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,470
"The ends justify the means."

1125
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,780
Those were your words.

1126
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,110
Connor,

1127
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,950
I did not sleep

1128
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,950
with your father.

1129
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,980
I wish I could believe you.

1130
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,330
Daniel, it's late.

1131
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,330
You still doing notes?

1132
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,410
Yeah, just cleaning

1133
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,410
a couple of things up.

1134
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,110
What are you doing?

1135
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,480
Nothing. What are you doing?

1136
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,280
Let me see.

1137
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,280
A dating profile? Really?

1138
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,750
I thought you didn't

1139
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,750
trust algorithms.

1140
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,320
I don't.

1141
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,860
You're just scared.

1142
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,620
I am.

1143
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,490
So, what changed?

1144
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,090
I don't know.

1145
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,570
I witnessed this real act

1146
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,570
of courage today,

1147
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,430
love even.

1148
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,100
Maybe it made me

1149
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,100
a little braver.

1150
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,000
What can I say?

1151
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,000
Hope springs eternal.

1152
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,570
"Tell us about yourself."

1153
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,570
What am I supposed to say?

1154
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,870
"Jazz, walks on the beach"?

1155
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,640
You don't like jazz.

1156
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,640
You like hip-hop.

1157
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,480
I like everything.

1158
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,480
Come on.

1159
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,270
I got all night.

1160
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,270
