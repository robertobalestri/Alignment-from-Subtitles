1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,040
Jay. Red eye, triple espresso.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,040
Thank you.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,930
Man, you're gonna be wired

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,930
till Thursday

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,930
with that much caffeine.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,530
This is not for me.

7
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,530
You need all the energy

8
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,530
you can get for tonight.

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,110
Should've seen that coming.

10
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,910
You know, you and Nat are very

11
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,910
lucky that I'm letting you

12
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,680
have a joint

13
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,680
bachelor-bachelorette party.

14
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,880
So, what do you want

15
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,880
to talk about?

16
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,440
'Cause I got some other

17
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,440
surprises I got to set up

18
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,440
for tonight.

19
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,850
All right,

20
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,850
what am I looking at?

21
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,550
The EKG I got of Ray's heart

22
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,550
when I was planting the bug.

23
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,830
Okay. So?

24
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,830
It's abnormal.

25
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,650
I need to bring him

26
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,650
to the hospital.

27
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,100
Run some tests...

28
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,100
Whoa, whoa.

29
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,260
You are not actually

30
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,260
his doctor,

31
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,260
you know that, right?

32
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,160
Jay, come on.

33
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,160
You did your part.

34
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,230
Now lay low until Agent Lee

35
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,230
says otherwise. That's it.

36
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,340
Ricky. Irish whiskey and Oban.

37
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,340
Yeah, only the finest.

38
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,400
I'll see you tonight.

39
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,270
Ah!

40
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,880
Hello.

41
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,050
Can I help you with something?

42
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,490
No, Maggie. Please.

43
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,490
Oh! Yes. Hey, Will.

44
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,060
Can you tell your fiancÃ©

45
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,060
to stop being a killjoy?

46
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,320
Huh?

47
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,320
She's got

48
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,320
to wear this, tonight.

49
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,200
Maggie, I would like

50
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,200
to maintain

51
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,200
a little bit of dignity.

52
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,390
You're wearing it.

53
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,390
This one's nonnegotiable.

54
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,360
Hey, you two, you're up.

55
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,070
Ambo's pulling in

56
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,070
with a car crash.

57
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,310
How many victims?

58
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,310
Driver and passenger.

59
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,500
Trauma Two.

60
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,500
Got it.

61
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,010
Daria Carson.

62
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,010
29-year-old female,

63
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,010
restrained passenger.

64
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,480
Driver lost control

65
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,480
of the wheel

66
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,480
and went into the guardrail.

67
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,580
GCS 15. Vitals stable.

68
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,580
Refused board and collar.

69
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,280
Where's the driver?

70
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,280
Her husband, Adam.

71
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,050
Wouldn't let us check him out.

72
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,050
I'm fine, really.

73
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,060
Just take care of my wife,

74
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,060
please. I'm right here, honey.

75
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,650
All right,

76
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,650
let's transfer on my count.

77
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,600
Ready? One, two, three.

78
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,100
Thanks, guys.

79
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,100
Yup.

80
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
Breath sounds are normal.

81
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,470
Periorbital bruising.

82
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,150
Battle sign

83
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,150
over the right mastoid.

84
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,150
Possible skull fracture.

85
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,910
Hey, why don't we go next door

86
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,910
so I can examine you?

87
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,580
I want to stay with my wife.

88
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,710
We're new, new to be married.

89
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,050
Newlyweds.

90
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,050
Congratulations.

91
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,290
Still working on the English.

92
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,290
Sounds pretty good to me.

93
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,030
At least let me check

94
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,030
your blood pressure.

95
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,030
We can do it right here.

96
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,570
All right, let me know if you

97
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,570
feel any pain or discomfort,

98
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,570
okay?

99
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,770
Does it hurt right there?

100
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,770
No, it doesn't hurt.

101
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,970
Let me take a look.

102
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,300
It's from crash.

103
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,300
Geez, babe.

104
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,640
You really slammed that dash,

105
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,640
didn't you?

106
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,720
Your blood pressure's

107
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,720
a little high.

108
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,450
It's just the adrenaline.

109
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,990
Let's get a chest x-ray

110
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,820
and then send her over

111
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,820
for a CT head

112
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,820
with a four vessel angio

113
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,260
for her neck

114
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,260
as well as her chest,

115
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,260
abdomen and pelvis, okay?

116
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,590
We'll be right back.

117
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,290
Hey, Adam, if you feel

118
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,290
lightheaded at all...

119
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,130
I know where to find you,

120
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,130
Doc, thanks.

121
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,970
That guy worships her.

122
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,970
Won't leave her side.

123
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,510
Yeah, I don't think that's it.

124
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,310
The contusions on her torso,

125
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,310
they're old.

126
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,780
They're not from the crash,

127
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,410
and the one on her side

128
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,410
looks like the tread

129
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,410
of a boot.

130
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,720
Son of a bitch.

131
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,300
Let me guess, unicorn.

132
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,300
Nope, cotton candy.

133
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,460
Oh?

134
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,030
My mom made it, actually.

135
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,050
Ten bags of cotton,

136
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,050
hand-painted

137
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,050
and sewn to a leotard.

138
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,950
Impressive.

139
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,950
That is quite a labor of love.

140
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,210
I always lacked imagination

141
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,210
in that department.

142
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,620
Pretty sure I was sheriff

143
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,620
all of elementary school.

144
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,610
Mr. and Mrs. Phillips,

145
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,320
Gabby appears to have

146
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,320
some swelling

147
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,320
in her lower legs as well.

148
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,160
She's been eating vegetarian.

149
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,160
Latest fad at school.

150
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,160
Could it be her diet?

151
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,160
I don't think so.

152
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,200
The swelling,

153
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,200
paired with vomiting

154
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,200
and jaundice

155
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,230
makes me think this may be

156
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,230
a liver issue.

157
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,890
Ultrasound?

158
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,700
Gabby, mind if we take

159
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,700
a closer look?

160
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,470
We just assumed

161
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,470
it was a stomach bug.

162
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,640
We would've brought her in

163
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,640
sooner if we thought

164
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,640
it could be serious.

165
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,770
Let's take a look.

166
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,880
Gallbladder looks normal.

167
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,990
But her liver is nodular.

168
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,990
Looks cirrhotic.

169
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,930
Cirrhosis? Isn't that

170
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,930
from drinking?

171
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,150
I don't drink.

172
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,960
Gabby's never even

173
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,960
tasted alcohol.

174
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,790
Cirrhosis just means there's

175
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,790
scar tissue in her liver,

176
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,200
so there are plenty of other

177
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,200
causes besides alcohol.

178
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,200
We'll run some tests

179
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,200
to help us narrow things down.

180
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,710
April, CBC, CMP, LFT,

181
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,710
CT abdomen and pelvis,

182
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,510
and give her 4 milligrams

183
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,510
of Zofran

184
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,510
and 1 liter saline IV.

185
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,510
Got it.

186
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,510
But I was supposed to set up

187
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,600
for my Halloween dance

188
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,600
tonight.

189
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,910
I have to be there.

190
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,180
Hey, worse comes to worst,

191
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,050
Dad will drop off

192
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,050
the decorations for you,

193
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,050
honey, okay?

194
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,950
We'll let you know

195
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,950
as soon as the results are in.

196
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,860
Could you give us a moment?

197
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,860
Thanks.

198
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,860
All right.

199
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,100
I go inside?

200
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,100
Yes, soon.

201
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,900
I wanted to speak

202
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,900
with you first.

203
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,870
The bruises on your body,

204
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,810
they're not all

205
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,810
from the accident, are they?

206
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,610
Is someone hurting you?

207
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,710
No.

208
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,710
Is your husband hurting you?

209
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,420
As your doctor,

210
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,420
whatever you say

211
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,420
to me stays between us.

212
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,690
He won't know.

213
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,860
We meet online.

214
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,960
When Adam comes to Ukraine

215
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,960
to see me,

216
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,400
he's gentleman,

217
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,400
handsome, kind.

218
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,700
I fall in love.

219
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,770
How did you end up

220
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,770
in the States?

221
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,310
A year ago, there is

222
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,310
trouble for my family.

223
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,720
I must leave.

224
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,820
Adam brings me here

225
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,820
on visa to marry,

226
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,120
but when I come,

227
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,120
he's a different man.

228
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,490
Everything I do, he get mad.

229
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,460
Today, in car, I say something

230
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,460
he doesn't like and...

231
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,000
That's why the car went

232
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,000
into the rail.

233
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,840
Daria, we can report this

234
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,840
to the police.

235
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,910
No, no. No police.

236
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,650
Adam, he kill me.

237
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,580
There are shelters

238
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,580
you can stay at.

239
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,780
No, I cannot leave him.

240
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,780
He will send me back,

241
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,780
no papers.

242
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,650
Deport you?

243
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,650
But you're married.

244
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,050
He never files

245
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,050
for my green card.

246
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,500
He says I'm a bad wife.

247
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,830
You say I can trust you.

248
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,830
Yes, you can trust me.

249
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,010
Please, no police. I beg you.

250
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,520
She still visiting Bernie

251
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,520
every day?

252
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,420
Yeah. How can she stay

253
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,420
with him?

254
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,760
He lied to her

255
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,760
about being married.

256
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,730
Come on, don't tell me

257
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,730
you approve of this.

258
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,230
It doesn't matter

259
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,230
what I or you think.

260
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,230
It's Emily's call to make.

261
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,290
I tried talking some sense

262
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,290
into her.

263
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,290
Now somehow I'm the bad guy.

264
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,340
He's the father

265
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,340
of her child, Ethan.

266
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,500
Yeah, and?

267
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,070
So it's not insane for her

268
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,070
to want at least try

269
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,070
to make it work.

270
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,550
And why can't she leave him?

271
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,110
Well, Daria didn't go

272
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,110
into detail,

273
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,210
but I gather being deported

274
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,210
would put her life in danger.

275
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,620
Yeah, a fear Adam is clearly

276
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,620
preying on.

277
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,220
Well, it's not uncommon.

278
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,490
Abusive spouses using

279
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,490
the victim's

280
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,490
immigration status

281
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,220
to control or manipulate.

282
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,890
If she isn't legal,

283
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,890
she's likely financially

284
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,890
dependent on him, too.

285
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,490
He won't even let her

286
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,490
leave the house.

287
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,060
Yeah, the prick

288
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,060
has her trapped.

289
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,530
Let me talk

290
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,530
to an immigration attorney,

291
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,300
see if we can't find a way out

292
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,300
for Mrs. Carson.

293
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,370
Thank you.

294
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,970
Dr. Choi,

295
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,970
Gabby's been short of breath

296
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,970
for the last few minutes.

297
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,140
Sats are at 91.

298
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,140
April, let's get her

299
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,140
on oxygen.

300
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,210
Is there any news?

301
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,020
That's what I came

302
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,020
to speak to you about. Please.

303
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,060
Gabby's CT did in fact

304
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,060
show cirrhosis,

305
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,060
and her labs, I'm afraid,

306
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,060
are consistent

307
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,060
with liver failure.

308
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,830
Oh, my God.

309
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,830
What? How could that be?

310
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,030
I have a theory, but I'd like

311
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,030
to do a quick exam to confirm.

312
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,260
Excuse me.

313
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,470
Hey, Gabby.

314
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,470
Can you look

315
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,470
in the light for me?

316
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,740
There.

317
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,980
See the golden color

318
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,980
around her pupils?

319
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,250
Those are called

320
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,250
Kayser-Fleischer rings.

321
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
They're a sign

322
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
of Wilson's disease.

323
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,180
What is that?

324
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,180
Well,

325
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,390
when our bodies

326
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,390
consume copper,

327
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,620
our livers get rid

328
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,620
of the excess.

329
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,030
But with Wilson's,

330
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,660
the copper's improperly

331
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,660
eliminated so it builds up

332
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,660
in our vital organs.

333
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,760
It's a hereditary disorder.

334
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,270
Any family history

335
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,270
on either side?

336
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,270
No.

337
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,270
I'm not sure.

338
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,200
No. No.

339
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,070
Can we step outside

340
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,070
for a moment?

341
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,080
I'll keep Gabby company.

342
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,080
Thanks.

343
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,550
Right now,

344
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,550
we're going to start Gabby

345
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,550
on plasmapheresis

346
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,250
to remove the copper

347
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,250
from her blood,

348
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,950
but ultimately,

349
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,950
she will need

350
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,950
a liver transplant.

351
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,060
Well, can we donate?

352
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,060
Is that possible?

353
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,070
Yes, because

354
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,070
the liver regenerates,

355
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,660
it's possible

356
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,660
to donate a segment.

357
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,140
We just need a test to see if

358
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,140
either of you are a match.

359
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,140
Can friends and family get

360
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,140
tested as well?

361
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,400
The wider the net, the better.

362
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,340
Good, we'll reach out

363
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,340
to everyone we know.

364
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,970
In the meantime, we'll set you

365
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,970
both up to get evaluated.

366
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,670
Thank you.

367
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,760
Yes! So cute!

368
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,160
Who are you guys

369
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,160
supposed to be?

370
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,030
"The Pink Ladies."

371
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,030
Yes!

372
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,090
Who are they?

373
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,760
What?

374
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,230
Dr. Lanik, I changed

375
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,230
the dressing on the patient

376
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,230
in Treatment Six,

377
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,180
and found the journal articles

378
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,180
you requested,

379
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,180
and here's your latte.

380
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,470
Wow.

381
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,410
You know, I'm all about

382
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,410
giving the med students

383
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,410
the occasional scutwork,

384
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,650
but having them

385
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,650
fetch you coffee,

386
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,650
that's classy.

387
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,620
He wanted to.

388
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,620
Rising star, that kid.

389
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,620
Real pleaser.

390
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,280
Dr. Rhodes.

391
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,220
Dr. Bekker.

392
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,220
What's on tap for you today?

393
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,220
Back to back CABG's.

394
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,530
You got time for lunch later?

395
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,530
I'll see

396
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,530
if I can squeeze you in.

397
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,710
Need some help over here.

398
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,930
Terry, come and help!

399
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,700
Dr. Rhodes,

400
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,700
you're going to Baghdad!

401
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,870
What happened?

402
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,040
Working a job

403
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,040
a couple blocks away.

404
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,410
Piece of sheet metal

405
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,410
fell on Mitch.

406
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,640
Ripped his leg open.

407
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,620
The blood,

408
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,620
never seen anything like it.

409
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,280
All right, Maggie, tag in.

410
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,280
We might have to move

411
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,280
to the hybrid OR.

412
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,380
I got you.

413
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,380
Pupils are sluggish.

414
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,690
Pulse is thready.

415
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,690
Maggie, get an IV in,

416
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,690
trigger the MTP.

417
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,750
I'm on it.

418
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,190
Large laceration

419
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,190
through the muscle.

420
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,190
Femoral artery's severed.

421
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,790
Prognosis?

422
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,790
Trauma to the femoral artery

423
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,460
can cause massive

424
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,460
and rapid blood loss.

425
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,970
Bad. Prognosis is bad.

426
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,530
Breath sounds are weak.

427
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,530
I'm gonna intubate.

428
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,130
Give me a laryngoscope.

429
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,130
On it.

430
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,970
I can get a 22 in the hand.

431
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,940
That'll have to do.

432
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,940
100 of sux, 20 of etomidate.

433
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,200
Lanik, get

434
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,200
an eight French line

435
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,200
in the groin.

436
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,710
Terry, you're up.

437
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,650
A central line?

438
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,650
I've only done practice runs.

439
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,910
Then you're ready. Get to it.

440
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,750
Beats scutwork, right?

441
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,820
I can't see the cords.

442
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,820
Guy's really anterior.

443
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,720
Maggie, cricoid pressure.

444
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,720
Yep, got it.

445
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,860
Come on, hurry up.

446
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,860
Get the catheter

447
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,860
and the dilator over the wire.

448
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,130
BP's dropping.

449
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,130
Lanik, step in.

450
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,140
Come on, Terry. Guy's dying.

451
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,160
The guy needs blood.

452
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,160
Lanik, step in or I will.

453
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,600
I'm in, bag him.

454
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,570
Done. I got it.

455
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,090
Why is there so much blood?

456
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,090
What happened?

457
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,750
Damn it. You missed the vein.

458
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,750
You went into the artery.

459
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,090
All right,

460
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,090
we can't use that line.

461
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,090
Give me a kit.

462
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,090
I've got to get a line

463
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,090
in the subclavian.

464
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,330
I'm sorry.

465
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,330
I was having trouble

466
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,330
finding my landmarks.

467
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Everything was moving so fast.

468
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I...

469
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,310
Well, next time we'll just ask

470
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,310
the guy to stop dying

471
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,310
so you can catch up.

472
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,080
All right.

473
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,080
Let's get the blood going.

474
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,740
Move him over

475
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,740
to the hybrid OR.

476
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,740
We'll shunt the leg there.

477
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,280
You heard the man.

478
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,280
Let's get ready to travel.

479
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,420
Hey, results are back

480
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,420
for Gabby's dad.

481
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,420
They couldn't test her mom.

482
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,290
How come?

483
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,290
Preexisting condition?

484
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,290
Lupus.

485
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,030
Dad?

486
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,030
Unfortunately,

487
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,030
he's not a match.

488
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,060
John's blood type is AB.

489
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,060
Gabby's type O.

490
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,900
He can't be

491
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,900
her biological father.

492
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,940
Remember how Jeanette changed

493
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,940
her answer

494
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,810
when I asked them

495
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,810
about their family history?

496
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,310
John probably has no idea.

497
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,110
I'm going to pull in

498
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,110
Dr. Charles.

499
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,220
The radiologist just read

500
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,220
Daria's scans.

501
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,130
So, you see that blip,

502
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,130
right there?

503
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,290
That's called

504
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,290
a pseudoaneurysm.

505
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,820
The impact from the crash

506
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,820
tore the vessel,

507
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,630
and now there's

508
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,630
a small blood clot

509
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,630
is covering the hole.

510
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,400
If it ruptures, it could cause

511
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,400
a life-threatening bleed.

512
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,600
So what's the treatment?

513
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,160
We'll put you on medication

514
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,160
to keep

515
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,160
your blood pressure low,

516
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,140
and we'll monitor you

517
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,140
for the next 24-48 hours.

518
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,770
I'm here, too, you know.

519
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,010
Then we'll

520
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,010
start anticoagulants

521
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,010
and reimage you.

522
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
If your condition worsens,

523
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,280
we will need

524
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,280
to perform surgery.

525
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,980
In the interim,

526
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,980
it is very important

527
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,980
that we keep Daria calm.

528
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,220
Any stress or agitation

529
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,220
could spike her blood pressure

530
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,420
and cause the pseudoaneurysm

531
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,420
to rupture.

532
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,490
We'll need to restrict

533
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,490
all visitors.

534
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,760
You don't mean me.

535
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,760
Yes, actually we do.

536
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,100
I hope you understand.

537
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,960
She'll get nervous

538
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,960
if I'm not here.

539
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,470
Babe, you don't want me

540
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,470
to leave.

541
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,500
I'll stay.

542
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,940
Your wife needs rest.

543
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,340
Hey, man, do you have a

544
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,340
problem with me?

545
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,240
No, Mr. Carson.

546
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,010
Once a room opens up,

547
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,010
we'll move you upstairs.

548
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,710
Thank you.

549
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,350
Will.

550
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,590
Give me three minutes alone

551
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,590
with that guy.

552
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,430
If we show him our cards,

553
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,430
he'll suspect we're onto him.

554
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,440
It'll put Daria

555
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,440
at even greater risk.

556
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,830
Be smart about this.

557
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,080
So, if John's not a match

558
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,080
and I can't donate, what now?

559
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,510
Ms. Phillips,

560
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,510
it is not at all our intention

561
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,020
to pry

562
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,020
into your private affairs,

563
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,020
but at the same time

564
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,250
it's important to us to give

565
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,250
your daughter

566
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,250
the best care possible.

567
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,950
Okay.

568
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,480
And in reviewing you

569
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,480
and your husband's

570
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,480
test results,

571
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,090
it became evident that John

572
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,090
is not Gabby's

573
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,090
biological father.

574
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,330
And we wanted to meet with you

575
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,330
in private because we

576
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,330
weren't sure that John knew.

577
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,340
No, no.

578
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,340
It's not what you think.

579
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,440
Gabby's adopted.

580
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,870
When I asked

581
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,870
about your family history,

582
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,870
you didn't...

583
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,570
No, we didn't want to say

584
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,570
anything in front of Gabby.

585
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,940
She doesn't know.

586
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,950
Mrs. Phillips,

587
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,950
I know it's a stretch,

588
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,150
but if we could locate any

589
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,150
of Gabby's blood relatives...

590
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,020
That's not possible.

591
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,550
Gabby was a ward of the state

592
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,550
when we adopted her.

593
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,460
Her biological parents

594
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,460
were deceased and she had

595
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,460
no other known relatives.

596
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,190
Well, in that case,

597
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,190
we'll want to get Gabby

598
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,030
onto the transplant list

599
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,030
right away.

600
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,540
Okay. Thank you.

601
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,840
Artery shunted.

602
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,040
Clamps are off.

603
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,850
Let's get him up to the ICU

604
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,850
to rewarm and resuscitate.

605
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,550
What about the line

606
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,550
in his artery?

607
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,240
Don't you need to pull it out?

608
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,260
So we can watch him bleed out?

609
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,290
We can't do that right now.

610
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,290
He's too cold

611
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,290
and coagulopathic.

612
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,350
We'll fix it when his pressure

613
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,350
and clotting are better.

614
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,100
Where do you get off

615
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,100
treating him like that?

616
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,430
What happened

617
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,430
was your responsibility.

618
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,800
I didn't stick

619
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,800
that guy's artery.

620
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,140
You were supposed

621
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,140
to be supervising.

622
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,770
Look, the only way they learn

623
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,770
is under pressure.

624
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,780
Not when it endangers

625
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,780
my patient.

626
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,680
Look, would you just relax?

627
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,680
You got your line in.

628
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,540
Disaster was averted.

629
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,540
No harm, no foul.

630
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,950
If you ever pull something

631
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,950
like that again...

632
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,610
Hey, you might've been

633
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,610
the golden boy up in CT,

634
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,610
but down here I'm in charge.

635
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,520
And I will supervise

636
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,520
my med students

637
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,520
in whatever way I see fit.

638
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,700
Glad to see you found

639
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,700
a new sparring partner

640
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,700
down here.

641
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,030
Would hate to see you getting

642
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,030
rusty in my absence.

643
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,730
That guy is an egomaniac.

644
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,240
Well, takes one to know one,

645
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,240
right?

646
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,700
Come on. Buy you lunch?

647
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,700
Yeah.

648
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,680
Dr. Charles?

649
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,240
Hey, I was wondering,

650
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,240
how long does Gabby have to be

651
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,910
on the transplant list

652
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,910
before she gets a new liver?

653
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,250
Please, just level with me.

654
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,660
I'm afraid I can't give you

655
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,660
a definitive answer.

656
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,160
It can take days. Weeks.

657
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,760
Sometimes, honestly,

658
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,760
even years.

659
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,460
Years?

660
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,460
Well, unfortunately,

661
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,590
demand vastly

662
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,590
outweighs supply.

663
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,260
It's why living donor

664
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,260
transplantation was developed.

665
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,340
It's not possible

666
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,340
for a drug addict to donate,

667
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,340
is it?

668
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,510
A drug addict?

669
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,510
Honey.

670
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,010
I got you a coffee.

671
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,010
Thank you.

672
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,580
Any word from Paula?

673
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,580
No, she can't...

674
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,890
She's having a seizure.

675
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,890
5 of Ativan IV.

676
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,950
Gabby.

677
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,090
Let's get a brain CT,

678
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,090
just to make sure

679
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,090
there are no bleeds.

680
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,650
Bleeding in the brain?

681
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,650
What are you talking...

682
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,290
It's just a precaution.

683
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,290
Here, let's let them

684
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,290
do their job.

685
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,530
John?

686
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,530
Ativan's in.

687
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,970
Okay, okay.

688
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,970
Easy.

689
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,620
You know, some people

690
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,620
have this great knack

691
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,130
for hearing cardiac murmurs

692
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,130
or palpating a pulse.

693
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,290
But no one picks up a scalpel

694
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,290
and instinctively knows

695
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,290
how to open a chest.

696
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,270
Procedures take practice

697
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,270
and repetition.

698
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,670
You'll get better with time.

699
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,900
But what if I don't?

700
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,940
Maybe this was a mistake.

701
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,810
What was a mistake?

702
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,810
Med school.

703
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,940
I gave up an NFL contract

704
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,940
to come here.

705
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,820
Could've paid off

706
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,820
my mom's mortgage,

707
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,820
put my little brother

708
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,820
through school.

709
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,920
My family relies on me

710
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,920
financially, if I fail out...

711
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,950
Whoa, you are getting

712
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,950
way ahead of yourself.

713
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,860
You keep at this,

714
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,860
you'll get better.

715
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,790
Now do it again.

716
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,910
Get a grip on yourself

717
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,910
or it'll be Gabby who suffers.

718
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,150
Dr. Charles, my wife...

719
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,490
This whole thing

720
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,490
has been really hard on her.

721
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,860
She and Gabby haven't spent

722
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,860
more than a night apart

723
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,860
since the day we adopted her.

724
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,400
I imagine it's incredibly hard

725
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,400
on both of you. Right?

726
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,330
I mean, the stress,

727
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,330
emotion's gonna run high.

728
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,170
We all say things,

729
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,170
do things we regret. Right?

730
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,630
Look, not for nothing,

731
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,630
I'm here.

732
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,270
You want to talk

733
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,270
about anything?

734
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,710
Anything at all?

735
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,710
No, you know what?

736
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,950
You make a good point.

737
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,950
I should find Jeanette.

738
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,820
I owe her an apology.

739
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,450
Any word on Gabby's CT?

740
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,460
It was negative.

741
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,460
Oh! That's good.

742
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,920
Look, I've been thinking.

743
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,100
Why don't we see if we

744
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,100
can get a look

745
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,100
at Gabby's adoption records?

746
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,870
Sometimes courts will unseal

747
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,870
them in the case of imminent

748
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,870
medical need.

749
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,070
But didn't the parents say

750
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,070
Gabby's a ward of the state

751
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,070
with no surviving relatives?

752
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,770
Yeah, but at this point,

753
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,080
I'm pretty sure

754
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,080
there's something

755
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,080
they're not telling us.

756
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,480
I'll make the call.

757
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,460
I spoke

758
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,460
with the immigration attorney.

759
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,960
Under provisions

760
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,960
in the Violence

761
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,960
Against Women Act,

762
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,520
battered immigrant spouses

763
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,520
can self-petition

764
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,520
for legal residency.

765
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,830
Without their

766
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,830
spouse's knowledge?

767
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,270
Yes, and if Mrs. Carson's

768
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,270
petition is approved,

769
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,070
she'll be eligible to work

770
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,070
in the U.S.

771
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,900
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

772
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,900
I'll go speak with Daria.

773
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,960
All right.

774
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,840
Where's Adam?

775
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,850
He goes for food,

776
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,850
but he comes back soon.

777
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,470
I only need a second.

778
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,420
Daria, there is a way

779
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,420
for you to stay

780
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,420
in this country

781
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,580
without Adam's help.

782
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,060
You can even get a work visa.

783
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,220
But if Adam finds out...

784
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,220
That's the thing.

785
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,730
He won't find out.

786
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,290
Dr. Manning.

787
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,000
I was just checking on Daria.

788
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,460
You know, I was thinking,

789
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,510
if we're just going to watch

790
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,510
and wait,

791
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,510
we may as well go home.

792
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,040
You'd be more

793
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,040
comfortable there.

794
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,040
Right, babe?

795
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,400
Babe?

796
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,400
Mr. Carson,

797
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,350
I don't think you understand

798
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,350
the gravity

799
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,350
of your wife's situation.

800
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,150
We're not just watching

801
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,150
and waiting.

802
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,020
It is imperative that Daria

803
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,020
remain in the hospital.

804
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,720
That's your opinion.

805
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,190
Yes, my medical opinion.

806
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,160
What's going on here?

807
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,160
We'd like to be discharged.

808
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,760
No. That would be

809
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,760
against medical advice.

810
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,770
So we've been told. It's fine.

811
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,570
Well, that's not up to you.

812
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,570
That's the patient's decision.

813
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,540
Tell them you want to leave.

814
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,470
Daria, you do realize that

815
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,470
if you leave the hospital

816
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,470
in your condition,

817
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,640
you will be exposing yourself

818
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,640
to significant health risks?

819
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,710
Yes. I want to go. Please.

820
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,080
Okay, then.

821
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,320
We'll get

822
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,320
the paperwork started.

823
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,830
Goodwin found Daria

824
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,830
a legal fix

825
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,830
for the long-term,

826
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,600
but if she walks out the door

827
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,600
with him...

828
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,540
It won't matter.

829
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,540
Next time he hits her,

830
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,540
it'll kill her.

831
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,070
Hey, got your page.

832
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,070
Hey.

833
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,620
Just heard back.

834
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,620
We can't get

835
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,620
Gabby's adoption records.

836
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,740
Why not?

837
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,740
Because they don't exist.

838
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,290
Okay, so the state

839
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,290
made a clerical error,

840
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,020
or they lost

841
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,020
our adoption record.

842
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,120
I fail to understand

843
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,120
how this is our fault.

844
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,920
No one was blaming you.

845
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,920
Then what were you doing

846
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,520
going behind our backs

847
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,520
without our consent

848
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,520
in the first place?

849
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
Mr. Phillips, please,

850
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
just try to stay calm.

851
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,870
Jeanette, you asked me before

852
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,870
if an addict can donate.

853
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,200
Leave my wife alone!

854
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,440
I need you to know

855
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,440
that if they're clean now,

856
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,440
they very well could.

857
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,970
Really?

858
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,170
I know how much

859
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,170
you both love your daughter.

860
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,490
But if you're withholding

861
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,490
information that could help us

862
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,490
save her life,

863
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,310
now is absolutely the time

864
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,310
to tell us.

865
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,790
We had to do something,

866
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,790
we couldn't just

867
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,790
leave her there.

868
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,130
Gabby was just a baby.

869
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,130
She wasn't even a year old.

870
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:37,710
And she'd leave her out

871
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:37,710
in the hallway for hours

872
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:37,710
in this ratty old bassinet.

873
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,840
We could hear her wailing

874
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,840
from our apartment.

875
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,910
Who would leave her?

876
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,880
That woman. The mother.

877
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,630
She was inside getting high,

878
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,630
getting strung out

879
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,630
on who knows what.

880
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,460
We were just going to take her

881
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,460
up to our apartment

882
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,460
for a night, I swear.

883
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,230
Give her a bath, get her fed.

884
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,070
Wait, you kidnapped her?

885
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,110
No, it's not like that.

886
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,070
We had to save her.

887
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,150
I'm sorry, but you know

888
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,150
we have to report this.

889
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,390
We know.

890
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,420
Look, could we have a moment

891
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,420
with Gabby?

892
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,630
To try to explain?

893
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,930
Of course.

894
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,930
I'm sorry.

895
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,570
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

896
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,370
It's okay.

897
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,970
It's going to be okay.

898
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,680
What's going on?

899
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,680
Pressure just dropped.

900
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,480
No pulse. He's in V-fib.

901
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,920
What happened?

902
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,920
Why did he arrest?

903
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,680
Don't know yet.

904
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,680
What were his last labs?

905
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,750
PH was 7.1, but we've been

906
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,750
correcting it.

907
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,720
Take over. Charge to 200.

908
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,160
Charging.

909
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,320
Clear.

910
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,130
Lab just called

911
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,130
with a critical value.

912
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,130
Potassium is 9.

913
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,540
All right, two amps of bicarb,

914
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,540
amp of D50,

915
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,010
and charge to 200 again.

916
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,010
Got it.

917
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,440
Why the hell's his potassium

918
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,440
so high?

919
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,780
Bicarb's in.

920
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,780
Clear.

921
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,380
He's back to sinus rhythm.

922
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,760
Well, your shunt

923
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,760
must have failed.

924
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,990
There's no bleeding.

925
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,120
Strong pulse

926
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,120
in the right foot.

927
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,890
Damn it.

928
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,070
No pulse in the left foot.

929
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,730
Compartments are hard

930
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,730
as a rock.

931
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,100
The line in the artery

932
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,100
must've thrombosed the leg.

933
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,940
The line I put in.

934
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,310
The muscle's dying,

935
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,310
dumping potassium

936
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,310
into the bloodstream.

937
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,080
The leg's gotta go.

938
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,150
You're going to amputate

939
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,150
his good leg?

940
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,680
We don't have a choice.

941
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,700
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

942
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,700
What are you doing?

943
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,700
I've got to book an OR.

944
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,130
No, I mean what are you doing,

945
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,130
sawing off this guy's leg?

946
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,730
It's going to keep dumping

947
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,730
potassium and stopping

948
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,730
his heart.

949
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,930
Even if you take off the leg

950
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,930
and he stops arresting,

951
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,910
he's never waking up.

952
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,910
You don't know that.

953
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,000
His pupils were sluggish

954
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,000
when he got here.

955
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,910
He'd already lost

956
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,910
a massive amount of blood.

957
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,950
You're saying he suffered

958
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,950
an anoxic injury in the field?

959
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,180
Of course, he did.

960
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,180
The guy was a goner

961
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,180
when he got here.

962
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,850
He's on his way to brain death

963
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,850
no matter what we do.

964
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,850
Unbelievable.

965
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,730
You're worried that he might

966
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,730
just pull through, aren't you?

967
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,260
You're reaching.

968
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,260
No way he's pulling through.

969
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,490
That's what

970
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,490
you're counting on, right?

971
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,900
That he dies?

972
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,900
What do you mean?

973
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,000
Dr. Lanik is worried about

974
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,000
a malpractice suit.

975
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,030
The patient survives,

976
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,030
he's accountable.

977
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,740
Guy wakes up,

978
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,740
he's going to wonder why we

979
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,740
amputated his good leg, right?

980
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,380
You're a coward.

981
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,380
Get over yourself.

982
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,650
All you're doing is

983
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,650
rearranging deck chairs

984
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,650
on the Titanic.

985
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,950
As long as this guy

986
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,950
has a fighting chance,

987
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,390
I am going to do

988
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,390
everything I can to save him.

989
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,360
The leg comes off.

990
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,560
You know,

991
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,560
it's not just my neck

992
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,560
on the chopping block.

993
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,620
He put the line in.

994
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,370
So if I take a hit,

995
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,370
you can be sure as hell

996
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,370
the kid goes down, too.

997
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,210
Mr. Carson?

998
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,110
What? More paperwork

999
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,110
for me to fill out?

1000
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,950
Given the high risk associated

1001
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,950
with discharging Daria...

1002
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,290
The hospital's

1003
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,290
Ethics Committee is convening

1004
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,290
an emergency meeting.

1005
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,380
You got to be kidding me.

1006
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,360
I know my rights.

1007
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,360
You can't keep us here

1008
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,360
against our will.

1009
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,930
Dr. Manning, Dr. Halstead.

1010
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,930
I need you. It's Daria.

1011
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,070
No pulse.

1012
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,070
What?

1013
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,010
The aneurysm

1014
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,010
must've ruptured.

1015
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,010
She was fine a second ago.

1016
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,600
Maggie, start bagging.

1017
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,600
Got you.

1018
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,670
She's asystolic.

1019
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,840
Do something.

1020
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,840
You're not helping her.

1021
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,010
Step outside. Now.

1022
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,350
Milligram of epi.

1023
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,120
Epi's in.

1024
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,590
Another milligram of epi.

1025
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,560
Stay with me, Daria.

1026
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,560
Stay with me.

1027
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,100
Pulse?

1028
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,230
Epi.

1029
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,430
Come on, Daria.

1030
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,110
No.

1031
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,580
She's gone.

1032
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,950
Time of death, 17:32.

1033
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,840
The birth mom,

1034
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,840
Alyssa Thompson,

1035
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,840
is on her way in.

1036
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,210
We were able to track her down

1037
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,210
with the info

1038
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,210
the Phillips provided.

1039
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,910
Is she clean and sober?

1040
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,910
Seems like it.

1041
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,710
Been working as a hotel maid

1042
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,710
for the past six years.

1043
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,080
Good. Hopefully, she'll be

1044
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,080
willing to get tested

1045
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,310
to be a donor.

1046
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,310
Yeah.

1047
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,550
Nearly had a heart attack

1048
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,550
when we told her

1049
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,550
we found her daughter.

1050
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,790
What's...

1051
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,790
Mr. and Mrs. Phillips?

1052
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,930
I'm going to need you to come

1053
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,930
with me.

1054
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,730
Wait, wait...

1055
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,800
No.

1056
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,430
We're so sorry, baby.

1057
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,200
No, please. Please.

1058
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,870
We have no choice.

1059
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,870
So sorry.

1060
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,200
Can you do something?

1061
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,200
Can you...

1062
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,440
Please forgive us.

1063
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,750
I know this is very scary...

1064
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,080
This is all of your fault.

1065
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,830
Mr. Carson,

1066
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,830
we're sorry for your loss.

1067
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,860
What happens now?

1068
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,730
What sort of arrangements

1069
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,730
do I have to make?

1070
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
After the autopsy is complete,

1071
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
likely in about six

1072
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
to eight weeks...

1073
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,340
Wait, autopsy?

1074
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,740
Yes, it's the law

1075
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,740
that all traumatic deaths

1076
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,440
go for an autopsy to determine

1077
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,440
the cause of death.

1078
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,810
But we already know

1079
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,810
what happened.

1080
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,440
Well, the crash

1081
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,440
is the presumed

1082
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,440
cause of death.

1083
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,150
The medical examiner will need

1084
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,150
to rule out

1085
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,150
other possibilities.

1086
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,280
Like what?

1087
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,120
There was bruising

1088
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,120
in her initial exam

1089
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,250
that is not consistent

1090
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,250
with the mechanism of injury

1091
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,250
from the crash.

1092
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,260
Daria wouldn't have wanted

1093
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,260
an autopsy.

1094
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,390
People poking and prodding

1095
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,390
her body.

1096
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,660
As her next of kin, I refuse.

1097
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,200
The ME has jurisdiction

1098
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,200
to perform the autopsy

1099
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,200
with or without your consent.

1100
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,300
But feel free to voice your

1101
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,300
objections directly.

1102
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,400
She'll be here to take

1103
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,400
your statement shortly.

1104
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
You can wait here.

1105
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
We'll retrieve you

1106
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
when she arrives.

1107
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,750
How's the husband taking it?

1108
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,750
He's worried.

1109
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,990
Just what we expected.

1110
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,410
Daria.

1111
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,810
Daria, it's okay.

1112
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,020
He's gone?

1113
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,020
He will not come back?

1114
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,510
No, trust me.

1115
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,250
He's going to stay as far away

1116
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,250
from this hospital

1117
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,250
as he possibly can.

1118
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,160
We know this was

1119
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,160
an unorthodox intervention.

1120
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,830
No, Dr. Manning,

1121
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,700
this was a complete

1122
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,700
misappropriation

1123
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,700
of medical care.

1124
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,640
What if your fake code had

1125
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,640
caused the patient to rupture?

1126
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,380
The compressions were staged.

1127
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,380
I wasn't using full force.

1128
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,010
And light compressions

1129
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,010
wouldn't spike

1130
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,010
blood pressure...

1131
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,990
Save it, Dr. Halstead.

1132
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,390
If Carson hadn't bought

1133
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,390
your little charade,

1134
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,760
do you have any idea

1135
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,760
of the legal ramifications?

1136
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,960
He would've gone

1137
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,960
after your medical licenses,

1138
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,960
and then you pulled Maggie in.

1139
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,390
I can't believe she allowed

1140
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,390
herself to be involved.

1141
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,570
Ms. Goodwin, if we could have

1142
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,570
stayed within the lines,

1143
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,570
we would have.

1144
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,170
But in this instance,

1145
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,170
that would have meant

1146
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,170
sending a woman out the door

1147
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,040
knowing she would

1148
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,040
very possibly die.

1149
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,710
Enough.

1150
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,650
Another stunt like this,

1151
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,710
and both of you

1152
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,710
will be looking

1153
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,710
for work elsewhere.

1154
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,420
And just so you know,

1155
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,320
an immigration attorney

1156
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,320
is meeting

1157
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,320
with Mrs. Carson shortly

1158
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,060
and a social worker

1159
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,060
is standing by to find

1160
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,060
a shelter for her.

1161
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,030
Thank you.

1162
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,600
Dr. Rhodes.

1163
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,910
BP and heart rate

1164
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,910
suddenly spiked.

1165
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,480
Now he's bradycardic.

1166
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,380
Both pupils

1167
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,380
are blown bilaterally.

1168
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,260
No corneal.

1169
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,330
No gag.

1170
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,500
We'll need an apnea test

1171
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,500
to confirm,

1172
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,500
but it appears that he's...

1173
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,730
He's brain-dead.

1174
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,700
Herniated due to

1175
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,700
an anoxic brain injury

1176
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,400
from prolonged downtime

1177
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,400
in the field.

1178
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,370
Just like I said he would.

1179
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,710
You should be happy.

1180
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,710
Dodged that bullet.

1181
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,480
Will you excuse me?

1182
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,830
From now on,

1183
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,830
you'll stay out of my way.

1184
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,050
Likewise.

1185
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,800
Is that Kylie?

1186
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,870
She goes by Gabby now.

1187
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,800
I can't believe...

1188
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,980
All these years,

1189
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,980
I thought she was dead.

1190
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,780
Would you like to meet her?

1191
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,780
Yes.

1192
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,880
Gabby, I think you have

1193
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,880
a visitor.

1194
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,010
Alyssa is here.

1195
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,590
Hi.

1196
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,960
I'm so happy to see you.

1197
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,130
You are so beautiful.

1198
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,130
Get away from me.

1199
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,970
You're not my mama.

1200
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,170
Gabby, I know this is...

1201
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,170
I want her out of here.

1202
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,170
I don't care.

1203
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,080
I'm not here to hurt you.

1204
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,080
Get out.

1205
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,810
Get out!

1206
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,390
I get it.

1207
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,390
I wouldn't expect her to...

1208
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,930
But I just thank God

1209
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,930
that I get a second chance

1210
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,930
to be in her life in some way.

1211
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,200
To be some kind of mother.

1212
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,670
Thank you for agreeing

1213
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,670
to get tested.

1214
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,710
Anything. Anything she needs.

1215
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,680
If you follow me,

1216
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,680
I'll get you started.

1217
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,880
Excuse me.

1218
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,880
The couple that took her,

1219
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,880
where are they?

1220
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,980
They're in police custody.

1221
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,280
I was hoping I may be

1222
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,280
able to thank them.

1223
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,090
They saved her life.

1224
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,470
"Thank them." Wow.

1225
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,170
Motherhood, you know.

1226
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,170
Mysterious powerful thing.

1227
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,010
Something you and me

1228
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,010
will never fully understand.

1229
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,740
We took a huge risk today.

1230
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,280
No regrets. I'd do it again.

1231
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,990
Aren't you

1232
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,990
forgetting something?

1233
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,250
Your sash.

1234
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,960
You really think

1235
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,960
she'll notice?

1236
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,100
Nat, it's Maggie.

1237
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,700
Fine, but I am not putting

1238
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,700
it on until we're out

1239
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,700
of the hospital.

1240
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,770
All right.

1241
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,080
Okay, I'll be right back.

1242
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,600
I don't need another lecture

1243
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,600
right now.

1244
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,930
And I'm not here to do that.

1245
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,270
Listen, Em,

1246
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,600
I may not understand your

1247
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,600
decision to stay with Bernie,

1248
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,600
but I'm not in your shoes,

1249
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,640
and you need to do what you

1250
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,640
think is best.

1251
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,310
Really?

1252
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,310
Yeah.

1253
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,020
I'm so glad to hear that.

1254
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,250
I have some news,

1255
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,250
kind of big news.

1256
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,190
Okay.

1257
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,460
As soon

1258
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,460
as Bernie's discharged,

1259
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,730
we're going to move

1260
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,730
to Las Vegas.

1261
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,840
Okay, Em.

1262
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,770
Okay.

1263
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,640
Awesome. Okay.

1264
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,440
First one's the hardest.

1265
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,900
Huh?

1266
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,710
You didn't cause his death.

1267
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,710
You know that, right?

1268
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,780
That's not it.

1269
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:20,660
When Mitch died,

1270
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:20,660
for a moment,

1271
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:20,660
for a split-second,

1272
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,800
I was relieved to be

1273
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,800
in the clear.

1274
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,140
You're human.

1275
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,670
Now, look, the minute that you

1276
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,670
walk into this hospital,

1277
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,180
the only person relying on you

1278
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,180
needs to be your patient.

1279
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,550
This is already

1280
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,550
a high-pressure gig

1281
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,610
and you need to find a way

1282
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,610
to leave everything else

1283
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,610
at the door.

1284
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,740
You got me?

1285
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,350
I hear you.

1286
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,590
Thanks, Dr. Rhodes.

1287
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,610
You hang in there, Terry.

1288
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,610
You're going to be fine.

1289
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,210
Arr, matey.

1290
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,590
You clean up nice, Dr. Bekker.

1291
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,590
You're not so bad yourself.

1292
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,380
Shall we?

1293
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,390
Thanks for coming.

1294
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,730
Whoa! Yeah!

1295
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,120
I'll go get us another round.

1296
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,120
All right.

1297
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,650
Congrats, man.

1298
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,720
Hey, can I talk to you

1299
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,720
for a quick sec?

1300
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,720
Yeah, sure.

1301
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,860
What's going on, man?

1302
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,800
I'm just giving you

1303
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,800
a heads-up,

1304
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,800
out of respect.

1305
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,430
Okay.

1306
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,070
I'm bringing Ray Burke in

1307
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,070
for an echo and an MRI...

1308
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,940
Jesus, Will,

1309
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,940
you're not his doctor.

1310
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,280
And I can't,

1311
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,280
in good conscience,

1312
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,720
withhold possibly

1313
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,720
life-threatening information

1314
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,720
from him.

1315
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,450
If you make a move

1316
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,450
in his direction

1317
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,450
without our go-ahead,

1318
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,920
I promise you,

1319
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,920
you will regret it.

1320
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,150
Look, man, because of the bug

1321
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,150
that you planted,

1322
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,060
the task force has intel

1323
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,060
that Ray is meeting

1324
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,060
with his crew in a week.

1325
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,760
They're this close

1326
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,760
to taking him down.

1327
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,300
He'll get treated in custody.

1328
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,270
Now, if you don't mind,

1329
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,270
I'd like

1330
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,270
to get back to your party.
