1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,100
All right, Caroline,

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,640
we'll have your infusion

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,640
ready in just a minute.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,170
If you feel nauseous,

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,170
just let us know

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,230
and we'll get you

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,230
some Zofran.

8
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,300
Okay.

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,870
Think maybe we could just

10
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,870
give her some preemptively?

11
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,500
She got nauseous

12
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,500
the first three infusions.

13
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,780
I'm fine.

14
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,780
Danny, I can ask for

15
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,780
my own meds, thank you.

16
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,650
Of course you can, I'm just...

17
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,650
I'm just trying to...

18
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,620
Wait. Wait a second.

19
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,180
Don't start

20
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,180
the infusion yet.

21
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,820
Heather? Heather, sorry.

22
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,650
Um, I'm just curious,

23
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,490
is nausea a side effect

24
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,490
of the drug?

25
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,500
No, it's an effect

26
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,230
of the infusion process

27
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,230
in general.

28
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,830
Well, what kind of

29
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,830
side effects

30
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,830
are you seeing

31
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,960
from patients

32
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,960
who are getting the drug

33
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,800
as opposed to those

34
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,800
who are getting the placebo?

35
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,600
This is a blinded trial.

36
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,300
You know I can't disclose

37
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,300
that kind of information.

38
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,510
Of course.

39
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,510
Of course you can't.

40
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,940
I mean, not that

41
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,940
I'd ever tell her.

42
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,840
I just wanna be able to manage

43
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,840
her expectations, that's all.

44
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,240
Dan, I'm not gonna tell you

45
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,120
whether she's on

46
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,120
drug or placebo.

47
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,390
What are you doing?

48
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,360
Trying to take care

49
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,360
of my wife... My ex-wife.

50
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,870
I know that you're

51
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,870
worried about CeCe,

52
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,530
but this is exactly what

53
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,530
got you into trouble

54
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,800
when you were married.

55
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,470
Okay, look, I'm just gonna

56
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,470
go get her a glass of water.

57
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,010
Hey, we got a patient in Two.

58
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,350
Cystic fibrosis, temp 103.

59
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,610
Third time he's been in

60
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,610
in the last month.

61
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,120
That doesn't sound good.

62
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,180
Uh, here.

63
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,190
Been meaning to

64
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,190
give you that back.

65
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,860
Hi, Ben,

66
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,860
I'm Dr. Halstead.

67
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,900
This is Dr. Manning.

68
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,900
Hi.

69
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,270
How long have you

70
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,270
had the fever?

71
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,400
Started last night.

72
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,700
Do you know what antibiotics

73
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,700
usually work for you?

74
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,760
Not many.

75
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,170
The last few times they went

76
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,170
straight to Imipenem.

77
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,230
Okay.

78
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,810
Get me 500 of

79
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,810
Imipenem, CBC, BMP,

80
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,810
cultures times three,

81
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,810
chest x-ray,

82
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,810
PA, and a lateral.

83
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,380
I'm sorry, one second.

84
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,510
That's okay.

85
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,720
Hey.

86
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,750
I just parked.

87
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,360
I'm walking. I love you.

88
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,690
I love you, too.

89
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,060
It's my girlfriend.

90
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,060
Aw.

91
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,390
Lisa.

92
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,470
She can come in

93
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,470
if she wants.

94
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,230
Actually, she can't.

95
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,540
She has cystic

96
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,540
fibrosis too.

97
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,910
Ah.

98
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,910
Well, CF isn't contagious.

99
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,080
But CF patients carry

100
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,080
many different strains

101
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,780
of drug-resistant bacteria.

102
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,510
The fear's that

103
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,510
by sharing the same air,

104
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,610
they'll cross-infect

105
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,610
each other.

106
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,360
So you've never been

107
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,360
in the same room?

108
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,820
We met in an online

109
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,820
support group.

110
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,190
Lots of video chatting.

111
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,560
Um, but that's

112
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,560
all gonna change once

113
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,560
we each get new lungs.

114
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,070
You have to tell them

115
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,070
you're status 1A.

116
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,700
I'm status 1A.

117
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,770
This is why she makes me

118
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,770
bring her everywhere.

119
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,970
Glad to hear

120
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,970
you're 1A.

121
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,440
Three severe infections

122
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,440
in a month,

123
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,100
you're gonna need those

124
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,100
lungs sooner than later.

125
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,470
All right, well,

126
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,470
I'll call over

127
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,850
to the transplant coordinator,

128
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,850
and in the meantime

129
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,320
hopefully the antibiotics

130
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,320
will help get

131
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,320
your fever down, okay?

132
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,680
Poor kids.

133
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,830
So in love, and they

134
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,830
can't even be together.

135
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,860
April, are you taking

136
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,860
Mr. Lane in Six?

137
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,530
Going now.

138
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,530
Awesome.

139
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,830
Don?

140
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,830
Yeah?

141
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,730
I have some stretchers

142
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,730
in the ambo bay.

143
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,210
Can you take care of that?

144
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,210
Yeah, I'll get them.

145
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,270
Thank you so much.

146
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,840
Hey.

147
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,940
Hey, Ava.

148
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,000
Robin.

149
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,070
So, I heard you rounded

150
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,070
on my mom this morning.

151
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,620
How's her

152
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,620
new valve doing?

153
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,620
She is looking great.

154
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,710
I don't foresee

155
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,710
any problems.

156
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,710
Good.

157
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,290
Oh, and did you see the

158
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,290
vertical farming exhibit

159
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,290
at the Smart

160
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,290
I told you about?

161
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,020
I'm telling you,

162
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,020
the future is

163
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,020
aeroponics.

164
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,650
We get 120 days

165
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,650
of rain a year.

166
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,790
I don't see us

167
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,790
running out of water.

168
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,920
It's not about

169
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,920
the water.

170
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,460
It's about feeding 130 million

171
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,460
new babies a year.

172
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,730
Okay.

173
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,730
Have you seen it?

174
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,530
Uh, no, but I'll

175
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,530
make a point to.

176
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,630
Thank you.

177
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,140
Obviously, it is over

178
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,140
some people's heads.

179
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,840
That's a vertical

180
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,840
farming joke.

181
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,800
No.

182
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,800
Yeah.

183
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,370
Nope, nope, nope.

184
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,650
Anyway, I know

185
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,650
my mom's scheduled

186
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,650
for an echo tomorrow,

187
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,880
so once you get

188
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,880
the results...

189
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,390
Oh, my God, help me!

190
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
Please, help me!

191
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
Get me out!

192
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,670
Help!

193
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,910
Hey, hey, hey, don't move!

194
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,910
April, give me a hand!

195
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,460
Robin, go call Goodwin!

196
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,460
Sir, sir?

197
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,820
Can you hear me, sir?

198
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,280
It's locked!

199
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,290
I got an idea!

200
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,850
Don!

201
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,850
Don?

202
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,060
Hang on, Don!

203
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,990
Use this!

204
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,990
Clear!

205
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,130
I'll go call CFD!

206
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,440
Kill the engine.

207
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,440
Stay with him!

208
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,500
Got it.

209
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,410
What do we got?

210
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,410
Hey, hey.

211
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,680
It's okay, we got you.

212
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,680
What hurts the most, Don?

213
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,240
My leg!

214
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,240
He's bleeding really bad.

215
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,410
Yeah.

216
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,410
It's too much blood.

217
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,680
Am I gonna die?

218
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,680
Don't talk like that.

219
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,750
We're gonna get you

220
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,750
out of here.

221
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,420
Something cut his thigh.

222
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,190
It looks like it must

223
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,190
have been the artery.

224
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,250
I can't reach it.

225
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,190
Hey, give me an 18-gauge

226
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,190
IV catheter with an EJ line

227
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,930
and four units of O-neg

228
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,930
on the rapid transfuser.

229
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,560
Got it.

230
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,560
April!

231
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,240
April, you can't

232
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,240
go under there!

233
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,570
It's okay, I got it!

234
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,570
It hurts so bad, it hurts!

235
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,940
Definitely arterial blood.

236
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,940
Maybe femoral.

237
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,240
Can you get

238
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,240
a tourniquet above it?

239
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,610
It's too high.

240
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,610
It's too high to clamp, too.

241
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,950
If I can just pinch

242
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,950
my fingers around it...

243
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,580
Okay, I got it.

244
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,680
I pinched it off.

245
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,820
Hey, hey,

246
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,820
be careful up there!

247
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,090
Please, please.

248
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,360
Don't let anything

249
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,360
happen to me.

250
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,600
April, you gotta

251
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,600
get out of there.

252
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,100
I'm not letting

253
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,100
his artery go.

254
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,600
She is the only thing that's

255
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,600
keeping him alive right now.

256
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,460
CFD's gonna be here soon.

257
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,530
Hold on.

258
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,900
Sir?

259
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,840
Sir, can you tell me

260
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,840
your name?

261
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,880
He's got a loud

262
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,880
diastolic rumble.

263
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,740
It could be

264
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,740
an embolic stroke.

265
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,110
Which would mean

266
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,110
he passed out while driving.

267
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,950
We need to get him

268
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,950
up to CT!

269
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,950
Okay, let's move him!

270
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,950
Get the gurney in here!

271
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,510
Clear out, folks.

272
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,510
All right!

273
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,990
All right, let's move him!

274
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,990
Come on!

275
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,490
On my count.

276
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,490
One, two, three...

277
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,060
All right,

278
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,060
all right,

279
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,060
all right.

280
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,030
Let's go. There we go.

281
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,370
Ethan, page me when you're

282
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,370
ready to move Don, okay?

283
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,430
Yeah!

284
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,170
All right,

285
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,170
let's go, let's go!

286
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,810
Curry, we've

287
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,810
got ambulances

288
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,350
lining up outside

289
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,350
of the lobby!

290
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,980
Go help them!

291
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,980
Absolutely.

292
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,840
I got you.

293
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,990
This is Sandy Glenn

294
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,990
and her husband, Drew.

295
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,730
Passed out in her home

296
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,730
this morning.

297
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,320
GCS 15, vitals stable.

298
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm Elsa Curry,

299
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
third-year medical student.

300
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,330
Uh, can you tell me

301
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,330
what happened?

302
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,440
I was just making some tea,

303
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,440
then suddenly I saw stars.

304
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,740
I found her on the floor.

305
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,740
Has this ever happened before?

306
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,370
No.

307
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,370
But she does have

308
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,370
multiple sclerosis.

309
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,710
Relapsing/remitting.

310
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,010
Could it be the start

311
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,010
of a new episode?

312
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,510
Yeah, it's possible.

313
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,510
Any other symptoms?

314
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,520
Visual disturbances,

315
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,520
pain, incontinence?

316
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,310
Uh, no, nothing like that.

317
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,440
Okay, uh, transfer

318
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,440
on my count.

319
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,650
One, two, three...

320
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,380
Okay. Yeah,

321
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,380
you've also got

322
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,380
some dry skin,

323
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,960
marked pallor,

324
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,960
and some peripheral edema.

325
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,460
Have you been

326
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,460
losing any weight?

327
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,900
Maybe a little,

328
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,900
but not much.

329
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,370
All right, then my attending

330
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,370
and I are gonna order

331
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,200
a full set of labs

332
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,200
and have Neuro

333
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,200
come down to take a look.

334
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,260
I'll be back in a little bit.

335
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,640
April!

336
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,640
Hey!

337
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,210
We got here

338
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,210
as fast as we could.

339
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,720
Kelly?

340
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,720
April, you hit?

341
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,320
No, no, no,

342
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,320
I'm fine. It's Don.

343
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,480
We gotta get him out of here.

344
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,390
Just hold tight.

345
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,390
We got it.

346
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,820
Cruz, how's it look?

347
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,750
His leg's stuck

348
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,750
in the wheel well.

349
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,590
Kelly, how long

350
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,590
till we get him out?

351
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,790
Well, we have to stabilize

352
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,790
the car with airbags

353
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,960
and secure it with cribbing

354
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,870
before we can even attempt

355
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,870
to remove that leg.

356
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,440
We move too quick, whole thing

357
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,440
will come down on top of him.

358
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,730
All right,

359
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,730
keep me posted.

360
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,730
Yeah.

361
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,530
Hey, Don?

362
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,530
Hey, you hang

363
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,530
in there, okay?

364
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,740
I'll try my best.

365
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,740
Good.

366
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,510
We're working on a way

367
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,510
to get you out soon.

368
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,470
Hey, come on.

369
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,470
I'll take over from here.

370
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,980
No, don't leave me.

371
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,980
Don't leave me.

372
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,040
No, it's fine.

373
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,780
You're not gonna fit

374
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,780
under here, anyways.

375
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,920
Look, April, I can

376
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,920
squeeze my way in.

377
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,290
I said I'm fine.

378
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,790
Dr. Choi.

379
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,140
How's he doing?

380
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,140
He's lost a lot of blood.

381
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,170
April's pinching off

382
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,170
his femoral artery,

383
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,900
but he's still bleeding

384
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,900
into his pelvis.

385
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,000
We've got him

386
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,000
on the rapid transfuser.

387
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,100
I'm gonna have Dr. Lanik

388
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,100
take over from here.

389
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,740
What, why?

390
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,740
April's in danger.

391
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,280
We need someone in charge

392
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,280
who's not as close to her.

393
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,750
Ms. Goodwin, I hear

394
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,750
what you're saying,

395
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,950
but April and I,

396
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,950
we're just coworkers.

397
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,110
It's fine.

398
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,450
Okay.

399
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,930
Mr. Nichols,

400
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,930
I'm Dr. Rhodes.

401
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,170
This is Dr. Bekker.

402
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,260
How are you feeling?

403
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,600
Sore, but okay.

404
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,670
I'm so sorry

405
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,670
about what happened.

406
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,640
I was getting

407
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,640
so numb and dizzy,

408
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,180
and I just wanted

409
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,180
to get here, and...

410
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,810
You passed out

411
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,810
while you were driving.

412
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,250
Mr. Nichols, your scans show

413
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,690
that you have a tumor

414
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,690
growing in your heart.

415
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,950
It's called a "myxoma."

416
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,820
Now, it is

417
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,820
most likely benign,

418
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,820
which means

419
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,060
that it won't spread to

420
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,060
the rest of your body,

421
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,930
but it is large enough that

422
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,930
pieces are breaking off

423
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,060
and causing you

424
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,060
to have small strokes.

425
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,290
So how do you fix it?

426
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,290
Normally we'd remove it

427
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,290
surgically,

428
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,200
but yours has grown

429
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,200
extremely large.

430
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,800
We would like to put you

431
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,800
on the transplant list.

432
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,910
Find you a new,

433
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,910
healthy heart.

434
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,810
Couldn't that take a while?

435
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,110
What if I have

436
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,110
another stroke?

437
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,110
I could die.

438
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,240
Removing the tumor

439
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,240
is a very difficult procedure.

440
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,310
If we try

441
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,310
and are unsuccessful,

442
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,310
your body won't be able

443
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,010
to tolerate

444
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,010
a transplant later on.

445
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,720
But it's possible

446
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,720
you could get it all?

447
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,950
It's possible.

448
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,150
Then let's do it.

449
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,890
Mr. Nichols, I appreciate

450
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,890
how eager you are

451
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,890
to take care of this,

452
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,560
but I, and we, would really

453
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,560
advise against that.

454
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,530
This thing

455
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,530
almost killed me today.

456
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,500
Just please, take it out.

457
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,170
Well, the risks

458
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,170
are significant,

459
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,780
but if you'd prefer

460
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,780
to take them,

461
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,640
of course, we'll do everything

462
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,640
we can to fix this.

463
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,700
Yes.

464
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,340
Thank you.

465
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,770
Okay.

466
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,740
All right, then.

467
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,820
Ava, you realize what we are

468
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,820
committing ourselves to?

469
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,880
I do.

470
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,960
We get one shot

471
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,960
at opening him up.

472
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,890
If we do it, and we don't

473
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,890
succeed, he's gonna die.

474
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,960
We can do it.

475
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,300
Hi, Ben.

476
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,540
So, good news.

477
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,100
A new pair of lungs

478
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,100
have become available.

479
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,170
Really?

480
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,870
Oh, my God, Ben!

481
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,870
That's amazing!

482
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,270
Yeah, they're flying in now.

483
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,480
Should be here

484
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,480
in a couple of hours.

485
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,950
So I'm getting them today?

486
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,490
I'll call surgery now.

487
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,950
Hey, you here

488
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,950
for your check-up?

489
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,020
That we are.

490
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,020
Hi, Sophie.

491
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,530
I think she's waking up.

492
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,830
I hope the, um...

493
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,830
The doctors will warm

494
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,830
his fingers up.

495
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,890
I heard

496
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,890
they charge extra for that.

497
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,910
That'd be great. Thanks.

498
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,910
But maybe I can

499
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,910
put in a good word.

500
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,270
I'll call surgery for Ben.

501
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,140
Thanks. Why don't I

502
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,140
take you guys up?

503
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,270
Great, yeah.

504
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,480
Everything's all right.

505
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,380
All right.

506
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,480
Dr. Choi!

507
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,650
Don needs you right now.

508
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,690
I can't breathe.

509
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,920
What happened?

510
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,830
He just started wheezing

511
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,830
a minute or two ago.

512
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,420
It's just getting worse.

513
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,420
I can't breathe.

514
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,990
I can't breathe.

515
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,700
He's having

516
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,700
a transfusion reaction.

517
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,760
We gotta stop the blood.

518
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,170
Give me 50 milligrams

519
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,170
of diphenhydramine, stat.

520
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,870
What's happening to me?

521
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,870
Am I gonna be okay?

522
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,670
You're having

523
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,670
an allergic reaction.

524
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,800
They're gonna have to

525
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,800
stop the blood.

526
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,780
But I'm still bleeding, right?

527
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,840
All right.

528
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,180
Cruz!

529
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,180
Yeah?

530
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,150
How close are you?

531
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,150
Leg's almost free,

532
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,710
but there's a lot of

533
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,710
jagged metal down here.

534
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,850
We gotta move

535
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,850
this whole thing

536
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,850
at least eight inches,

537
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,060
stabilize it before

538
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,060
we can move anybody.

539
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,060
It's gonna be awhile.

540
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,320
I can't give him

541
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,320
any more blood.

542
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,260
How long is "a while"?

543
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,260
What can I tell you?

544
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,320
We're working.

545
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,490
April?

546
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,510
Just let me

547
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,510
switch out with you.

548
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,700
Ethan, I am not leaving him.

549
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,990
Okay, so, anemic,

550
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,990
hypoglycemic.

551
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,960
Low vitamin B12

552
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,960
and calcium.

553
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,690
EKG changes...

554
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,730
Hmm. It ain't good,

555
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,130
but it doesn't look like

556
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,130
an exacerbation of her MS.

557
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,600
No, it looks like anorexia,

558
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,600
but she's not underweight.

559
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,530
Which doesn't necessarily

560
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,530
exclude the disorder.

561
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,570
Let's go say hi.

562
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,140
I'm Dr. Charles.

563
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,740
Ms. Curry wanted me to...

564
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,740
To say a quick hello.

565
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,650
Were my test results bad?

566
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,350
We're worried about

567
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,350
your nutrition.

568
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,290
Have you been experiencing

569
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,290
any digestive issues

570
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,190
or decreased appetite?

571
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,610
No.

572
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,260
No? Okay, that's good.

573
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,230
Are you concerned about

574
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,230
your weight at all, or...

575
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,660
Or even, say,

576
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,660
your appearance

577
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,660
in general?

578
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm not anorexic.

579
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,160
I have a tapeworm.

580
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,790
A tapeworm?

581
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,810
Yes, I infected myself

582
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,810
on purpose for my MS.

583
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,780
There's this thing called

584
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,780
"helminthic therapy"...

585
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,340
Yeah, for autoimmune diseases.

586
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,880
It's really cutting-edge.

587
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,820
You've heard of it?

588
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,820
Yes.

589
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,080
Basically, the hypothesis

590
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,080
is that a worm infestation

591
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,380
can activate

592
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,380
your immune system

593
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,720
to fight against

594
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,720
certain conditions.

595
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,320
You know, there's actually

596
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,320
quite a few centers

597
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,880
that are doing

598
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,880
clinical trials.

599
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,450
She couldn't get in to

600
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,450
any of them.

601
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,120
Have you discussed this

602
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,120
with your neurologist?

603
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,990
'Cause there are several

604
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,990
new therapies for MS.

605
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,830
And, you know, modulators...

606
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,830
Steroids, Cytoxan.

607
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,920
I tried everything.

608
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,540
But since I started this,

609
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,540
I haven't had an episode

610
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,540
in three months.

611
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,590
Really?

612
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,000
Okay, what is your normal

613
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,000
remission rate?

614
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,130
Because anything longer than

615
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,130
two standard deviations,

616
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,440
and we could probably

617
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,440
publish a case study.

618
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,680
Um, could you

619
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,680
excuse us for a second?

620
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,970
Ms. Curry.

621
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,820
Ms. Curry, I appreciate

622
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,820
your enthusiasm,

623
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,580
but these trials

624
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,580
are held under strict

625
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,580
medical supervision.

626
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,750
She's doing it on her own.

627
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,900
I know, but this is

628
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,900
the front line

629
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,900
of immunotherapy.

630
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,400
I mean, we could find

631
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,400
a positive result.

632
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,930
That woman passed out today

633
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,930
from malnourishment.

634
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,130
That's what

635
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,130
we're treating here.

636
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,130
Or we can work with her.

637
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,600
We can modify her diet,

638
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,930
we can give her

639
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,930
higher calorie foods...

640
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,500
The patient has a parasite,

641
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,500
and it is clearly undermining

642
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,500
her health.

643
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,700
Dr. Charles, I really...

644
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,840
Let's start with

645
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,840
400 milligrams

646
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,840
of Albendazole

647
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,380
and hang a liter of D5W.

648
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,440
Thanks.

649
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,670
Mmm-hmm.

650
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,120
Looks like things

651
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,120
between you and Phillip

652
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,120
are going well.

653
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,950
He's still having

654
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,950
a tough time,

655
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,090
but it's slowly

656
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,090
getting better.

657
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,330
He's lucky to have you.

658
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,070
Dr. Halstead, Dr. Manning,

659
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,070
Ben's sats are dropping.

660
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,340
Please, help him.

661
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,580
Sats are down to 82.

662
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,920
No breath sounds on the left.

663
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,920
It's likely a pneumothorax.

664
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,480
I'll get a chest tube kit.

665
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,480
Wait.

666
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,860
Do you know

667
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,860
how many chest tubes

668
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,860
you've had before?

669
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,050
Four.

670
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,300
His lungs are likely

671
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,300
scarred as is.

672
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,060
Another chest tube will

673
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,060
only jeopardize his ability

674
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,120
to receive a transplant.

675
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,790
But the new lungs are

676
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,790
still an hour out.

677
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,170
I don't think

678
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,170
he'll make it like this.

679
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,270
I can make it.

680
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,740
We can give him steroids

681
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,740
and put him on a mask.

682
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,340
It's worth a try.

683
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,940
Okay. Let's give him

684
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,940
60 milligrams

685
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,040
of methylprednisolone,

686
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,040
and up the O2 to 10 liters.

687
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,170
Hang in there, Ben.

688
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,080
We're gonna send you up

689
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,080
to prep for surgery soon.

690
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,190
Hey, hey, hey,

691
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,190
hey, hey. Ethan?

692
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,890
He is losing consciousness.

693
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,890
We gotta get him out of here.

694
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,230
Hey, Don?

695
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,230
Don, can you hear me?

696
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,930
I'm so tired.

697
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,930
Stay with me, Don.

698
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,430
Kelly, you guys

699
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,430
ready to go yet?

700
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,240
The back wheels

701
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,240
are still too unstable.

702
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,040
We need a little bit

703
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,040
more time.

704
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,040
We don't have time.

705
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,580
Don's lost too much blood.

706
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,580
We're not moving anyone

707
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,580
until it's safe.

708
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,140
No, Ethan...

709
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,140
I'm sorry, April.

710
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,570
Kelly!

711
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,380
He's dying. We have

712
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,380
to move him now.

713
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,010
Dr. Choi, is that true?

714
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,260
How unstable is the car?

715
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,260
It's not where we'd like it.

716
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,560
If we move now,

717
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,560
can't promise you

718
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,560
it won't collapse.

719
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,850
Kelly!

720
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,990
Do it!

721
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,030
You start pressors,

722
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,030
I'll up his fluids.

723
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,030
No.

724
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,600
Keep working.

725
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,600
We're waiting

726
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,600
till it's safe.

727
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,640
Ethan!

728
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,640
We're waiting.

729
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,000
What's going on?

730
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,020
Turned into a tension pneumo.

731
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,020
We have to needle it.

732
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,160
His sats aren't coming up.

733
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,160
It's not working.

734
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,690
The new lungs are

735
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,690
still 15 minutes away.

736
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,890
He's not gonna

737
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,890
make it that long.

738
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,400
We have to do a chest tube.

739
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,560
If we do it, he may not be

740
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,560
able to get a transplant.

741
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,160
We have to do this.

742
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,100
Get the chest tube kit.

743
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,100
No, wait!

744
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,700
I'm sorry.

745
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,050
Sats are down to 71.

746
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,750
What about his transplant?

747
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,550
We don't have a choice.

748
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,120
Okay, making the incision.

749
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,060
I'm in.

750
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,500
Sats back up to 80.

751
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,810
Eighty-three.

752
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,810
All right, tell radiology

753
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,510
he needs a stat chest CT

754
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,510
before he goes to the OR.

755
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,510
Mmm-hmm.

756
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,220
I can't get an angle on this.

757
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,720
Reflect the atrium.

758
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,090
That's as far back

759
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,090
as it's gonna go.

760
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,590
I can't get around it.

761
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,290
Damn it.

762
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,430
The tumor's extended too far

763
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,430
into the auricle.

764
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,370
And into the valve

765
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,370
and the SA node.

766
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,680
I don't see how we're ever

767
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,680
gonna get the margins clear.

768
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,540
We may have to

769
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,540
close him back up.

770
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,740
But we can't

771
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,740
close him back up.

772
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,910
He's never gonna survive

773
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,910
another procedure.

774
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,250
We need to fix this today.

775
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,350
Let me try it from here.

776
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,890
Reflect the atrium.

777
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,890
Yes, sir. Forceps.

778
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,720
Right here.

779
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,420
Dr. Rhodes?

780
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,720
They're ready

781
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,720
to extract the patient

782
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,720
from under the car.

783
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,260
Okay.

784
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,700
Keep dissecting.

785
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,540
It's the only option we have.

786
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,410
Go grab a board.

787
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,410
Ethan.

788
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,040
Hey, team's in place.

789
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,710
Soon as he's out,

790
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,710
Maggie and I will

791
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,710
bind the pelvis

792
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,160
while you clamp off

793
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,160
the artery.

794
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,130
Why isn't he

795
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,130
on the rapid

796
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,130
transfuser?

797
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,360
He had a reaction

798
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,360
to the blood.

799
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,360
We had to take him off.

800
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
And he's been

801
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
down there

802
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
this long?

803
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,620
Yeah.

804
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,060
He's lost too much blood

805
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,060
and his pressure's

806
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,060
in the toilet.

807
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,630
Even if we are

808
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,630
perfect on this,

809
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,630
it might not be enough.

810
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,860
I know.

811
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,880
Man, I know

812
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,880
that this is delicate,

813
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,640
but is Don an organ donor?

814
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,610
I don't know.

815
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,970
The driver.

816
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,480
He needs a new heart.

817
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,410
God.

818
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,620
Yeah.

819
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,830
Don? Don, it's time

820
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,830
to get you out of here.

821
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,200
You have lost

822
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,200
a lot of blood.

823
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,200
I know.

824
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,230
Your condition is

825
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,230
extremely serious,

826
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,140
and you know that

827
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,140
in cases like this,

828
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,500
we'd like to

829
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,500
have a plan.

830
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,780
You wanna know

831
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,780
if I'm an organ donor.

832
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,880
You're a healthcare

833
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,880
worker, Don, you understand.

834
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,480
You said you were

835
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,480
gonna save me.

836
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,750
I know. We are, Don.

837
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,050
Don, we're gonna do everything

838
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,050
that we possibly can...

839
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,180
I don't want to die.

840
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,790
Stop, guys,

841
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,790
you're scaring him.

842
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,260
April, please.

843
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,260
Get me out.

844
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,990
Just get me out.

845
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,990
Don, Don?

846
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,290
Kelly, we gotta go now.

847
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,460
Let's go!

848
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,460
Ready?

849
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,270
Up on blue!

850
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,270
Copy that.

851
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,290
Up on blue.

852
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,170
Let's get it in.

853
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,570
Okay, ready? Kelly?

854
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,570
Yep.

855
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,050
One, two, three.

856
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,050
There we go.

857
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,220
Gonna roll him!

858
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,220
Yep!

859
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,910
Roll!

860
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,810
You're good.

861
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,450
Clamp?

862
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,450
Clamp!

863
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,090
All right, April.

864
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,090
Yep!

865
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,760
Faster, let's go!

866
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,760
He's gonna bleed out!

867
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,690
Clamps are on!

868
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,630
Heart rate's 140!

869
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,630
Sats are dropping!

870
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,540
Let's go, let's move!

871
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,540
All right,

872
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,540
on my count!

873
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,970
One, two, three!

874
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,330
Let's go! Come on,

875
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,330
let's move, people.

876
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,330
He's crashing.

877
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,440
All right, let's move!

878
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,440
Move, move!

879
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,350
Whoa! What's going on?

880
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,990
Dr. Latham called

881
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,990
the transplant off.

882
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,530
What do you mean?

883
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,530
The new lungs

884
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,530
are ready to go.

885
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,400
The chest tube caused

886
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,400
a hemothorax, and that's

887
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,400
on top of the damage

888
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,800
from all his

889
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,800
previous procedures.

890
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,170
He'd bleed out

891
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,170
before we even got

892
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,170
the new lungs in.

893
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,860
Nothing we've tried has

894
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,860
touched his infection.

895
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,340
If he doesn't get

896
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,340
this transplant,

897
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,340
he's going to die.

898
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,810
Dr. Latham says his lungs

899
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,810
are completely fused

900
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,810
to his chest wall.

901
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,450
It's just not possible.

902
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,810
I'm sorry.

903
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,380
Oh, God!

904
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,480
Oh, God. Here.

905
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,920
Oh, God.

906
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,050
Oh, God.

907
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,050
You okay?

908
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,020
Oh, God. Yeah, I'm okay.

909
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,160
Hang a bag of Zofran.

910
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,160
No, I don't want

911
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,160
any Zofran.

912
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,800
Honey, you're nauseous.

913
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,800
It'll make you feel

914
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,800
so much better.

915
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,930
Go get the Zofran.

916
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,930
No, I don't want any Zofran.

917
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,640
I take the Zofran,

918
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,640
I get tired.

919
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,870
When I get tired, I nap,

920
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,870
and then I can't sleep

921
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,870
at night.

922
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,110
I don't want any Zofran.

923
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,480
Okay, well, we can get you

924
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,480
something to help you sleep.

925
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,280
Ask Dr. Singh to write

926
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,280
an order for, uh...

927
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,820
Will you stop it, please?

928
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,590
Okay, will you leave, please?

929
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,590
I want you to get out.

930
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,120
Okay. Okay.

931
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,890
I'll be back

932
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,890
in a little while,

933
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,060
20, 30 minutes, just to see if

934
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,060
you're still feeling nauseous.

935
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,530
No! Don't come back.

936
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,200
I want you out!

937
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,450
How's Don?

938
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,450
His pelvis is

939
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,450
completely shattered.

940
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,850
It's still touch and go.

941
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,750
What?

942
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,560
If he doesn't make it,

943
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,560
that's a heart wasted.

944
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,560
He was terrified, Ethan.

945
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,560
It was wrong of you

946
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,560
to ask him.

947
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,230
How could we not?

948
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,230
He wanted us to save him.

949
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,030
And we are! We're doing

950
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,030
everything we can.

951
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,230
You did not do

952
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,230
everything you could.

953
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,770
You should have gotten

954
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,770
Don out sooner.

955
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,830
That car

956
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,830
could have collapsed.

957
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,170
I wanted to make sure

958
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,170
he was safe.

959
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,210
No, you wanted

960
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,210
to make sure I was safe!

961
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,940
But I wasn't

962
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,940
your patient, Ethan.

963
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,240
He was.

964
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,670
Okay, so, um,

965
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,670
if you email me

966
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,670
the details,

967
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,890
I'll follow up

968
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,890
with you in a week

969
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,960
and we can

970
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,960
take it from there.

971
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,430
Ms. Curry?

972
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,430
What are you doing?

973
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,970
She wanted to be discharged.

974
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,970
She's severely anemic.

975
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,300
She could pass out before

976
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,300
she gets to the parking lot.

977
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,280
I mean, I scheduled

978
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,280
a visit with a nutritionist

979
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,610
and I'm gonna

980
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,610
monitor her closely.

981
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,780
Ms. Glenn?

982
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,640
You're aware

983
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,640
that this worm

984
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,640
puts you at risk

985
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,690
of pancreatitis,

986
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,690
heart disease,

987
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,690
arrhythmia...

988
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,120
I know, but it's

989
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,120
the only thing

990
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,120
that's helped my MS.

991
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,560
Trust me, correlation

992
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,560
is not necessarily causation.

993
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,610
What does that mean?

994
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,520
He doesn't think

995
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,520
that the absence

996
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,520
of MS symptoms

997
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,650
is related to

998
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,650
the tapeworm.

999
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,650
Not what I said.

1000
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,470
Whether it's helping you

1001
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,470
or not, the side effects

1002
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,260
are seriously

1003
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,260
endangering your health.

1004
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,560
I don't agree.

1005
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,430
I know how I feel,

1006
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,430
and I'm going home.

1007
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,170
Well, then, I'm sorry,

1008
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,170
you leave me no choice

1009
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,730
but to put you

1010
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,730
on a psych hold.

1011
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,470
What?

1012
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,470
You can't

1013
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,470
make her stay here!

1014
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,710
I'm afraid I can.

1015
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,710
Right now, your wife is

1016
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,710
a danger to herself.

1017
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,050
My job is to protect her.

1018
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,050
Earl, back in Four.

1019
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,050
No... Dr. Charles,

1020
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,050
what are you doing?

1021
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,380
Come with me, ma'am.

1022
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,380
Let go of me!

1023
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,610
Hey, what are you doing?

1024
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,320
You can't keep me here!

1025
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,320
Dr. Charles!

1026
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,220
You can't keep me here!

1027
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,220
Get off of her!

1028
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,300
Oh, hey. Uh, my mom,

1029
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,670
she was feeling some tightness

1030
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,670
in her chest before, so...

1031
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,860
Yeah, of course.

1032
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,860
I'll check on her

1033
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,860
as soon as I can.

1034
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,730
Okay, thank... Hey.

1035
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,310
What's the matter?

1036
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,310
Ah. Tough case.

1037
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,540
We allowed this patient

1038
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,540
to talk us into removing

1039
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,910
his cardiac myxoma when we

1040
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,910
should have done a transplant

1041
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,250
and now... Well, he's

1042
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,250
probably gonna die.

1043
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,980
Why can't you remove it?

1044
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,980
Well, it's too extensive.

1045
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,150
We'd never get it all.

1046
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,850
Could you get it all

1047
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,850
with an autotransplant?

1048
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,960
You're talking about

1049
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,960
completely removing his heart

1050
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,960
from his body.

1051
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,930
I mean, we could get

1052
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,930
at the whole tumor,

1053
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,830
but the damage

1054
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,830
is so extensive,

1055
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,770
the odds

1056
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,770
of reimplantation

1057
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,770
are minuscule.

1058
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,160
That might not be true.

1059
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,240
The chief of CT

1060
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,240
back at my hospital,

1061
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,800
he did a 12-patient trial

1062
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,800
on reimplantation

1063
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,500
after ice-bath dissection.

1064
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,980
He hasn't published yet

1065
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,980
but he got good results.

1066
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,910
What kind of results?

1067
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,910
Greater than 50%.

1068
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,450
"Greater than 50%,"

1069
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,450
you're sure?

1070
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,950
Yeah. I can get you

1071
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,950
the details on the procedure.

1072
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,460
Do it, fast.

1073
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,460
I'm gonna be back

1074
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,460
in the OR.

1075
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,790
Thank you.

1076
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,790
Yeah.

1077
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,620
Okay.

1078
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,380
Mmm-hmm.

1079
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,330
I gotta go.

1080
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,700
Hey.

1081
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,650
Four months ago,

1082
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,650
we were getting

1083
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,650
married.

1084
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,550
Today I gave her

1085
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,550
her house key back.

1086
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,240
I know.

1087
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,950
What do I do?

1088
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,650
Come on.

1089
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,200
Let's get back to work.

1090
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,280
Don's still in surgery.

1091
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,280
It's not going well.

1092
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,490
If he dies, I accept

1093
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,490
full responsibility.

1094
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,690
I looked at the notes,

1095
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,690
spoke with CFD.

1096
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,390
Lieutenant Severide said

1097
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,390
you were faced with

1098
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,390
some tough decisions,

1099
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,660
especially regarding April.

1100
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,800
You tried to warn me.

1101
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,130
Being responsible

1102
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,130
for people's lives

1103
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,130
is never easy, Dr. Choi.

1104
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,100
Let's all just hope that

1105
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,100
things work out for the best.

1106
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,100
Yes, ma'am.

1107
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,260
The antibiotics

1108
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,260
aren't working,

1109
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,260
are they?

1110
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,130
No, they're not.

1111
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,730
Lisa...

1112
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,500
I spoke with

1113
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,500
the transplant

1114
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,500
coordinator.

1115
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,480
No one ahead of you

1116
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,480
on the list can get here

1117
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,410
before the donor

1118
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,410
lungs expire,

1119
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,540
which means

1120
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,540
you're up next.

1121
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,750
To get a transplant?

1122
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,110
Yes.

1123
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,460
I can't.

1124
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,430
Not if he's going to die.

1125
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,530
He's septic.

1126
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,710
He has a DNR...

1127
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,740
There's nothing

1128
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,740
you can do.

1129
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,970
I can be here with him.

1130
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,510
I have to be here.

1131
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,750
He's amazing.

1132
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,550
Never complains.

1133
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,450
Most people born with

1134
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,450
something like this

1135
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,820
would say, "Why me?"

1136
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,690
But Ben, he's always

1137
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,690
saying, "Why not me?"

1138
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,860
He taught me

1139
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,860
to be grateful

1140
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,860
for what I have.

1141
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,030
And I am.

1142
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,830
I understand.

1143
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,040
But you need

1144
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,040
these lungs, too.

1145
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,670
I still have time.

1146
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,810
Another pair will come up.

1147
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,810
Lisa...

1148
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,870
No.

1149
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,570
I'm sorry.

1150
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,010
No.

1151
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,930
Mind if I come in?

1152
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,630
Not at all.

1153
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,240
You okay?

1154
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,100
What, you mean

1155
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,100
that whole thing

1156
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,100
down there?

1157
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,920
I mean, I wish it hadn't

1158
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,920
come to that, but, uh...

1159
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,980
Yeah, I'm fine.

1160
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,080
Didn't look

1161
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,080
that way to me.

1162
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,330
Now, we've worked together

1163
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,330
a long time, Daniel.

1164
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,160
You usually

1165
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,160
empower your patients

1166
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,160
to make their own choices.

1167
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,090
Putting that woman

1168
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,090
on a psych hold?

1169
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,000
Sharon, I made

1170
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,000
a clinical decision

1171
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,600
for her own well-being.

1172
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,470
Don't know

1173
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,470
what to tell you.

1174
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,230
Look, I know watching CeCe

1175
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,230
go through treatment

1176
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,570
has been very hard on you.

1177
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,340
It's making you

1178
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,340
feel a little helpless.

1179
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,810
But...

1180
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,220
Bringing your emotions

1181
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,220
to work?

1182
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,990
I really don't like this.

1183
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,690
You have a better idea?

1184
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,930
You don't know

1185
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,930
how you're going

1186
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,930
to restart his heart.

1187
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,430
Robin's on the

1188
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,430
phone right now.

1189
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,800
She'll have answers

1190
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,800
for us soon.

1191
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,930
Robin.

1192
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,930
Not a cardiothoracic

1193
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,930
surgeon,

1194
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,130
not even an amiable

1195
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,130
country doctor.

1196
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,570
I trust her.

1197
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,120
Why isn't Lisa in surgery?

1198
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,920
You told her

1199
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,920
she was next up.

1200
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,180
She won't leave Ben.

1201
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,790
Not while he's still alive.

1202
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,510
Lisa, you and Ben have never

1203
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,510
been able to be together.

1204
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,020
But what if

1205
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,020
there was a way

1206
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,020
you could be?

1207
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,920
Not through

1208
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,920
a pane of glass.

1209
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,980
We could?

1210
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,120
Yes.

1211
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,220
It could only be

1212
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,220
for a minute, though,

1213
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,890
because you'd have to agree

1214
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,890
to take the new lungs.

1215
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,030
No.

1216
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,860
I can't.

1217
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,110
Don't you think Ben would

1218
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,110
want you to have them?

1219
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,250
I can't leave him now.

1220
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,510
It wouldn't be leaving him.

1221
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,110
It'd be giving him

1222
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,110
what you both have

1223
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,110
always wanted.

1224
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,590
Lisa, this is the memory

1225
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,590
you'll have for the rest

1226
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,590
of your life.

1227
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,190
The one moment

1228
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,190
you were truly together.

1229
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,200
Okay.

1230
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,900
Okay.

1231
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,160
Lisa, no.

1232
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,530
It's okay.

1233
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,440
It's okay.

1234
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,440
I promise, Ben.

1235
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,670
I love you, Ben.

1236
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,710
I love you.

1237
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,360
It's outrageous, I...

1238
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,520
What recourse do we have?

1239
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,260
My husband's talking

1240
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,260
to our lawyer.

1241
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,320
We're going to sue you.

1242
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,400
That won't be necessary.

1243
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,830
I'm releasing

1244
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,830
the psych hold.

1245
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,830
You can go home.

1246
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,360
What?

1247
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,310
I'm discharging you.

1248
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,310
You're free to go.

1249
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,070
Okay.

1250
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,210
Well, good luck.

1251
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,210
Hope you feel better.

1252
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,910
Follow up with

1253
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,910
her neurologist.

1254
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,520
Stay on top of

1255
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,520
those labs, and, um...

1256
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,650
Keep me updated

1257
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,650
as to her progress.

1258
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,530
Of course.

1259
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,530
Thank you.

1260
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,400
You know there's

1261
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,400
no published data

1262
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,870
on intracardiac pacemaker use

1263
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,870
in reimplanted hearts?

1264
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,360
I am aware.

1265
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,740
So do you have a plan

1266
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,740
for what to do

1267
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,740
if it doesn't catch?

1268
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,640
No.

1269
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,270
Great.

1270
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,120
All right, here we go.

1271
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,400
Well, will you

1272
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,400
look at that?

1273
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,680
All right, we still have

1274
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,680
a lot of work to do.

1275
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,150
Let's get him off bypass.

1276
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,150
Yes, Doctor.

1277
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,400
V-fib.

1278
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,740
He's DNR.

1279
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,740
Nothing more

1280
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,740
we can do.

1281
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,550
Time of death, 19:42.

1282
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,540
They were able

1283
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,540
to set his pelvis.

1284
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,440
They actually think

1285
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,440
he'll make a full recovery.

1286
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,500
Are you all right?

1287
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,340
I was worried

1288
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,340
about you today.

1289
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,780
Did it cloud my judgment...

1290
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,410
Maybe.

1291
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,750
But either way,

1292
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,750
there's no place

1293
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,750
for that here.

1294
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,320
Thank you.

1295
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,460
For caring.

1296
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,600
Lisa, I'm so sorry.

1297
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,810
But Ben has passed.

1298
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,740
Natalie!

1299
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,740
Yeah?

1300
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,740
You and I...

1301
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,810
We have some good memories.

1302
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,870
Don't we?

1303
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,120
Yes, we do.
