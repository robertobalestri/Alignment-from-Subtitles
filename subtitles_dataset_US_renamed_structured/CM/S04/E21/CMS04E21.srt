1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,590
All right, okay.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,400
Uh, coming.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,000
Morning.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,000
Hey.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,340
Almost ready to go?

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,340
Getting there.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,540
Emily's still in the bathroom.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,280
She's gonna make

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,280
us late again.

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,250
Ethan, hold on.

11
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,250
Em!

12
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,570
Hey!

13
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,490
Em, hurry up!

14
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,950
Can I just have, like,

15
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,950
20 more minutes, please?

16
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,220
We have to get to work.

17
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,390
Look, I'm covered in spit up.

18
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,390
I haven't showered in days.

19
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,450
I'm...

20
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,450
Look, I'm so exhausted.

21
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,260
Okay, Em,

22
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,260
take your time.

23
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,160
You're going to visit

24
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,160
Bernie, right?

25
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,160
Yeah.

26
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,330
We'll take Vincent

27
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,330
and meet you at the hospital.

28
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,370
Thank you so much, April.

29
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,070
Don't say it. I know.

30
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,800
Take Vincent so I can

31
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,800
finish getting ready.

32
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,240
Thank you. All right.

33
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,680
I saw that they

34
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,680
just put Sophie's surgery

35
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,680
on the schedule.

36
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,810
How's Phillip holding up?

37
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,510
Ah, he's trying

38
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,510
to stay positive.

39
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,250
He's looking forward

40
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,250
to being on the other

41
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,250
side of it, though.

42
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,380
Oh, yeah.

43
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,480
In other news,

44
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,480
a little birdie told me

45
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,480
it was your birthday today.

46
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,390
Oh, yeah? Did that

47
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,390
little birdie happen

48
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,390
to have long, dark hair?

49
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,860
Don't look at me.

50
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,860
I never reveal my sources.

51
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,230
Mmm-hmm.

52
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,230
So any plans tonight?

53
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,960
No, just dinner with Robin.

54
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,630
So you and Robin have been

55
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,630
spending some time together.

56
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,900
You thinking about rekindling?

57
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,930
Wow. You are just

58
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,930
brimming with curiosity

59
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,930
today, aren't you?

60
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,010
Mmm-hmm.

61
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,010
Maggie.

62
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,440
You want me

63
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,440
to turn the air on?

64
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,000
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

65
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,000
I always run hot.

66
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,910
Well, you got through

67
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,910
the polar vortex.

68
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,880
And now you just have

69
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,880
the sweltering Chicago summer

70
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,350
to look forward to.

71
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,150
I'm gonna skip town

72
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,150
before that heat wave hits.

73
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,750
What, you going

74
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,750
on some cruise

75
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,750
I don't know about?

76
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,920
Actually, I'm...

77
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,490
I'm headed back

78
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,490
to Minneapolis.

79
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,420
Oh, yeah?

80
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,420
Yeah.

81
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,790
What, for the weekend?

82
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,090
Umm...

83
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,160
I was gonna

84
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,160
fill you in later.

85
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,590
Hamline made me an offer

86
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,590
I couldn't refuse

87
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,000
to go back and teach,

88
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,000
so I'm going to tie up

89
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,540
some loose ends here

90
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,540
and then head back in a week.

91
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,940
Well... Well, what about...

92
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,940
What about the trial?

93
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,110
What about

94
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,110
your clinical trial?

95
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,250
They're gonna let me continue

96
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,250
my treatment back home.

97
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,380
It's good.

98
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,050
Congratulations.

99
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,050
Thank you.

100
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Guess it'll be good to sleep

101
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,680
in your own bed again.

102
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,090
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,090
And you know what?

104
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,890
I'm gonna get in that

105
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,890
claw-foot tub you tried

106
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,890
to fight me for.

107
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,200
You offered that woman

108
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,200
ten dollars more than I paid.

109
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,340
You ain't right.

110
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,340
That's a great tub.

111
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,480
Your echo report looks good.

112
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,840
You're gonna have to

113
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,840
continue cardiac rehab

114
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,400
for a couple of weeks.

115
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,050
But best guess,

116
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,050
you're going home tomorrow.

117
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
Well, thank God.

118
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,150
'Cause that chef

119
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,150
can't make a poached egg

120
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,150
to save his life.

121
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,780
All the money

122
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,780
I'm spending here,

123
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,290
this place should be

124
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,290
Michelin starred.

125
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,620
Look, Dad, I've gotta run,

126
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,620
but I'll be back to

127
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,620
check in later.

128
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,960
Hey, before you go...

129
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,860
Happy birthday.

130
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,070
Shocked I remembered?

131
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,830
Yeah, frankly.

132
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,370
Well, I will admit

133
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,370
that I almost forgot.

134
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,210
But Carlotta was cleaning out

135
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,210
the attic a few weeks ago

136
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,710
and she found your

137
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,710
old Ninja Turtle mask...

138
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,150
From my seventh birthday?

139
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,980
Yes.

140
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,980
Wow, yeah.

141
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,580
Mom made that Donatello

142
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,580
birthday cake from scratch.

143
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,650
She planned every detail.

144
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,650
You mean your nanny.

145
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,720
No, I mean Mom.

146
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,390
Mom was having

147
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,390
a depressive episode.

148
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,260
She'd been in bed for weeks.

149
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,130
That's not how I remember it.

150
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,860
That doesn't surprise me.

151
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,700
Now, what is that

152
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,700
supposed to mean?

153
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,740
You always paint me

154
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,740
as the absentee father

155
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,740
and your mother as the saint,

156
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,680
and I'm telling you

157
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,680
your nanny planned the party,

158
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,500
I paid for it,

159
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,970
and your mom never came.

160
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,810
Why do you feel the need

161
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,810
to disparage her?

162
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm not disparaging her.

163
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,080
Yes, you are.

164
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,020
No, I'm not!

165
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,020
You do this every time.

166
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,020
I'll... I'll come back later.

167
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,180
No, you stay. I'm leaving.

168
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,460
Need some help out here.

169
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,460
Got a patient down.

170
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,130
Get a gurney out there.

171
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,030
She's seizing.

172
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,030
She looks like

173
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,030
she's full term.

174
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,540
Must be eclamptic.

175
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,240
Lucy, get me ten grams

176
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,240
of magnesium.

177
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,110
On it.

178
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,110
Name's Desiree Parker.

179
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,580
She had just signed in.

180
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,580
Husband went to park the car.

181
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,620
Desiree, I'm Dr. Manning.

182
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,620
Can you tell me where you are?

183
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,420
What? What?

184
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,420
You're in a hospital.

185
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,620
You just had a seizure.

186
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,620
Let's get her

187
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,620
on the backboard.

188
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,680
Yes, Doctor.

189
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,720
Gonna get you into the ER.

190
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,360
All right, let's lift her

191
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,360
on my count.

192
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,360
Ready? One, two, three.

193
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,520
All right.

194
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,960
She's seizing again.

195
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,960
Lucy!

196
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,030
Excuse us.

197
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,030
Injecting magnesium.

198
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,740
The magnesium isn't working.

199
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,150
Get her

200
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,150
two milligrams of Ativan IM.

201
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,980
Let's check her vitals

202
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,980
and get her some oxygen.

203
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, there's the fetus

204
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,000
but she's not even close

205
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,000
to full term.

206
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,800
Maybe 20, 21 weeks.

207
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,840
But she's so big.

208
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,010
Whoa, that's all free fluid.

209
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,010
Maybe she's cirrhotic.

210
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,670
No, no, she has cancer.

211
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,370
My wife.

212
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,470
She has ovarian cancer.

213
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,110
Stage four.

214
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,090
Thanks.

215
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,000
What is it? What's wrong?

216
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,760
Honey.

217
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,760
It's okay.

218
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,600
Desi, your CT scan

219
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,600
shows that your cancer

220
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,840
has metastasized

221
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,840
to your brain.

222
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,300
Oh, God.

223
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,810
There's a large tumor

224
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,810
on your right temporal lobe.

225
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,510
That's what

226
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,510
caused your seizure.

227
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,280
I knew the risk I was taking

228
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,280
when I decided against

229
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,280
treatment.

230
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,290
Yeah, we, um...

231
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,090
Got the diagnosis

232
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,090
when we were three months

233
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,090
along with the pregnancy.

234
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,600
With Elijah.

235
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,400
That's his name.

236
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,460
I was already stage four.

237
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,300
It was highly unlikely that

238
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,300
treatment would be successful.

239
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,470
Unlikely, not impossible.

240
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,370
I didn't want any

241
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,370
interventions that could

242
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,370
harm the baby.

243
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,510
What are our options?

244
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,280
Well, given the size

245
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,280
and location of the tumor,

246
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,580
a craniotomy

247
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,580
is recommended to resect it.

248
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,190
Brain surgery?

249
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,190
That could hurt Elijah, right?

250
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,720
Well, they would take

251
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,720
every precaution,

252
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,200
but, yes, general anesthesia

253
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,200
does pose a small risk

254
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,200
for the fetus.

255
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,900
Then, no, I won't do it.

256
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,900
Desi, we agreed

257
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
not to take treatment

258
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
off the table completely,

259
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,940
especially as

260
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,940
circumstances evolve.

261
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,010
Could you give us some time

262
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,010
to discuss it?

263
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,510
Of course.

264
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,780
Getting dolled up.

265
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,780
Where you headed?

266
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,090
Having breakfast

267
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,090
with my sister.

268
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,230
Oh, Denise is in town?

269
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,230
Mmm-hmm.

270
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,850
Third time this month.

271
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,620
Little sneak's been

272
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,620
dating someone

273
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,620
in Streeterville.

274
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,470
Finally agreed to make

275
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,470
the introductions.

276
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,130
Does she...

277
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,870
Never mind.

278
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,600
No, spit it out.

279
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,450
Probably a dumb question,

280
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,450
but does she date

281
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,450
men or women?

282
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,620
Oh, Will.

283
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,620
Every trans woman

284
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,620
is different.

285
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,810
But Denise dates men.

286
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,190
Speaking of... Denise!

287
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,290
Look at you! You look awesome!

288
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,530
Stop it. Hey, Will.

289
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,570
Hi.

290
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,570
I'm serious.

291
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,170
She isn't lying.

292
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,500
Well, if I look good,

293
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,500
I owe it to Trevor.

294
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,100
We've been

295
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,100
on a low-carb kick.

296
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,010
Oh, no, you can thank

297
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,010
your folks for that.

298
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,510
I see good genes

299
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,510
run in the family.

300
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,700
Okay.

301
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,310
He's a keeper.

302
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,310
Trevor, this is Will Halstead.

303
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,940
Nice to meet you.

304
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,480
I got you covered. Have fun.

305
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,380
Thank you. Well, come on.

306
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,390
Yeah, good luck, man.

307
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,390
You're gonna need it

308
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,390
with those two.

309
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,820
Okay.

310
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,580
Ow.

311
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,520
Matt Jacobson,

312
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,520
14-year-old male.

313
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,690
Fell attempting

314
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,690
a skateboard trick.

315
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,690
It hurts!

316
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,490
Complaining of pain

317
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,490
to the left forearm.

318
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,490
Vitals stable.

319
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,060
All right.

320
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,060
You notify his parents?

321
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,060
Dad's right behind us.

322
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,160
Keep breathing, kid.

323
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,160
I know that it hurts.

324
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,640
Just try to keep breathing.

325
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,340
He was screaming his

326
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,340
head off the whole way here.

327
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,100
All right.

328
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,150
On my count. One, two, three.

329
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,580
Thank you, you guys.

330
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,750
Hey, Matt, did you put

331
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,750
your arms out in front

332
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,750
of you to break your fall?

333
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,120
I can't remember. Ow!

334
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,420
All right, easy there.

335
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,150
Breath sounds are normal.

336
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,150
Dad, did you see

337
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,150
what happened?

338
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,530
No, I was in the house.

339
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,220
I got to him as quick

340
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,220
as I could.

341
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,290
But I don't move so fast.

342
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,290
Yeah.

343
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,060
All right, Matt,

344
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,060
can you move your head for me?

345
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,500
My arm hurts so bad.

346
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,560
All right, just touch your

347
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,560
chin to your chest, then.

348
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,300
Make it stop hurting, please!

349
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,400
He's too distracted

350
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,400
to clear the C-spine.

351
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,500
Let's take care of his pain

352
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,500
and then we'll reassess.

353
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,770
Monique, get a line in

354
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,770
and give four of morphine.

355
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,480
No, no, no, I hate needles.

356
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,480
Can't you give me pills?

357
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,380
They're gonna take

358
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,380
a lot longer to work, bud.

359
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,550
I don't want a needle.

360
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,550
Just give him a pill. Please.

361
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,160
All right, fine.

362
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,160
Give 7.5 hydrocodone.

363
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,660
Once the pain subsides,

364
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,660
we'll do a chest x-ray,

365
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,430
AP and lateral x-rays

366
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,430
of both arms.

367
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,360
Be right back, okay?

368
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,030
It hurts.

369
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,860
Dr. Rhodes, you smell

370
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,860
alcohol on dad's breath?

371
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,800
Oh, yeah. He reeked of it.

372
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,100
It hurts!

373
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,580
Hey.

374
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
Just the lady

375
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
I was looking for.

376
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,250
Uh-oh. What's up?

377
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,380
You still friendly

378
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,380
with the chairman

379
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,090
of the anthropology department

380
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,090
at University of Chicago?

381
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,220
Yes, I just saw him

382
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,220
last weekend at a fundraiser

383
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,790
for the Boys

384
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,790
& Girls Club. Why?

385
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,800
Well, you know, they've been

386
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,800
trying to recruit CeCe

387
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,800
for years.

388
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,990
And I was just thinking...

389
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,990
Daniel.

390
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,400
What? Oh, come on.

391
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,130
They would jump

392
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,130
at the opportunity

393
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,130
to have her on the faculty.

394
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,330
And let's face it,

395
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,330
she should stay in Chicago

396
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,240
and stick with the same

397
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,240
medical team.

398
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,680
Why don't you just

399
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,680
tell her how you feel?

400
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,340
Do you have the number?

401
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,610
All right.

402
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,610
Send it to me.

403
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,820
Sent.

404
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,820
Thank you.

405
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,790
Emily should be here soon.

406
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,790
I'll hang

407
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,790
with him till then.

408
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,300
All right, I can take him.

409
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,190
He's still sleeping.

410
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,190
I got it.

411
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,930
Thank you.

412
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,130
Hey.

413
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,330
You got a pep in your step.

414
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,170
Trevor knock it out

415
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,170
of the park?

416
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,580
The guy's a prince.

417
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,740
I can't believe Denise

418
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,740
kept him hidden for so long.

419
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,510
Poor thing was so nervous,

420
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,510
she didn't eat a bite.

421
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,490
Well, maybe she was

422
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,490
worried her big sister

423
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,490
wouldn't approve.

424
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,280
I mean, you can be a little

425
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,280
judgmental at times.

426
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,190
I think you mean discerning.

427
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,420
Whatever. Where are you

428
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,420
going, anyway?

429
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,360
Forgot my phone in the car.

430
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,360
Be back in a sec.

431
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,560
All right.

432
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,080
Hey!

433
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,940
Denise!

434
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,910
Hey, Denise.

435
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,610
You all right?

436
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,610
I'm fine, really.

437
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,320
Your lip's bleeding.

438
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,320
Let me...

439
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,920
I said I'm fine.

440
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,920
I just need to call

441
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,920
me an Uber.

442
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,890
Listen, why don't

443
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,890
you come inside?

444
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,490
Let me

445
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,490
check you out properly.

446
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,960
Looks like you're

447
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,960
banged up pretty good.

448
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,260
I'm not coming inside, Will.

449
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,960
And you can't mention

450
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,960
this to Maggie. Promise me.

451
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,240
I won't mention it to Maggie.

452
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,170
But you gotta let me

453
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,170
examine you.

454
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,500
I don't...

455
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,900
Denise?

456
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,400
Whoa!

457
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,810
Denise.

458
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,940
Denise?

459
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,280
Denise? Oh, my God.

460
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,280
What happened?

461
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
She fainted.

462
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,990
Where? How?

463
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,530
And where's Trevor?

464
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,820
He had to, um...

465
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,060
I'll let her fill you in

466
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,060
when she's feeling better.

467
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,620
Is treatment four open?

468
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,340
Okay. Here, this way.

469
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,340
All right.

470
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,270
Given the kid's

471
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,270
description of what happened,

472
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,610
I'd expect a Colles

473
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,610
or Smith fracture.

474
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,770
But this is not

475
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,770
a fracture from a fall.

476
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,340
And with the bruising pattern,

477
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,380
I'd say he was struck

478
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,380
with something.

479
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,220
Like a cane.

480
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,020
You think his father did this?

481
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,150
I think there's

482
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,150
a strong possibility, yeah.

483
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,650
It's odd, though,

484
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,650
that he brought his son in.

485
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,250
I mean, usually they try

486
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,250
to hide the abuse

487
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,770
or delay seeking medical

488
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,770
treatment.

489
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,830
There's something off here,

490
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,830
Miss Goodwin. I know it.

491
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,200
Okay.

492
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,600
Pull social work in to do

493
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,600
an evaluation and have them

494
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,170
check for any pending

495
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,170
or prior claims of abuse,

496
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,940
but let's wait to involve DCFS

497
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,940
until we're absolutely sure.

498
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,040
Of course. Thank you.

499
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,040
All right.

500
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
Dr. Rhodes, Matt's requesting

501
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
more meds for the pain.

502
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,290
Really? Oh, come on.

503
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,190
That kid is 120 pounds

504
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,190
soaking wet.

505
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,250
He's had two tabs

506
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,250
of hydrocodone.

507
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,700
He should be high as a kite.

508
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,230
Do me a favor.

509
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,440
Get a new urine sample

510
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,440
and run a tox.

511
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,040
On it.

512
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,310
Caleb, I was just

513
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,310
headed to you.

514
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,680
Have you and Desi made

515
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,680
a decision about surgery?

516
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,710
Not exactly. Can we...

517
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,980
Sure.

518
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,880
My wife and I, we agreed

519
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,880
that if the cancer

520
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,880
progressed quickly

521
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,150
that she would reconsider

522
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,150
treatment.

523
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,930
The tumor in her brain,

524
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,930
it could be impairing

525
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,930
her judgment, right?

526
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Yes, it's a possibility,

527
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,200
but...

528
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,130
So maybe she can't

529
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,130
make this decision.

530
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,370
Caleb, I understand that

531
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,370
you're overwhelmed,

532
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,370
but Desi did appear to have

533
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,370
all of her faculties...

534
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,870
Hey, I know my wife.

535
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,800
She's not thinking clearly.

536
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,800
I'm telling you.

537
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,840
Okay, I will have the head of

538
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,840
psychiatry evaluate Desi.

539
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,010
Thank you.

540
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,990
You said she fainted.

541
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,990
What happened to her face?

542
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,190
Her lip is busted.

543
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,190
It looks like she got hit.

544
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,030
I told you you're gonna have

545
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,030
to talk to your sister.

546
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,330
Wait. Did Trevor do this?

547
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,940
So this is why you didn't

548
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,940
want us to meet.

549
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,280
You told her?

550
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,280
He didn't have to.

551
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,810
How long has Trevor been

552
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,810
putting his hands on you?

553
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,010
He hasn't. He just lost

554
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,010
his temper today.

555
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,420
It's my fault. I was

556
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,420
pushing his buttons.

557
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,290
We have to call the cops.

558
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,290
Don't!

559
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,690
Say anything and I'll deny it.

560
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,390
Why? What is wrong

561
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,390
with you, Denise?

562
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,690
No, I don't expect you

563
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,690
to understand, okay?

564
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,290
Look, Trevor

565
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,290
may not be perfect,

566
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,030
but at least

567
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,030
he loves me for me.

568
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,900
Loves you? This man

569
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,900
doesn't love you.

570
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,600
He preys on you.

571
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,000
He preys on you

572
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,000
because he can.

573
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,370
Mags, let me talk to you.

574
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,370
Look at your face!

575
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,370
Come on. Let's go.

576
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,010
Denise, sit tight. I'm gonna

577
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,010
have plastics come take

578
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,010
a look at that lip.

579
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,410
What?

580
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,410
Just listen.

581
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,980
You shoot from the hip

582
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,980
and we all love

583
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,980
that about you,

584
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,580
but maybe try

585
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,580
a softer approach.

586
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,680
Sometimes the truth hurts.

587
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,700
What's going on?

588
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,500
I couldn't find Emily.

589
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,500
She wasn't in Bernie's room.

590
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,840
He said she hasn't

591
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,840
come by yet.

592
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,010
I'll call her.

593
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,880
I did already.

594
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,880
She didn't pick up.

595
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,280
I left a voicemail.

596
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,280
She had a really rough night

597
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,280
with Vincent.

598
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,010
I don't think she slept

599
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,010
more than an hour.

600
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,380
I know it's a lot.

601
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,860
I just hope she's not falling

602
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,860
back to her old ways.

603
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,460
Well, she's made a lot of

604
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,460
strides these last few months.

605
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's try to give her

606
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,000
the benefit of the doubt.

607
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,520
All right.

608
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,330
I'll run Vincent down

609
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,330
to the daycare center,

610
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,100
see if they have

611
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,100
room for him.

612
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,100
Okay.

613
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,760
Hi, buddy. Hello.

614
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,910
Hey, Desi.

615
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,910
How are you feeling?

616
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,880
Okay. Just a bit,

617
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,880
um, drowsy.

618
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,550
That's from the Ativan.

619
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,550
Should wear off soon.

620
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,120
In the meantime, I wanted to

621
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,120
introduce you to Dr. Charles.

622
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,890
He's our head of psychiatry.

623
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,720
Psychiatrist. Why?

624
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,920
Desiree, I just wanna ask you

625
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,920
a couple of quick questions

626
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,920
if that's okay.

627
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,630
You can... Me... Desi.

628
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,560
I'm sorry?

629
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,560
Call me...

630
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,070
Bag her.

631
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,070
Desi!

632
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,140
What's going on?

633
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,140
Let's give them

634
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,140
some room.

635
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,410
Her right pupil is dilated

636
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,410
and sluggish.

637
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,510
I need to tube her

638
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,510
and send her to CT stat.

639
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,010
I suspect edema.

640
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,010
It's a swelling in the brain.

641
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,680
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

642
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,120
Do the surgery!

643
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,120
Mr. Parker...

644
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,280
I'm her surrogate

645
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,280
decision maker.

646
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,530
I said do it. Now!

647
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,500
Where are the pills?

648
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,900
I don't know

649
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,900
what you're talking about.

650
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,300
Did you take them already?

651
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,530
Just tell me.

652
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,530
Where are the pills?

653
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,500
Hey, hey.

654
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,500
What's going on in here?

655
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,970
Guy abused his son

656
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,970
and came here

657
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,970
to score opioids.

658
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,240
Are you insane?

659
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,830
I ran a tox on Matt.

660
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,900
He hasn't taken any

661
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,900
of the pills we've given him.

662
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,680
Meanwhile, I search

663
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,680
the Illinois Prescription

664
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,680
Database.

665
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,810
Turns out Mr. Jacobson

666
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,810
here has been flagged

667
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,810
as a frequent flier.

668
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,320
I swear to God I didn't lay

669
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,320
a hand on my son.

670
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,760
And I sure as hell didn't

671
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,760
take his pain meds!

672
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,820
Take a drug test

673
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,820
to prove it, then.

674
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,660
I don't have to prove

675
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,660
anything to you!

676
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,160
All right, look,

677
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,160
I have a better idea.

678
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,230
Why don't we all go speak

679
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,230
with Matt, all right?

680
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,460
Please.

681
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,410
I took the pills.

682
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,550
Dr. Rhodes ran

683
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,550
a tox screen, Matt.

684
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,310
They're not in your system.

685
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,710
So? Maybe the test was wrong.

686
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,620
We're going around in circles,

687
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,620
Miss Goodwin.

688
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,590
That's it. I'm calling Child

689
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,590
Protective Services.

690
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,390
No. No, my dad

691
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,390
never touched me.

692
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,950
Please don't call them.

693
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,790
They're right here.

694
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,160
Fine, he told

695
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,160
him to pocket 'em.

696
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,290
Dr. Rhodes.

697
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,830
How did you hurt

698
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,830
yourself today, Matt?

699
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,240
Did you really fall off

700
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,240
your skateboard?

701
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,840
Son. Just tell us the truth.

702
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,280
You won't get in trouble.

703
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,480
I slammed my arm in the door.

704
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,250
On purpose?

705
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,560
I'm so sorry, Dad.

706
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,770
I'm so sorry.

707
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,730
I just wanted to help you.

708
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,280
I got into

709
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,740
an awful car wreck

710
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,740
about ten years ago.

711
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,740
My back's been a mess

712
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,740
ever since.

713
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,920
Doc had me on Oxy,

714
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,920
which was working pretty well,

715
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,250
but then some new

716
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,250
government guidelines,

717
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,490
something came out.

718
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,890
Yes, the CDC introduced new

719
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,890
prescribing recommendations.

720
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,090
A response to

721
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,090
the opioid crisis.

722
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,570
With opioids, there is always

723
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,570
the concern with, um,

724
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,040
overdose or misuse.

725
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,700
Yeah, well, I wasn't misusing.

726
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,250
Hit up just about

727
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,250
every doctor in the city.

728
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,740
But no one would write me

729
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,740
a new prescription.

730
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,110
And how are you currently

731
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,110
managing your pain?

732
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,590
Drinking, mostly.

733
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,400
I thought I did

734
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,400
a better job hiding it.

735
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,560
But, God, I can't believe

736
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,560
he'd personally harm himself

737
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,870
to try and get me pills.

738
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,230
Well, Mr. Jacobson,

739
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,140
I'll give you the contact

740
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,140
information of a general

741
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,140
practitioner in Schaumburg.

742
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,610
I'm confident he'll be

743
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,610
able to help you.

744
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,110
I appreciate it.

745
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,110
Sure.

746
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,320
Mr. Jacobson,

747
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,250
for what it's worth,

748
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,250
I am very, very sorry.

749
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,930
I apologize, Miss Goodwin.

750
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,930
I just... I...

751
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,000
I can't believe that

752
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,000
I was so off base.

753
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,680
Well, I appreciate

754
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,680
your intent, Dr. Rhodes.

755
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,950
But next time just

756
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,950
ask more questions

757
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,950
before you start accusing.

758
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,350
Well, Denise,

759
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,350
your blood sugar's pretty low.

760
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,260
I suspect that's what

761
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,260
caused you to faint.

762
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,990
'Cause you haven't been

763
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,990
eating enough.

764
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,560
Thanks to Trevor. Am I right?

765
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,230
What, he told you

766
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,230
to lose weight?

767
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,000
Just lay off, okay?

768
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm gonna have a nurse

769
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,000
put an IV in.

770
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,040
Give you some fluids and bring

771
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,040
you a glass of orange juice.

772
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,480
Fine, but can I leave

773
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,480
after that, please?

774
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,880
Yeah, that should do it.

775
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,480
I'll send the nurse in now.

776
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,920
My sister needs protection

777
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,920
from that monster.

778
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,560
I want you to report what you

779
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,560
saw today to the police and...

780
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,030
Maggie, I can't do that.

781
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,030
Excuse me?

782
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,090
Look, I want to see

783
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,090
that prick behind bars, too.

784
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,260
But what if she's not ready

785
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,260
to leave him?

786
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,970
Which I don't think she is.

787
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,310
I think Denise will be

788
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,310
better off if we convince

789
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,310
her to report it herself

790
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,080
and walk away.

791
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,080
My sister won't do that!

792
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,650
But I got an idea.

793
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,590
Grab your coat

794
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,590
and meet me out front.

795
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,290
Daniel, do you believe

796
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,290
Mrs. Parker lacked

797
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,530
the capacity to refuse

798
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,530
brain surgery?

799
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,190
I never got a chance

800
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,190
to evaluate her.

801
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,000
But a tumor in that area

802
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,000
certainly has the potential

803
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,270
to affect reasoning,

804
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,270
understanding...

805
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,900
Desi has been consistent

806
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,900
in her refusal of treatment

807
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,240
since her initial diagnosis.

808
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,510
She also agreed to consider

809
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,510
additional treatment

810
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,840
if the disease progressed.

811
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,510
Well, is there any written

812
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,510
record explicitly stating

813
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,510
her wishes?

814
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,750
Just the advanced directive.

815
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,910
Which clearly establishes

816
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,910
her husband

817
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,820
as her surrogate

818
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,820
decision maker.

819
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,880
This isn't right.

820
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,860
Her husband is taking

821
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,860
advantage of the situation.

822
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,590
But doesn't the fact that she

823
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,590
granted him power

824
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,590
of attorney in the first place

825
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,190
demonstrate a bond of trust?

826
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,860
A bond that he is breaking

827
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,860
by completely disregarding

828
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,860
her wishes.

829
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,230
If we operate and anything

830
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,230
happens to the fetus...

831
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,170
I'm sorry, Dr. Manning,

832
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,730
but the advanced

833
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,730
directive stands.

834
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,480
Will you guys

835
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,480
excuse me really quick?

836
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,020
I will be right back, sorry.

837
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,410
Maggie! Hey, beautiful.

838
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,420
What do I owe the pleasure?

839
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,420
Don't you touch me.

840
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,090
Come near my sister again,

841
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,090
respond to a text,

842
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,220
answer a phone call,

843
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,220
and I will call the cops.

844
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,130
I don't know

845
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,130
what she told you,

846
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,030
but you know your sister.

847
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,030
She's a drama queen.

848
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,360
Don't you try me.

849
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,900
That's what you came

850
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,900
down here for?

851
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,340
Warn me to stay away?

852
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,470
That's right.

853
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,470
What's it gonna be?

854
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,580
Could have saved

855
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,580
yourselves a trip.

856
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,940
I was done with that

857
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,940
freak anyways.

858
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,850
You better back up...

859
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,790
Go ahead.

860
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,790
Take your shot.

861
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,610
Connor!

862
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,610
Hi, Carlotta.

863
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,490
Hi. Come inside.

864
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,680
Thank you.

865
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,600
Is this what

866
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,600
you're looking for?

867
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,530
Yeah, that's it. Thank you.

868
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,270
Hmm.

869
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,520
Carlotta, are there

870
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,520
any other albums

871
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,110
between '88 and '94?

872
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,180
Don't see any. Why?

873
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,560
Well, there's hardly

874
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,560
any pictures of my mom.

875
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,960
Your poor mother.

876
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,360
So much of the time

877
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,360
she wasn't feeling herself.

878
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,520
Hey, baby.

879
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,520
Call me back.

880
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,880
I didn't mean to...

881
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,880
Denise.

882
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,950
If you're here to lecture me,

883
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,950
you can save your breath.

884
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,390
I already signed

885
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,390
my discharge papers.

886
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,550
Trevor's not gonna pick up.

887
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,550
How do you know?

888
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,320
I went to talk to him.

889
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,320
You what?

890
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,560
You won't be hearing from him.

891
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,570
No, no. Trevor wouldn't...

892
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,190
He wouldn't run scared.

893
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,190
You're lying.

894
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,600
I told him I knew

895
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,600
about his abuse.

896
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,200
And I was never gonna

897
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,200
let him hurt you again.

898
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,710
You had no right.

899
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,710
Denise...

900
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,180
What did he say?

901
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,180
He said...

902
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,110
He said you meant

903
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,110
a lot to him.

904
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,280
He was really upset.

905
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,650
Devastated.

906
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,860
But I gave him no choice.

907
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,950
I told him that if he ever

908
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,950
spoke to you again,

909
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,530
I was gonna call the cops.

910
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,400
You stay out

911
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,400
of my life, Maggie.

912
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,730
Denise...

913
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,200
CeCe. Hey.

914
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,580
How did everything go

915
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,580
with your check up?

916
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,110
Good. Good, good.

917
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,280
Great. Listen.

918
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,150
Are you doing

919
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,150
anything tonight?

920
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,150
Do you have any plans?

921
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,350
No.

922
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,820
'Cause I am having dinner

923
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,330
with the head

924
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,330
of the anthropology

925
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,330
department at U of C.

926
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,490
Okay.

927
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,220
There's a position

928
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,220
opening up next semester.

929
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,530
So what's that

930
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,530
got to do with me?

931
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,930
Well, I just thought you'd

932
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,930
like to join us because

933
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,930
the position sounds great.

934
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,170
I mean, two classes

935
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,170
a semester, sabbatical

936
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,170
every three years,

937
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,570
you could...

938
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,570
You could write your book.

939
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,340
I already have

940
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,340
a position at Hamline.

941
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,000
I know, but this way

942
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,000
you could...

943
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,000
You could stay in Chicago.

944
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,240
You could keep working

945
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,240
with Dr. Singh.

946
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,280
Maybe I don't want to

947
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,280
stay in Chicago.

948
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,510
Have you ever thought of that?

949
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,420
Damn, Danny.

950
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,420
Sometimes you don't

951
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,420
know when to quit.

952
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,330
Can you heat up his bottle?

953
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,330
It's on the top shelf

954
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,330
in the fridge.

955
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,730
You got it.

956
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,440
Ethan? Come here.

957
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,940
All of Emily's clothes

958
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,940
are gone.

959
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,540
So is her suitcase.

960
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,030
Dr. Charles?

961
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,870
You know where

962
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,870
Dr. Manning is?

963
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,970
I think she's

964
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,970
with another patient.

965
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,840
But they should be

966
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,840
coming to prep Desi

967
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,840
for surgery very soon.

968
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,400
No, no, it's not that.

969
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,310
Without the operation, Desi's

970
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,310
never gonna wake up, is she?

971
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,910
It's unlikely.

972
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,410
So she'd lose the baby, right?

973
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,250
Well, not necessarily.

974
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,520
Plan would be to continue

975
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,520
to treat the swelling

976
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,520
in her brain with steroids

977
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,030
which should allow her

978
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,030
to remain on the ventilator

979
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,030
long enough

980
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,030
to deliver via C-section

981
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,930
once the fetus

982
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,930
becomes viable in a few weeks.

983
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,160
You mean she'd become

984
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,160
one human incubator.

985
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,860
You know, that's not

986
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,860
the term that I would use.

987
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,270
But, um...

988
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,240
I know what she would

989
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,240
want me to do.

990
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,710
I just, uh...

991
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,820
You're terrified.

992
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,890
Desi and I were

993
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,890
just kids when we met.

994
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,690
Freshman year of college.

995
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,130
You know, we've really

996
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,130
grown up together.

997
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,870
You know, we've seen each

998
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,870
other through everything and

999
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,210
she knows me

1000
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,210
better than anyone.

1001
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,110
Yeah.

1002
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,720
And you know her

1003
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,720
better than anyone.

1004
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,380
Which is why she trusted you

1005
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,380
to become her voice

1006
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,020
when she was no longer able

1007
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,020
to speak for herself.

1008
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,320
And, Caleb, look.

1009
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,060
Letting go of someone that

1010
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,060
you love when every instinct

1011
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,830
is telling you

1012
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,830
to hold on, to fight,

1013
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,570
I mean, it's the hardest thing

1014
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,570
in the world.

1015
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,670
But Desi knew that you

1016
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,670
were up to the task.

1017
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,540
Now you just have to

1018
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,540
come to believe

1019
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,140
that you are, too.

1020
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,730
Mags?

1021
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,700
Are you okay?

1022
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,350
Me and Denise...

1023
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,820
We'd just gotten close again.

1024
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,130
And now...

1025
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,030
I probably lost her for good.

1026
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,910
Clear!

1027
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,450
Dad?

1028
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,450
Epi.

1029
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,080
Charge again to 200.

1030
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,080
What happened?

1031
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,390
We don't know. He flipped into

1032
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,390
V-fib. Might have had an MI.

1033
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,450
Charging. Charged.

1034
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,450
Clear.

1035
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,160
Epi, charge to 200.

1036
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,560
I'm taking over.

1037
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,690
Charged.

1038
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,690
Clear.

1039
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,800
Asystole.

1040
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,800
Epi.

1041
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,510
Meds are in.

1042
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,840
Come on!

1043
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,450
Come on, Dad! Come on!

1044
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,350
Come on!

1045
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,980
Connor, he'd already

1046
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,980
been down ten minutes

1047
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,980
by the time you got here.

1048
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,920
Connor.

1049
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,550
No!

1050
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,220
No.

1051
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,800
Time of death, 17:42.

1052
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,010
Hi.

1053
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,380
We'll be moving Desi

1054
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,380
up to pre-op

1055
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,690
and Dr. Abrams

1056
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,690
will be waiting

1057
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,690
for us up there.

1058
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,630
No.

1059
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,630
I'm sorry?

1060
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,220
No surgery.

1061
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,400
Can you

1062
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,400
give us a moment?

1063
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,430
Caleb, are you sure?

1064
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,860
Yeah.

1065
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,040
The cancer took everything

1066
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,040
away from Desi.

1067
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,550
But this is the one thing

1068
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,550
she was determined

1069
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,350
not to let it touch.

1070
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,280
She's been so brave.

1071
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,790
For me, for Elijah.

1072
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:54,660
The least I can do is try to

1073
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:54,660
have an ounce of her courage.

1074
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,580
Em, it's me again.

1075
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,580
Call me back.

1076
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,320
Took a lot of rocking

1077
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,320
but Vincent's finally asleep.

1078
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,960
She still not picking up?

1079
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,960
No.

1080
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,660
I'm gonna talk

1081
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,660
to Bernie tomorrow

1082
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,360
and let him know Emily's gone.

1083
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,570
And after tonight,

1084
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,570
I'll keep Vincent at my place

1085
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,700
till... Till Bernie's

1086
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,700
released.

1087
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,570
The baby can stay here.

1088
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,210
April, no.

1089
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,210
What?

1090
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,150
I already know his routine.

1091
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,150
Hey.

1092
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,680
His stuff is here.

1093
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,680
Vincent's not your

1094
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,680
responsibility.

1095
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,450
It's no problem. Really.

1096
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,620
Listen...

1097
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,220
I'm not sure how long

1098
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,220
this is gonna last.

1099
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,530
Even after Bernie's out

1100
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,530
of the hospital, the guy...

1101
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,770
Guy doesn't have a job.

1102
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,000
If Emily doesn't come back,

1103
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,400
Vincent may be with me

1104
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,400
for the foreseeable future.

1105
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,270
With us.

1106
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,300
I'm not gonna let you

1107
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,300
do this alone.

1108
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,040
April...

1109
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,040
What?

1110
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,420
Anyone else would have

1111
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,040
bailed on this whole mess

1112
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,090
a long time ago.

1113
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,850
But you're still here.

1114
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,930
Because it's you, Ethan.

1115
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,380
I was coming

1116
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,380
to tell my dad that...

1117
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,980
He was right.

1118
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,960
And that my mother wasn't

1119
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,960
at my seventh birthday party.

1120
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,290
In fact, she...

1121
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,600
She wasn't there

1122
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,600
for most of my life.

1123
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,960
I turned her into this

1124
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,430
doting, perfect mother.

1125
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,180
Turns out it was all fiction.

1126
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,610
All these years,

1127
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,610
I blamed my dad for her death.

1128
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,920
I thought that it was his

1129
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,920
cheating that drove her

1130
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,920
to kill herself.

1131
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,190
Hey. Hey.

1132
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,220
You were just trying

1133
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,220
to make sense of it.

1134
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,100
What else am I inventing?

1135
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,050
I'll go check on Vincent.

1136
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,990
Ethan... Oh, what's going on?

1137
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,050
Where have you been?

1138
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,930
Look, I'm so sorry.

1139
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,930
I was feeling

1140
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,930
really overwhelmed

1141
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,470
and I kinda freaked out.

1142
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,760
You ditched your son.

1143
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,770
I know it was really

1144
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,770
irresponsible for me

1145
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,770
to just take off,

1146
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,000
but I only made it

1147
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,000
to St. Louis

1148
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,000
before turning back.

1149
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,840
I couldn't leave Vincent.

1150
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,180
Hey, sweetie. It's Mama.

1151
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,180
Are you ready

1152
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,180
to go for a ride?

1153
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,910
Do you know what time it is?

1154
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,910
Where are you going?

1155
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,010
Back to the hospital

1156
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,010
to see Bernie.

1157
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,420
ICU's no place for a baby.

1158
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,880
It's fine.

1159
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,510
No. Vincent's staying here.

1160
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,450
Excuse me?

1161
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,380
Give me my son.

1162
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,380
You can't keep him from me.

1163
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,490
No, I'm not keeping

1164
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,490
him from you.

1165
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,220
But Vincent needs consistency.

1166
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,230
Em, this is no kind of life

1167
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,230
for Vincent, all right?

1168
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,100
You need to come up

1169
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,100
with a plan.

1170
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,230
All right, all right.

1171
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,170
I'll put him back to bed

1172
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,170
and stay here tonight.

1173
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,040
If that's okay

1174
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,040
with you, April.

1175
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,810
Yeah, of course.

1176
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,310
And in the morning

1177
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,310
I'll figure something out.

1178
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,750
With or without Bernie.

1179
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,280
I promise.

1180
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,520
Oh, honey.

1181
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,240
Hey. Hey.

1182
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,070
Hey.

1183
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,180
I wasn't sure that

1184
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,180
you were gonna show.

1185
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,410
So what's up?

1186
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,710
Um...

1187
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,620
So that's a really...

1188
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,830
That's a good situation

1189
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,830
at Hamline.

1190
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,830
Yeah.

1191
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,090
Yeah, yeah.

1192
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,090
Do that. Right?

1193
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,830
Yeah.

1194
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,410
What's this?

1195
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,450
You're resigning from Med.

1196
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,290
Caroline, these last

1197
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,290
few months with you,

1198
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,160
I don't... I don't understand

1199
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,160
it. It's crazy.

1200
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,960
It's felt...

1201
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,960
It's felt like...

1202
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,800
Like coming home.

1203
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,640
I wanna go with you.

1204
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,370
Oh, Danny.

1205
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,700
I want to marry you.

1206
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,380
Again.

1207
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,110
I lied.

1208
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,220
There was no...

1209
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,960
There was no offer

1210
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,960
from Hamline.

1211
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,650
They didn't ask me

1212
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,650
to come back.

1213
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,790
They didn't?

1214
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,790
No.

1215
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,160
I found out a couple days ago

1216
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,740
that my lymphoma

1217
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,740
is progressing

1218
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,510
and the clinical trial

1219
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,510
isn't working

1220
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,940
and there's nothing more

1221
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,940
they can do.

1222
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,700
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1223
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,110
I shouldn't have lied

1224
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,110
about any of that.

1225
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,980
I just thought that

1226
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,980
it would be better

1227
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,980
for everyone if I just left.

1228
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,050
I want to be there.

1229
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,820
For all of it. All of it.

1230
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,390
You know, in sickness

1231
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,390
and in health?

1232
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,420
If you'll have me.

1233
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,760
Please don't make me

1234
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,760
get down on one knee.

1235
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,100
I don't think I'd ever

1236
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,100
be able to get back up.
