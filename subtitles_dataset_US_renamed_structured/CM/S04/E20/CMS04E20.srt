1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,030
Will!

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,300
Owen! Hi!

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,230
Oh, you're getting so big.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,040
Might be time for you

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,040
to start playing football.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,210
No, Mom wants me

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,210
to protect my brain.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,750
Smart lady, your mom.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,750
Where is she?

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,780
Um, Natalie's in the cafÃ©.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,150
She's just getting us

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,150
some coffee really quick,

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,490
so I'm watching Owen.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,320
I'm Phillip Davis.

15
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,960
Yeah, Will Halstead.

16
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,960
We haven't officially met.

17
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,400
Natalie and I,

18
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,400
we work together.

19
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,660
She's told me about you.

20
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,800
Good things, I hope.

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,790
Of course.

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,770
How's your daughter?

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,770
She's doing her best.

24
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,910
We're here for

25
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,910
a surgery counsel,

26
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,410
and I suggested Dr. Rhodes.

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,980
Yeah, he's one of the best.

28
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,980
You're in good hands.

29
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,550
Phillip is gonna teach me

30
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,550
how to ride a horse.

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,910
He is?

32
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,550
Yeah, I own

33
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,550
a ranch in, uh...

34
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,550
In Texas.

35
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,320
Ain't that

36
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,320
right, partner?

37
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,520
Yee-haw.

38
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,620
Yee-haw!

39
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,750
Oh, hey, Will.

40
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,750
Did you guys meet?

41
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,760
Yeah, just now.

42
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,760
Thank you.

43
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,960
All right, come on, Owen,

44
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,960
let's get you to daycare,

45
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,960
buddy.

46
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,770
Come on.

47
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,770
See you later,

48
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,770
little man.

49
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,730
No, I want to

50
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,730
play with you.

51
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,970
Some other time, bud.

52
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,840
There you go.

53
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,970
Yeah.

54
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,810
Let's go.

55
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,090
Will, it was great

56
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,090
meeting you.

57
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,180
Yeah, you too.

58
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,850
I'll see you at work.

59
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,230
See you.

60
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,230
Are you ready to go?

61
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,290
All right, bud.

62
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,500
This is Gaia.

63
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,500
She won't let us

64
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,500
treat her.

65
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,470
No visible injuries,

66
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,470
but she's been screaming

67
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,330
in pain the whole ride over

68
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,330
and wouldn't tell us why.

69
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,030
Gaia, I'm Dr. Choi.

70
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,170
Oh, yeah. She's

71
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,170
combative, too.

72
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,710
Is she under arrest?

73
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,710
We'll see.

74
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,080
We raided a flophouse

75
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,080
after neighbors complained

76
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,080
of a smell.

77
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,510
Drug den?

78
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,510
Looks like it.

79
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,410
All right,

80
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,410
let's transfer her

81
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,410
on my count.

82
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,810
One, two, three.

83
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,410
Any idea what she's on?

84
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,410
Not a clue, but it's lethal.

85
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,550
We've got 10 dead bodies,

86
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,550
only two survivors.

87
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,090
Gaia and another

88
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,090
woman, Meadow.

89
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,320
She's in the ambo

90
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,320
behind us.

91
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,320
I'll go get her.

92
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,480
Gaia, I can see

93
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,480
you're in pain,

94
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,220
but I can't help you

95
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,220
if you don't help me.

96
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,720
Dr. Choi?

97
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,660
What kind of drug does that?

98
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,830
Gaia, what did you take?

99
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,400
This is Burgess.

100
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,300
Meadow, keep looking

101
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,300
at me, all right?

102
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,500
Keep breathing.

103
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,770
It burns!

104
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,410
I'm on fire!

105
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,350
All right,

106
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,350
let's transfer her

107
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,350
on my count.

108
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,780
Ready? One, two, three.

109
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,760
All right, let's get

110
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,760
a urine and blood toxin,

111
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,380
a CBC, CMP,

112
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,380
a chest X-ray,

113
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,380
and an EKG.

114
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,450
No! I don't

115
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,450
want your help!

116
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,320
Oh. Get her.

117
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,020
Meadow?

118
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,590
She's not putting

119
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,590
any weight on her legs.

120
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,690
Leave me alone.

121
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,700
Meadow, you do that again,

122
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,700
I'm gonna need to put you

123
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,700
in restraints.

124
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,760
Don't touch me!

125
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,640
Meadow.

126
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,640
No! I said don't touch me!

127
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,590
Gaia, this would go

128
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,590
so much easier for you

129
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,220
if you just talked to me.

130
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,000
Just tell me

131
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,000
what drug you took,

132
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,970
and we can forget about all

133
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,970
my other questions for now.

134
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,470
Would you let us take

135
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,470
a little urine sample

136
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,010
so we can figure it out

137
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,010
for ourselves?

138
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,220
Okay. No IV, no monitor,

139
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,220
no blood, no urine.

140
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,890
Look, you're clearly

141
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,890
very uncomfortable.

142
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,480
At least let me give you

143
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,480
something for the pain.

144
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,510
Gaia has pronounced

145
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,510
hyperesthesia.

146
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,240
Excruciating pain

147
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,240
from the lightest touch.

148
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,780
Even a slight breeze

149
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,780
against her skin.

150
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,310
So does Meadow.

151
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,440
But she also has

152
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,440
lower extremity paresis.

153
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,150
And still no idea what drug

154
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,150
we're dealing with?

155
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,450
Whatever it is, it's going

156
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,450
after the nervous system,

157
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,150
and it'll be days before

158
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,150
the county sends us

159
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,820
the autopsies

160
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,820
on the other victims.

161
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,980
You get anywhere?

162
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,290
They won't say anything.

163
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,360
And no guarantee of

164
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,360
doctor-patient confidentiality

165
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,520
would put them at ease?

166
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,000
They turned down morphine.

167
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,470
I'm guessing they could

168
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,470
care less about HIPAA.

169
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,160
So what do we do now?

170
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,110
They're cognizant,

171
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,110
responsive.

172
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,770
They have the right

173
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,770
to refuse care.

174
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,330
Hopefully these young women

175
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,330
will change their minds

176
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,970
and accept treatment.

177
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,510
Seriously? Wait and see

178
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,510
is the best we can do?

179
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,770
Our hands are tied.

180
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Well, keep me posted.

181
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,850
Now, I know that

182
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,850
I have given you

183
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,850
a ton of information,

184
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,020
so if you get home,

185
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,020
you feel overwhelmed,

186
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,570
and you realize

187
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,570
you have some questions,

188
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,120
just give me a call.

189
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,100
Okay. I'm nervous.

190
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,340
Sophie's gonna do

191
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,340
just fine.

192
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,970
Okay.

193
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,840
Damn, I am saying...

194
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,840
Get on that... Get me some...

195
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,810
Hey, hey. What's going on?

196
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,750
I can't breathe.

197
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,750
Okay.

198
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,550
What are you doing

199
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,550
all the way up here?

200
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,880
Why didn't you go

201
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,880
to the ED?

202
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,320
Your lungs sound junky.

203
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,050
How are your legs?

204
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,690
Uh, swollen.

205
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,990
All right.

206
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,990
Yeah.

207
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,890
We're gonna admit you

208
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,890
to the CICU.

209
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,930
Let's get stat labs,

210
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,930
chest X-ray, EKG, and echo.

211
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,020
Mmm-hmm.

212
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,020
Come on. Here we go.

213
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,430
Yeah, I feel like

214
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,430
I did before my surgery.

215
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,400
I thought Dr. Bekker

216
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,400
fixed my ASD.

217
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,110
Yeah, so did I.

218
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,300
I met Natalie's boyfriend,

219
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,300
Phillip, this morning.

220
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,450
He told Owen he owns

221
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,450
a cattle ranch.

222
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,110
Okay.

223
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,390
You ever seen

224
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,390
his hands?

225
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,390
They're smooth.

226
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,950
Like, manicured.

227
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,950
No calluses.

228
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,390
So people with pretty hands

229
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,390
can't own livestock?

230
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,460
Come on. No way a guy

231
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,460
with hands like that

232
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,460
owns a ranch.

233
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,220
Or he just wears gloves

234
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,220
when he works,

235
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,400
like we do,

236
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,400
all day long.

237
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,700
I don't buy it.

238
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,910
I think he's lying and using

239
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,910
Owen to get close to Natalie.

240
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,840
I think you overthink things.

241
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,470
Hey.

242
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,950
It was nice to see Owen.

243
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,150
Been awhile.

244
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,530
Yeah, he was

245
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,530
excited to see you.

246
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,360
Phillip seems like

247
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,360
a nice guy.

248
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,960
He is. Thanks.

249
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,460
I mean, he must be nice

250
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,460
if you're bringing him

251
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,460
around Owen.

252
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,190
Excuse me?

253
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,740
You've been dating,

254
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,740
what, six weeks now?

255
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,770
It took you a heck

256
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,770
of a lot longer to let me

257
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,770
get close to Owen

258
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,900
and we'd been

259
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,900
working together

260
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,900
for years by then.

261
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,310
You know, I don't need

262
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,310
to defend my parenting

263
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,310
choices to you.

264
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,980
Honestly, though, how well

265
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,980
do you really know him?

266
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,610
Okay, Dr. Halstead,

267
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,610
you have a patient in Six.

268
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,530
Hi. I'm Dr. Halstead.

269
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,670
Vasiley Qipaqli?

270
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,960
Butchered it, didn't I?

271
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,070
You got close.

272
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,070
Just call him Vee.

273
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,070
It's easier.

274
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,640
Uh, I'm his cousin,

275
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,640
Brandon Wycoff.

276
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,840
Nice to meet you.

277
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,140
So, Vee, what happened?

278
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,750
He's visiting me

279
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,750
from Moldova.

280
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,410
He knows, like,

281
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,410
10 words of English.

282
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,380
Yeah, that's okay.

283
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,380
We can get a translator.

284
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,650
Well, good luck.

285
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,930
Most people there

286
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,930
speak Russian or Romanian.

287
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,830
He's from the South.

288
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,830
He speaks Gagauz.

289
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,830
It's just better

290
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,830
if I do the talking.

291
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,930
Long story short,

292
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,930
he fell in the shower.

293
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,990
All right.

294
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,340
Look at the back

295
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,340
of your head.

296
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,870
Ah.

297
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,540
Minor head laceration.

298
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,540
Doesn't even need a stitch.

299
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,240
Yeah, hey...

300
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,240
Anything hurt?

301
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,310
Pain?

302
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,350
Oh. I okay.

303
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,020
Okay, good.

304
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,650
Yeah.

305
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,590
I want to get an X-ray.

306
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,760
But I think the arm

307
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,760
is just bruised.

308
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,820
There's nothing internal?

309
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,700
I'm not seeing

310
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,700
anything concerning.

311
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, thank God.

312
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,830
If he's a no-go,

313
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,830
I'm screwed.

314
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,400
Sorry?

315
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,730
Oh.

316
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,400
That came out wrong.

317
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,470
Um...

318
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,950
Fistula for dialysis.

319
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,090
End-stage renal disease?

320
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,780
Yeah.

321
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,890
My only hope

322
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,890
is a new kidney.

323
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,950
Luckily, he's donating me

324
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,950
one of his.

325
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,760
I love you, cuz.

326
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,330
Meadow,

327
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,330
these are the same lesions

328
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,330
we found on Gaia.

329
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,580
You're getting worse.

330
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,580
Please just let us help you.

331
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,310
No.

332
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,380
Dr. Choi, come quick!

333
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,610
Gaia.

334
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,390
She's not breathing.

335
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,390
No pulse. Ventilator.

336
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,590
I'll take a quick look.

337
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,400
Asystole. She's gone.

338
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,600
Time of death, 11:10.

339
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,170
I only left her

340
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,170
for a few minutes.

341
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,580
I didn't hear her, I swear.

342
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,670
It's not your fault.

343
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,850
She wouldn't let us

344
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,850
put on the monitors.

345
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,750
She killed herself?

346
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,000
Suicide? Why?

347
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,490
All I can come up with is,

348
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,490
the pain must've been

349
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,490
too much to bear.

350
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm gonna

351
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,000
have to imagine.

352
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,590
Meadow's going through

353
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,590
the same thing.

354
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,300
I'm sorry, Ethan.

355
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,300
Yeah.

356
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,910
Dr. Manning?

357
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,910
Yeah.

358
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,310
We ordered a postmortem

359
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,310
tox screen for Gaia.

360
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,180
Hopefully it'll show us

361
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,180
what drug we're dealing with.

362
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,850
Yeah, but I'm not so sure

363
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,850
we're dealing with

364
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,850
a drug anymore.

365
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,310
Look at all this hair.

366
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,420
Is that from when Ethan

367
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,420
pulled off the bag?

368
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,360
Yeah, but there's

369
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,360
too much of it.

370
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,950
I can't think of

371
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,950
a recreational drug

372
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,650
that would account

373
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,650
for this amount of hair loss.

374
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,830
Heavy metal toxin

375
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,830
or poison?

376
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,730
That run-down house

377
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,730
where they found them?

378
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,830
Any number of contaminants

379
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,830
could be in there.

380
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,640
All right, I'll have the labs

381
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,640
expand Gaia's blood tests,

382
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,370
search for

383
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,370
heavy metals and toxins

384
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,370
as well as other drugs.

385
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,070
But, you know,

386
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,070
it still doesn't add up.

387
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,240
If neither Gaia or Meadow

388
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,240
were taking an illegal drug,

389
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,080
why were they so adamant

390
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,080
about refusing treatment?

391
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,120
Patient's middle name?

392
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,420
Is that really necessary?

393
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,420
I never put mine

394
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,420
on anything.

395
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,030
Okay. Date of birth.

396
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,650
I don't know, I...

397
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,490
I'm 30.

398
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,000
He's a year

399
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,000
younger than me,

400
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,000
maybe two.

401
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,600
Is everything okay?

402
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,600
Yes.

403
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,740
The intake form

404
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,740
has a few blank boxes.

405
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,860
More than a few.

406
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,940
Look, the paperwork

407
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,940
is irrelevant.

408
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,500
I'm covering the costs.

409
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,580
Billing is still

410
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,580
going to want information.

411
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,380
Cash is king. I'm sure

412
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,380
they'll make an exception.

413
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,510
Are we done?

414
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,450
Thanks, Leah.

415
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,600
Kind of shooting

416
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,600
the messenger,

417
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,600
don't you think?

418
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,800
I'll buy her something

419
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,800
from the gift shop.

420
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,290
Vee's X-ray?

421
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,960
No fracture.

422
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,230
Great.

423
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,640
We can go.

424
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,840
You all right?

425
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,210
I'm exhausted.

426
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,050
Kidney failure

427
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,050
will do that to you.

428
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,470
I bet.

429
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,490
Transplant is next week

430
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,490
at East Mercy.

431
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,250
I'm supposed to be resting,

432
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,250
keeping my stress level low.

433
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,290
I brought you to Chicago

434
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,290
to cure me, not make it worse.

435
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,120
I'm sorry.

436
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,520
Let's go.

437
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,940
Hold on. Let me take

438
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,940
a look at you first.

439
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,070
I really am okay.

440
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,070
I have my own nephrologist.

441
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,130
He'll make a house call.

442
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,310
End-stage renal disease,

443
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,310
I suspect they'll just

444
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,310
send you to an ED for labs.

445
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,320
Yeah, you're probably right.

446
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,320
That's been the drill.

447
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,150
All right, but I want

448
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,150
my doctor in the loop.

449
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,690
I'll have my assistant

450
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,690
reach out to the hospital

451
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,690
and set everything up.

452
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,560
Works for me.

453
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,560
I'll send someone in

454
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,560
to get you registered.

455
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,060
We're gonna stay.

456
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,930
Hey.

457
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,300
I heard about

458
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,300
your patient.

459
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,900
You all right?

460
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,370
Yeah.

461
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,140
Emily and Bernie are here.

462
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,140
Bernie's not feeling well.

463
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,150
You are up, but I'll

464
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,150
get another doctor

465
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,380
if you need

466
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,380
a few more minutes.

467
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,310
I got it.

468
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,620
Okay. Treatment three.

469
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,810
Be nice.

470
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,460
It's okay, Bernie,

471
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,460
we'll find something else.

472
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,970
I know, baby.

473
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,970
You're so good to me.

474
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,970
I love you.

475
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,390
Hey, guys.

476
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,390
Hey.

477
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,800
What's going on?

478
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,470
Emily just found

479
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,470
a really good apartment,

480
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,470
but it was a little pricey.

481
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,910
Bernie, honey, I think he's

482
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,910
talking about your stomach.

483
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,080
Oh, right, yeah, I'm, uh...

484
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm a little bloated.

485
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,550
Yeah, he's got

486
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,550
a fever, too.

487
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,150
Belly's really distended.

488
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,150
How long has it been this way?

489
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,410
Couple of days.

490
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,910
All right, well,

491
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,910
we'll get some labs

492
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,820
and a CT abdomen,

493
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,820
then go from there.

494
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,920
So you guys are

495
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,920
getting an apartment.

496
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,030
Trying to.

497
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,030
That's good.

498
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
So everything's settled

499
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
with your wife?

500
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,470
Ethan.

501
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,470
Okay, then.

502
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,770
I'll go put in

503
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,770
the order for your tests.

504
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,630
Hey there, Vincent.

505
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm looking

506
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,640
right at it.

507
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,020
Even my father still has

508
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,020
a left-to-right shunt

509
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,080
through a patent

510
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,080
atrial septal defect.

511
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,890
And I'm telling you

512
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,890
it wasn't there

513
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,690
after I placed

514
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,690
the intracardiac patch.

515
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,430
Negative bubble test.

516
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,430
His post-op echo was good.

517
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,490
I fixed the problem.

518
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,130
Clearly, you didn't.

519
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,130
You're incredible.

520
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,530
You've made it clear you think

521
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,530
I'm a horrible person.

522
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
Now I'm a lousy

523
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
surgeon as well?

524
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,260
No, you're

525
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,260
an excellent surgeon,

526
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,970
which is why

527
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,970
this is so glaring.

528
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,010
I take it that's your

529
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,010
passive-aggressive way

530
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,480
of saying I was careless?

531
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,700
Or worse?

532
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,220
However it happened,

533
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,220
my father still needs

534
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,220
a repeat repair of his ASD

535
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,320
and I am going to advise him

536
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,320
to have Dr. Latham perform it.

537
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,950
At first, I thought

538
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,950
your attacks on me

539
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,230
were just you

540
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,230
blowing off steam

541
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,230
after we broke up.

542
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,930
But now I really think

543
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,930
you're losing your mind.

544
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,340
Gaia's body

545
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,340
tested positive

546
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,010
for a highly toxic substance

547
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,010
called thallium.

548
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,250
There may have been

549
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,250
traces of it in the house

550
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,440
where you all were staying.

551
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,350
The good news is,

552
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,350
there is an antidote.

553
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,320
Prussian blue.

554
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,460
It stops the thallium

555
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,460
from being absorbed

556
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,460
into your body.

557
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,500
Meadow, do you understand

558
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,500
what Dr. Manning

559
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,500
is saying to you?

560
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,160
Yes.

561
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,970
Are you willing

562
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,970
to take the medicine?

563
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,040
If you don't take

564
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,040
the Prussian blue soon,

565
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,710
you will die from this.

566
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,080
Will you leave me alone

567
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,080
if I take the pills?

568
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,280
Promise.

569
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,450
Okay.

570
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,220
I'll take them.

571
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,390
Okay.

572
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,730
Here you go.

573
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,980
We finally got

574
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,980
through to her.

575
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,720
Yeah, but why?

576
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,720
I mean why now

577
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,720
all of a sudden?

578
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,980
I'll take the win.

579
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,460
Would you do me a favor?

580
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,460
Keep a very close eye on her?

581
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,590
Sure.

582
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,590
Thank you.

583
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
Hey, let me ask you.

584
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,430
What's going on with

585
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,430
Emily and Bernie and this

586
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,430
hunt for an apartment?

587
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,930
They're looking.

588
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,140
Yeah, I heard her place

589
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,140
fell through, too expensive.

590
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,940
I just hope Bernie

591
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,940
isn't dragging his feet.

592
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,410
Well, Emily

593
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,410
hasn't complained.

594
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,670
Maybe, but she's still

595
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,670
sleeping at your place

596
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,670
with the baby.

597
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,780
I don't mind.

598
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,780
And Bernie's what?

599
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,950
Sleeping across town

600
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,950
on his wife's couch?

601
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,320
Doesn't seem to

602
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,320
faze him a bit.

603
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,880
Ethan, if you're thinking

604
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,880
of getting involved, don't.

605
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,160
It's not gonna help.

606
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,360
You're Bernie's doctor.

607
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,360
Focus on that, okay?

608
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,170
Dr. Halstead, this is

609
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,170
Dr. Richard Haley.

610
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,770
Mr. Wycoff's nephrologist.

611
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,870
Nice to meet you.

612
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,870
So you'll handle

613
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,870
the red tape?

614
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,970
Absolutely.

615
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,180
A VIP room

616
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,180
is being prepared

617
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,180
for Mr. Wycoff

618
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,310
as well as our

619
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,310
conference room

620
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,150
for you to consult

621
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,150
with our transplant team.

622
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,950
I'm sorry.

623
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,950
What's happening?

624
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,620
Well, I didn't like

625
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,620
Brandon's labs.

626
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,120
His phos is up

627
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,120
and he's anemic.

628
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,160
I'm moving up

629
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,160
his kidney transplant

630
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,160
to today.

631
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,630
I want him to get two units

632
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,630
of O-neg, stat.

633
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,560
Whoa! Not so fast.

634
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,560
Mr. Wycoff's my patient.

635
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,690
I'll handle those orders.

636
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,430
Dr. Halstead. I appreciate you

637
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,430
getting the ball rolling,

638
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,340
but Dr. Haley

639
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,340
is gonna take over.

640
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,000
Ms. Garrett,

641
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,000
I am not comfortable

642
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,000
with this.

643
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,670
Brandon doesn't seem to know

644
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,670
anything about his cousin.

645
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,070
He's avoiding a paper trail

646
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,070
by paying cash,

647
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,210
and now some doctor

648
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,210
we met two minutes ago

649
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,210
is rushing him off to surgery?

650
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,880
What about repeat labs?

651
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,880
Pre-op scans?

652
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,880
HLA confirmation?

653
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,010
It will all happen.

654
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,490
Only now, it's going

655
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,490
to take place here

656
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,490
instead of East Mercy.

657
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,460
An easy and profitable win

658
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,460
just fell into our laps,

659
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,460
Dr. Halstead.

660
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,860
Be grateful.

661
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,060
We're moving Mr. Wycoff

662
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,060
to the Ambassador Suite.

663
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,040
It time?

664
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,480
Not yet. Soon.

665
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,840
Vee? Vee.

666
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,510
Do you understand

667
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,510
what's happening?

668
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,160
Brandon, need.

669
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,260
I have give.

670
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,430
You have to or want to?

671
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,700
Dr. Manning,

672
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,700
Dr. Charles.

673
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,870
Monique, get me suction.

674
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,410
Mmm-hmm.

675
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,950
I don't understand.

676
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,610
The Prussian blue

677
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,610
should be making her

678
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,610
better.

679
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,810
It's only

680
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,810
making her worse.

681
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,880
It's 'cause she didn't

682
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,880
take the pills.

683
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,080
Where are they?

684
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,750
Dr. Charles.

685
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,750
Meadow, where...

686
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,220
Monique.

687
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,220
Meadow, without these

688
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,220
pills, you will die.

689
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,200
We're supposed to die.

690
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,470
The oceans are warming.

691
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,440
Ice caps are melting.

692
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,620
We're killing the planet

693
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,620
and no one cares.

694
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,650
Except for us.

695
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,490
The Angels of the Earth.

696
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,930
"We, the Angels

697
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,930
of the Earth,

698
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,340
"will not be so blind

699
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,340
to ignore that

700
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,340
human greed, negligence,

701
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,500
"and abuse are

702
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,500
destroying the planet.

703
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,680
"We will serve the Earth

704
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,680
by removing ourselves

705
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,680
from it."

706
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,770
My God.

707
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,540
They're a cult that believes

708
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,540
the Earth is destined

709
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,540
for destruction

710
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,920
and the only solution

711
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,920
is to kill themselves.

712
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,420
At least they're not

713
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,420
making it all up

714
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,420
out of thin air.

715
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,520
Each one of their claims

716
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,520
is linked to a legitimate

717
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,520
scientific study.

718
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,420
Yeah, I know, but their

719
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,420
whole manifesto is still

720
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,420
one big suicide note.

721
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,600
Well, at least you can put her

722
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,600
on a psych hold, and we can

723
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,600
force treatment.

724
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,900
No, no, no, we can't.

725
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,270
Look, a psych hold

726
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,270
just means we can

727
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,270
keep her here

728
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,810
so she doesn't

729
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,810
harm herself more.

730
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,710
It still doesn't mean we can

731
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,710
make her take Prussian blue

732
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,470
or undo the things

733
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,470
she's done to herself

734
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,710
unless she wants us to.

735
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,280
So what can we do?

736
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,390
Well, it's a long shot,

737
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,390
but I could petition a court

738
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,250
to deem her

739
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,250
mentally incompetent

740
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,950
because of the brainwashing

741
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,950
she's received

742
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,050
at the hands

743
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,050
of this cult.

744
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,190
If not, Meadow controls

745
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,190
her own fate.

746
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
I just got word

747
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
your patient's

748
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,310
gonna be admitted

749
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,310
and moved upstairs

750
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,500
to meet with transplant.

751
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,970
Mags.

752
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,280
I need you

753
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,280
to stall the transfer.

754
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,610
I'm waiting on calls

755
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,610
from translators.

756
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,310
Gwen Garrett called me

757
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,310
personally on this one.

758
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,850
I can buy you

759
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,850
maybe half an hour.

760
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,620
That's not

761
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,620
gonna do it.

762
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,620
Damn it!

763
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,220
Okay, let's get a head CT.

764
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,060
Will!

765
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,060
Due diligence.

766
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,490
I'm just making sure

767
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,490
there's not a delayed

768
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,030
subdural hematoma that might

769
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,030
endanger Vee in surgery.

770
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,500
This case smells that funky?

771
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,660
It smells illegal.

772
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,440
Okay, I'll order you the CT.

773
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,510
You got an hour now.

774
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,050
But if I were you,

775
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,050
I'd find a Plan B.

776
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,610
Yeah, I need Ms. Goodwin.

777
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,560
Dr. Latham, how'd it go

778
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,560
with my father?

779
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,680
No problems.

780
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,680
Good.

781
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,060
So, what was it?

782
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,420
Was the intracardiac patch

783
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,420
not sewn in properly

784
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,050
or did the sutures

785
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,050
come loose?

786
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,960
Neither,

787
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,960
the patch itself

788
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,960
was faulty.

789
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,520
The patch?

790
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,360
So there was no error

791
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,360
on Dr. Bekker's part?

792
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,460
Absolutely not.

793
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,030
Her sutures were

794
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,030
placed perfectly,

795
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,030
as always.

796
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,770
So, Bernie, I've got

797
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,770
your CT results.

798
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,050
You have a complete

799
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,050
small bowel obstruction.

800
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,650
Likely caused by adhesions

801
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,650
related to your pancreatic

802
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,650
pseudocyst surgery.

803
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,980
Wow. Uh...

804
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,820
I've got an OR

805
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,820
prepped for you now.

806
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,060
What about

807
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,060
recovery time?

808
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,190
A few days in the hospital,

809
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,190
then another week or two

810
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,190
of bed rest.

811
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,730
Honey, we'll have to put

812
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,730
a hold on our job

813
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,730
and apartment search.

814
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,290
Of course,

815
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,290
your health comes first.

816
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,600
And I'll call Ashley

817
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,600
and let her know I'm gonna

818
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,600
be there a bit longer.

819
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,580
It's all gonna work out.

820
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,600
How, Bernie?

821
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,310
How is everything

822
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,310
gonna work out?

823
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,850
Without a job?

824
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,850
Without a place to live?

825
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,890
Can't you see

826
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,890
how hard this is on Emily?

827
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,120
Not to mention her baby?

828
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,420
For reasons, I may

829
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,420
never understand,

830
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,120
Emily loves you

831
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,120
with all of her heart.

832
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,600
So start showing her

833
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,600
you feel the same way.

834
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,660
Get it together.

835
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,340
Mr. Kim? I'm Dr. Wilde.

836
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
We're here to take you

837
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
to pre-op holding.

838
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,560
Let's go.

839
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,150
The black market?

840
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,280
You think Mr. Wycoff is buying

841
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,280
your patient's kidney?

842
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,380
Wouldn't be the first.

843
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,000
World Health Organization

844
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,000
estimates that 7,000 kidneys

845
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,900
are illegally harvested

846
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,900
annually.

847
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,330
I have other reports

848
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,330
from human rights groups,

849
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,130
economic equality firms.

850
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,530
All right.

851
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,960
"Buyers of trafficked organs

852
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,960
are high-income individuals

853
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,130
"from developed countries.

854
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,610
"The typical seller

855
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,610
is male, around 29,

856
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,310
"and from some of the

857
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,310
world's poorest areas."

858
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,140
I mean, this is

859
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,140
Brandon and Vee.

860
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,710
Yes, they fit the profile,

861
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,710
and I'm well aware

862
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,550
of the magnitude

863
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,550
of illegal organ transplants.

864
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,820
But this is Brandon's file

865
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,820
from East Mercy.

866
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,260
Transplant list status

867
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,260
as well as Vee's donor papers.

868
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,030
Our lawyers have been

869
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,030
all over these documents.

870
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,160
Nothing appears

871
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,160
out of place.

872
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,430
And what about

873
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,430
the nephrologist,

874
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,430
Dr. Haley?

875
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,990
Privileges at hospitals

876
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,990
across the city,

877
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,990
including ours.

878
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,210
So Brandon's

879
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,210
covered his bases.

880
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,110
That doesn't mean

881
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,110
money hasn't changed hands.

882
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,080
Ms. Goodwin,

883
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,080
I'm telling you,

884
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,980
there's something

885
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,980
going on here.

886
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,250
This is the mission statement

887
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,250
of the Angels of the Earth.

888
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,620
I've read it

889
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,620
three times now.

890
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,130
Are you beginning

891
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,130
to understand, then?

892
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,560
I'm trying to.

893
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,770
As a scientist, I agree.

894
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,100
But I'm having a hard time

895
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,100
believing that the planet

896
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,010
is doomed to become

897
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,010
uninhabitable.

898
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,440
Or how poisoning

899
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,440
yourself with thallium

900
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,440
will change that.

901
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,610
Would you have heard

902
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,610
of the Angels of the Earth

903
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,610
otherwise

904
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,550
if I wasn't here?

905
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,180
So you're a martyr?

906
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,630
In 1963, a monk

907
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,630
set himself on fire

908
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,060
in protest of the

909
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,060
Vietnamese government's

910
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,660
discriminatory laws

911
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,660
against Buddhism.

912
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,040
The government

913
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,040
was overthrown.

914
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,400
Is that your hope?

915
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,300
That the government

916
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,300
is overthrown?

917
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,340
No.

918
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,140
My hope is that people

919
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,140
wake up and take action

920
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,210
instead of continuing

921
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,210
to cook our planet

922
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,210
by burning fossil fuels.

923
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,150
So then you believe

924
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,150
the planet can be saved.

925
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,590
You're twisting my words.

926
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,590
I'm not.

927
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,930
Mmm-hmm.

928
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,930
Your logic is flawed.

929
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,890
You want people to change,

930
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,590
but you also think

931
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,590
that change will be

932
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,590
meaningless.

933
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,930
So what is the point

934
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,930
of martyring yourself

935
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,770
if it's unclear

936
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,770
what you stand for?

937
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm not taking your pills.

938
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,710
Meadow, your hair

939
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,710
is falling out.

940
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,520
You're running out of time.

941
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,920
Good.

942
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,990
I am not gonna let you die.

943
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,630
Monique, John?

944
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,760
Put her in the

945
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,760
soft restraints,

946
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,860
then prepare for an NG tube.

947
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,130
I'm giving her

948
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,130
the Prussian blue.

949
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,130
No!

950
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,670
Maybe I should

951
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,670
call Dr. Charles.

952
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm a licensed physician,

953
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,800
and I am deeming

954
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,800
the patient nondecisional.

955
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,430
Put her in the restraints.

956
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,940
Now.

957
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,040
No! No, you can't do that!

958
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,410
I'm sorry.

959
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,840
You can't!

960
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,480
No, please!

961
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,850
You can't do this! No!

962
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,980
Stop.

963
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,860
I have to ask you.

964
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,970
Is Brandon paying

965
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,970
for your kidney?

966
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,050
Money. All right?

967
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,080
Is Brandon paying you money

968
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,080
for your kidney?

969
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,790
No, no money.

970
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,590
It's okay.

971
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,390
Just tell me the truth

972
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,390
so I can help.

973
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,760
Help? Yes.

974
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,770
Me.

975
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,710
Brandon.

976
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,340
Uh-huh.

977
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,550
Brandon sick.

978
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,790
I help family.

979
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,390
Dr. Halstead?

980
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,390
Is there a problem?

981
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,700
No, just checking

982
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,700
on Vee.

983
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,300
Making sure he's okay.

984
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,730
Me too.

985
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,400
Oh.

986
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,300
You gotta be kidding me.

987
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,810
Look at us.

988
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,380
My mom took me to Moldova

989
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,380
when I was eight.

990
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,620
She wanted me to

991
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,620
experience the homeland.

992
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,250
And village

993
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,250
after village,

994
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,250
I was so bored.

995
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,260
But then on the

996
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,260
last day, I met Vee.

997
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,000
And we couldn't

998
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,000
speak to each other,

999
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,510
but we both knew

1000
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,510
how to play soccer.

1001
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,170
Football.

1002
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,970
Football,

1003
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,970
football.

1004
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,970
Football.

1005
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,650
Thank you for what

1006
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,650
you're doing for me.

1007
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,820
You're saving my life.

1008
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,090
I wish he knew

1009
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,090
what I was saying.

1010
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,260
I think he does.

1011
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,700
I'll leave you guys alone.

1012
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,950
I have gifted millions

1013
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,950
to this hospital.

1014
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,960
I expect first-class care.

1015
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,280
Connor, get in here.

1016
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,280
You should hear this.

1017
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,790
A budget

1018
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,790
bloated with waste,

1019
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,390
and what is

1020
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,390
Ms. Garrett's solution,

1021
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,200
is to save money on

1022
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,200
intracardiac patches.

1023
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,570
Again, Mr. Rhodes,

1024
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,570
I sincerely apologize.

1025
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,270
I will personally look into

1026
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,270
how these patches ended up

1027
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,270
in the OR

1028
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,780
and I will make sure

1029
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,780
that it never happens again.

1030
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,370
Full report

1031
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,370
next board meeting.

1032
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,640
Of course.

1033
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,550
And, Gwen, if memory serves,

1034
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,620
your contract extension

1035
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,620
is also an agenda item

1036
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,620
at that meeting.

1037
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,650
I believe it is.

1038
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,730
Perfect. See you there.

1039
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,870
It's okay. Shh, shh.

1040
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,450
Hey, uh, just got an update.

1041
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,450
Bernie's surgery went well.

1042
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,410
He'll be out soon.

1043
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,410
That seat's taken.

1044
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,280
And that seat's taken too.

1045
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,750
Okay, I get it.

1046
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,750
You're mad at me.

1047
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,910
Why'd you yell

1048
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,910
at Bernie like that?

1049
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,450
I was sticking up for you.

1050
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,860
You were kicking him

1051
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,860
when he's down.

1052
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,920
Everything I said,

1053
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,920
Bernie needed to hear,

1054
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,560
and you were never

1055
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,560
gonna say it.

1056
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,770
Yes, I want an apartment.

1057
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,770
I want him to get a job.

1058
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,830
But tough love

1059
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,830
won't get us there.

1060
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,030
And coddling does?

1061
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,490
Ms. Choi?

1062
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,970
Mr. Kim's being moved

1063
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,970
to the ICU for recovery.

1064
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,480
Whenever you're ready,

1065
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,480
you can go down and see him.

1066
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,940
Thanks, Lizzie.

1067
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,150
You don't get it.

1068
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,150
Bernie's delicate.

1069
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,210
He's warm, affectionate,

1070
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,750
and he needs

1071
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,750
encouragement

1072
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,750
and support.

1073
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,920
And if you can't

1074
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,920
get behind that,

1075
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,920
then get out of our lives.

1076
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,460
Dr. Charles? I need you.

1077
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,370
What the hell

1078
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,370
were you thinking?

1079
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,200
You could lose

1080
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,200
your license for this.

1081
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,340
For doing what's right?

1082
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,340
For breaking the law!

1083
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,780
I don't want her

1084
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,780
to die either, Natalie,

1085
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,180
but the woman has rights!

1086
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,780
What are you going to do?

1087
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,490
Well, now that

1088
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,490
you've boxed me in,

1089
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,780
there's only one thing

1090
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,780
that I can do.

1091
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,830
If you take out that tube,

1092
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,830
the only thing

1093
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,830
you will be doing

1094
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,020
is pushing Meadow

1095
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,020
one step closer to death.

1096
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,390
Get out of my way.

1097
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,700
Okay, this is gonna be

1098
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,700
uncomfortable.

1099
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,940
Sorry about that.

1100
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,620
I apologize for Dr. Manning.

1101
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,960
It's hard for her

1102
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,960
to understand

1103
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,960
why you're doing this.

1104
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,830
I thought you'd want

1105
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,830
to know that, um,

1106
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,530
because of your

1107
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,530
friend's deaths,

1108
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,370
everybody is talking about

1109
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,370
Angels of the Earth right now.

1110
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,170
I mean, the Internet's

1111
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,170
going crazy.

1112
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,270
We knew it would.

1113
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,470
So thallium, huh?

1114
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,010
Clever.

1115
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,780
A chemical compound

1116
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,780
not found in nature.

1117
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,080
A poison that deteriorates

1118
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,080
the body in much the same way

1119
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,820
that climate change

1120
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,820
affects the Earth.

1121
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,880
It's poetic.

1122
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,060
You're smart.

1123
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,720
You know, you've gotten

1124
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,720
pretty much everything

1125
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,720
you wanted.

1126
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,990
And all that's left now

1127
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,990
is to wait?

1128
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,400
I think you've

1129
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,400
suffered enough, Meadow.

1130
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,860
And I'd like to help

1131
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,860
ease that transition

1132
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,640
and give you

1133
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,640
a couple of sleeping pills

1134
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,640
if you'll let me.

1135
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,640
Suffering is the point.

1136
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,580
Look, Gaia put a bag

1137
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,580
over her head.

1138
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,810
There is no one

1139
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,810
on the Internet

1140
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,480
calling her out

1141
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,480
for taking a shortcut.

1142
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,540
Trust me.

1143
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,780
It's just a thought.

1144
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,230
Okay.

1145
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,510
I'll take the sleeping pills.

1146
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,770
Good.

1147
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,250
Give Meadow

1148
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,250
five of eszopiclone.

1149
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,950
It's okay.

1150
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,970
Meadow has agreed

1151
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,970
to take eszopiclone.

1152
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,410
Once she's out, she will

1153
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,410
no longer have the ability

1154
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,740
to advocate for herself.

1155
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,100
And a strong legal case

1156
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,100
could be made

1157
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,150
that we then have the right

1158
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,150
to act under implied consent

1159
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,820
as surrogate decision-makers

1160
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,820
on her behalf.

1161
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,450
So you can re-place

1162
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,450
the NG tube and administer

1163
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,450
Prussian blue.

1164
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,270
Ava, hold up.

1165
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,270
Leave me alone, Connor.

1166
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,210
Look, I am sorry

1167
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,210
for jumping to

1168
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,210
conclusions earlier.

1169
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,810
I should have

1170
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,810
considered

1171
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,810
the possibility

1172
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,440
that the patch failed before

1173
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,440
placing all the blame on you.

1174
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,910
And?

1175
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,180
And what?

1176
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,780
Seriously, Connor?

1177
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,320
Accusing me of botching

1178
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,320
your father's surgery

1179
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,830
is the only conclusion

1180
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,830
you're sorry for?

1181
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,030
What about your claim

1182
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,030
that I slept with him?

1183
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,800
That I manipulated

1184
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,800
the oversight committee?

1185
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,100
That I let you

1186
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,100
cut my hand in surgery?

1187
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,300
And God knows what else.

1188
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,100
No apology for

1189
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,100
any of that madness.

1190
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,970
I'll be honest.

1191
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,100
When we broke up,

1192
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,100
I was devastated.

1193
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,910
And I'm still

1194
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,910
getting over it.

1195
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,410
But at no point

1196
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,410
have I cast you

1197
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,410
as a monster.

1198
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,650
So why do you insist

1199
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,650
on making me one?

1200
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,880
Why do you want

1201
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,880
to hurt me so badly?

1202
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,880
You're such a good baby.

1203
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,880
Yes, you are.

1204
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,640
Hey, Bernie.

1205
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,250
Bernie, look...

1206
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,820
I was out of line earlier.

1207
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,060
I appreciate you

1208
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,060
saying that, Ethan.

1209
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,100
Now on, if you

1210
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,100
need anything...

1211
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,740
I want you to know

1212
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,740
you can come to me,

1213
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,740
no questions asked.

1214
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,750
Em, do you mind if I,

1215
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,750
uh, have a moment alone

1216
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,750
with Ethan?

1217
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,490
Okay. We'll be

1218
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,490
right outside.

1219
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,250
Let's go outside.

1220
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,290
You were right, Ethan.

1221
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,400
I better step it up,

1222
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,400
and I'm going to.

1223
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,660
I promise.

1224
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,130
I'm glad to hear that.

1225
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,200
There is, uh, one thing

1226
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,200
you can help me out with.

1227
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,900
Name it.

1228
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,050
Lately, I've been

1229
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,050
having trouble

1230
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,950
sustaining an erection.

1231
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,710
What?

1232
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,920
It's called

1233
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,920
erectile dysfunction,

1234
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,890
and there's medication

1235
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,890
that can possibly help.

1236
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,860
I'm reluctant to write you

1237
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,860
a prescription.

1238
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,920
You should really talk

1239
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,920
to a urologist.

1240
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:02,070
Thank you. Thanks for

1241
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:02,070
everything, Ethan.

1242
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,410
Dr. Charles...

1243
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,160
I know you're upset with me.

1244
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,390
But I just wanted to thank you

1245
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,390
for what you did today.

1246
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,090
We prevented a suicide.

1247
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,320
Have we, though?

1248
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,970
I mean, two doses

1249
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,970
of Prussian blue

1250
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,530
won't be enough

1251
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,530
to neutralize the thallium.

1252
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,770
She's gonna need

1253
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,770
dozens more.

1254
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,740
When Meadow wakes up

1255
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,740
tomorrow morning,

1256
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,240
the battle to get her

1257
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,240
to take them,

1258
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,830
it starts all over,

1259
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,830
and I'm just worried

1260
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,850
that we haven't really

1261
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,850
prevented a suicide

1262
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,010
as much as

1263
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,010
we've postponed one.

1264
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,290
Natalie, um...

1265
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,850
This is the second time

1266
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,850
in as many months

1267
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,560
that you've, um,

1268
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,560
well, you've misstepped,

1269
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,790
and I'm just wondering,

1270
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,790
is everything okay?

1271
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,590
Yeah.

1272
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,690
Okay.

1273
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,700
Well, um, I will

1274
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,700
see you tomorrow.

1275
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,080
Hey, Phillip.

1276
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,820
Oh, hey.

1277
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,250
Waiting on Natalie?

1278
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,760
Yeah, she's picking

1279
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,760
Owen up from daycare.

1280
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:37,500
Look, man, if I seemed

1281
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:37,500
weird earlier, I'm sorry.

1282
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,330
What do you mean?

1283
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,430
I was just thrown

1284
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,430
when you mentioned

1285
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,430
your ranch to Owen.

1286
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,070
I'm so sorry,

1287
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,070
when I mentioned my...

1288
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,840
Your ranch.

1289
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,320
Oh! Yeah. That.

1290
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,620
Well, look,

1291
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,620
the kid loves horses.

1292
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,680
I was just playing.

1293
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,050
So you don't own a ranch.

1294
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,760
No. No.

1295
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,720
Oh.

1296
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,790
But I figured that...

1297
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,530
Owen got a pretty big kick

1298
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,530
out of it, right?

1299
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,990
Yeah, I guess.

1300
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,330
I'll see you around.

1301
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,800
Yeah, take care.
