1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,870
Hey.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,870
Thanks for coming.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,430
Hospital food, I know.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,200
But the French toast

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,200
is surprisingly good.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,000
Not at all.

7
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's do it.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,010
Okay. But first...

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,410
I have a little

10
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,410
something for you.

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,540
What are these?

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,750
Airline tickets to Honolulu.

13
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,450
For our wedding.

14
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,060
Where you wanted to go

15
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,060
first time around, remember,

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,420
but we couldn't afford it?

17
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,920
Danny,

18
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,920
that is so sweet. Thank you.

19
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't know what to say.

20
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,960
How about..."Aloha."

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,670
Honolulu! Take that.

22
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,110
Whoa.

23
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,110
What?

24
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,230
What's this?

25
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,510
Um, Robin gave it to me.

26
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,610
I don't really need it

27
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,610
but, you know,

28
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,740
it makes her happy,

29
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,740
so I'm going to do it.

30
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,050
Come on, French toast.

31
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,880
Come on, Waikiki!

32
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,750
Finally you're going

33
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,750
to learn how to surf, right?

34
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,880
Remember you've just had

35
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,880
abdominal surgery

36
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,930
so be patient. It takes

37
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,930
a while to recover.

38
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,550
You need to be ambulatory.

39
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,550
Walk every day.

40
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,000
But don't push it.

41
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,090
Got it.

42
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,070
Great to see you two

43
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,070
back together.

44
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,400
I like to think it was

45
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,400
because of Bernie and me.

46
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,770
Whatever.

47
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,470
You know, when you go through

48
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,470
something like this,

49
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,570
makes you appreciate

50
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,570
everything you have.

51
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,970
Good friends,

52
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,970
a wonderful woman,

53
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,970
a brand-new baby.

54
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,070
Not to mention a wife

55
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,070
and teenage daughter.

56
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,740
Ethan.

57
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,740
I know, I know.

58
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,650
But we're working

59
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,650
something out.

60
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,750
I promise, I'm going to

61
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,750
take good care of your sister.

62
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,950
I look forward

63
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,950
to hearing your plans.

64
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,220
Connor...

65
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,330
Look, I hope you know

66
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,330
I did everything I could

67
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,330
for your father.

68
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,270
I do.

69
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm here for you.

70
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,150
If there's...

71
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,150
If there's anything I can do.

72
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,110
Thank you.

73
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,920
Hey, Nina.

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Are you doing the autopsy

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,840
on my dad?

76
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,200
Yes, um...

77
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,040
Before I start, maybe you

78
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,340
want some time with him?

79
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,080
Yeah, please. Thank you.

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,660
I hated you.

81
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,670
I blamed you for Mom's death.

82
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,670
I blamed you for...

83
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,640
So many things.

84
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,310
Maybe I was

85
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,310
seeing it all wrong.

86
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,320
You weren't the best dad.

87
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,850
But maybe if I'd been

88
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,850
a better son...

89
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,320
You'd have been

90
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,320
a better father.

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,720
Oh, man, I...

92
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm sorry.

93
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,890
Remember our

94
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,890
cochlear implant patient,

95
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,890
Peter Rush?

96
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,150
Yeah. Usher syndrome.

97
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,130
Why, is he back?

98
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,130
Is his eyesight worse?

99
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,760
Yes, but that's not

100
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,760
why he's here.

101
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,630
It's his wife, Bonnie.

102
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,200
This way.

103
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,200
Okay.

104
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,470
Hello, Bonnie.

105
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,940
Who's that?

106
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,940
Dr. Manning.

107
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,870
Sorry. I don't see too well.

108
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,870
No need to apologize.

109
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,920
Congratulations

110
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,920
on your marriage.

111
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,540
So what seems

112
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,540
to be the trouble?

113
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,650
She says she doesn't

114
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,650
need to be here. There's

115
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,650
nothing wrong with her.

116
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,420
I made her come.

117
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,420
Her heart doesn't sound right.

118
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,860
"Doesn't sound right"?

119
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,590
I had my head

120
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,590
on her chest.

121
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,590
I heard it.

122
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,050
May I?

123
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,600
You heard right.

124
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,600
Sounds like a systolic murmur.

125
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,340
Do you ever feel dizzy

126
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,340
or out of breath?

127
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,310
Yes, you do.

128
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,980
Let's get her

129
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,980
on the monitors.

130
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,850
Need a CBC, BMP, cardiac labs,

131
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,850
a D-Dimer, chest x-ray...

132
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,250
And a 12-lead EKG

133
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,250
and a cardiac echo.

134
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,350
Right.

135
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,390
She's saying sorry,

136
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,390
he was right.

137
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,060
We'll be back

138
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,060
when we get the results.

139
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,690
Dan.

140
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,700
I got a patient of yours,

141
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,700
Delmar Brendl.

142
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,960
Oh.

143
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,700
Yeah, he won't let me treat

144
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,700
him unless you're in the room.

145
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,740
Hey, Del.

146
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,980
Dr. Charles, I'm fine.

147
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,980
I really don't need

148
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,980
to be here.

149
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,040
He was found at the bottom

150
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,040
of his stairs of

151
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,040
his apartment building.

152
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,920
I didn't get hurt.

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,920
But he couldn't get up.

154
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,650
The manager called

155
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,650
the paramedics.

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,090
Well, Del's been

157
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,090
a patient of mine

158
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,090
for a couple years now.

159
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,590
I'm treating him for

160
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,590
generalized anxiety disorder,

161
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,690
panic attacks, and making

162
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,690
some real progress.

163
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,420
Mr. Brendl, why weren't

164
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,420
you able to get up?

165
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,590
I don't know.

166
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,600
My right leg is a little weak.

167
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,360
And my left.

168
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,360
And my left arm.

169
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,840
Anything else bothering you?

170
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,130
You mean

171
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,130
like the headaches?

172
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,900
But everybody

173
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,900
gets headaches, right?

174
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,140
Do me a favor.

175
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,140
Put your feet up.

176
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,910
Flex your foot like you're

177
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,910
stepping on the gas.

178
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,140
The other side.

179
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,120
Your left side's weaker.

180
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,590
Yeah, I know. I told you that.

181
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,590
It's no big deal.

182
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,790
Monique, let's get

183
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,790
a 12-lead EKG, CT head,

184
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,790
CTLS spine and...

185
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,190
No needles. I hate needles.

186
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,750
And cardiac labs.

187
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,630
You can totally do this, Del.

188
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,690
Gonna be over in a flash,

189
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,690
I promise you.

190
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,270
Ow, that really hurts!

191
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,500
I haven't done anything.

192
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,040
Here. Del,

193
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,040
Del. Look at me.

194
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,510
Right here, all right.

195
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,510
Doing great.

196
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,910
In through the nose.

197
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,110
Out through the mouth.

198
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,110
Gonna be fine.

199
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,970
When we woke up,

200
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,970
I looked over and Henry

201
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,380
had this rash all over.

202
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,480
Okay if I look in your mouth?

203
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,480
Sure.

204
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,580
Ahh.

205
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,750
It's clear.

206
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,260
Any trouble breathing?

207
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,260
No.

208
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,020
Mr. Kupfer puts out

209
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,020
a star for Christmas.

210
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,460
Yes he does, Joanie.

211
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,460
Honey, give us a second.

212
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,020
We're talking to the doctor.

213
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,830
It's Alzheimer's.

214
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,530
Well, your rash, it's hives.

215
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,160
Pretty sure you're having

216
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,160
an allergic reaction.

217
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,470
To what?

218
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,470
He doesn't have any allergies.

219
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,240
People can develop them

220
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,240
at any age.

221
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,010
April, let's give Mr. Wilks

222
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,010
50 milligrams of Benadryl IV,

223
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,940
150 milligrams of Zantac IV.

224
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,180
Also, let's get a CBC

225
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,180
and BMP and send a UA

226
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,180
for tox and EO's.

227
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,780
Standard blood

228
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,780
and urine tests. Fist.

229
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,750
Let's see

230
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,750
if the antihistamines

231
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,410
get rid of your rash,

232
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,410
make you feel better.

233
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm afraid your husband's

234
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,680
going to be here

235
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,680
a few hours.

236
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,520
Oh, I'm not his wife.

237
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,850
Joanie's my wife.

238
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,460
Am I sick?

239
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,470
No, honey, you're fine.

240
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,970
It's Henry.

241
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,700
I'll check back

242
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,700
in a little bit.

243
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,640
Excuse me.

244
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,780
Dad.

245
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,940
Hi, honey.

246
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,570
Hey, I need to talk to you.

247
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,780
Shoot.

248
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,010
Wedding in Hawaii?

249
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,420
Right.

250
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,580
Dad, do you really think

251
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,580
this is a good idea?

252
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,880
Oh.

253
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,890
Honey, it's what

254
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,890
your mom always wanted.

255
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,980
Yeah, I know, but...

256
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,090
Oh, trust me.

257
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,360
She was delighted.

258
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,360
Delighted.

259
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,630
Yeah, of course she was.

260
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,600
I mean, she wouldn't want

261
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,600
to disappoint you.

262
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,640
What do you mean?

263
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,640
Mom is thrilled

264
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,870
about the wedding,

265
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,870
but... She's not well.

266
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,570
She can't handle

267
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,570
a trip to Hawaii.

268
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,410
She's gonna have

269
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,410
a couple mai tais

270
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,840
and sleep the whole flight.

271
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,840
Then once we get there

272
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,850
she's not lifting a finger,

273
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,850
'cause it's first-class

274
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,850
all the way.

275
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,080
You have my word on that.

276
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,140
Charles.

277
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,350
Mr. Brendl's cardiac labs

278
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,350
came back negative.

279
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,720
But his head CT showed

280
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,020
a frontal mass

281
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,020
with focal edema

282
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,020
and midline shift.

283
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,120
A tumor?

284
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,120
Very possibly.

285
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,660
Neurosurgery and Neurology

286
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,660
want a stat MRI.

287
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,320
I mean, he's really

288
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,320
claustrophobic.

289
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,870
The CT was bad enough,

290
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,870
now with all the banging?

291
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,870
He'll jump out of his skin.

292
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,110
Ingrid, got your text.

293
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,740
What is it?

294
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,110
I just got some news, Will.

295
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,310
Tim Burke,

296
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,310
he's out of prison.

297
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,280
Already?

298
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,950
He only got

299
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,950
a two-year sentence.

300
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,890
Model prisoner, no priors.

301
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,890
He's out on parole.

302
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,590
Should I be worried?

303
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,090
Will, you are responsible

304
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,090
for his father

305
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,390
and his brother

306
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,390
being incarcerated.

307
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,590
This is hard for me

308
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,590
to say, but...

309
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,190
I think the safest thing

310
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,190
would be for you to relocate.

311
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,600
Out of state.

312
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,510
The purpose of the Glenn

313
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,510
procedure is to improve

314
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,510
Sophie's oxygenation

315
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,640
and reduce pulmonary

316
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,640
artery pressure.

317
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,810
Any questions?

318
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,810
No.

319
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,190
The operation

320
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,190
is not without risk,

321
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,160
particularly in light

322
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,160
of Sophie's previous surgery.

323
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,850
Each time you open the chest,

324
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,850
it becomes more difficult.

325
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,060
We expect Sophie's adhesions

326
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,060
to be extensive.

327
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,140
But we're optimistic.

328
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,140
She's a strong little girl.

329
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,970
Ah. Okay, thank you.

330
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,300
Hey, you're doing great.

331
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,310
They're great surgeons,

332
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,310
Phillip.

333
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,900
Sophie's in the very

334
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,900
best hands.

335
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,080
You know, it might just be

336
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,080
because you're here, but...

337
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,280
I just think that everything's

338
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,280
going to work out.

339
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,750
Yeah.

340
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,590
Oh!

341
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,820
It's terrible!

342
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,230
Oh, God, that was terrible.

343
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,230
That was terrible.

344
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,770
The banging. Oh, God.

345
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,860
Just get me out of here, man.

346
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,240
You did great.

347
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,240
Absolutely great.

348
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,370
Del, this is Dr. Abrams.

349
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,370
He is a neurosurgeon.

350
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,970
Best one in Chicago.

351
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,840
If not the entire

352
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,840
United States.

353
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,580
My mistake.

354
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,580
Surgeon?

355
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,980
Yeah,

356
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,980
you have a tumor.

357
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,950
A frontoparietal convexity

358
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,950
meningioma.

359
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,540
I have a tumor in my brain?

360
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,210
That's where the weakness

361
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,210
is coming from.

362
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,550
But Dr. Abrams is

363
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,550
pretty sure that it's benign.

364
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,290
And operable.

365
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,290
Okay.

366
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,920
Okay, just knock me out

367
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,920
and let's get it over with.

368
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,230
Here's the thing.

369
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,130
Because of the location

370
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,130
of the tumor,

371
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,470
it's going to have to be what

372
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,470
we call an "awake procedure."

373
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,770
Awake?

374
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,770
Yeah,

375
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,770
not the entire procedure.

376
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,030
You'll be anesthetized,

377
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,030
but then at a certain point

378
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,700
we'll have to lower

379
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,700
the sedation so I can monitor

380
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,700
your motor functions.

381
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,070
So I'll just

382
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,170
be lying there awake

383
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,170
with the top of my skull off?

384
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,580
Yeah, more or less.

385
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,580
I know it sounds extreme,

386
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,580
but it's actually

387
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,580
remarkably common.

388
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,280
No, forget it.

389
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,280
I'm not doing that.

390
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,480
Okay.

391
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,310
Um...

392
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,190
Wait here,

393
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,190
I'll be right back.

394
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,820
Sam!

395
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,620
Dan, he said no.

396
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,890
I'm not going to

397
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,890
twist his arm.

398
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,990
I'll talk to him.

399
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,730
Look, the guy's

400
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,730
a terrible risk. What if

401
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,730
he flips out in surgery?

402
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,830
He could herniate.

403
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,670
If he does that,

404
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,670
I'll calm him down.

405
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,110
Really? I'd say

406
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,110
you've done a piss-poor

407
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,110
job of that so far.

408
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,540
Sam, come on.

409
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,300
If you don't operate,

410
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,300
that tumor's going to

411
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,300
kill him.

412
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,350
All right, if you

413
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,350
get him to agree,

414
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,350
page me.

415
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,300
Looking for a job?

416
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,300
No.

417
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,400
Just curious.

418
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,030
There's a lot of jobs

419
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,030
for ED docs out there,

420
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,030
you know?

421
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,810
Well, hey, nice to know

422
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,810
you're wanted, right?

423
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,140
Let's go.

424
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,250
Bonnie, Peter.

425
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,560
This is Dr. Latham, our chief

426
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,560
of cardiothoracic surgery.

427
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,390
He's made a diagnosis.

428
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,690
Your cardiac echo shows

429
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,690
a condition which is...

430
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,500
Why don't you let me sign?

431
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,540
With your permission,

432
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,540
of course.

433
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,840
You know ASL?

434
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,670
I try to learn

435
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,670
a new language every year.

436
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,940
This year it's Hindi,

437
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,940
last year ASL.

438
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,470
It's an elegant language.

439
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,470
Correct me if I make

440
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,470
a mistake.

441
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,680
Okay.

442
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,750
Your cardiac echo shows

443
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,180
a condition associated

444
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,180
with hearing loss.

445
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,790
Mitral valve prolapse.

446
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,060
Is it serious?

447
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,760
The leaflets of your

448
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,760
mitral valve

449
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,570
bulge when your heart

450
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,570
contracts, allowing

451
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,770
blood to leak back

452
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,770
into your atrium.

453
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,570
I can repair with

454
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,570
minimally invasive surgery.

455
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,250
She's asking if she

456
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,250
really needs it.

457
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,380
She doesn't feel that bad.

458
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,420
It's better to do it before

459
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,420
you feel really sick.

460
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,360
There's less risk.

461
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,360
Yeah.

462
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,830
And you're in danger

463
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,830
of getting endocarditis.

464
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,520
It's a heart infection.

465
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,140
He's asking if he can

466
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,140
go ahead and

467
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,140
schedule the procedure.

468
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,380
Mr. Wilks' test results.

469
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,950
Wife's got Alzheimer's

470
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,950
but, hey, why should that

471
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,950
slow you down?

472
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,920
Go out,

473
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,920
get another woman.

474
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,950
Have her come live with you.

475
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,530
It's really nice, Ethan,

476
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,530
when we actually agree

477
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,530
on something.

478
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,320
Yeah.

479
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,430
Hey, Mr. Wilks.

480
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,430
How are you feeling?

481
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,900
Better, thanks.

482
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,440
I see your hives are fading.

483
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,560
And as I thought,

484
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,560
your blood work is normal.

485
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,340
I do recommend

486
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,340
you see an allergist

487
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,310
to figure out what you

488
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,310
were sensitive to.

489
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,370
I will.

490
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,970
I will start your discharge.

491
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,610
While you're waiting,

492
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,610
I'll get Joanie a bite.

493
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,170
Pick me up something too.

494
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,170
Okay.

495
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,350
Come on, Joanie.

496
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,350
How about some scrambled eggs?

497
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,150
Scrambled eggs!

498
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,150
Yes!

499
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,360
Dr. Rhodes...

500
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,900
Sophie just went up

501
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,900
for a pre-op.

502
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,190
Good.

503
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,900
Yeah... Oh, can I ask

504
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,900
you something?

505
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,960
You've known Natalie

506
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,960
for a while.

507
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,480
I mean, yeah, we've worked

508
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,480
together for a few years.

509
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,370
So...

510
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,410
What do you think?

511
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,520
Will she like it?

512
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,420
Um...

513
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,690
It's a very nice ring.

514
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,330
Yeah, right, well...

515
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,660
I'd only propose

516
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,660
if everything goes well.

517
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,860
Right.

518
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,600
Right.

519
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,180
Thanks, man.

520
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,680
Will, I need you.

521
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,520
They're bringing in

522
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,520
Sydney Hawkins.

523
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,350
Your kidney recipient?

524
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,350
Yeah.

525
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,360
You're going to Baghdad.

526
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,520
Sydney Hawkins, mid-30s,

527
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,520
kidney transplant. GCS 15.

528
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,930
BP 102/66. HR 98.

529
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,930
Sats at 95.

530
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,440
Complaining of flu-like

531
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,440
symptoms, edema, and lower

532
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,440
left quadrant abdominal pain.

533
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,940
Maggie...

534
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm sorry.

535
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,610
Sorry for what, Sydney?

536
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,240
I... I'm nothing but trouble.

537
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,040
No, you're not.

538
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,040
Don't say that.

539
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,680
On my count.

540
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,680
One, two, three!

541
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,990
Four liters nasal O2,

542
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,990
stat chest x-ray, CBC, BMP,

543
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,650
cyclosporine

544
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,650
and renal ultrasound.

545
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,950
Right.

546
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,920
Get a non-contrast CT

547
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,920
abdomen and pelvis.

548
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,330
Take a look

549
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,330
at her kidney as well.

550
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,730
She seems pretty uremic.

551
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,270
Sydney Hawkins.

552
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,140
Looks like she might be

553
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,140
rejecting my kidney.

554
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,110
Maggie, I'm so sorry.

555
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,560
Help, help!

556
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,560
Henry can't breathe!

557
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,780
Somebody!

558
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,420
He was just eating

559
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,420
a sandwich and suddenly...

560
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,090
He's having an allergic

561
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,090
reaction. I've got to look

562
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,090
in your mouth.

563
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,690
All right, tongue's swollen.

564
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,690
He's got hives in his mouth.

565
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,560
Epi?

566
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,560
Yeah,.3 milligrams IM

567
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,970
and 125 of Solu-Medrol

568
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,970
IV stat.

569
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,970
Let's get him on oxygen.

570
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,060
Another round of epi.

571
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,600
Sat's at 86.

572
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,600
He's tripoding.

573
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,200
All right,

574
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,200
he's in anaphylaxis.

575
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,740
I've got to intubate

576
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,740
before his airway closes.

577
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,940
Twenty of etomidate,

578
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,940
100 of sux.

579
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,220
I'm in.

580
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,720
Bag him.

581
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,090
Eighty-nine.

582
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,090
They're coming up.

583
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,660
BP and heart rate are okay.

584
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,500
He's stable.

585
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,500
Oh, thank God!

586
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,530
My God, what...

587
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,530
What could've caused this?

588
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,480
What did he eat?

589
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,480
It was a roast beef sandwich.

590
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,680
Wait, where's Joanie?

591
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,410
Where is she?

592
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,240
Hey, did you see a woman leave

593
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,240
this room just a minute ago?

594
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,380
Yeah. She's headed outside.

595
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,000
Joanie!

596
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,330
Oh, my God!

597
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,740
Joanie!

598
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,740
Whoa, whoa,

599
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,740
whoa, whoa, whoa!

600
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

601
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,410
Lots of cars.

602
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,890
Let's get you

603
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,890
where it's safe.

604
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,820
Oh, honey! Honey!

605
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,930
Oh, honey.

606
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,960
Are you okay?

607
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,960
I'm okay.

608
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,090
Okay.

609
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,230
Connor.

610
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,870
Hey, Nina, what's up?

611
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,930
Your father didn't have

612
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,930
a history of diabetes, did he?

613
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,400
Hmm. No, why?

614
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,980
He died from

615
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,980
an overdose of insulin.

616
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,340
Insulin. That doesn't

617
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,340
make any sense.

618
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,890
It was synthetic.

619
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,890
Someone in the hospital

620
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,890
gave it to him.

621
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,290
I have to label his death

622
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,290
suspicious.

623
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,860
So were they able

624
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,860
to determine your father's

625
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,860
cause of death?

626
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,430
Uh...

627
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,870
No, not yet.

628
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,900
Such a sudden arrhythmia.

629
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,540
I'd have to guess

630
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,540
it was a pulmonary embolism.

631
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,210
Dr. Rhodes...

632
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,210
She's bleeding.

633
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,210
Suction.

634
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,480
Suction. It's coming

635
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,480
from her right atrium.

636
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,350
The adhesions from the sternum

637
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,350
must've torn it open.

638
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,750
Damn it.

639
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,750
Let's do a sucker bypass.

640
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,120
Sats are down to 52.

641
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,780
Eleven blade

642
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,780
and an aortic cannula.

643
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,600
And...

644
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,100
I'm in.

645
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,100
Sats are up to 76.

646
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,370
Eighty...

647
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,010
Prolene stitch

648
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,010
for the SVC cannula.

649
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,230
Time to

650
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,230
wake him up. You ready?

651
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,790
Yes, sir.

652
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,790
Lighten his sedation.

653
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,100
Maggie?

654
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,100
Mmm-hmm?

655
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,440
Sydney's scans came back.

656
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,440
There's a tumor on her kidney.

657
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,840
That's what's been causing

658
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,840
her kidney failure.

659
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,310
A tumor? Cancer?

660
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,510
It looks that way.

661
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,250
We'll know more

662
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,250
after the biopsy.

663
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,180
Oh, God, I gave her

664
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,180
a bad kidney.

665
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,050
No. No, they examined

666
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,050
your kidney thoroughly.

667
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,490
There was no sign of a tumor.

668
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,260
Sydney clearly developed it

669
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,260
after her transplant.

670
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,360
As if her life

671
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,360
wasn't hard enough.

672
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,300
Well, let's hope

673
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,300
they get it all

674
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,300
and she recovers.

675
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,260
Sydney?

676
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,370
Do you understand

677
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,370
what's happening?

678
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,640
They're trying to

679
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,640
make me well.

680
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,040
That's right.

681
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,450
We're all just trying

682
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,450
to make you well.

683
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,950
Thank you.

684
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,620
Go ahead.

685
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,110
I've excised

686
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,110
the misshapen

687
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,110
section of the valve.

688
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,870
I'm starting now

689
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,870
to reconstruct.

690
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,000
Surgery's going well.

691
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,000
No surprises.

692
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,540
What were we thinking?

693
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,630
What's going on?

694
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,470
Bonnie and I,

695
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,470
we talked about

696
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,470
having a baby.

697
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,170
So stupid.

698
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,280
Me going blind.

699
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,280
Bonnie with her heart.

700
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,820
Her heart's going to be fine.

701
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,610
But what's next?

702
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,190
You know, Peter, none of us

703
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,190
get any guarantees in life.

704
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,800
I mean, we all

705
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,800
just face what comes.

706
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,800
I look at you and Bonnie

707
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,800
and I think you two do great.

708
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,770
I think you two can handle

709
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,770
almost anything.

710
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,780
Mr. Brendl,

711
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,780
can you hear me?

712
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,580
Who's that?

713
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,580
That's Dr. Abrams.

714
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,810
You're in surgery, Del,

715
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,810
and it's going great.

716
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,950
I need to map different

717
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,950
pathways in your brain,

718
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,720
so I'll be touching

719
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,720
certain areas

720
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,450
and asking you to respond

721
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,450
to my questions.

722
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,820
Count to five for me.

723
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,390
One, two...

724
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,330
So the top of my skull is off?

725
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,330
A portion of it, yes.

726
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,270
We talked about that, too.

727
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,270
Continue counting.

728
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,270
My brain is just exposed?

729
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,710
Del, you've got this.

730
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,870
Deep breaths, okay?

731
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,870
In through the nose.

732
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,740
Out through the mouth.

733
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,510
Three, four...

734
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,290
No, I want to stop.

735
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,290
Make him stop.

736
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,150
Del, it's okay.

737
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,150
You're doing great.

738
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,490
You got me into this.

739
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,490
Get me out.

740
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,860
Stop squirming.

741
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,860
No, no, no!

742
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,330
Del, look at me.

743
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,330
Right here, right here.

744
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,160
His breathing is too shallow.

745
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,160
He's retaining CO2.

746
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,470
His brain's going to swell.

747
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,470
Get me out, get me out!

748
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,730
Either you do something

749
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,770
or I'm going to re-sedate

750
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,770
and end this.

751
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,040
Please, please,

752
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,040
I can't stand it!

753
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,810
Okay, Del.

754
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,810
I need you to tell me,

755
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,810
how are your feet?

756
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,910
Can you feel your feet?

757
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,910
I can't, I can't!

758
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,040
Dan!

759
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,040
Del, I'm touching

760
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,040
your right foot.

761
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,280
Can you feel me touching

762
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,280
your right foot?

763
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,510
Yeah, I can feel it.

764
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,510
Can we please stop?

765
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,280
Okay, great.

766
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,280
Now how about your knee?

767
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,410
I'm squeezing your right

768
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,410
kneecap, can you feel that?

769
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,930
Yeah, I can feel it.

770
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,930
So your feet,

771
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,990
your stomach, your legs,

772
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,990
your hands are all okay,

773
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,990
right?

774
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,190
I'm okay.

775
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,190
Yeah.

776
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,750
You're doing really,

777
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,750
really well.

778
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,160
I mean, you're answering

779
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,160
my questions.

780
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,100
I think that that means that

781
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,160
maybe you can answer some of

782
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,160
Dr. Abrams' questions, too.

783
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,640
What comes

784
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,640
after three?

785
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,610
After three... After three...

786
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,840
You know this one.

787
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,370
Four.

788
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,420
You're so much stronger

789
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,420
than you think you are,

790
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,420
you know that?

791
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,180
What did FDR say?

792
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,180
FDR?

793
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,280
Come on, we talk

794
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,280
about this all the time.

795
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,740
Roosevelt.

796
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,020
"You have nothing to fear..."

797
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,120
"...but fear itself."

798
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,120
That's right.

799
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,290
Raise your right index finger.

800
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,200
That's a lot of narrowing

801
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,200
in the right branch.

802
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,970
And the left as well.

803
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,800
We need a new plan.

804
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,780
There's no way to anastomose

805
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,780
to the trunk of the artery.

806
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,840
We need to attach

807
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,840
further up the right side.

808
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,650
But if we don't attach

809
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,650
to both sides, she'll only

810
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,650
oxygenate half her blood.

811
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,950
It's a lot better than none.

812
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,180
She'll never sat above 75

813
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,180
for the rest of her life.

814
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,150
She'll be in heart failure

815
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,150
by the age of 30!

816
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,920
Which can be controlled

817
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,920
by medications.

818
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,050
Connor...

819
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,050
I won't let this girl die

820
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,720
because we tried to bite off

821
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,720
more than we can chew.

822
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,360
I know this is

823
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,360
a difficult time for you.

824
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,270
You've suffered a loss.

825
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,540
But I've seen you do

826
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,540
things in the OR

827
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,670
that I did not think possible.

828
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,180
This is not the time

829
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,180
to back away from a challenge.

830
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,470
All right.

831
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,450
Two anastomosis sets.

832
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,590
Let's move it.

833
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,320
So what are you saying?

834
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,020
We think it was

835
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,020
the roast beef sandwich

836
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,020
that you're allergic to.

837
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,590
That's what kicked

838
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,590
off the attack.

839
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,130
Roast beef?

840
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,560
I've eaten roast beef

841
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,560
my whole life.

842
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,800
I like roast beef.

843
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,840
Have you been

844
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,840
in the woods recently?

845
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,670
Woods? Yeah, I...

846
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,210
A month ago I went

847
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,210
fishing in Kentucky.

848
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,740
Any tick bites?

849
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,250
Yes. He called me and said

850
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,250
there were ticks everywhere.

851
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,620
A bite

852
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,620
from the Lone Star tick,

853
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,620
which is common

854
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,660
in the Southeast

855
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,660
like Kentucky can cause

856
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,660
a sensitivity to meat.

857
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,820
You'll need to confirm

858
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,820
with an allergist,

859
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,920
but in the meantime it's best

860
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,920
that you stay away from meat.

861
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,520
Oh, God.

862
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,400
Mr. Wilks, we were very lucky

863
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,400
with your wife today.

864
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,840
Has this happened before?

865
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,740
She can wander off.

866
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,040
We have to keep

867
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,040
an eye on her.

868
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,300
Yes, you do.

869
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,600
If you find you can't manage,

870
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,240
you know there are facilities.

871
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,480
Oh, Joanie was in one.

872
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,480
Nice place.

873
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,310
But she was depressed.

874
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,150
Missed her house,

875
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,150
Roxanne and me.

876
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,920
She's a lot happier now.

877
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,460
We missed her, too.

878
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,720
I know that look.

879
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,700
You don't approve

880
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,700
of how we live.

881
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,330
I doubt you have any idea

882
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,330
what it's like

883
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,370
to, little by little,

884
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,370
lose someone

885
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,370
you care deeply about.

886
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,930
If it hadn't been for

887
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,930
Roxanne's love and support,

888
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,440
I could never

889
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,440
take care of Joanie.

890
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,570
It's not a perfect situation,

891
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,570
but it's the best we can do.

892
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,850
Excuse us.

893
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,290
You're gonna be okay.

894
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,660
Unusual arrangement,

895
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,660
but, seems to work.

896
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,960
I guess.

897
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,830
People can live

898
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,830
any way they want.

899
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,130
I'm glad to hear

900
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,130
you say that.

901
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,030
Emily called.

902
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,030
Yeah?

903
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,370
She and Bernie have a plan.

904
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,370
They'd like to discuss it

905
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,370
with us over dinner.

906
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,840
What is this plan?

907
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,540
I'm going to let

908
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,540
Emily tell you.

909
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,420
I informed Ms. Rush

910
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,420
that her surgery went well

911
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,750
and that I anticipate

912
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,750
that she'll only need

913
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,990
to spend another three days

914
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,990
in the hospital.

915
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,120
Oh, Dr. Halstead.

916
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,120
Mr. Rush asked me to tell you

917
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,930
that they've decided

918
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,930
they will try to have a baby.

919
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,360
Ah! "A lovely couple."

920
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,160
Thank you for asking

921
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,160
me to consult.

922
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,040
Thank you.

923
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,000
A baby?

924
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,740
They didn't think

925
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,740
they could handle one.

926
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,920
Looks like

927
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,920
they changed their minds.

928
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,950
I guess when you've

929
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,950
already been through

930
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,950
so much together...

931
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,250
Nothing much scares you.

932
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,480
Yeah.

933
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,790
Snip.

934
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,810
Time on pump?

935
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,180
Three hours 14.

936
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,440
Should we take

937
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,440
her off bypass?

938
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,190
That should do it.

939
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,330
Pressure's good.

940
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,330
Normal rate and rhythm.

941
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,600
Sats are at 88.

942
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,600
She's going to make it.

943
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,360
Close, if you don't mind.

944
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,570
Not at all.

945
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,110
Hey.

946
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,780
What is it?

947
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,420
I've decided I'm not

948
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,420
going to relocate.

949
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,750
Why?

950
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,750
I'm tired of being afraid.

951
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,590
I don't want to run away.

952
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,400
I'd like to think

953
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,400
that you were staying

954
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,400
because of me,

955
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,060
but that's not

956
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,060
the reason, is it?

957
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,570
Natalie?

958
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,180
My loss.

959
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,890
Be safe, okay?

960
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,840
I was able to completely

961
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,840
resect the tumor and

962
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,840
as I expected, it's benign.

963
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,250
Dr. Charles, I couldn't

964
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,250
have done it without you.

965
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,370
Thank you.

966
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,020
I'm the one you should be

967
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,020
thanking, but so be it.

968
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,520
You should be

969
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,520
proud of yourself.

970
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,360
The inspirational speech

971
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,360
you gave that nutcase?

972
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,890
The FDR quote?

973
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,600
That was a dreadful cliché,

974
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,600
but effective.

975
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,300
Yeah.

976
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,540
All right, Daniel, I'll bite.

977
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,540
What's the problem?

978
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:56,180
Well, um... Fear.

979
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,720
I think I'm having

980
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,720
a really hard time

981
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,590
facing the fact that I'm going

982
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,590
to lose somebody that I love.

983
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,660
And?

984
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,660
And what?

985
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,700
Who doesn't have

986
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,700
a hard time with that?

987
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,130
Shrinks.

988
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,270
Have to make a meal

989
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,270
out of everything.

990
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,980
Hey, honey. It's Dad.

991
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,080
Um, I think I'm going to need

992
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,080
your help with something.

993
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,290
Emily, there's more blankets

994
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,290
for the guest room

995
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,020
in the hall closet,

996
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,020
and pillows.

997
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,460
Thanks.

998
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,790
Hmm.

999
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,160
Ethan. Do you want

1000
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,160
more chicken?

1001
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,530
No, thanks.

1002
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,830
Jamie, did you put out

1003
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,830
fresh towels for

1004
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,830
Emily and your dad?

1005
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,770
Mom...

1006
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,670
Sorry, the bed's only a queen.

1007
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,630
The king wouldn't fit.

1008
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,110
It's okay.

1009
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,110
I'm used to the couch.

1010
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,510
You and Emily should sleep

1011
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,510
together so she can

1012
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,510
keep an eye on you.

1013
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,380
Oh! Did you remember

1014
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,380
to take your stool softener?

1015
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,150
Oh! No, I didn't.

1016
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,990
I'll clear.

1017
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,990
Oh, Jamie can do that.

1018
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,000
Honey, I'll take the baby.

1019
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,000
No, sit. I'm fine.

1020
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,420
Okay.

1021
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,420
I'll help him.

1022
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,540
So... You're not

1023
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,540
judging, right?

1024
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,740
No, no.

1025
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,970
Hey, didn't I tell Emily

1026
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,970
how happy I was for her?

1027
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,410
Living together with

1028
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,410
Bernie's wife and daughter?

1029
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,710
I just couldn't tell

1030
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,710
how sincere you were.

1031
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,990
Okay.

1032
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,920
This might actually

1033
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,920
be the best solution.

1034
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,320
Emily's always had trouble

1035
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,320
with stability...

1036
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,520
Bernie's family seems

1037
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,520
pretty stable.

1038
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,830
Look, what can I say?

1039
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,830
Everybody's happy.

1040
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,110
So... Why shouldn't I be?

1041
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,230
I have something to tell you.

1042
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,140
What?

1043
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,440
I'm late.

1044
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,820
"Late"?

1045
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,820
My period.

1046
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,660
Maggie.

1047
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,930
They got the path results

1048
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,930
back on Sydney.

1049
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,170
The tumor is malignant.

1050
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,440
Oh, my God.

1051
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,140
There is another issue.

1052
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,710
Pathology says it's not

1053
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,710
primary kidney cancer.

1054
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,840
What do you mean?

1055
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,180
The tumor is actually

1056
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,180
breast cancer.

1057
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,250
Metastatic breast cancer.

1058
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,120
Sydney has breast cancer?

1059
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,490
And it spread?

1060
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,560
Actually...

1061
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,420
She doesn't.

1062
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,070
You're saying that I have

1063
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,070
metastatic breast cancer?

1064
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,380
When was the last time

1065
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,380
you had a mammogram, Maggie?

1066
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,540
I don't know.

1067
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,540
I... A while.

1068
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,110
You're going to have

1069
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,110
a mammogram.

1070
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,980
Today. Now.

1071
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,150
Come on.

1072
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,150
No.

1073
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,850
One second.

1074
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,220
Maggie...

1075
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,190
You don't have to

1076
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,190
worry, Sydney.

1077
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,080
You're going to be okay.

1078
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,960
Thank you.

1079
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,350
Sharon, I can handle this.

1080
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,350
Come on.

1081
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,930
We did it.

1082
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,070
We saved that little girl.

1083
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah.

1084
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,410
We're a great team.

1085
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,880
Connor...

1086
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,250
I'm so sorry

1087
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,250
about your father.

1088
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,490
But...

1089
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,500
Now there's nothing

1090
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,500
keeping us apart.

1091
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,370
What?

1092
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,370
He's gone, you're free.

1093
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,670
No, Ava...

1094
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,670
No, no, look. Listen to me.

1095
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,900
We can be together now.

1096
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,200
I think that you and I

1097
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,200
are way past that.

1098
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,610
We're not. We'll start over.

1099
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,610
We'll just...

1100
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,940
Ava, stop!

1101
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,650
Okay? We're finished.

1102
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,740
That's it.

1103
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,350
You ungrateful prick.

1104
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,760
Rot in hell.

1105
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,680
Oh, my goodness.

1106
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,910
This is so beautiful.

1107
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,910
Thank you!

1108
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,580
Oh, my goodness gracious. Oh!

1109
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,580
Well, it's not...

1110
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,620
Not quite Hawaii,

1111
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,620
but it's close, right?

1112
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,710
Yeah.

1113
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,380
Oh, my goodness,

1114
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,380
look who's here!

1115
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,130
What are you guys doing here?

1116
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,560
Hi, Mom.

1117
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,560
Oh, my God!

1118
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,360
Congratulations, CeCe.

1119
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,360
Congratulations for what?

1120
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,130
Mrs. C!

1121
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,200
I am so happy

1122
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,200
to finally be

1123
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,200
at your wedding.

1124
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,980
Wedding? Now?

1125
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,140
If you'd still have me?

1126
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,940
Come on, wed me.

1127
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,380
I'm like... Oh, my God.

1128
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,890
Oh, my God.

1129
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,760
Caroline, this is Keoni.

1130
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,760
Hi, Keoni.

1131
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,620
Welcome.

1132
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,620
Thank you.

1133
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,300
In the Hawaiian language,

1134
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,260
the Hawaiian word

1135
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,260
for love is "aloha."

1136
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,300
You will share these leis.

1137
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,410
Exchange them,

1138
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,410
in the spirit of your aloha.

1139
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,510
Sophie should be able

1140
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,510
to leave the hospital

1141
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,060
in about a week or ten days.

1142
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,380
And after that,

1143
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,380
she'll begin to thrive.

1144
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,690
Hit her milestones.

1145
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,690
Crawling, walking, growing.

1146
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,000
Natalie...

1147
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,400
You've helped me so much

1148
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,400
through a very difficult time.

1149
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,030
I'm glad I could.

1150
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,310
There's something

1151
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,310
I want to ask you.

1152
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,920
Dr. Manning, can I...

1153
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,550
Will you give me a second?

1154
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,550
Yeah.

1155
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,050
What is it?

1156
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,160
Tim Burke's out of prison.

1157
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,090
And I advised Will

1158
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,090
to relocate, but he won't.

1159
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,100
Because of you.

1160
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,670
Will loves you.

1161
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,030
He is brave, and devoted,

1162
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,770
and you will never find

1163
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,770
another guy like him.

1164
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,050
You would be a fool

1165
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,050
not to take him back.

1166
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,810
Natalie. What are you...

1167
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,050
Agent Lee told me

1168
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,050
what was going on.

1169
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,880
Will, I am so sorry.

1170
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,190
Whoa.

1171
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,680
Natalie!

1172
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,120
I got you.

1173
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,360
Natalie? No!

1174
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,330
Natalie!

1175
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,740
Natalie, come on. Wake up!
