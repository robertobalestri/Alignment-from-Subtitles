1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,770
Friends, let us

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,770
raise a glass

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,530
to dear

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,530
Patrick Halstead.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,910
May you be in Heaven

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,910
an hour before the Devil

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,910
knows you're dead.

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,510
Slainte!

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,980
Let me get you

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,980
another one.

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,980
Yes, please.

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,150
Mmm-hmm.

13
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,150
Thank you.

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,120
Will.

15
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,750
Tommy.

16
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,750
Hey.

17
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,560
Sorry about

18
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,560
your dad.

19
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,220
My old man couldn't be here.

20
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,220
He...

21
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,430
He's not feeling so well.

22
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,060
Sorry to hear it.

23
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,060
Yeah.

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
You know, you could do

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
me a solid, though.

26
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,430
Dad, he...

27
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,630
He won't go to a hospital.

28
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,070
Maybe you could come

29
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,070
by the house,

30
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,070
give him a look-see?

31
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,910
Sorry, Tommy, I'm an ED doc.

32
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,910
Emergency medicine.

33
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,670
All right.

34
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,980
I hope he feels better.

35
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,980
Thanks, Will.

36
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,150
Tommy.

37
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,150
Yeah?

38
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,450
Your father still running

39
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,450
the neighborhood?

40
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,090
You kidding me?

41
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,090
He'll never let that go.

42
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,060
All right, I'll drop by.

43
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,060
Thanks a lot, Will.

44
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,330
You got it.

45
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,740
You okay?

46
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,740
Great, man.

47
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,540
So...

48
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,310
It's only what, five days

49
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,310
till your hybrid OR's

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,310
up and running?

51
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,550
Four, actually,

52
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,550
and I've still got

53
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,550
personnel to train

54
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,060
and logistics

55
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,060
to figure out.

56
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,920
You're nervous about this,

57
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,920
aren't you?

58
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,930
I don't think I've ever

59
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,930
seen you nervous.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,990
It's refreshing.

61
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,790
Not necessarily attractive,

62
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,790
but refreshing.

63
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,160
Help! Help me!

64
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,910
My son can't breathe.

65
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,040
Okay, come with me.

66
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
It's okay, buddy.

67
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,180
Dr. Choi.

68
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,180
What's going on?

69
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,580
Looks like the early stages

70
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,580
of respiratory failure.

71
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,310
Lay him down here.

72
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,020
Any medical history?

73
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,020
He was born with bad kidneys.

74
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,460
They see him

75
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,460
at the hospital

76
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,460
in Gary,

77
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,020
but I don't think

78
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,020
they know what they're doing.

79
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,620
Daddy! My tummy hurts.

80
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,690
When's the last time

81
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,690
he was dialyzed?

82
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,930
I don't know.

83
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,930
My ex deals with that.

84
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
Let's put him on oxygen,

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
then let reno know

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
he needs dialysis.

87
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,660
It really hurts.

88
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,660
I'm so sorry.

89
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,930
Ben, we're gonna

90
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,930
give you something

91
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,670
to make you feel better.

92
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,670
Just a minute, okay?

93
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,470
Here.

94
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,470
Okay.

95
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,100
He's got a lot

96
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,100
of fluid in his lungs.

97
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,710
Hopefully, the dialysis

98
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,710
will bring it down.

99
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,080
Then we can discuss

100
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,080
what to do next.

101
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,520
Yeah, of course, man,

102
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,520
whatever you say. Just do it.

103
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,310
Dr. Choi.

104
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,310
Hold on one second, Maggie.

105
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,080
I know this isn't easy,

106
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,080
but try to stay calm.

107
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,520
We're gonna take

108
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,520
good care of your son.

109
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,750
Dr. Choi, need to talk to you

110
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,750
right now. April.

111
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,460
Yeah?

112
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,430
That dad, Chris Davis,

113
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,430
there's a BOLO out

114
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,430
for his arrest.

115
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,630
A "be on the lookout"?

116
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,630
Yeah.

117
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,430
He kidnapped his son.

118
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,250
Apparently,

119
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,250
he just got out

120
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,250
of Joliet on parole.

121
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,130
Showed up at his ex-wife's,

122
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,130
grabs his son and takes off.

123
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,990
How's the boy?

124
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,990
End stage renal disease.

125
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,120
Oh, the poor kid.

126
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,660
I'll call PD.

127
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,970
Ms. Goodwin,

128
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,970
Ben's in bad enough shape

129
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,630
without having

130
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,630
to watch his dad get

131
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,630
arrested and taken away.

132
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,010
Could we just hold off

133
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,010
until he's stabilized?

134
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,140
April.

135
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,200
He risked his freedom

136
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,200
to bring Ben here.

137
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,300
He's not gonna leave.

138
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,540
I'm not sure that's our call.

139
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,010
Can you think of any medical

140
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,010
reason why we should hold off?

141
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,750
No.

142
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,350
I'll keep an eye on Ben.

143
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,190
Go ahead

144
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,190
and make the call.

145
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,190
Okay, then.

146
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,490
Really?

147
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,620
Our first duty is

148
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,620
to protect our patient.

149
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,600
How? By taking his dad away?

150
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,760
We have no idea what

151
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,760
this man is capable of.

152
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,510
Sharon.

153
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,100
Gwen.

154
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,240
Dr. Lanik, new coat.

155
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,340
Since Dr. Stohl

156
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,340
is no longer here,

157
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,860
Dr. Lanik will be

158
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,860
our interim chief of the ED.

159
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,330
Congratulations.

160
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,350
Thank you. Excuse me.

161
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,730
You didn't consult

162
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,730
me on this.

163
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,760
It seems to be your mission

164
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,760
to fight me on everything.

165
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,900
Until that changes,

166
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,430
I'm going to be making

167
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,430
some decisions unilaterally.

168
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,680
Mr. Nevins, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

169
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,680
Nice to meet you.

170
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,220
Call me Bill.

171
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,220
All right, Bill it is.

172
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,850
So, I understand you've got

173
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,850
some new onset back pain, huh?

174
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,890
Yeah, but it's not too bad.

175
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,220
It's nothing you need

176
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,220
to get making a fuss about.

177
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,560
Yeah, well, fuss

178
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,560
is kind of our thing here.

179
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,260
Now, it looks like your CT

180
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,260
shows an aortic dissection,

181
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,330
which means you've got

182
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,330
a tear on the inside

183
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,330
of your vessel wall.

184
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,600
Do you have any tingling

185
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,600
in your arms?

186
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,040
Nope.

187
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,940
Uh, any palpitations,

188
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,940
funny feelings

189
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,940
in your chest?

190
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,110
Nothing. Seriously,

191
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,110
I'm good to go.

192
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,620
Well, you might be right.

193
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
It looks like

194
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
the tear is small,

195
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,420
so if we can

196
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,420
get you stabilized,

197
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,960
we should be able to send

198
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,960
you home to follow up

199
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,960
with the cardiologist.

200
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,750
That'd be great.

201
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,750
All right.

202
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,920
Start him on an Esmolol drip,

203
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,920
and if his systolic gets

204
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,920
above 120,

205
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,260
let me know.

206
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,260
Yes, Doctor.

207
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,320
I'll be back to check in

208
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,320
on you in a bit.

209
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,320
Thanks, Doctor.

210
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,500
You ever taken a lead

211
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,500
on a case before?

212
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,500
Not yet.

213
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,130
Well, today's

214
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,130
your lucky day.

215
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,550
Mr. and Mrs. Harris,

216
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,550
I'm student doctor Curry

217
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,050
and this is Dr. Manning.

218
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,740
I'm Lisa.

219
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,740
Matt.

220
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,850
So, you're 13 weeks

221
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,850
pregnant with three days

222
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,850
of abdominal pain.

223
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,420
Have you ever had pain

224
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,420
like this before?

225
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,420
No.

226
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,330
I'm going to examine you,

227
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,330
if that's all right.

228
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,990
Okay, have you had

229
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,990
any bleeding?

230
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,060
No.

231
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,730
Okay, any complications

232
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,730
with your pregnancy?

233
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,270
No. I mean,

234
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,270
not with the pregnancy.

235
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,800
For years, doctors said

236
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,800
Lisa could never get pregnant.

237
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,110
We tried and we prayed,

238
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,110
but nothing worked,

239
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,740
until, one day,

240
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,740
it just happened.

241
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,380
Did they tell you why

242
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,380
you couldn't get pregnant?

243
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,350
Um, something about

244
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,350
the shape of my uterus.

245
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,380
They did some tests,

246
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,380
but whatever it is,

247
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,380
it doesn't matter

248
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,860
'cause we finally have

249
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,860
our miracle baby.

250
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,970
So, the thing

251
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,970
about human anatomy

252
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,970
is that even when things

253
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,970
may seem like a miracle...

254
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,730
You know, before

255
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,730
we get much further,

256
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,710
I think we should check

257
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,710
your blood and send you

258
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,710
over for a doppler,

259
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,870
just to get

260
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,870
some more information.

261
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,430
Is that okay?

262
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,430
Yeah, that's okay.

263
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,340
Great. We'll be back soon.

264
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,010
First trimester pain

265
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,010
in a woman with

266
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,010
anatomic abnormalities

267
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,050
means that this pregnancy

268
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,050
could be ectopic.

269
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,220
Yes, but that does not mean

270
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,220
that we need to give her

271
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,220
a physiology lesson.

272
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,760
We do if we want her to be

273
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,760
informed about her condition.

274
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,630
She's entitled to her beliefs.

275
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,630
It is not our job

276
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,630
to challenge them.

277
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,260
It is when they're wrong.

278
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,260
Ms. Curry,

279
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,820
we don't know what

280
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,820
we're looking at yet,

281
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,820
so just go order the tests.

282
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,570
Hey, Ben.

283
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,570
Feeling any better?

284
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,030
No.

285
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,410
He's in SVT.

286
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,280
Give him four milligrams of

287
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,280
Diltiazem over five minutes.

288
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,380
"SVT"? What's that?

289
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,180
It's an arrhythmia.

290
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,180
You mean his heart?

291
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,850
I thought the problem

292
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,850
was his kidneys.

293
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,450
It is, but kidney failure

294
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,450
can lead to dysfunction

295
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,450
in other systems.

296
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,020
Will dialysis fix it?

297
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,720
I mean, he's been doing that

298
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,720
and he's still getting worse.

299
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,100
We need to give it a chance

300
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,100
before I can assess

301
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,290
what else he might need.

302
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,510
You didn't have to do this.

303
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,700
Sorry, legally, I had to.

304
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,100
Hey, Benny.

305
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Benny, I got to go away

306
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
for a little while.

307
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,550
But Dr. Choi is gonna take

308
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,550
good care of you, okay?

309
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,620
So you listen to him

310
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,620
and do whatever he says,

311
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,990
and I promise,

312
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,990
everything's gonna be okay.

313
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,930
Okay?

314
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,930
Okay.

315
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,360
Okay.

316
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,100
I love you. Okay.

317
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,310
Christopher Davis,

318
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,310
you're under arrest

319
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,410
for aggravated kidnapping,

320
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,410
endangerment of a child,

321
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,420
violation of an order

322
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,420
of protection

323
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,420
and violation of parole.

324
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,810
Do everything

325
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,810
you can for Ben.

326
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,990
Please.

327
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,510
All right, let's go.

328
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,260
Burgess, uh...

329
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,260
Uh, hold up.

330
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,320
What's up?

331
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,800
His son's really sick.

332
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,870
Could you keep him here

333
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,870
till we have a better idea

334
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,870
of what's going on?

335
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,960
That's not up to me.

336
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,200
I know.

337
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,670
If you want, I can,

338
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,670
I don't know, call the

339
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,670
State's Attorney and find out.

340
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,070
I'd appreciate it.

341
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,740
He can wait in there.

342
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,600
Okay.

343
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,810
Talbert.

344
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,180
Thanks.

345
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,390
Is that the baby?

346
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,390
Yes.

347
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,370
What?

348
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,260
Your pregnancy

349
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,260
is ectopic,

350
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,900
which means that the fetus

351
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,900
is implanted outside

352
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,900
of your uterus.

353
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,340
Okay, but you can put it back

354
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,340
where it belongs, right?

355
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,440
Unfortunately, we can't.

356
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,580
And I'm afraid

357
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,580
it's implanted

358
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,580
on your vena cava,

359
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,680
the large vessel

360
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,680
that carries blood

361
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,680
back to your heart.

362
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,290
And from the free fluid

363
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,290
I'm seeing in your abdomen

364
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,390
tells me that, unfortunately,

365
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,390
the vessel is leaking.

366
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,500
So how do you stop it?

367
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,120
I mean,

368
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,120
you need an operation.

369
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,140
The surgeon will have

370
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,140
to remove the fetus

371
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,140
and then repair the vessel.

372
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,170
Wait, you mean

373
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,170
we could lose the baby?

374
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,230
I'm sorry, but you would

375
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,230
in any case because

376
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,230
of where it's implanted.

377
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,870
There's no possible way

378
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,870
that it'll survive

379
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,870
long enough to be viable.

380
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,750
In surgery, we'll keep

381
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,750
your bleeding from

382
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,750
getting out of control,

383
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,580
so we need to get you up

384
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,580
to the OR as soon as possible.

385
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,550
No.

386
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,390
I'm sorry?

387
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,390
I am not having surgery.

388
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,930
I don't think

389
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,930
you understand.

390
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,260
If we don't operate,

391
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,260
you're going to die.

392
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,090
No, you don't understand.

393
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,160
This baby is a miracle.

394
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,660
And God will take

395
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,660
care of it.

396
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,630
Bill, what's happening?

397
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,610
It's like it's tearing a hole

398
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,610
through my belly.

399
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,110
Maggie, we need

400
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,110
to get Mr. Nevins

401
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,880
to Interventional now.

402
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,880
I'm on it.

403
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,680
Bill, I think the tear in your

404
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,680
aorta is getting larger,

405
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,880
so we need to place

406
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,880
a stent so it doesn't

407
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,880
get any worse, okay?

408
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,650
Yes, if you say so.

409
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,650
Okay.

410
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,250
Maggie, get transport down.

411
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,250
We need to get him moving.

412
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,690
IR's full.

413
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,690
It can't wait.

414
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,990
Can they bump any cases?

415
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,330
No, and both CT ORs are full,

416
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,330
too. There's nowhere to go.

417
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,130
If his aorta ruptures,

418
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,130
he's gonna bleed out.

419
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,430
Yeah.

420
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,730
I'm opening up

421
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,730
my hybrid OR.

422
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,770
It's not ready yet,

423
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,770
and it's not fully stocked.

424
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,860
Bill is too unstable.

425
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,570
I can't risk his aorta

426
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,570
blowing while we wait

427
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,570
to get him upstairs.

428
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,980
That team is not trained yet

429
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,980
and... You haven't done

430
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,980
a single run-through.

431
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,740
Dr. Rhodes!

432
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,890
Will, when was

433
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,890
the last time

434
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,890
you were here?

435
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,590
Man, I can't

436
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,590
even remember.

437
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,790
Hey, Tim.

438
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,790
Will.

439
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,850
What's the score?

440
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,850
Just started.

441
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,800
All right.

442
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,800
Dad.

443
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,990
Hey, Dad.

444
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Will Halstead's here.

445
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,130
William.

446
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,640
Still got the red hair.

447
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,610
Nice to see you, Mr. Burke.

448
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,610
Please, Ray.

449
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,480
Dad, I'll be in the kitchen.

450
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,280
Yeah.

451
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,280
See you, Will.

452
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,980
And, listen,

453
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,980
I'm sorry about

454
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,980
your father.

455
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,490
Good guy, but a terrible

456
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,490
poker face.

457
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,750
Always looked to the left

458
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,750
when he had a good hand.

459
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
He loved those

460
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
Friday night games.

461
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,790
So, what seems

462
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,790
to be the problem?

463
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,890
Ah, it's nothing.

464
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,890
Tommy's a worrywart.

465
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,760
I just been getting

466
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,760
these dizzy spells.

467
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,700
Sometimes they'll lay me out

468
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,700
a couple hours.

469
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,430
Well, sit down.

470
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,430
Let's have a listen.

471
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,110
This is what's missing

472
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,110
from medicine these days,

473
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,980
the face to face.

474
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,720
I'll take a house call

475
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,720
over some giant hospital

476
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,720
any day.

477
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,310
Can't say I blame you.

478
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,920
Yeah, you do have

479
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,920
a little bit of a murmur.

480
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,360
Probably worth

481
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,360
keeping an eye on.

482
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,030
So, what are you

483
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,030
up to these days?

484
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,790
Still got that place

485
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,790
down on Union?

486
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,790
The hall? Yeah.

487
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,860
Man, must be a heck

488
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,860
of a business.

489
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,510
I tell you,

490
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,510
I'm getting married soon,

491
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,370
and all the places

492
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,370
out there

493
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,540
are either booked up

494
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,540
or charging a fortune.

495
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,980
Oh.

496
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,980
Yeah.

497
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,540
So?

498
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,520
Are you gonna

499
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,520
ask me or what?

500
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,080
No, that's not why...

501
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,080
Come on, kid.

502
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,230
You check in on me

503
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,230
on your day off,

504
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,230
you need a hall.

505
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,690
I'm not an idiot.

506
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,990
I didn't mean to...

507
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm happy to do it.

508
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,930
So just say yes.

509
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,510
You're too smart

510
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,510
for me, Mr. Burke. Ray.

511
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,910
I really appreciate it.

512
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,910
Nah.

513
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,150
I gotta draw some blood.

514
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,150
Run some tests.

515
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,150
My favorite part.

516
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,520
All right, let's get

517
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,520
this started.

518
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,480
Where's Beth?

519
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,790
Stuck in the OR.

520
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,790
This wasn't on the schedule.

521
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,360
Gene, what's happening

522
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,360
with the monitors?

523
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,530
It's a brand-new system.

524
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,530
I'm still figuring it out.

525
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,660
Dr. Rhodes, patient's under.

526
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,660
I'm set.

527
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,430
Denise, what's the hold up?

528
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,600
I can't find the right-sized

529
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,600
guide wires.

530
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,440
All right, IV contrast,

531
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,440
injector tubing, and 20

532
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,440
and 60 CC syringes.

533
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,710
I didn't know

534
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,710
which ones you wanted.

535
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,440
Thank you, Maggie.

536
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,440
Welcome.

537
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,680
Dr. Rhodes, I still can't find

538
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,680
the correct guidewires.

539
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,050
Oh, that's the middle cabinet,

540
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,050
top left corner.

541
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,090
Iris, call upstairs.

542
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,090
We're not gonna need Beth.

543
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,030
I can make the call.

544
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,030
Nope. I need you to scrub in.

545
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,290
What? I can't do that.

546
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,420
You used to scrub, right?

547
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,420
Yeah, that's like forever ago.

548
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,730
I don't even know

549
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,730
if I remember.

550
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,430
I need a pair of hands.

551
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,430
Go scrub in.

552
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,240
April, take over.

553
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,240
Yeah. No problem.

554
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,870
Just figure this out,

555
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,870
we'll be fine.

556
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,740
Your patient, Mrs. Harris,

557
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,740
just passed

558
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,580
the Brief Psychiatric Rating

559
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,580
Scale with flying colors.

560
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,650
You actually think

561
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,650
she's capable

562
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,650
of making this decision?

563
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,920
She is holding on

564
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,920
to a very strong belief,

565
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,520
but other than that,

566
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,520
she seems entirely reasonable.

567
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,760
"Reasonable"? She thinks

568
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,760
God is going to save

569
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,490
a fetus with a 0%

570
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,490
chance of survival.

571
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,590
That's delusional.

572
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,060
In my experience, it's not

573
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,060
always so easy to figure out

574
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,230
where belief ends

575
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,230
and delusion begins.

576
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,070
I mean,

577
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,070
faith in a supreme being

578
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,470
is held by an overwhelming

579
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,470
majority of humans.

580
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,080
Okay, but if we don't do

581
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,080
something, she's going to die.

582
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,080
Can't force a procedure on her

583
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,080
that she doesn't want.

584
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,740
We're her doctors.

585
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,080
Our job is to fix her,

586
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,080
not argue about theology.

587
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,810
I'm sorry,

588
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,810
but this is ridiculous.

589
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,290
Ms. Curry, I appreciate

590
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,290
that this is

591
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,290
a complicated situation,

592
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,160
but our job, in fact,

593
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,630
is to treat our patients

594
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,630
to the best of our ability

595
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,460
while honoring their

596
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,460
cultural, spiritual

597
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,460
and religious beliefs.

598
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,860
She's allowed to make

599
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,860
her own decisions

600
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,870
whether we agree

601
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,870
with them or not.

602
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,680
What did the State's Attorney

603
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,680
say about that kid's dad?

604
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,810
I haven't

605
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,810
heard back yet.

606
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,480
But does he have to wait

607
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,480
in my treatment room?

608
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,850
For now, yes.

609
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,850
Ben needs

610
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,850
a kidney transplant.

611
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,250
I want to see

612
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,250
if Chris is a match.

613
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,520
The man's going to jail.

614
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,520
And his son is dying.

615
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,030
His boy needs a kidney.

616
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,690
We don't have a choice.

617
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,160
Almost done.

618
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,970
My ex is always telling me

619
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,970
how they're doing just fine

620
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,970
without me.

621
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,560
Then I saw him lying there,

622
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,640
looking so sick.

623
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,230
Yeah.

624
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,210
For whatever it's worth,

625
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,210
Ben may very well have died

626
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,870
if you hadn't

627
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,870
brought him here today.

628
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,750
Anyway, it's not like

629
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,750
he's gonna miss me.

630
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,450
Never really been there

631
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,450
for him in the first place.

632
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,910
I'll have the results soon.

633
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,830
What you got there?

634
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,240
"The Journal

635
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,240
of Computer Methods

636
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,240
and Biomedicine."

637
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,010
MIT grad, right?

638
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,010
Yep.

639
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,040
Looks very technical.

640
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,040
It is.

641
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,210
But so is creating

642
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,210
a biomolecular scaffolding

643
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,150
to replicate

644
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,150
human organs in vitro.

645
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,980
That's what I'm going

646
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,980
to do as soon as

647
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,980
I finish med school.

648
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,110
Hmm. Sounds rewarding.

649
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,690
You know, in terms

650
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,690
of Mrs. Harris, I just

651
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,690
want to clarify that

652
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,730
the challenge when

653
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,730
you're trying to evaluate

654
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,730
a patient's ability

655
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,560
to act in their

656
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,560
own interests...

657
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,900
Oh! Actually, her labs

658
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,900
are ready. I should

659
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,900
go check on them.

660
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,070
Femoral sheath is in.

661
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,310
Gene, get in closer.

662
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,650
Zooming in.

663
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,190
What?

664
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,660
That bulge there,

665
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,420
that's where

666
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,420
his aortic wall

667
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,420
is the weakest.

668
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,300
That wasn't there before.

669
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,300
That's because his

670
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,300
aneurysm's enlarging.

671
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,030
We need to open him up.

672
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,730
What do you mean?

673
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,000
His aorta is being squeezed

674
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,000
closed. I'm gonna try going

675
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,000
in from the top.

676
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,370
Dr. Rhodes, the team's

677
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,370
not ready. Let me just

678
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,370
call upstairs...

679
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,970
We don't have time

680
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,970
to go upstairs.

681
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,110
Dr. Rhodes, we don't even

682
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,110
have profusion down here.

683
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,310
So we'll do without.

684
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,310
Set up for a thoracotomy.

685
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,820
Dr. Rhodes... It's...

686
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,820
Maggie!

687
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,380
We are opening him up.

688
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,210
All right, you heard the man.

689
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,580
Let's get set up

690
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,580
for a thoracotomy.

691
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,580
Let's go!

692
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,860
I can't get a good angle

693
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,860
on the aorta.

694
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,130
You opened his chest!

695
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,610
We didn't have a choice.

696
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,670
You told me yourself

697
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,670
this room wasn't ready.

698
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,610
What if this patient

699
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,610
doesn't survive?

700
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,720
Connor, I advocated for this

701
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,720
program. For you.

702
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,880
And now you're gonna

703
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,880
blow it up

704
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,880
before it even starts?

705
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,550
Damn it.

706
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,550
This isn't working.

707
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,290
Great. How do you propose

708
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,290
we get him upstairs

709
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,290
with his chest open?

710
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,830
I'm not going to.

711
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,230
Get me a five-inch

712
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,230
30 millimeter Dacron graft.

713
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,690
We're gonna cut out

714
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,690
the damaged aorta

715
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,690
and sew in a graft.

716
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,290
Prepare for cross clamp.

717
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,030
"Cross clamp."

718
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,040
That only gives you

719
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,040
30 minutes, even under

720
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,040
the best of circumstances.

721
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,510
This is a terrible long shot.

722
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,370
Yeah, I understand the risk.

723
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,810
Fine, I'll scrub in.

724
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,810
Six-and-a-half gloves.

725
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,110
No, I have everyone I need.

726
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,310
You wanna kill this man, fine.

727
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,620
Cross clamps

728
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,620
times two.

729
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,190
Thank you.

730
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,820
Right away.

731
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,590
Natalie.

732
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,100
Hey, so you know how it's been

733
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,100
impossible to find a venue

734
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,100
for the wedding?

735
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,900
Mmm-hmm.

736
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,900
Well, I found one.

737
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,870
You did?

738
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,870
And not just found it,

739
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,870
killed it.

740
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,810
It seats 200, separate room

741
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,810
for cocktails, and I got

742
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,810
the place at cost.

743
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,070
How did you do that?

744
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,070
The owner's a guy

745
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,070
who knew my dad.

746
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,770
He wasn't feeling well,

747
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,770
so I made a house call.

748
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,080
I looked him over

749
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,080
and he insisted we take it.

750
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,280
Will, that's fantastic.

751
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,050
That's how Canaryville works,

752
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,050
you scratch my back,

753
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,050
I scratch yours.

754
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,380
Dr. Manning.

755
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,380
The ICU just called.

756
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,020
Mrs. Harris'

757
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,020
pressure's dropping.

758
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,690
On my way.

759
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,550
This is great.

760
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,550
Yeah.

761
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,460
Let's go.

762
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,260
She's 90 over 60.

763
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,670
What's going on?

764
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,670
Let's see.

765
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,210
You're losing too much blood.

766
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,210
We need to get you

767
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,210
to surgery now.

768
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,300
I already told you no.

769
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,180
Honey, maybe we should

770
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,180
listen to the doctors.

771
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,680
Not you too, Matt.

772
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,680
I am not having surgery.

773
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,720
Lisa...

774
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,720
Please stop.

775
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,790
For 12 years, all I wanted

776
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,790
was to bring a new life

777
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,790
into this world,

778
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,800
and finally,

779
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,800
God has rewarded

780
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,800
my patience.

781
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,800
And I don't believe

782
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,800
that he would turn around

783
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,560
and take it all away.

784
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
What if he did

785
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
take it away?

786
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,800
What?

787
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,810
If the fetus were to

788
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,010
stop living because

789
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,010
of the blood loss,

790
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,480
would you give us permission

791
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,480
to do the surgery then?

792
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,280
To let us save your life?

793
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,950
What are you...

794
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,790
Why is she even talking about

795
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,790
this? That's not gonna happen.

796
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,190
She's just asking.

797
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,220
So will you at least agree

798
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,220
to that? If the fetus dies.

799
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,960
Fine,

800
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,800
if that happened,

801
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,800
which it won't, then...

802
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,400
Yes, I would have

803
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,400
the surgery.

804
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,670
Can we stop

805
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,670
talking about this?

806
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,670
Of course.

807
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,680
Bolus a liter of saline,

808
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,680
and type and cross

809
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,680
for six and six,

810
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,180
and give her two units

811
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,180
of uncrossmatched blood now.

812
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,980
We'll be back to check

813
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,980
on your shortly, okay?

814
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,580
Okay.

815
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,580
Thank you.

816
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:11,150
Ms. Curry, that was

817
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:11,150
a disturbing,

818
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:11,150
tactless question.

819
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,690
Why did you ask that?

820
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,630
Because we should know, right?

821
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,420
To be prepared.

822
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,800
No, there is a difference

823
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,800
between being prepared

824
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,800
and terrifying a sick woman.

825
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,260
I'm at work.

826
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,540
What?

827
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,410
Caught on fire?

828
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,280
Emily, don't you know

829
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,280
you can't put something

830
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,280
in the microwave

831
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,320
if it doesn't say

832
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,320
"microwave safe"?

833
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,910
No, don't touch anything,

834
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,910
okay? I'll take care of it

835
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,910
when I get home.

836
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,350
Nice.

837
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,350
What?

838
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,660
She's your sister.

839
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,660
Talk to her however you want.

840
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,550
What's going on with you?

841
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,550
Nothing.

842
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,920
It's just unfortunate that you

843
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,920
can't give anyone a break.

844
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,330
Me?

845
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,770
You know,

846
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,770
I can't win with you.

847
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,430
You disapproved when I was

848
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,430
tough on Emily, then you

849
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,430
walked out when I took her in,

850
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,840
and now you're mad at me

851
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,840
for telling her how to use

852
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,840
the microwave

853
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,470
so she doesn't burn

854
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,470
my apartment down.

855
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,210
I'm not the problem here,

856
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,210
April, you are.

857
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,150
Hey, Joey.

858
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,150
Hey.

859
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,850
Could you run a CBC, BMP,

860
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,850
LFTs, and a thyroid panel

861
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,850
on those, please?

862
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,190
Sure.

863
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,390
Ray Burke.

864
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,790
Oh, uh... Where's the

865
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,790
Patient Accession Number?

866
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,230
Doesn't have one.

867
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,860
It's for a friend.

868
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,100
Look, I can't run blood work

869
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,370
for anyone who's not a patient

870
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,370
in the hospital.

871
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,600
Come on, Joey.

872
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,600
What's the big deal?

873
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,940
Processing bodily fluids

874
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,940
is highly regulated,

875
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,850
and if my numbers

876
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,850
don't match up, then

877
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,850
somebody's gonna know.

878
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm sure you'll figure

879
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,880
something out.

880
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,880
Sorry, man.

881
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,280
Nah, you're right.

882
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,280
We should play by the rules.

883
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,460
You remember last month?

884
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,460
Your bronchitis?

885
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,460
I gave you amoxicillin?

886
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,530
Yeah.

887
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,130
I should fill out

888
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,130
admission forms, submit them

889
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,130
to your insurance,

890
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,180
then we can have a Patient

891
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,180
Accession Number on that, too.

892
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,810
Your friend's results

893
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,810
should be ready in an hour.

894
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,110
What a saint.

895
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,090
Yeah.

896
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,490
What's going on?

897
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,320
Mr. Davis is

898
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,320
a transplant match

899
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,320
for his son.

900
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,660
We're taking him up

901
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,660
to the OR.

902
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,060
No. We can't do that.

903
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,260
Excuse me?

904
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,700
He's the only donor

905
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,700
within 500 miles.

906
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,700
Ben needs his kidney.

907
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,700
I'm sorry,

908
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,700
but I have my orders.

909
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,440
You cannot deny

910
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,440
that boy a transplant.

911
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,320
I don't want to,

912
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,320
but the moment we take

913
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,320
his father upstairs,

914
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,860
he becomes

915
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,860
our patient as well.

916
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,690
I understand

917
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,690
transplant protocol.

918
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,660
So then you know that

919
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,660
the dad is gonna spend

920
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,720
a few days in the ICU,

921
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,720
but then what?

922
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,560
Jail while awaiting trial,

923
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,560
and then prison.

924
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,530
Those are hardly ideal

925
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,530
conditions in which to recover

926
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,530
from major surgery.

927
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,830
We could very well lose him.

928
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,240
Find an acceptable donor.

929
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,240
Let's not lose anybody.

930
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,040
Gwen, we don't have time,

931
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,040
and the father is a match.

932
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,640
You know

933
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,640
the hospital's position

934
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,640
on ultra high-risk patients,

935
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,250
especially those who have

936
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,250
a proven history of making

937
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,250
extremely poor decisions.

938
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,190
So you're sacrificing

939
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,190
the child to protect

940
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,190
your statistics?

941
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,450
Our statistics,

942
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,860
which allow us

943
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,860
to remain an accredited

944
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,860
transplant center

945
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,330
serving this entire city,

946
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,330
and that is my concern.

947
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,400
And it should be yours,

948
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,400
as well.

949
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,320
I let him know he won't

950
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,320
be allowed to give Ben

951
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,320
his kidney.

952
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,080
Any luck finding

953
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,080
another donor?

954
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,080
No.

955
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,460
I have a call into East Mercy.

956
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,390
There's a chance

957
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,390
they may agree

958
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,390
to let Chris donate there.

959
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,990
Let's hope.

960
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,990
Yeah.

961
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,070
Ray, I just want to let

962
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,070
you know that your

963
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,070
blood work looks good,

964
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,010
but given your murmur, I do

965
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,010
recommend that you follow up

966
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,010
with a cardiologist.

967
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,610
Well, I'm sorry,

968
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,610
but my specialty

969
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,610
is emergency medicine.

970
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,210
You'd be better served...

971
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,890
And, Ray, I really

972
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,890
appreciate that...

973
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,820
Okay, I'd be happy to.

974
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,360
You know,

975
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,360
let me check my schedule,

976
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,290
and I'll find a day that works

977
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,290
and I'll stop by.

978
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,840
Ultrasound.

979
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,030
Start the MTP.

980
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,030
What's happening to her?

981
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,080
Her internal bleeding

982
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,080
is getting worse.

983
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,800
Katie, call the OR.

984
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,800
Lisa!

985
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,180
BP's 92 over 51.

986
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,010
I need to take you

987
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,010
to surgery right now.

988
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,580
No, my baby.

989
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,580
Lisa, listen to her.

990
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,590
Mrs. Harris, I need

991
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,590
your consent. We don't

992
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,590
have a lot of time.

993
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,020
I can't find a heartbeat.

994
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,020
What?

995
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,060
The fetus.

996
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,060
What is it?

997
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,290
There's no heartbeat.

998
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,290
Its heart isn't beating.

999
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,660
No.

1000
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,890
I'm sorry, but the fetus

1001
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,890
is no longer alive.

1002
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,990
No.

1003
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,970
I need to take you

1004
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,970
to surgery right now.

1005
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,660
Lisa, come on. We have to go.

1006
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,660
My baby.

1007
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,970
BP's 70 over 35.

1008
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,730
Mrs. Harris, look at me.

1009
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,970
I need to take you

1010
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,970
to surgery right now.

1011
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,740
If I don't, you will die.

1012
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,800
Lisa.

1013
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,910
Mrs. Harris, please.

1014
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,040
Please.

1015
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,040
Okay.

1016
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,380
All right, let's go!

1017
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,980
Time?

1018
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,750
Got seven minutes.

1019
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,850
Marty, the heart stopped.

1020
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,160
Lost the A-line waveform.

1021
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,990
He's in PEA. Get me epi.

1022
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,120
Maggie, do internal CPR.

1023
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,120
What?

1024
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,260
Put your hands around

1025
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,260
his heart, all the way around

1026
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,260
his heart, and pump.

1027
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,230
Is there no other option?

1028
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,230
No, there's not.

1029
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,230
You can do this.

1030
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,070
Now keep squeezing.

1031
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,170
Epi.

1032
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,910
Squeeze harder.

1033
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,040
Got a CPR waveform.

1034
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,980
Stop.

1035
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,550
And pump.

1036
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,090
Let go.

1037
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,270
Good job.

1038
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,630
Six-and-a-half minutes.

1039
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,840
Hey.

1040
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,710
I heard Ms. Harris agreed

1041
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,710
to the surgery once she lost

1042
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,710
the fetal heartbeat.

1043
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,550
They got to her in time.

1044
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,550
She's gonna make it.

1045
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,880
Well, that's a relief.

1046
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,020
Yeah, but even though

1047
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,020
the fetus wasn't viable,

1048
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,690
its heart was still beating

1049
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,690
when they opened Lisa up.

1050
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,660
Really?

1051
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,660
Yeah, I've got to go tell tech

1052
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,720
that there was a malfunction

1053
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,720
with the ultrasound.

1054
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,730
Huh.

1055
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,370
The State's Attorney said

1056
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,370
we can't keep him here

1057
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,370
any longer.

1058
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,410
Well, we're still waiting

1059
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,410
to hear back from East Mercy.

1060
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,000
There's nothing I can do.

1061
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,550
Dr. Choi!

1062
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,910
He's in unstable SVT at 240.

1063
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,680
He's not profusing.

1064
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,680
Two milligrams of Adenosine.

1065
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,960
Adenosine's in.

1066
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,820
What's happening? Will someone

1067
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,820
tell me what's happening?

1068
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,420
Let him stay.

1069
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,020
No change. Charge at 20

1070
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,020
and sync.

1071
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,160
Charged.

1072
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,160
Clear!

1073
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,900
Two more of Adenosine.

1074
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,900
Charging to 40.

1075
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,510
Adenosine's in.

1076
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,770
No good. Clear!

1077
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,080
Pulse is strong. Regular.

1078
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,360
Is he gonna be okay?

1079
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,830
His arrhythmias

1080
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,830
are getting harder

1081
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,830
to convert.

1082
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,220
He's gonna die?

1083
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,500
I'm sorry, Chris.

1084
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,500
Let me see him.

1085
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,440
Come on, please, man.

1086
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,440
It's my son.

1087
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,940
Let him.

1088
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,240
Stop.

1089
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,240
Not like that.

1090
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,130
Daddy.

1091
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,210
You're gonna be okay.

1092
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,710
I love you, Ben.

1093
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,410
I love you, too.

1094
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1095
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,430
Chris!

1096
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,930
Do the transplant.

1097
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,070
You wanna do everything

1098
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,070
you can for him?

1099
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,070
Take my kidney.

1100
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,170
I'm trying to find another

1101
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,170
hospital to do the surgery.

1102
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,240
I just need

1103
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,240
a little more time.

1104
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,550
No, he doesn't have time!

1105
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,550
Do it now!

1106
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,290
Do it now!

1107
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,290
No!

1108
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,920
Stand down!

1109
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,920
Pupils are blown.

1110
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,620
Start Levophed,

1111
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,620
get him on a gurney,

1112
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,290
and tell the transplant team

1113
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,290
we're coming up now.

1114
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,350
Okay.

1115
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,800
Thought you'd like to know.

1116
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,740
We just heard from East Mercy.

1117
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,740
They would have done

1118
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,740
the transplant.

1119
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,980
What did we do?

1120
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,640
You are a physician,

1121
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,640
Dr. Lanik.

1122
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,220
You know that

1123
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,220
when you make a decision,

1124
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,590
you don't always

1125
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,590
get the outcome

1126
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,590
that you want.

1127
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,590
But that doesn't mean

1128
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,590
that the decision was wrong.

1129
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,700
To have such faith

1130
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,700
in something, and then

1131
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,700
have it go so wrong.

1132
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,230
Yeah.

1133
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,170
Are you gonna...

1134
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,700
Are you gonna tell her

1135
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,700
about the fetal heartbeat.

1136
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,480
I'm happy to.

1137
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,480
No.

1138
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,680
No, I'll tell her. I just hate

1139
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,680
to have to tell her at all.

1140
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,860
I'm so sorry...

1141
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,680
So, I heard about the false

1142
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,680
reading on the ultrasound.

1143
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,970
Yeah, those machines

1144
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,970
can be delicate.

1145
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,380
One good hit

1146
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,380
to the transducer...

1147
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,940
Save it.

1148
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,780
You hacked the machine

1149
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,780
so that it wouldn't read

1150
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,780
the fetal heartbeat.

1151
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,250
No, I did not.

1152
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,590
You've been resistant

1153
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,590
to the patient's wishes

1154
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,590
from the start.

1155
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,450
Because she was determined

1156
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,450
to kill herself.

1157
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,020
Do you know that

1158
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,020
I can have you kicked

1159
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,020
out of medical school?

1160
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,700
Kicked out?

1161
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,700
Well, you committed a crime.

1162
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,990
No,

1163
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,990
the machine malfunctioned.

1164
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,400
Okay, I didn't do anything,

1165
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,400
and, by the way,

1166
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,400
that woman is alive.

1167
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,900
Doesn't anybody

1168
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,900
care about that?

1169
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,990
That's not the point.

1170
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,510
I know what the point...

1171
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,510
Clearly, you don't!

1172
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,240
I didn't do it.

1173
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,180
Well, I can't prove it,

1174
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,910
which makes you

1175
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,910
a very lucky young woman.

1176
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,820
But you are severely deficient

1177
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,820
in attitude and temperament,

1178
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,380
and I'm going to keep

1179
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,380
a very close eye on you.

1180
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,020
From now on, you and I

1181
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,020
are gonna go over

1182
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,760
all your charts

1183
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,760
and all your cases together.

1184
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,760
Are you serious?

1185
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,000
Very.

1186
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,900
Your numbers all look good,

1187
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,900
Bill, so we're gonna

1188
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,900
get you set up here, okay?

1189
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,940
Thanks, Doc.

1190
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,910
I'll be back to check on you

1191
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,910
in the morning.

1192
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,920
That was a hell of a day.

1193
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,620
Sure was.

1194
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,590
We should do it again.

1195
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,090
What?

1196
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,830
What do you say

1197
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,830
to heading up my team?

1198
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,600
Scrub in on all of my cases.

1199
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,070
I'm a charge nurse.

1200
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,130
Going back to the OR,

1201
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,110
that's sort of a demotion.

1202
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,640
Think about it.

1203
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,290
My patient pulled through.

1204
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,060
I'm glad to hear it.

1205
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,530
Look, I am sorry

1206
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,530
that I threw you

1207
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,530
out of my OR.

1208
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,260
It was a mistake.

1209
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,260
It was inexcusable.

1210
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,330
So how about a peace offering,

1211
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,330
huh? I'll buy you a drink.

1212
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,640
I don't care about

1213
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,640
you throwing me out.

1214
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,770
What I can't stand

1215
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,770
is you acting so stupidly.

1216
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,940
Willing to destroy your

1217
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,940
program in service of your

1218
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,940
arrogance and your ego.

1219
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,480
So go enjoy your victory,

1220
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,480
but I don't want

1221
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,480
any part of it.

1222
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,900
I'm gonna pick up

1223
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,900
some dinner and I'll meet

1224
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,900
you at your place.

1225
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,260
Okay.

1226
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,660
Oh, hey.

1227
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
Do you think the hall

1228
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
would hold 250?

1229
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,430
I sent a picture of it

1230
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,430
to my mom,

1231
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
and now she wants to invite

1232
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
a few more cousins.

1233
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,040
Yeah, of course.

1234
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,430
Great.

1235
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,370
See you.

1236
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,370
Good.

1237
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,750
Come here.

1238
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,650
Jay, what's up?

1239
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,650
Get in the car.

1240
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,530
What do you know

1241
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,530
about Ray Burke?

1242
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,870
Does some real estate,

1243
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,870
owns a bar,

1244
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,500
a construction company...

1245
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,500
And a reception hall.

1246
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,840
Yeah.

1247
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,400
You went to see him.

1248
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,950
He wasn't feeling well,

1249
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,950
so I made a house call.

1250
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,450
How do you know?

1251
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,810
Ray, I just want to let you

1252
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,810
know that your blood work

1253
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,810
looks good,

1254
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,380
but I do recommend

1255
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,380
you follow up

1256
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,380
with a cardiologist.

1257
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,390
I'm not going

1258
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,390
to a cardiologist.

1259
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,090
I want you, Will. And, you

1260
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,090
know, I'm giving you that

1261
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,090
hall for two grand.

1262
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,720
That's practically for free.

1263
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,600
Yeah, what, are you listening

1264
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,600
to my calls?

1265
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,160
Ray's.

1266
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,160
Ray's?

1267
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,100
PD and the FBI have been

1268
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,100
investigating him

1269
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,870
for, like, two years,

1270
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,870
and then look who

1271
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,870
waltzes in, my brother.

1272
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,850
Why are you investigating him?

1273
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,850
'Cause he's a gangster.

1274
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,250
Come on.

1275
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,050
What, he pays off

1276
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,050
a building inspector

1277
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,050
every once in a while?

1278
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,990
Try money laundering, fraud,

1279
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,990
embezzlement, and now

1280
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,990
you're involved with him.

1281
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,980
I'm not involved with him,

1282
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,980
okay? I'm using his hall.

1283
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,980
It's no big deal.

1284
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,860
Yes, it is. So whatever

1285
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,860
you're doing, stop.

1286
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,960
Go home.
