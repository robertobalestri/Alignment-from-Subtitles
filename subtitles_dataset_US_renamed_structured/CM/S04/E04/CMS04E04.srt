1
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,320
Good workout?

2
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,050
Bring on the day.

3
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,290
Me too.

4
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,590
Come on,

5
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,590
what are you eating?

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,190
Peanut butter-banana-bacon

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,190
sandwich.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,530
Delicious.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,160
Elvis was

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,160
on to something.

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,390
I get it,

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,390
you crave calories.

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,870
But I told you,

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,870
healthy ones are

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,870
best for the baby.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,430
I know. That's why

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,430
I doubled up on the bananas.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,710
Anyway, just came in

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,710
to say, I give up.

20
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,740
You've been nagging me

21
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,740
to meet Bernie.

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,410
He's been all over me

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,410
to meet you,

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,080
so let's just

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,080
get it over with.

26
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,880
I can meet tonight

27
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,880
after work.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,150
Molly's?

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,150
Or before work?

30
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,190
Maybe in, like, an hour?

31
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,790
Hospital cafe?

32
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,330
Bernie's got

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,330
a tight schedule.

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,330
You know what? I want to meet

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,330
Bernie more than I want

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,330
to argue with you.

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,170
So fine. I'll be there.

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,640
Thank you.

39
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,440
He's a really good guy, Ethan.

40
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,840
I love him.

41
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,910
You will, too.

42
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,090
Linda Harper, 28-year-old

43
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,090
female, GCS 12,

44
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,720
diaphoretic,

45
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,720
and very confused.

46
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,530
BP 100 over 76.

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,620
Heart rate 120.

48
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,390
Normal sinus rhythm EKG.

49
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,830
Dad said Mom's been fighting

50
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,830
a cold the last few weeks.

51
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,340
Today she was holding

52
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,340
the baby and passed out.

53
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,630
Landed on him.

54
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,630
Okay.

55
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,000
It's okay, little man. Dad's

56
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,000
right here. Everything's gonna

57
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,000
be all right.

58
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,770
Evan Harper,

59
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,770
18-month-old male,

60
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,110
gross deformity of the right

61
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,110
arm, splinted in the field,

62
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,700
no other apparent injuries,

63
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,700
.10 morphine en route.

64
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,910
Okay, his arm needs to

65
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,910
be reduced and casted.

66
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,780
Let's do it

67
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,780
in special procedures.

68
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,380
Wait, you're taking

69
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,380
him away?

70
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,890
We need to set his fracture.

71
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,950
He's only a toddler.

72
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,950
It's safer to do it upstairs.

73
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,080
But my wife's staying here.

74
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,080
Go be with your son.

75
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,520
We'll take really good

76
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,520
care of your wife.

77
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,620
James, where are you?

78
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,820
Linda, I'm right here.

79
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,820
I'm right here.

80
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,560
I've gotta go be with Evan.

81
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,560
I'll be back as soon as I can.

82
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,660
Will you call her

83
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,660
brother Manny?

84
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,670
I don't want her to be alone.

85
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,670
Yeah.

86
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,030
I'll get the number,

87
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,030
get him down here.

88
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,030
Thank you.

89
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,230
All right, let's get

90
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,230
a CBC, CMP, COAGS,

91
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,240
cardiac labs, and let's start

92
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,240
a 12 Lead EKG.

93
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,310
Whoa. Dr. Manning.

94
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,280
Oh, my God.

95
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,090
Your patient's brother

96
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,090
is here,

97
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,390
Manny Calderon.

98
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,560
Thank you, Leah.

99
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,900
Mr. Calderon?

100
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,600
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning. I've been

101
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,600
treating your sister, Linda.

102
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,580
Is she okay?

103
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,580
The nurse said she fell.

104
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,580
She passed out. We're trying

105
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,580
to figure out why.

106
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,980
What about the baby, Evan?

107
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,210
He has a broken arm,

108
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,210
but he's going to be okay.

109
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,450
James is with him,

110
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,450
and until he comes back,

111
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,650
Linda said I can share

112
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,650
with you what I've learned

113
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,650
so far.

114
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,450
Come on, I'll take you

115
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,450
back to her.

116
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,720
So, Linda's upper body

117
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,720
is covered in bruises.

118
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,420
There's also petechiae,

119
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,900
the small capillaries

120
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,900
of her skin are inflamed

121
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,900
and bleeding.

122
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,530
I think it's all a result

123
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,530
of something happening

124
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,530
inside her body.

125
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,030
She has more

126
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,030
than a cold then.

127
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,770
Until I know more,

128
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,770
I don't want to speculate.

129
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,870
Here, she's in here.

130
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,350
Manny.

131
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,350
Okay?

132
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,100
Great. Emily asked you to be

133
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,100
the buffer for the Bernie

134
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,100
introduction, didn't she?

135
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,600
She's nervous.

136
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,600
She wants you to like him.

137
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,900
Or at least not scare him.

138
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,490
Right, because

139
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,490
I'm the problem in this.

140
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,360
Just try to have

141
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,360
an open mind.

142
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,000
Hey, Emily.

143
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,470
Ethan, this is my boyfriend

144
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,470
Bernard Kim.

145
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,980
Call me Bernie.

146
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,240
Nice to meet you.

147
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,710
Honey, this is April.

148
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,020
Oh, April, it's lovely

149
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,020
to meet you.

150
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,650
Oh, okay, we're hugging.

151
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,350
Emily and I are just...

152
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,350
We're just so touched

153
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,890
by how supportive

154
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,890
you've been

155
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,890
and... Thank you.

156
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,120
It's my pleasure.

157
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,220
So, why don't we

158
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,220
grab a table?

159
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,820
Keep things moving? Babe?

160
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,820
Yeah.

161
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,860
Oh, you're not coming?

162
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,300
Greetings are done.

163
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,300
Nobody ran.

164
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,960
You don't need

165
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,960
me anymore.

166
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,710
Heh.

167
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,580
Look, I am not bragging

168
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,840
when I say that

169
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,840
this hybrid O.R.

170
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,610
could revolutionize

171
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,610
trauma surgery's interaction

172
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,740
with emergency medicine.

173
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,620
It's set up for interventional

174
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,620
and open procedures.

175
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,850
We've got surgical lights,

176
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,850
we've got a C-arm, case carts.

177
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,520
There is a scrub room

178
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,520
right outside.

179
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,790
Okay, maybe I'm bragging

180
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,790
just a little bit.

181
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,500
Doctor, can I get a shot

182
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,500
of you in front

183
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,500
of the operating table?

184
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,930
Yeah, sure.

185
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,070
All right,

186
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,070
thank you, everybody.

187
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,600
The hospital's PR department

188
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,600
will forward you complete

189
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,600
press kits.

190
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,010
Thank you.

191
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,900
So, I'm going to bring

192
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,900
the Trib through in five

193
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,380
and then the local

194
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,380
NBC affiliate after that.

195
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,850
I'll be ready.

196
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,850
I really appreciate

197
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,650
your putting on the charm.

198
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,550
Ms. Goodwin,

199
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,550
you built me Xanadu.

200
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,420
I would sing and dance

201
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,420
for you if you wanted.

202
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,360
Oh, I'm gonna

203
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,360
hold you to that.

204
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,300
Oh, my God,

205
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,300
it's Dr. Connor Rhodes.

206
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,770
Can I have

207
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,770
your autograph?

208
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,900
You're gonna have

209
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,900
to get in line.

210
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,030
I'm kind of a big deal

211
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,030
around here.

212
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,840
I've gotta admit,

213
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,840
this is an

214
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,840
impressive space.

215
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,880
Yeah. Feels right.

216
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,380
Look... Now that

217
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,380
I am officially

218
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,380
open for business,

219
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,120
it's pretty easy to see

220
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,590
how jumping the gun last week

221
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,590
was a mistake. I'm sorry.

222
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,830
Are we good?

223
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,830
We're good.

224
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,370
It's Latham.

225
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,370
I've gotta go.

226
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,330
Congratulations, Connor.

227
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,330
Thank you.

228
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,980
Hey, you could have told me

229
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,980
Bernie's old enough

230
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,980
to be my dad.

231
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,480
First, that's

232
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,480
an exaggeration.

233
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,950
Second, I didn't know.

234
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,420
It's just a number, right?

235
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,420
Does it really matter?

236
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,790
No, not if Emily

237
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,790
acted like an adult,

238
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,690
instead of a 12-year-old.

239
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,090
You mean like how

240
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,090
you're acting right now?

241
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,830
April, every boyfriend

242
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,830
my sister's had has

243
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,830
been a train wreck.

244
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,090
You really think Bernie,

245
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,090
who she met in AA,

246
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,900
who's 20 years older,

247
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,900
is gonna be different?

248
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,630
Well, I mean, she does,

249
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,630
so you have to give him

250
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,630
a chance.

251
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,680
I wanted to, but then

252
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,680
I walked into the cafeteria

253
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,240
and I saw the same red flags.

254
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,280
April, I know

255
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,280
how this ends.

256
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,180
He splits, she folds,

257
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,180
and I'm left to pick up

258
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,180
the pieces.

259
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,910
Let's just hope

260
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,910
this time you're wrong, okay?

261
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,550
Look, I've gotta get

262
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,550
on transport right now.

263
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,350
Let's pick this up later.

264
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,120
The OTCs did nothing.

265
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,130
Urgent care prescribed

266
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,130
Zofran and Imodium.

267
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,250
Been taking them

268
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,250
for over a week, but...

269
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,920
Oh, it's so embarrassing.

270
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,970
It's okay, I get it.

271
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,970
Both ends?

272
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,340
I haven't eaten in days.

273
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,340
Where is it all coming from?

274
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,870
Likely viral gastroenteritis.

275
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,640
Urgent care

276
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,640
said the same thing,

277
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,240
but I've been like this

278
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,240
almost a month, and it's

279
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,240
not even flu season.

280
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,780
Unfortunately,

281
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,780
there's often an

282
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,780
exception to the rule,

283
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,870
and this time

284
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,870
it's you. Tests?

285
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,380
CBC, CMP, quantitative HCG.

286
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,150
Oh, that hurts.

287
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,480
CT abdomen and pelvis, got it.

288
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,290
Techs will be by soon

289
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,290
to take you for your scan.

290
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,990
The sooner the better.

291
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,990
I really feel like crap.

292
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,230
No pun intended, right?

293
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,560
Ms. Blake, I'm Dr. Choi.

294
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,070
Oh, thank God.

295
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,070
Finally, a real doctor.

296
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
44-year-old female,

297
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
complaints of lumbago.

298
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,570
Pain, ten out of ten.

299
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,980
HPI symptoms...

300
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,980
The important info...

301
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,740
I was getting

302
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,740
dressed for work,

303
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,880
bent down to put on my shoes,

304
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,880
and my back locked up.

305
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,650
Well, why don't we

306
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,650
take a look?

307
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,590
Is it okay if student doctor

308
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,590
McNeal examines you?

309
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,210
Have you done

310
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,210
this before?

311
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,120
Oh, wonderful.

312
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,120
I'll be gentle.

313
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,060
Guess you can't make

314
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,060
the pain any worse.

315
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,120
Laid on the floor for an hour

316
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,390
hoping the pain would ease up.

317
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,460
Nothing.

318
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,170
I see a surgical scar.

319
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,070
Discectomy?

320
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,070
L4.

321
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,440
Two years ago.

322
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,140
Felt pretty good

323
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,140
right after,

324
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,910
but these days it feels like a

325
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,910
bad sneeze could paralyze me.

326
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,850
Unfortunately, as common

327
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,850
as back pain is,

328
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,110
there's not a perfect fix.

329
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,780
Slow, slow.

330
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,080
Press against my hand

331
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,080
like a gas pedal.

332
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,850
It hurts.

333
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,750
Stabbing pain.

334
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,420
We have to do

335
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,420
the other leg?

336
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,790
It's gonna hurt, too.

337
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,090
So will flexion, extension,

338
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,260
the femoral stretch,

339
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,260
FABER test.

340
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,490
Been down this road

341
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,490
a few times?

342
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,730
Today's the worst

343
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,730
it's ever been, though.

344
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,700
What would you suggest?

345
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,630
CT?

346
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,000
Five of Valium

347
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,000
for the spasm?

348
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,800
Oh, bless you.

349
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,050
She got on you a bit.

350
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,050
Patients are going

351
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,050
to do that.

352
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,210
Don't take it personally.

353
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,950
It's all good.

354
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,950
When I was playing ball,

355
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,990
I had an OC could rip me

356
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,990
a new one like no other.

357
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,920
Compared to him,

358
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,920
Nora's a peach.

359
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,190
Hey, Doc.

360
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,490
Hey.

361
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,660
Got a sec?

362
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,060
Yeah, what's up?

363
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,930
Not here.

364
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,280
Here's the deal.

365
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,240
Your voice on Ray Burke's

366
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,240
wire is a problem.

367
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,580
Yeah, Jay told me.

368
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,180
I'm sorry. I didn't know

369
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,180
PD had something

370
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,180
going on with him.

371
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,560
Well, it's not just PD.

372
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,560
Feds are in on this too.

373
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,820
It's a joint

374
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,820
task force. Listen.

375
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,990
I just came to give you

376
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,990
the heads-up.

377
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,800
They're looking

378
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,800
your way now.

379
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,190
Me?

380
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,360
Mmm-hmm.

381
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,930
What for?

382
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Taking kickbacks.

383
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,500
What the hell

384
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,500
are you talking about?

385
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,910
You ran Ray's blood for free

386
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,910
and off the books,

387
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,170
then accepted

388
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,170
a sweetheart deal

389
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,170
on his wedding venue.

390
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,840
It's a bad move.

391
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,080
I was treating a patient

392
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,080
from the neighborhood.

393
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,180
E.D. docs, they make

394
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,180
house calls all the time.

395
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,150
They've never been

396
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,150
an issue with the hospital.

397
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,320
Well, they are with the Feds.

398
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,790
Unbelievable.

399
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,790
Yeah, I... Look.

400
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,690
You can still get

401
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,690
ahead of this, okay?

402
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,960
You can make it go away.

403
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,030
'Cause from now on,

404
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,660
whatever happens

405
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,660
between you and Ray,

406
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,660
pass it on.

407
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,170
Become a CI

408
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,170
for the task force.

409
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,170
An informant.

410
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,070
That's crazy. No way.

411
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,370
Doc, this is a big case.

412
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,340
High priority, understand?

413
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,680
You don't have

414
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,680
a lot of options.

415
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,710
Maybe, but I'm, uh...

416
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,420
I'm still not doing it.

417
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,420
Will, listen to me.

418
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,150
You get jammed up

419
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,150
with the Feds,

420
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,940
it could cost you

421
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,940
your medical license.

422
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,350
I said no.

423
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,080
It's the wrong answer.

424
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,160
I'll be in touch.

425
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,690
Doctor.

426
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,400
BP's dropping,

427
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,400
down to 90 over 70.

428
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,030
Heart rate's jumped, 130.

429
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,410
Spleen's abnormal.

430
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,410
Ultrasound.

431
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,640
Spleen is

432
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,640
grossly enlarged.

433
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,980
Also, free fluid

434
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,980
in the abdomen.

435
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,080
Wasn't there on intake.

436
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,780
Grab two units

437
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,780
and then let's move.

438
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,720
I need some help!

439
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,720
What's going on?

440
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,350
She's bleeding internally.

441
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,350
We need to get her

442
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,950
up to surgery now

443
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,950
to control it.

444
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,430
She'll be

445
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,430
okay though, right?

446
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,510
Doctor Manning.

447
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,510
Hi.

448
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,250
Linda, your labs

449
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,250
came back.

450
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,240
The cold you can't shake,

451
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,340
the bruising and petechiae,

452
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,340
and now your spleen...

453
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,980
They're from

454
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,980
primary myelofibrosis.

455
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,650
It's a type of leukemia.

456
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,320
Oh, my God.

457
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,650
Leukemia.

458
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,120
That's cancer.

459
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,560
It is. There are

460
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,560
some medications

461
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,890
that treat the disease,

462
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,660
but the side effects

463
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,660
can be extreme

464
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,130
and the results are unproven.

465
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,770
There is one treatment

466
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,770
that can offer a cure.

467
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,530
It's a stem cell transplant.

468
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,370
Transplant?

469
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,110
There's a list, right?

470
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,670
I'll be at the bottom.

471
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,240
No, no.

472
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,980
There are lists for organs

473
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,980
like hearts and lungs.

474
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,850
Because they come

475
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,850
from deceased donors,

476
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,290
there's a limited supply.

477
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,380
But stem cells come

478
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,380
from living donors.

479
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,930
So anyone able

480
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,930
to give blood

481
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,660
can likely also

482
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,660
give stem cells.

483
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,990
There are a lot of options.

484
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,230
See, baby,

485
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,230
we're gonna beat this.

486
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,670
Thank you, Dr. Manning.

487
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,670
Of course.

488
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,710
I'll call hematology

489
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,710
to get things started, okay?

490
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,970
Gracias.

491
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,480
BP's still low,

492
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,480
temp's ticked up, 102.

493
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,780
And three trips

494
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,780
to the bathroom.

495
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,720
I couldn't even

496
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,720
keep down ice chips.

497
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,950
I'm sorry. I wish

498
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,950
I had an answer.

499
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,050
All your blood work

500
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,050
was within normal limits.

501
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,680
And the CT did show

502
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,680
a cyst in your ovaries,

503
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,850
but that's not uncommon.

504
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,260
Yeah, my sister

505
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,260
has the same thing.

506
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,420
Oh...

507
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,160
Your neck hurt?

508
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,160
It's stiff.

509
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,330
Headache?

510
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,430
Off and on.

511
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,170
Set up for

512
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,170
a lumbar puncture?

513
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,730
Isn't that a spinal tap?

514
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,730
For the flu?

515
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,840
It's possible that

516
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,840
it's evolved into

517
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,840
encephalitis or meningitis.

518
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,910
I will never skip another

519
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,910
flu shot, I swear.

520
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,510
Is there someone

521
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,510
we can call for you?

522
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,650
No, my girlfriends,

523
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,650
they'll bring drama

524
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,650
I don't need right now.

525
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,920
Mmm-hmm.

526
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,820
Uh, what about your sister?

527
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,730
She and my parents

528
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,730
live out of state.

529
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,790
Mmm.

530
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,870
It's okay,

531
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,870
I've got my podcasts,

532
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,870
and they can actually

533
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,870
go with me into

534
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,870
the bathroom, so...

535
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,740
They might make

536
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,740
better company, then.

537
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,080
I see the Valium's helping.

538
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm trying to move around

539
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,520
a little, loosen things up.

540
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,020
Those my CT results?

541
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,650
Yes, scans show spinal

542
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,650
degeneration and scar tissue

543
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,280
at L3 through L5.

544
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,690
We suspect it's chronic and

545
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,690
not the cause of today's pain.

546
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,490
That's likely

547
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,490
structural, so...

548
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,490
You want an MRI.

549
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,530
Compare it to the scan

550
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,530
taken when I had surgery

551
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,090
two years ago to see

552
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,090
if anything's different.

553
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,040
Forgot. You know the drill.

554
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,370
Yeah, so I know an MRI

555
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,370
won't show anything

556
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,370
more than the CT.

557
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,070
You'll give me some

558
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,070
low grade muscle relaxer,

559
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,610
recommend physical therapy,

560
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,870
but those meds won't do

561
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,870
anything more than

562
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,870
a baby aspirin.

563
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,280
And I'm a lawyer, a partner

564
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,280
at Astor, Caldwell and Davis.

565
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,870
I don't have time

566
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,870
to lie on the floor

567
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,870
doing pelvic bridges

568
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,390
with some

569
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,390
glorified trainer.

570
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,180
So how about you just

571
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,180
write me a script

572
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,660
for what will work?

573
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,660
Norco 10/325s,

574
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,160
then we can all

575
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,160
get on with our lives.

576
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,090
I'll talk to the pharmacy.

577
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,860
I take it back.

578
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,370
I think Nora's got the edge

579
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,370
over my old coach.

580
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,400
What are you doing?

581
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,400
Running Nora's name

582
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,000
through the Illinois

583
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,000
prescription database.

584
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,300
See if she's flagged

585
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,300
as a frequent flyer.

586
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,940
You think she's just

587
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,940
trying to score pills?

588
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,940
Faking her pain?

589
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,000
Maybe. Dodging an MRI

590
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,000
and then immediately

591
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,170
pressing for meds

592
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,170
reeks of a con job.

593
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,350
She's not on file.

594
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,980
Still doesn't mean

595
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,980
we're getting the whole story.

596
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,850
So what do we do?

597
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,950
Nora had her back surgery

598
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,950
at East Mercy.

599
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,990
Call over there. See if

600
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,990
she's only coming to us

601
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,990
because they cut her off.

602
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,520
Cesar.

603
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,520
Ricky Glendon, 19.

604
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,470
Hit by a bus.

605
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,470
GCS 5, intubated on scene.

606
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,630
Hypotensive, but no obvious

607
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,630
long bone deformities.

608
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,100
Belly's hard

609
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,100
as a rock. Maggie?

610
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,200
I got you.

611
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,200
Baghdad's ready.

612
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,100
All right,

613
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,100
let's get him in.

614
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,450
All right. On my count.

615
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,280
One, two, three.

616
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,610
Give me the ultrasound.

617
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,670
Here you go.

618
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,820
Fast scan's positive.

619
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,260
There's free fluid

620
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,260
in the belly.

621
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,450
I need to get in there.

622
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,890
We'll do it in the hybrid O.R.

623
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,890
Maggie, decision time.

624
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,020
You on my team or no?

625
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,890
I'm in.

626
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,890
Good.

627
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,570
Page anesthesia,

628
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,570
assemble the others,

629
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,970
and prep the hybrid

630
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,970
O.R. for surgery.

631
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,440
Copy that. April.

632
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,870
Take over the AD?

633
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,880
As long as you need.

634
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,880
All right.

635
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,780
Jay, where are you?

636
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,780
Call me back.

637
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,510
Better yet, just stop

638
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,510
by the hospital.

639
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,980
Everything okay?

640
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,320
Yeah, just...

641
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,320
You know, Jay and I,

642
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,050
still arguing

643
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,050
over Dad's stuff.

644
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,650
Really? I thought

645
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,650
Pat didn't hold on

646
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,650
to anything.

647
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,450
Yeah, he didn't.

648
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,020
These are old baseball cards.

649
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,220
Oh.

650
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,230
So what was all that

651
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,230
with Voight this morning?

652
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,460
So secretive.

653
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,600
Nothing. He wanted

654
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,600
a curbside diagnosis

655
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,900
because he doesn't

656
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,900
trust his own doctor.

657
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,970
He's a pain in the ass.

658
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,070
He should get

659
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,070
a second opinion for that.

660
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,340
Get it?

661
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,340
Pain in the ass.

662
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,110
Oh, yeah. That's funny.

663
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,950
No, it wasn't.

664
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,010
But that's why I love you.

665
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,060
Oh, it's Goodwin.

666
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,060
I gotta go.

667
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,110
I'll see you.

668
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,100
We get a stem cell donor

669
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,100
for Linda?

670
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,430
Come in and close the door.

671
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,630
There's a problem.

672
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,700
Linda Harper isn't

673
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,700
a U.S. citizen.

674
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,580
That complicates

675
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,580
her ability to access

676
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,580
the transplant network.

677
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,440
Why? Patients can't be denied

678
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,440
based on immigration status.

679
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,920
No, but they can if they're

680
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,920
unable to prove they have

681
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,580
stable insurance

682
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,580
to cover the procedure

683
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,710
and the follow-up cost.

684
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,150
But she has insurance.

685
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,520
James, her husband,

686
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,520
is a citizen

687
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,520
and covered by Medicaid.

688
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,220
Doesn't that include Linda?

689
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,920
The marriage allows

690
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,920
Linda to apply

691
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,920
for a green card,

692
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,870
but until she has

693
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,870
official legal status,

694
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,700
James' Medicaid

695
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,700
does not extend to her.

696
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,030
This is ridiculous.

697
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,700
So despite the abundance of

698
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,700
stem cell donors out there,

699
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,750
Linda can't get to

700
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,750
any of them

701
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,750
because of red tape?

702
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,910
Ms. Goodwin, a transplant

703
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,910
is the only treatment

704
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,140
that can save her life.

705
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,550
I know.

706
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,750
That's why I think the family

707
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,750
should bypass the network

708
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,980
altogether with

709
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,980
a direct donation

710
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,460
from her brother, Manny.

711
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,920
And pay out of pocket?

712
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,820
It's expensive, I know.

713
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,260
But there's not

714
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,260
a better option.

715
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,990
I'll speak with James.

716
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,260
All right.

717
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,060
Thank you.

718
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,060
Mmm-hmm.

719
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,630
When this is tied,

720
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,210
the mesentery

721
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,210
will be hemostatic.

722
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,120
Marty, talk to me.

723
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,120
Massive ST elevations.

724
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,710
Kid's 19 and he's having

725
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,710
a heart attack?

726
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,590
Apparently.

727
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,590
We need an angiogram.

728
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,420
Let's get the C-arm

729
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,420
in place. Maggie?

730
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,960
Introducer kit,

731
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,960
wire and lead.

732
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,190
Read my mind. Let's go.

733
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,560
So, your LP revealed

734
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,560
a high presence

735
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,560
of white cells

736
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,030
in your cerebral

737
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,030
spinal fluid.

738
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,570
So it is encephalitis

739
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,570
or meningitis.

740
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,660
Yes and no.

741
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,300
The search for the

742
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,300
infecting bacteria or virus

743
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,300
was inconclusive.

744
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,710
So, you have the symptoms,

745
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,710
but not the cause.

746
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,870
That's strange, isn't it?

747
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,980
Tara, you're slurring.

748
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,150
My face feels weird. Tingly.

749
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,750
Ptosis of the left eyelid.

750
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,750
It's really droopy.

751
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,480
Left corner of the mouth

752
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,480
is lagging.

753
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,080
Seventh cranial

754
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,080
nerve issue?

755
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,890
Mmm-hmm.

756
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,520
Does your mouth feel dry?

757
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,660
Tastes like metal.

758
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,630
These new signs, whatever is

759
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,630
going on, it is definitely

760
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,630
affecting her brain.

761
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,670
Let's get an MRI and push her

762
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,670
to the front of the list.

763
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,790
Squeeze my fingers.

764
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,800
What's wrong with me?

765
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,400
We're gonna find out.

766
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,580
Order a transvaginal

767
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,580
ultrasound as well.

768
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,130
For the ovarian cysts?

769
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,700
Why? We already saw them

770
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,700
on the CT.

771
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,840
Yeah, well, I want

772
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,840
a better look.

773
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,280
Okay.

774
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,640
I understand

775
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,640
it's an enormous

776
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,640
amount of money.

777
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,920
I don't care.

778
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,220
We'll take out loans,

779
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,220
sell the car.

780
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,450
It's Linda's life.

781
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,650
And in all honesty,

782
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,650
this is the hardest part.

783
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,590
The medicine itself

784
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,590
is straightforward.

785
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,430
Manny, as Linda's brother,

786
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,430
you are the ideal candidate

787
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,590
to donate your stem cells.

788
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,100
It's a series of infusions

789
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,690
to boost your

790
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,690
bone marrow production.

791
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,970
When can he start?

792
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,970
Today.

793
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,200
By the end of next week,

794
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,300
it's likely you'll be

795
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,300
able to donate to Linda.

796
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,540
Manny, you all right?

797
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,540
I don't know.

798
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,140
Mr. Calderon,

799
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,140
it's a simple procedure.

800
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,650
I don't think I can.

801
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,810
Can what?

802
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,880
Donate.

803
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,120
Manny, what the hell

804
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,120
are you talking about?

805
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,750
I'm sorry, James. I just...

806
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,120
I can't.

807
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,390
Manny, you have to.

808
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,300
Mr. Calderon, I don't

809
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,300
know if you understand.

810
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,060
If we don't do this

811
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,060
transplant, your sister...

812
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,660
I know. But I can't.

813
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,210
What the hell's

814
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,210
wrong with you?

815
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,210
You're her brother.

816
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,740
Then leave.

817
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,740
Mr. Harper...

818
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,040
If you're not gonna help,

819
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,040
just get the hell out of here.

820
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,700
I said out!

821
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,650
Manny, are you okay?

822
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,020
Why?

823
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,260
I'm sorry, James.

824
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,850
Without you, she'll die.

825
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,340
Your sister

826
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,340
needs you, Mr. Calderon.

827
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,340
Please, help us

828
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,340
understand

829
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,340
your decision.

830
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,350
Donating stem cells means

831
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,350
my name goes into your system.

832
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,860
They monitor them.

833
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,860
That's how they get you.

834
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,390
Ah.

835
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,230
You're undocumented

836
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,230
as well, aren't you?

837
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,630
Yes.

838
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,360
And so is my wife.

839
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,290
She's pregnant.

840
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,900
I love my sister.

841
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,240
I risked our lives to get us

842
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,240
here from El Salvador, but...

843
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,810
If I get deported...

844
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,280
The hospital is prohibited

845
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,280
from sharing personal data

846
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,540
to law enforcement.

847
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,480
That includes

848
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,480
immigration officials.

849
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,490
No one will know you're here.

850
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,050
Government will find out.

851
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,990
They'll come for me

852
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,990
and then for my wife.

853
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:15,550
Mr. Calderon, I realize that

854
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:15,550
these are uncertain times

855
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:15,550
for immigrants

856
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,390
but you'd be donating

857
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,390
stem cells to your sister.

858
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,090
You'd be saving her life.

859
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,090
They won't care.

860
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,100
You don't understand.

861
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,100
How could you?

862
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,630
But it's real.

863
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,230
They take people

864
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,230
from work, from home.

865
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,700
They separate families.

866
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,870
I might

867
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,870
never see my wife again.

868
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,850
Meet our child.

869
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,320
I'm sorry.

870
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
No.

871
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,730
Damn it,

872
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,730
the tear is too close

873
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,460
to the takeoff of the LAD.

874
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,300
I can't deploy the stent

875
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,300
without occluding

876
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,300
the left main.

877
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,100
We're gonna have to crack him

878
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,100
open and revascularize.

879
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,010
I'll call upstairs

880
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,010
and get us a bypass machine

881
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,770
and perfusionist.

882
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,770
And Dr. Bardovi, too.

883
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,570
I'm going to need

884
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,570
an extra set of hands

885
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,570
to assist.

886
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,440
Okay, let's prep and drape.

887
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,740
On it.

888
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,490
Tara's MRI results.

889
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,790
Clean. No tumors,

890
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,790
lesions, or clots.

891
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,560
And the transvaginal

892
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,560
ultrasound.

893
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,800
Scan only shows

894
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,800
simple ovarian cysts.

895
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,170
Nothing abnormal.

896
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,170
Are you going to fill me in

897
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,940
on why you doubled back

898
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,940
to look at the cysts?

899
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,810
I thought one might

900
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,810
have been a teratoma.

901
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,640
A clump of cells

902
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,640
that shouldn't be there.

903
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,200
Well, it would explain

904
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,200
the sharpness she feels

905
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,200
in her abdomen,

906
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,010
and if the teratoma contains

907
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,010
primitive brain cells,

908
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,550
it could have tricked

909
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,550
her immune system

910
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,920
into attacking her

911
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,920
actual brain cells.

912
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,920
Causing the

913
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,920
neurologic symptoms.

914
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,220
Okay, yeah, I see

915
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,220
the connections,

916
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,590
but the kind of teratoma

917
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,590
that you're describing

918
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,990
is super rare.

919
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,990
Yes.

920
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,290
But a teratoma is the only

921
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,290
thing that connects

922
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,290
all her symptoms.

923
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,990
Then why didn't it show up

924
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,990
on the ultrasound?

925
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,160
I don't know.

926
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,630
But just because a

927
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,630
radiologist couldn't see it

928
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,100
does not mean it's not there.

929
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,440
Dr. Halstead,

930
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,440
there are cysts

931
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,440
in each ovary.

932
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,410
Even if there is

933
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,410
a teratoma hiding,

934
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,640
you don't know

935
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,640
which one it's in.

936
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,970
Yeah.

937
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,040
Our only move would be

938
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,040
to push for surgery.

939
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,280
Take them both out.

940
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,020
An oophorectomy.

941
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,490
You want me to call gyne?

942
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,110
She's only 30.

943
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,060
I do this, she won't

944
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,060
be able to have kids.

945
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,120
So, do I call gyne?

946
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,170
No. Start over.

947
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,170
Take a new history.

948
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,720
Draw all new labs

949
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,720
and test for zebras.

950
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,570
Start with an ANA,

951
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,570
SSA, SSB,

952
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,470
and antithyroglobulin

953
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,470
antibodies.

954
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,670
Okay.

955
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,740
Connor.

956
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,740
Oh, wow.

957
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,180
I asked for the CT fellow

958
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,180
and I get the Attending.

959
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,460
My new title

960
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,460
really carries some weight.

961
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,550
Easy there, tiger.

962
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,680
You only got me

963
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,680
because the elective CABG

964
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,560
I was starting

965
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,560
is now on hold

966
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,430
because your trauma

967
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,430
needs a bypass machine.

968
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,660
Mmm, also maybe because

969
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,660
you miss operating with me.

970
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,290
Scrub in.

971
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,340
Bypass machine should be

972
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,340
down here any minute.

973
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,370
Actually, I put a hold

974
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,370
on that order.

975
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,410
Machine's already prepped

976
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,410
and ready for use up

977
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,410
in the O.R.

978
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,340
Simpler to bring your patient

979
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,340
up than the equipment down.

980
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,080
You're right.

981
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,080
Let's do it.

982
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,620
Guess I do miss

983
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,620
operating with you.

984
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,480
Love hearing

985
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,480
you say I'm right.

986
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,780
Dr. Choi?

987
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,190
Just heard back

988
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,190
from East Mercy.

989
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,050
Nora's not on file

990
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,050
as a frequent flyer.

991
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,060
Never been a patient there.

992
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,190
Well, she definitely

993
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,190
had a surgery.

994
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,460
Scar on her back

995
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,460
is clear proof.

996
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,860
Well, I'll start calling

997
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,860
other hospitals,

998
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,400
see if she's on file

999
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,400
somewhere else.

1000
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,630
If Nora is playing us,

1001
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,630
it stands to reason

1002
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,640
she'd also lie about

1003
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,640
where she had her operation.

1004
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,400
Maybe it's simpler

1005
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,400
than that.

1006
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,370
If I were trying

1007
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,370
to game the system,

1008
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
I certainly wouldn't

1009
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
use my real name.

1010
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,240
So, if she's not

1011
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,240
Nora Blake, who is she?

1012
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,610
Good question.

1013
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,610
Dr. Charles, can I ask

1014
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,610
you something?

1015
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,950
I've got a strong feeling

1016
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,950
my patient gave a fake name

1017
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,150
to get a prescription.

1018
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,620
Huh.

1019
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,920
You think we're dealing

1020
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,920
with addiction?

1021
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,660
Likely, but I can't

1022
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,660
help her with it

1023
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,720
if I can't separate

1024
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,720
fact from fiction.

1025
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,270
You know,

1026
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,270
often when people lie,

1027
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,740
they tend to describe

1028
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,740
things in generalities.

1029
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,800
But when they

1030
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,800
use specifics,

1031
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,270
it's more likely

1032
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,270
they're telling

1033
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,270
the truth.

1034
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,570
Your patient give you

1035
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,570
any details?

1036
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,440
The type of meds

1037
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,440
she wanted.

1038
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,910
Oh, and her job.

1039
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,110
That she's a partner

1040
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,110
at a law firm.

1041
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,910
Astor, Caldwell,

1042
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,910
and Davis.

1043
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,680
Huh. Start there.

1044
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,510
Thanks.

1045
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,130
There.

1046
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,360
Nora Blake is actually

1047
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,360
Brenna McDouglas.

1048
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,500
Gotcha.

1049
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,770
Am I a match?

1050
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,610
No, I'm sorry.

1051
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,510
You don't have enough HLA

1052
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,510
markers in common with Linda.

1053
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,120
What about Evan?

1054
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,120
He's the only

1055
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,120
other blood relation.

1056
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,980
It's possible, but

1057
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,980
the injections needed

1058
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,050
to boost stem cells

1059
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,050
increase the chance

1060
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,060
that the donors themselves

1061
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,060
develop leukemia

1062
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,060
in the future.

1063
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,460
Evan's family history

1064
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,460
and his young age...

1065
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,260
His risk would be

1066
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,260
significantly higher.

1067
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,330
Is there any other way?

1068
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,670
Stem cells can also

1069
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,670
be extracted directly

1070
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,430
from Evan's bone marrow,

1071
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,810
but it's an invasive process,

1072
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,170
and given Evan's weight,

1073
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,680
it would take

1074
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,680
multiple procedures

1075
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,840
to harvest the amount

1076
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,840
of cells needed.

1077
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,310
It would be painful for him,

1078
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,720
and I can't guarantee it

1079
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,720
would be successful for you.

1080
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,480
So the only way

1081
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,480
to save my wife

1082
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,480
is to give my son

1083
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,030
the disease

1084
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,030
that's killing her

1085
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,890
or put him through hell

1086
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,890
and hope for the best?

1087
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,700
I'll donate

1088
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,700
my stem cells.

1089
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,250
I came to the United States

1090
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,250
for a better life.

1091
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,380
Linda has one

1092
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,380
with James and Evan.

1093
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,080
I can't take that from her.

1094
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,740
Fine, you got me.

1095
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,140
My name's Brenna McDouglas,

1096
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,140
not Nora Blake.

1097
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,880
Can I have

1098
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,880
my prescription now?

1099
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,610
It may feel

1100
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,610
like you need them,

1101
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,880
but more pills

1102
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,880
aren't the answer.

1103
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,650
I'm in pain.

1104
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,650
Don't you even care?

1105
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,250
Yes, we care.

1106
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,090
And we want to help.

1107
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,130
Let us set you up with

1108
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,130
an addiction therapist

1109
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,130
who can devise a pain

1110
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,130
management strategy

1111
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,630
that doesn't

1112
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,630
involve opioids.

1113
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,320
Here's some referrals

1114
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,490
that I think you should

1115
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,490
take a look at.

1116
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,690
No! I don't need

1117
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,690
a therapist

1118
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,690
or a new plan.

1119
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,260
I need my refill.

1120
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,100
What is the big deal?

1121
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,100
My God.

1122
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,970
I'm a lawyer

1123
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,970
with great insurance,

1124
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,870
not some junkie

1125
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,870
off the street.

1126
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,470
Or worse, some hombre

1127
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,470
that probably

1128
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,070
can't even speak

1129
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,070
the language.

1130
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,880
That guy in the next room...

1131
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,880
Mexican or whatever...

1132
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,110
He attacked a man.

1133
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,150
He fought him right

1134
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,150
in the emergency room.

1135
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,810
But nobody gave him

1136
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,810
a hard time

1137
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,480
or prevented his care. No.

1138
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,220
The doctor,

1139
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,220
the administrator...

1140
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,230
They're bending over

1141
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,230
backwards for him.

1142
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,660
There is no way

1143
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,660
he comes before me.

1144
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,090
So give me

1145
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,090
my prescription

1146
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,090
or, so help me,

1147
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,790
I will sue you

1148
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,790
and this entire

1149
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,790
emergency room.

1150
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,960
No.

1151
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,530
Then get out,

1152
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,530
and send me your boss.

1153
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,580
Dr. Lanik, my patient

1154
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,580
would like a word.

1155
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,100
You ready?

1156
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,450
Routine

1157
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,450
LIMA procedure

1158
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,450
should do it.

1159
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,010
Mammary artery's

1160
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,010
a perfect size match.

1161
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,890
But, if for any reason

1162
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,890
it feels off,

1163
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,420
we'll use the saphenous

1164
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,420
vein instead.

1165
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,290
What, you disagree?

1166
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,590
No, approach is spot on,

1167
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,500
just wondering why you're

1168
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,500
in the lead surgeon position.

1169
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,000
Because this is my patient.

1170
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,860
He was when

1171
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,860
he was downstairs,

1172
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,800
but now he's upstairs.

1173
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,030
I've been with Ricky

1174
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,030
since he entered the E.D.

1175
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,170
I'm gonna see him

1176
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,170
through to the end.

1177
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,470
And I have no problem

1178
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,470
with that,

1179
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,940
as long as it's as

1180
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,940
my number two.

1181
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,240
Scalpel please, Beth.

1182
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,880
Stop.

1183
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,810
Beth, scalpel.

1184
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,810
Hand him that instrument,

1185
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,150
and you're off my team.

1186
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,150
This is my O.R., Dr. Rhodes.

1187
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,960
You can assist

1188
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,960
or you can leave.

1189
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,960
What will it be?

1190
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,010
I already told you,

1191
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,010
the CT cases on the CT floor

1192
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,010
belong to the CT Attending.

1193
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,310
This shouldn't have

1194
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,310
even been an issue.

1195
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,010
No, because I wouldn't

1196
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,010
even be up here if I had

1197
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,710
a bypass machine downstairs.

1198
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,520
Well, you don't. Scalpel.

1199
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,160
It's about time.

1200
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,670
I've been trying

1201
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,670
to reach you for hours.

1202
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,240
Voight says the Feds

1203
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,240
want to come after me.

1204
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,700
Yeah, I know.

1205
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,700
Well, what the hell?

1206
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,570
You couldn't let me know I was

1207
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,570
about to get sucker punched?

1208
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,340
The Feds kept it from me.

1209
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,340
They know you're my brother.

1210
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,670
That I'd run interference.

1211
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,580
And did you?

1212
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,580
Deaf ears.

1213
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,140
PD, the Feds, they've been

1214
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,140
looking for a way

1215
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,380
into Ray Burke's circle

1216
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,380
for years.

1217
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,280
Now they got one,

1218
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,280
they're not letting go.

1219
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,480
I'm calling Ray,

1220
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,480
I'm giving the venue back.

1221
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,990
This is not worth it

1222
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,990
to save a few bucks.

1223
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,350
Will, you can't do that.

1224
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,220
Judges are

1225
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,220
expediting warrants

1226
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,220
and your clearance

1227
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,190
in the CI program.

1228
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,190
This is happening.

1229
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,390
Whose side are you on?

1230
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,120
Look, I'm not happy

1231
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,120
about making you a CI.

1232
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,290
But Ray Burke is a bad guy.

1233
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,300
Haven't I told you about

1234
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,300
all the felonies?

1235
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,740
Will, they want him

1236
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,740
for murder.

1237
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,740
He's gotta go away.

1238
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,140
So if I was running

1239
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,140
the task force, yeah,

1240
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,140
I'd wanna use you too.

1241
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,770
Ray's that dangerous

1242
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,770
a criminal

1243
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,900
and your best plan

1244
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,900
to nab him is me.

1245
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,840
He hardly ever lets

1246
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,840
anyone but family

1247
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,840
past the front door.

1248
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,170
You're perfect.

1249
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,910
You're a squeaky clean kid

1250
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,910
from the neighborhood

1251
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,350
who's an attending

1252
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,350
at a big-time hospital.

1253
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,550
For Christ's sakes,

1254
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,550
he invited you in.

1255
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,350
This is insane.

1256
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,250
Sometimes you've gotta do

1257
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,250
things you don't want to do.

1258
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,520
That's life.

1259
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,520
No.

1260
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,690
Screw the task force,

1261
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,690
screw Voight,

1262
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,490
and screw you.

1263
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,660
She's seizing.

1264
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,660
Five of Ativan.

1265
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,610
SATs have plummeted. 70.

1266
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,410
Face and lips

1267
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,410
are turning blue,

1268
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,410
she's cyanotic.

1269
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,580
Can't protect

1270
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,580
her airway either.

1271
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,580
I'm intubating.

1272
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,650
Sux and etomidate?

1273
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,250
Don't need meds.

1274
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,250
She's out.

1275
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,530
I'm in. Bag her.

1276
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,140
Cancel the new labs,

1277
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,140
transfer to gyne

1278
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,140
for the oophorectomy.

1279
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,570
Both ovaries have to come out.

1280
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,570
But, Dr. Halstead...

1281
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,910
I don't have a choice anymore.

1282
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,640
If I don't act now,

1283
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,640
she'll be dead.

1284
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,340
Prep her to move.

1285
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,170
It'll take five infusions

1286
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,170
to boost your stem cells

1287
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,520
to donation level.

1288
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,150
So come back tomorrow

1289
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,150
and I'll meet you

1290
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,420
at the outpatient clinic

1291
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,420
for number two.

1292
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,330
I know helping Linda

1293
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,330
is the right thing to do,

1294
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,330
but...

1295
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,660
I'm scared.

1296
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,320
Manny...

1297
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,700
What's going on right now in

1298
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,700
this country... I'm sorry.

1299
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,530
I hope it's not

1300
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,530
always like this.

1301
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,840
See you tomorrow.

1302
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,380
Stop!

1303
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,380
Hey!

1304
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,450
Stop right there.

1305
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,920
Immigration and Customs

1306
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,920
Enforcement.

1307
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,080
You're under arrest.

1308
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,680
Hey, what are

1309
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,680
you doing?

1310
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,820
No, no, no,

1311
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,820
you need to stop.

1312
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
This man is donating

1313
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
stem cells.

1314
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,560
Ma'am, please step back.

1315
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,730
I need you to stop.

1316
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,730
He is saving a life.

1317
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,770
Get your hands off of me!

1318
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,770
Ma'am.

1319
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,120
Due diligence?

1320
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,120
That's your position?

1321
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,620
A patient made a complaint

1322
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,620
against Mr. Calderon

1323
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,320
regarding an altercation

1324
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,320
with Mr. Harper.

1325
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,980
I looked into it

1326
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,980
and discovered

1327
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,980
the immigration issue.

1328
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,550
Unsure what

1329
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,550
hospital policy was,

1330
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,120
I brought the matter

1331
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,120
to Ms. Garrett.

1332
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,360
I reached out to legal

1333
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,360
for clarification.

1334
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,460
They reached out to

1335
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,460
immigration officials

1336
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,590
for further explanation

1337
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,590
of federal protocols.

1338
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,360
You're passing around

1339
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,360
Manny's information

1340
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,870
like it's a game

1341
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,870
of Telephone.

1342
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,240
Agents took him

1343
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,240
down at the hospital!

1344
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,110
The hospital is protected

1345
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,110
as a sensitive location.

1346
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,370
ICE had no right

1347
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,370
to make an arrest here.

1348
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,970
I was informed that

1349
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,970
there was

1350
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,920
an active Immigration and

1351
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,920
Customs Enforcement warrant

1352
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,820
on file for Mr. Calderon.

1353
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,450
So when authorities

1354
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,450
asked for permission

1355
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,080
to come on the property,

1356
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,080
I gave it.

1357
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,850
Did you even read this?

1358
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,490
They took Manny

1359
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,490
for a misdemeanor

1360
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,490
theft charge

1361
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,600
from 2010.

1362
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,500
Stolen items

1363
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,500
valued at $8.62.

1364
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,130
You gave permission

1365
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,130
for this.

1366
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,010
Manny's wife is

1367
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,010
also undocumented

1368
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,010
and she's pregnant.

1369
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,140
We just put

1370
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,140
a target on her back.

1371
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,840
I am not happy

1372
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,840
with the way this turned out.

1373
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,010
But my duty is

1374
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,010
to protect this hospital,

1375
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,180
not to pick fights

1376
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,180
with the Feds.

1377
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,890
I am sorry.

1378
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,170
Tough day, huh?

1379
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,970
You all right?

1380
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,850
She used an alias,

1381
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,850
lied to score drugs.

1382
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,220
She should be

1383
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,220
the one in cuffs,

1384
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,190
not that poor guy

1385
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,190
just trying to help

1386
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,190
his sister.

1387
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,550
I'm with you.

1388
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,350
But, look, I mean,

1389
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,350
she's an addict, right?

1390
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,830
And putting her behind bars

1391
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,830
wouldn't work anyway.

1392
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,720
I'm gonna have a lot of cases

1393
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,720
that break the wrong way,

1394
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,720
aren't I?

1395
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,790
Mmm-hmm.

1396
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,270
But you know what?

1397
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,430
You're also gonna have

1398
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,430
a whole lot that won't.

1399
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,170
Pathology report.

1400
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,910
One of the ovarian cysts

1401
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,910
was a teratoma.

1402
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,610
Oh, thank God.

1403
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,880
What if I'd been wrong?

1404
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,090
Are you supposed to say stuff

1405
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,090
like that to a third year

1406
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,090
medical student?

1407
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,490
Probably not, but that

1408
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,490
was the toughest call

1409
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,590
I've ever had to make.

1410
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,960
Yeah, but you said

1411
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,960
you didn't have a choice,

1412
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,860
so how tough

1413
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,860
could it have been?

1414
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,540
I'm sorry.

1415
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,540
I am so sorry.

1416
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,610
Did the hospital

1417
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,610
change their position?

1418
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,990
Are they gonna help?

1419
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,320
What is this?

1420
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,850
I compiled a list

1421
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,850
of immigration attorneys.

1422
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,300
Perhaps they can get

1423
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,300
Manny released quickly

1424
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,390
or expedite

1425
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,390
Linda's citizenship

1426
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,870
so she has easier access

1427
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,870
to the transplant network.

1428
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,530
That family came to us

1429
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,530
for medical help,

1430
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,870
and the best we could do is

1431
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,870
give them a list of lawyers?

1432
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,340
There are millions of people

1433
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,340
out there like Manny.

1434
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,850
What happens

1435
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,850
if they get sick?

1436
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,810
This is telling them,

1437
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,870
"Be afraid to go

1438
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,870
to the doctor."

1439
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,760
Hey.

1440
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,030
About earlier...

1441
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,030
Sorry I had

1442
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,030
to get rough.

1443
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,700
Don't be.

1444
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,400
You were just

1445
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,400
protecting your territory.

1446
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,700
So am I.

1447
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,940
What are you looking for?

1448
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,110
Uh, about three-and-a-half

1449
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,110
square feet.

1450
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,180
Ah.

1451
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,620
Space for a bypass machine.

1452
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,320
Of course.

1453
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,020
Big ticket item.

1454
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,020
Good luck.

1455
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,320
Good night.

1456
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,560
Ethan.

1457
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,600
Hey, you got a minute?

1458
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,930
Bernie, it's been a long day.

1459
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,530
I just want to go home

1460
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,530
and not think about anything.

1461
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,370
Please.

1462
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,810
Hey.

1463
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,480
I'm really sorry

1464
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,480
I put you in this position.

1465
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,620
Look, I'm a...

1466
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,620
I'm a middle-aged guy,

1467
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,590
and I meet

1468
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,590
your sister in AA.

1469
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,220
We start dating,

1470
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,220
we shouldn't,

1471
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,350
and I get her pregnant.

1472
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,560
And I'd be furious,

1473
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,560
too, if I were you.

1474
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,330
But I'm committed

1475
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,330
to my sobriety.

1476
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,530
And...

1477
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,930
Look, all I can say is

1478
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,540
I love Emily.

1479
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,880
And I'm gonna

1480
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,880
take care of her.

1481
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,310
And our baby.

1482
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,790
Okay, Bernie.

1483
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,950
Okay.

1484
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,600
Look, man, it's been

1485
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,600
a pretty long day

1486
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,610
so I don't want to

1487
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,610
get into it with you, okay?

1488
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,940
I'm really your only option?

1489
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,140
Yeah.

1490
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,540
Okay then.
