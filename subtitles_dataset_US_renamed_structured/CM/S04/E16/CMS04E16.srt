1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,600
Okay, modern art movement

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,600
characterized

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,830
by strong colors

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,830
and fierce brush strokes,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,000
seven letters,

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,000
begins with an "F."

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,540
Ask the Art History major.

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,600
Fauvism.

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,380
Painters were called fauves.

10
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,380
It's French for "wild beasts."

11
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,610
Hmm.

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,880
Always were

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,880
smarter than me.

14
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,180
Yeah, but it only

15
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,180
took you 20 years

16
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,750
to figure it out,

17
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,750
though, right?

18
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,590
You're gonna

19
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,590
have to eat fast,

20
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,960
because we're due

21
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,960
at the hospital

22
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,190
in a half hour

23
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,190
for your clinical

24
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,190
trial eval.

25
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,030
You know, speaking of which,

26
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,030
I had some time open up

27
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,430
in my schedule this morning,

28
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,930
so I was just thinking,

29
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,930
you know...

30
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,700
Okay, you can come,

31
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,700
but no doctoring.

32
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,670
No doctoring.

33
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,670
Danny.

34
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,370
I promise.

35
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,370
No doctoring.

36
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,550
Saw Robin and her mother

37
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,550
in the atrium.

38
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,950
Okay.

39
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,920
You must be happy

40
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,920
to have her back in town.

41
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,820
Look, Ava, we have to

42
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,820
share the same space,

43
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,230
so how about we just try

44
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,230
and keep it professional,

45
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,230
okay?

46
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,660
Still taking

47
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,660
the antiretrovirals,

48
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,660
by the way.

49
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,300
You know I've loved

50
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,300
having you crash with me.

51
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,170
The laundry, I know.

52
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,170
It won't happen again.

53
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,680
It's the third time

54
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,680
this week you left

55
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,680
wet clothes overnight.

56
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,150
What kind of grown man

57
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,150
can't follow a timer?

58
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,510
What kind of grown man buys

59
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,510
a sofa secondhand?

60
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,870
My back's killing me.

61
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,380
Honestly, dude,

62
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,380
don't you think

63
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,380
it's about time

64
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,950
you started thinking about

65
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,950
pulling the trigger

66
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,950
on an apartment?

67
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,920
Yeah, when I find one

68
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,920
I like, sure.

69
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,980
All right,

70
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,980
just level with me.

71
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,030
Are you holding out hope

72
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,930
that there's gonna be

73
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,930
a reunion with Natalie?

74
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,470
What? No.

75
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,430
She's done with me.

76
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,030
She's made that

77
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,030
perfectly clear.

78
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,070
What is it, Kol?

79
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,070
What do you see, huh?

80
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,570
What the...

81
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,440
Oh, my God, it's a body.

82
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,440
Frozen solid, no pulse.

83
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,180
I'm calling it in.

84
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,580
Jay, hang on.

85
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,580
I feel something.

86
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,580
She's alive.

87
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,300
Will, Baghdad's open.

88
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,300
What do you have?

89
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,860
Jane Doe, found her frozen in

90
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,270
the snow in

91
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,270
Jay's neighborhood.

92
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,070
Miss, can you tell me

93
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,070
your name?

94
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,700
Any idea how

95
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,700
she got there?

96
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,700
No overt signs of trauma,

97
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,070
did smell alcohol

98
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,070
on her breath.

99
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,270
CPD's working the scene.

100
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,080
Hey, you know the drill.

101
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,080
One, two, three...

102
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,390
Let's swap these blankets out

103
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,390
for warmer ones

104
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,180
and get these

105
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,180
wet clothes off her.

106
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,620
Whoa, whoa!

107
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,290
No wonder she's frozen,

108
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,290
got down to 10 degrees

109
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,290
last night.

110
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,990
Shawn, get a temperature.

111
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,990
Lucy, warm saline, two liters.

112
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,330
On it.

113
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,000
Frostbite to

114
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,000
her extremities.

115
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,200
Temp's only

116
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,200
31 degrees Celsius.

117
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,580
Miss?

118
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,580
My hands...

119
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,410
You're at Chicago Med.

120
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,410
Can you tell me your name?

121
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,490
My ring... Where's

122
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,490
my wedding ring?

123
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,680
Get new hot packs behind

124
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,680
her neck and in her armpits,

125
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,190
CBC, BMP, coags

126
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,190
and a urine tox screen,

127
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,320
specifically for

128
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,320
flunitrazepam.

129
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,320
On it.

130
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,790
Date rape drug? You think

131
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,790
she was sexually assaulted?

132
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,090
And probably robbed.

133
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,500
No cell phone or purse,

134
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,500
could have taken her

135
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,500
wedding ring, too.

136
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,540
And dumped her in the snow.

137
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,500
I'm gonna call Jay,

138
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,500
see what they turned up.

139
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,840
All right, wait a minute.

140
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,110
Do you remember when

141
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,110
you had that party,

142
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,210
that kind of New Orleans

143
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,210
style... What kind of party...

144
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,350
Fourth of July party.

145
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,720
Well, I always threw

146
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,720
the best parties, but that

147
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,720
was one for the books.

148
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,050
Pretty sure I ate

149
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,050
half my weight

150
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,150
in crawfish that day.

151
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,350
You did.

152
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,920
I did, yes.

153
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,760
And you had on that

154
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,760
really beautiful red sundress

155
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,760
that you made.

156
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,130
I did.

157
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,130
Made?

158
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,030
Looked pretty damn good

159
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,030
in that dress, too.

160
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,170
I looked good in that dress.

161
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,170
You looked good in red, right?

162
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,410
Hate to break up

163
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,410
the party, folks,

164
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,770
but I come

165
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,770
bearing good news.

166
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,100
Oh, Dr. Singh,

167
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,100
we love good news.

168
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,180
Caroline, your blood

169
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,180
and urine samples were normal.

170
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,050
Just need to do

171
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,050
a quick physical exam,

172
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,990
and then the last step

173
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,990
is to send you for scans.

174
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,180
If you follow me...

175
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,750
Okay, okay. Wanna come?

176
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,760
Yep.

177
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,760
All right.

178
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,570
It's nice of you to

179
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,570
clear your morning.

180
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,930
I'm sure

181
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,930
CeCe appreciates it.

182
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,900
Just trying to keep

183
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,900
everybody's spirits up.

184
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,940
Yeah, well,

185
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,940
I'll check in later.

186
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,770
Thanks for stopping by.

187
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,930
Okay.

188
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,310
She's hearing my murmur.

189
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,850
Had it since

190
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,850
she was a little girl.

191
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,650
No, I'm actually hearing

192
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,650
a double gallop.

193
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,910
A double gallop? Isn't that

194
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,910
usually from a valve issue?

195
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,320
We'll need an echo

196
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,320
to confirm,

197
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,290
but that tends to be

198
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,290
the cause, yes.

199
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,490
I'm sorry. I'll have to

200
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,490
hold the clinical trial

201
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,490
evaluation for now.

202
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,960
I'll page cardiology.

203
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,090
Can you page Dr. Rhodes?

204
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,070
Tell him it's for

205
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,070
Caroline Charles.

206
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,770
Morning.

207
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,420
How's Owen?

208
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,680
He's doing well.

209
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,520
Everything good with you?

210
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,520
Yeah.

211
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,430
Therapy's been going well.

212
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,230
That's great, Will.

213
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,230
I'm really glad

214
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,230
to hear that.

215
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,940
Oh, uh, I almost forgot...

216
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,720
What's up?

217
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,720
Your mail.

218
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,480
Sorry about that.

219
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,480
No, don't be.

220
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,580
Should change my address.

221
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,580
What? I didn't say that.

222
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,390
I...

223
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,390
Have a good day, Natalie.

224
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,800
Dr. Halstead,

225
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,800
Jane Doe's test results.

226
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
Did you hear? CPD stopped by

227
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
and dropped this off.

228
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,040
Her wedding ring.

229
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,810
Where'd they find it?

230
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,650
In the snow

231
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,650
where she passed out.

232
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,150
Her car was parked

233
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,150
nearby, too.

234
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,250
Purse and ID were inside.

235
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,250
Her name is Emma Patterson.

236
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,160
So she wasn't robbed.

237
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,160
Mmm-mmm.

238
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,220
What'd her labs turn up?

239
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,400
No roofie in her system,

240
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,400
but her blood alcohol

241
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,400
was.300.

242
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,830
Whoa!

243
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,260
So maybe

244
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,260
she just got wasted

245
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,260
and passed out.

246
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,630
Then what happened

247
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,630
to her clothes?

248
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,630
Right.

249
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,470
Let me know as soon

250
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,470
as she wakes up.

251
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,370
Hmm.

252
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,610
Hey.

253
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,850
Hey, Ethan...

254
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,690
Um, Shirley and Elijah

255
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,690
and I are going to check out

256
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,200
a band at the

257
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,200
Hideout tonight.

258
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,400
Since you haven't

259
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,400
accused me of murdering

260
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,400
any patients lately...

261
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,990
April, again, I'm sorry...

262
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,990
You should come.

263
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,040
I'd like to reset,

264
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,040
try being friends again.

265
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,810
I'd love to go.

266
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,810
It's just I have

267
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,810
plans already.

268
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,670
Vicki? What?

269
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,310
We're friends, right?

270
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,480
I mean, we should be able to

271
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,480
talk about our dating lives.

272
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Okay, yeah, with Vicki.

273
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,430
I'm actually meeting

274
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,430
the parents tonight.

275
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,220
Wow.

276
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,060
It's a big step.

277
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,060
Some help over here!

278
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,670
Hey. I'm Dr. Choi,

279
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,670
what's going on?

280
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,900
We were driving when

281
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,900
Tommy started complaining

282
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,900
of a headache.

283
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,240
We thought

284
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,240
it was a migraine.

285
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,680
A few minutes later,

286
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,680
he started vomiting.

287
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,210
Okay. Hey, Thomas...

288
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,910
Thomas, can you open

289
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,910
your eyes for me?

290
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,310
The light, it hurts.

291
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,310
All right, he's burning up.

292
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,580
He has acute

293
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,580
lymphocytic leukemia.

294
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,550
All right. Thomas...

295
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,550
Thomas, can you touch

296
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,550
your chin to your chest?

297
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,010
Stiff neck.

298
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,250
Could be meningitis.

299
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,250
Let's have a look at him

300
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,250
in the ED.

301
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,820
I'll let Maggie know

302
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,820
we're coming.

303
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,030
Grade 4 plus

304
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,030
mitral regurgitation?

305
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,630
I mean, what does that

306
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,630
even mean?

307
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,400
In addition

308
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,400
to your lymphoma,

309
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,770
you are, unfortunately,

310
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,770
in heart failure.

311
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,980
It was that chemo,

312
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,980
wasn't it?

313
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,310
I knew we shouldn't have

314
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,310
done the second round.

315
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,740
Some anti-cancer agents

316
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,740
can have cardio toxic effect.

317
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,580
What are the treatments?

318
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,580
Is it valve replacement?

319
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,020
Normally, yes, but given the

320
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,020
progression of your cancer,

321
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,580
the surgery is just too risky.

322
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,960
So I recommend

323
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,960
that we treat

324
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,960
with medication.

325
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,200
And how long

326
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,200
will it take to

327
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,200
show improvement

328
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,670
in her cardiac function?

329
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,070
There's no way

330
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,070
to know for sure,

331
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,400
but a couple of months,

332
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,400
at least.

333
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,870
But the clinical trial

334
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,870
starts in two weeks.

335
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,010
There's no way

336
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,010
she'll be accepted

337
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,510
if she's still being treated

338
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,510
for heart failure.

339
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,710
It's okay. There'll be

340
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,710
other trials.

341
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,850
Honey, there are new trials

342
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,850
being presented all the time.

343
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,680
All the time.

344
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,350
I'm gonna give you guys

345
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,350
some time.

346
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,670
Connor...

347
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,810
This clinical trial,

348
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,810
it's my mom's last hope.

349
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,210
Without it, she won't live

350
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,210
more than a few months.

351
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,010
If my mom agrees

352
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,010
to the surgery,

353
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,010
I want you to do it.

354
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,250
Look, Robin, I understand

355
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,250
how overwhelming

356
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,250
all of this is,

357
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,150
but I... I can't do that.

358
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,820
What do you mean,

359
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,820
you can't?

360
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,020
Oh, you mean you won't.

361
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,760
Look, there is

362
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,760
a 30 to 50% chance

363
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,760
of operative mortality.

364
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,390
Since when have you shied away

365
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,390
from a challenging surgery?

366
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,770
It is because

367
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,770
it's your mother

368
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,740
that I'm not willing

369
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,740
to chance it.

370
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,910
Robin, take the time

371
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,910
that you have with her.

372
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,710
Months are better than hours.

373
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,710
We could lose her

374
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,710
on the table.

375
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,010
And if it goes well,

376
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,010
you could give her years.

377
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,610
Please, Connor,

378
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,950
if anyone can

379
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,950
bring her through,

380
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,950
it is you.

381
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,450
I'm sorry, but no.

382
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,320
Wow.

383
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,090
I thought I could rely on you.

384
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,330
Robin, you have to

385
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,330
trust me, okay?

386
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,330
I am looking out for

387
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,330
both you and your mother.

388
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,690
Thomas's lumbar puncture

389
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,690
confirmed he has

390
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,690
viral meningitis,

391
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,220
most likely because

392
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,220
he's immunosuppressed.

393
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,820
I thought he was

394
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,820
finally out of the woods.

395
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,720
Kid can't catch a break.

396
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,460
Unfortunately, it appears

397
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,460
Thomas's leukemia

398
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,460
has progressed, as well.

399
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,760
His white blood

400
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,760
cell count is 48,000,

401
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,770
much higher than I'd expect

402
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,770
from viral meningitis alone.

403
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,910
You're saying... You're saying

404
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,910
the chemo isn't working?

405
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,940
I'm sorry.

406
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,250
We're gonna start him on

407
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,250
antivirals to help treat

408
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,250
the infection.

409
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,590
And then what?

410
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,590
A bone marrow transplant?

411
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,620
That's the next step.

412
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,620
It may give him time.

413
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,200
Our younger son, Gavin,

414
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,200
will donate to his brother.

415
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,890
Transplants from minors

416
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,890
are extremely rare.

417
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,830
Your oncologist will evaluate

418
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,830
all potential donors first...

419
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,700
No, you don't understand.

420
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,700
We conceived Gavin in vitro,

421
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,270
so he would be the perfect

422
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,270
genetic match to Thomas.

423
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,770
He's already donated

424
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,770
cord blood and a kidney.

425
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,590
Gavin was conceived to save

426
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,590
his brother's life?

427
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,650
I know how it sounds,

428
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,650
but we've been battling this

429
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,560
since Thomas was a toddler.

430
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,190
Without him...

431
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,120
Thomas wouldn't have made it

432
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,120
past his fifth birthday.

433
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,900
Ms. Patterson, do you know

434
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,900
how you ended up in the snow?

435
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,480
Call me Emma.

436
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,210
Um, couple of us

437
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,210
were at the office

438
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,210
working late.

439
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,680
We opened

440
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,680
a few bottles of wine,

441
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,680
had too much to drink.

442
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,790
So I ubered home

443
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,790
and left my keys.

444
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,520
Last thing I remember

445
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,520
is trying to get into

446
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,520
my house.

447
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,130
You ubered home?

448
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,130
Mmm-hmm.

449
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,660
'Cause they found

450
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,660
your car nearby with your

451
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,660
phone and keys in it.

452
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,570
Okay, truthfully,

453
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,570
I was hammered,

454
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,730
and I didn't want

455
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,730
you to know that I drove.

456
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,870
I know how irresponsible

457
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,870
that was.

458
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,840
Any idea what happened

459
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,840
to your clothes?

460
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,310
You were only wearing a slip

461
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,310
under your coat.

462
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,610
Right. Uh...

463
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,580
I spilled red wine

464
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,580
on my dress.

465
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,580
I left it at the office.

466
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,090
God, my hands are killing me.

467
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,720
Lucy, four of morphine.

468
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,720
You mentioned

469
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,720
your wedding ring

470
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,720
earlier...

471
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,050
Yeah, did you find it?

472
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,050
We did.

473
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,490
We got it in a safe place

474
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,490
for you.

475
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,490
Thank God.

476
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,430
If you want,

477
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,430
we can call

478
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,430
your spouse for you.

479
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,470
No, no, no, no, no.

480
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,900
I don't wanna worry Shelly.

481
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,230
Okay, but you are

482
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,230
gonna be here overnight.

483
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,800
We need to monitor the

484
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,800
severity of your frostbite

485
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,860
for at least 24 hours.

486
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,870
Well, my wife is

487
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,870
on a business trip.

488
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,180
If you call her, she'll just

489
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,180
hop on the first flight back.

490
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,940
There's really nothing

491
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,940
she can do, right?

492
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,150
Just let us know

493
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,150
if you change your mind.

494
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,210
Okay.

495
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,020
A bit shifty, no?

496
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,020
Mmm-hmm.

497
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,860
I mean, we all

498
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,860
have our nights,

499
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,590
but they don't end up

500
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,590
passed out in the snow.

501
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,290
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised

502
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,290
if she's trying to hide

503
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,230
a substance abuse

504
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,230
problem from her wife.

505
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,640
Do me a favor,

506
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,640
look in her records for

507
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,640
past hospitalizations,

508
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,730
anything related to drug

509
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,730
or alcohol abuse.

510
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,040
Yeah.

511
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,150
Hey, why'd you take on

512
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,150
Caroline's case if you're not

513
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,150
gonna see it through?

514
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,550
The last thing she needs

515
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,550
right now is to be passed off

516
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,550
on another doctor.

517
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,610
Whoa, wait a second,

518
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,610
what are you talking about?

519
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,590
We all agreed

520
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,590
that the surgery's

521
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,590
too dangerous, right?

522
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,890
Mortality rate's too high.

523
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,690
Now, all of a sudden,

524
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,690
Dr. Bekker's giving her

525
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,690
the green light?

526
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,320
Dr. Bekker advocated

527
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,320
for the surgery?

528
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,260
Advocated?

529
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,260
She agreed to do it.

530
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,370
I'm gonna take care of this.

531
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,140
Hey, Maggie, I have to

532
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,140
take off for a bit.

533
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,040
Dr. Peters is gonna

534
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,040
stay and cover for me.

535
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,470
Is everything okay?

536
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,470
Is Owen all right?

537
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,470
No, he's fine. It's Sophie.

538
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,910
Wasn't she discharged

539
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,910
a few days ago?

540
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,640
Yeah, but Phillip

541
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,640
just called.

542
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,050
Apparently, she's been

543
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,050
crying for hours.

544
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,280
He can't get her to stop.

545
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,550
Why doesn't he

546
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,550
just bring her in?

547
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,490
The last thing Sophie needs

548
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,490
is a trip in the cold,

549
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,850
especially if it's nothing.

550
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,230
Call me if you

551
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,230
need anything.

552
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,230
Thanks.

553
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,940
Oh, Will, good.

554
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,940
I've been doing

555
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,940
some digging.

556
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,100
I can't find any sign

557
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,100
of substance abuse in

558
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,100
Emma Patterson's records.

559
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,300
Huh.

560
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,640
Usually my gut doesn't lie.

561
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,640
Well, hold on, didn't you say

562
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,240
you found her

563
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,240
in Jay's neighborhood?

564
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,240
Yeah.

565
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,180
And she told us

566
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,180
that was her neighborhood,

567
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,180
but look at this.

568
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,450
Her current address

569
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,450
is Wilmette.

570
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,050
Okay, so she passed out

571
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,050
on someone else's lawn,

572
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,050
in her lingerie...

573
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,850
And didn't want us

574
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,850
to call her wife.

575
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,790
She's having an affair.

576
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,790
Certainly looks that way.

577
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,430
Oh, man.

578
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,430
Mags.

579
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
Mmm-hmm.

580
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
You know where

581
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
Natalie was off to?

582
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,360
I thought she was

583
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,360
working today.

584
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,360
She took some personal time.

585
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,500
With her medical bag?

586
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,500
She's making a house call.

587
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,780
Okay, Gavin, can you

588
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,780
make a fist for me?

589
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,440
Tight, tight, tight.

590
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,780
Okay, just gonna feel

591
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,780
a little prick.

592
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,760
It's not too bad, right?

593
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,190
No, but...

594
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,190
What's up, buddy?

595
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,330
When they take my bone marrow,

596
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,330
is it gonna hurt?

597
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,200
Last time, with the kidney,

598
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,100
I was so sore after.

599
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,470
I missed a lot of school.

600
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,470
I had to quit hockey.

601
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,410
Oh, sorry, bud.

602
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,410
That doesn't sound

603
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,410
too fun.

604
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,040
This time it shouldn't be

605
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,040
as rough, though.

606
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,150
The doctor will just take

607
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,150
some stem cells

608
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,150
out of your hip bone.

609
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,780
And it won't take long.

610
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,780
You'll be asleep

611
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,780
the whole time.

612
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,880
Asleep?

613
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,880
Yeah.

614
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,050
They'll give you

615
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,050
anesthesia.

616
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,050
No, I can't.

617
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,460
I don't want that again.

618
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,120
Gavin, did you have

619
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,120
a bad reaction last time?

620
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,860
It was so scary.

621
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,860
I couldn't breathe.

622
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,860
I couldn't scream.

623
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,130
When you were waking up?

624
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,570
It felt like there was

625
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,570
a pillow over my face.

626
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,300
I was gonna die.

627
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,530
Hey, hey, hey.

628
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,100
Take a deep breath,

629
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,100
Gavin, okay?

630
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,100
There you go.

631
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,240
Will it happen again?

632
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,240
Hopefully not.

633
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,310
No, no, no, no,

634
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,310
no, no, no, no, no.

635
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,310
Hey, hey, hey...

636
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,580
Gavin,

637
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,580
Gavin, look at me.

638
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,210
Look in my eyes.

639
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,210
Let's take some

640
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,210
deep breaths slowly.

641
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,060
In and out.

642
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,060
Slower, slow down.

643
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,660
Let me see your chest

644
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,660
fill up big, and relax.

645
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,290
She went behind my back

646
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,290
and tried to poach my patient.

647
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,670
Is this true, Dr. Bekker?

648
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,400
Hardly. I was offering

649
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,400
a second opinion.

650
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,400
You gotta be kidding me.

651
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,440
The patient's daughter

652
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,440
had already requested

653
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,440
the surgery directly.

654
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,570
You had no right

655
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,570
to insert yourself.

656
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,980
And honor

657
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,980
the family's wishes

658
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,980
when you'd refused?

659
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,140
Admit it, you're gun shy

660
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,140
because it's your

661
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,140
ex-girlfriend's mother.

662
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,210
Oh, come on, that is absurd.

663
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,120
I am acting in my patient's

664
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,120
best interest.

665
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,550
That's enough.

666
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,550
You mean my patient.

667
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,380
Really?

668
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,380
You two may think

669
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,380
I'm fascinated

670
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,120
by your little soap opera,

671
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,120
but I couldn't care less.

672
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,990
When you clock into

673
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,990
this hospital, you leave

674
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,990
that mess at the door.

675
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,560
Dr. Bekker, your lack

676
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,560
of professional etiquette

677
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,560
is glaring.

678
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,760
But Caroline Charles

679
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,760
has the right

680
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,760
to determine her own care.

681
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,740
Dr. Rhodes,

682
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,740
if you won't perform

683
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,740
the surgery,

684
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,140
Dr. Bekker will.

685
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,140
Thank you.

686
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,450
Not so fast.

687
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,310
Now, Caroline is

688
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,310
still my patient,

689
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,780
so if this surgery

690
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,780
is gonna happen,

691
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,380
I'm gonna do it.

692
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,520
What do you mean,

693
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,520
he doesn't wanna donate?

694
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,900
What did you say to him?

695
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,160
You have no business

696
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,160
scaring him.

697
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,400
I wasn't trying

698
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,400
to scare him.

699
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,460
Gavin had questions.

700
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,460
I answered him honestly,

701
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,900
because ultimately,

702
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,900
it's his decision.

703
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,100
We're his parents.

704
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,100
I still need his assent.

705
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,380
We won't put him under

706
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,380
anesthesia without it.

707
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,430
Dr. Choi.

708
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,910
My head. God, it hurts.

709
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,920
Oh, God.

710
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,920
He's tachycardic.

711
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,790
BP's 88 over 50.

712
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,790
Pressure's low.

713
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,790
What's happening?

714
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,490
Bolus a liter of saline

715
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,490
and give him 30 milligrams

716
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,490
ketorolac IV.

717
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,800
I thought you said

718
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,800
the antivirals would help

719
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,800
his infection.

720
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,930
They take time, but I'm

721
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,930
not convinced this is all

722
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,930
from the infection.

723
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,060
Pain is a stimulant.

724
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,830
I would expect

725
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,830
his blood pressure

726
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,830
to be high, not low.

727
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,840
Meds are in.

728
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,840
So then what is going on?

729
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,900
He's getting worse.

730
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,530
I'm not sure yet,

731
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,530
but I'm gonna find out.

732
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,180
April, let's get

733
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,180
a random cortisol

734
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,180
and a head CT.

735
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,020
Gavin, honey,

736
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,020
your brother is

737
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,020
really sick.

738
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,320
He needs you.

739
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,320
You wanna help him,

740
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,320
don't you, son?

741
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,770
Yeah.

742
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,800
I'll do it.

743
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,230
I wanna donate, Dr. Choi.

744
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,670
Oh, sweetie.

745
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,170
Hey.

746
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,550
You know

747
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,550
if Natalie's back yet?

748
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,550
Mmm-mmm. I don't think so.

749
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,660
Did she say who she was

750
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,660
going to see?

751
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,660
Will...

752
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,060
It's Phillip, isn't it?

753
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,060
Will, stop.

754
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,630
You know I'm friends

755
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,630
with both of you.

756
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,060
Just let sleeping dogs lie...

757
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,160
For now.

758
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,450
Hey, Nat, it's me.

759
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,450
I guess you're busy.

760
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,550
Uh, call me

761
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,550
when you get this.

762
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,490
How's everybody doing?

763
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,490
Good, Dad.

764
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,390
Honey, do you mind if I grab

765
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,390
a quick moment with your mom?

766
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,960
Sure.

767
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,630
Okay.

768
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,140
I'm fine, go.

769
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,140
All right.

770
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,570
Thanks, Dad.

771
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,920
Oh, God,

772
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,920
there's that look.

773
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,920
What look?

774
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,450
That look you always get

775
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,450
when you're about to

776
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,450
shrink me.

777
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,290
Me? Shrink you? Never.

778
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,290
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

779
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,590
So, um, how you feeling?

780
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,390
Terrified.

781
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,480
Honey, you know that

782
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,480
up until the moment

783
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,700
they wheel you into that OR,

784
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,700
you can change your mind.

785
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,440
You know that, right?

786
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,440
I can't.

787
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,480
I can't because

788
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,480
Robin begged me.

789
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,880
She begged me, Danny.

790
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,880
She begged me to do this.

791
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,690
And when your little baby

792
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,690
begs you to fight, you fight.

793
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,720
Right?

794
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,460
Of course, of course,

795
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,460
of course.

796
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,660
You know what?

797
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,660
It's cold in here.

798
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,600
Are you cold? Let me get you

799
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,600
another blanket.

800
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,360
Get you another

801
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,360
blanket? Okay.

802
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,120
Thank you.

803
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,310
Better?

804
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,420
Yeah, thank you.

805
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,820
Hey...

806
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,900
You know, I just, um...

807
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,440
I just wanted to

808
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,440
tell you how much, um...

809
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,840
How much I...

810
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,050
What?

811
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,610
I just wanna tell you that I

812
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,610
think you're gonna do great.

813
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,550
And I'm gonna see you

814
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,550
in a little while, okay?

815
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,250
Okay.

816
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,970
Where's Emma Patterson's room?

817
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,470
May I have your name, please?

818
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,710
I'm sorry, ma'am,

819
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,710
you cannot just walk in there.

820
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,580
Shelly,

821
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,580
how did you know

822
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,580
I was here?

823
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,410
The insurance called me.

824
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,410
Oh, my God, look at you.

825
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm gonna be okay, honey.

826
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,960
Thank you for checking on me.

827
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,320
I saw your car outside

828
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,320
of Ann's house, Emma.

829
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,920
Let's all take

830
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,920
a breath, okay?

831
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,920
I know how this looks.

832
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,460
This isn't the first time!

833
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

834
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,690
I swear, I wasn't planning

835
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,690
on doing anything.

836
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,360
What the hell

837
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,360
were you doing there?

838
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,760
Okay, that's it, outside now.

839
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,760
Your wife's still recovering.

840
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,800
Wife? You mean ex-wife.

841
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,430
Shelly, I'm so sorry.

842
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,430
Emma, I'm serious.

843
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,710
Leave me

844
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,710
and my girlfriend alone.

845
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,670
If you come near us again,

846
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,670
I'm calling the cops.

847
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,670
Okay.

848
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,770
Okay, that's enough.

849
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,770
Let's go, here we go.

850
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,290
It's nothing serious.

851
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,290
Okay, but the crying,

852
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,690
it's not gonna affect

853
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,690
her heart condition, right?

854
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,560
No, no. It's just colic.

855
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,360
So she'll be crying like this

856
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,360
for hours each day

857
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,460
for how long?

858
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,460
A week or two?

859
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,600
Probably a little bit longer.

860
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,070
Most babies stop

861
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,070
around three or four months.

862
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,770
But the best thing

863
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,770
you can do

864
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,540
is just try and soothe her,

865
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,540
just like this.

866
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,640
Okay, right. Yeah.

867
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,010
Wow, I love the little clouds.

868
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,790
My wife painted them.

869
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,690
And I nearly

870
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,690
had a heart attack

871
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,690
when I came in here,

872
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,960
and I saw her standing alone

873
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,960
up on that ladder.

874
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,520
But she insisted we get

875
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,520
the nursery done before

876
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,520
Sophie arrived.

877
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,590
Aww.

878
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,630
I... I haven't had time

879
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,630
to unpack the rest

880
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,630
of the house.

881
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,500
It's so strange,

882
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,500
it's like,

883
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,570
each day gets

884
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,570
better and worse

885
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,570
at the same time.

886
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,380
Hmm. Grief isn't linear,

887
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,380
at least not in my experience.

888
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,990
Can I ask you something?

889
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,990
Sure.

890
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,760
When did you know

891
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,760
that it was time

892
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,760
to take your ring off?

893
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,860
I noticed you were

894
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,860
still wearing it

895
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,860
a few weeks ago.

896
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,060
Oh, um, that wasn't

897
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,060
my wedding ring.

898
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,510
That was my engagement ring.

899
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,040
Oh, I didn't know.

900
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,040
That's okay.

901
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,480
Uh, we're not...

902
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,480
He and I aren't in

903
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,480
a great place, so...

904
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,910
I'm sorry.

905
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,910
No.

906
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,550
Did you hear that?

907
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,550
What?

908
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,650
Sophie fell asleep.

909
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,990
Oh, that's amazing.

910
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,990
Yeah.

911
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,860
Okay, I can put her down.

912
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,190
No, no, no, no, no.

913
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,460
It takes a while for them

914
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,460
to get into deep sleep.

915
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,660
I got it.

916
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,660
Okay.

917
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,990
Yeah.

918
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,660
Thank you.

919
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,660
Yeah.

920
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,270
Well?

921
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,670
I asked Gavin

922
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,670
if he wanted to donate.

923
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,410
He very clearly said yes.

924
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,540
The kid's scared

925
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,540
out of his mind,

926
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,540
I'm telling you.

927
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,380
He agreed under duress,

928
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,380
Ms. Goodwin.

929
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,510
April, duress is nearly

930
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,510
impossible to prove.

931
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,960
He's 11 years old.

932
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,960
He's already given

933
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,960
a kidney.

934
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,930
At some point,

935
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,930
we have to take into account

936
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,020
what Gavin wants.

937
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,220
He can't just be

938
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,220
a means to an end.

939
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,490
I get it, Dr. Choi.

940
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,490
Trust me, I do.

941
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,970
But the Kramers

942
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,970
don't want to hurt Gavin.

943
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,030
They want to

944
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,030
keep Thomas alive.

945
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,030
It's an impossible situation.

946
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,970
And if he doesn't voice

947
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,970
his reservations directly,

948
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,240
my hands are tied.

949
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,210
I can't stop the transplant

950
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,210
from moving forward.

951
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,420
What do you think

952
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,420
you're doing?

953
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,590
What does it look like

954
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,590
I'm doing?

955
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,330
I'm scrubbing in.

956
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,630
Oh, come on, you didn't think

957
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,000
you were going to perform

958
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,000
a surgery without me?

959
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,040
This is my floor.

960
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,440
You don't take on

961
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,440
cases this risky.

962
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,270
You're too worried

963
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,270
about your stats.

964
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,240
You know, I would say

965
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,240
that you were doing this

966
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,370
to get under my skin,

967
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,370
but even you wouldn't

968
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,370
stoop that low.

969
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,510
Or... Or would you?

970
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,110
Wow.

971
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,880
Your egotism

972
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,880
is truly boundless,

973
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,880
isn't it?

974
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,790
All right,

975
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,790
you want it straight?

976
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,790
I agreed to do the surgery

977
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,290
because I'm the

978
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,290
best CT surgeon

979
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,290
in this hospital.

980
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,300
I'm confident I can pull

981
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,300
Caroline through.

982
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,990
And if you're not, then stay

983
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,990
the hell out of my OR.

984
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,730
Hey, your temperature's up,

985
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,700
kidneys are making urine,

986
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,700
all good signs.

987
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,210
You think I'm insane,

988
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,210
don't you?

989
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,170
I'm not judging.

990
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,170
Breakups are tough.

991
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,950
I didn't intend to

992
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,950
go over there, I swear.

993
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,450
I'd just been drinking

994
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,450
and I couldn't sleep.

995
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,680
So I throw on my coat

996
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,680
and the next thing I knew,

997
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,090
I was parked outside

998
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,090
her girlfriend's house.

999
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,160
Listen, we all

1000
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,160
make mistakes.

1001
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,160
I get it.

1002
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,590
I just mean you shouldn't be

1003
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,590
too hard on yourself.

1004
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,190
Thank you for saying that.

1005
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,730
Everybody says

1006
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,730
I should let it go.

1007
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,800
But... Mmm.

1008
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,910
I know that Shelly

1009
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,910
still loves me.

1010
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,310
She came to the

1011
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,310
hospital, right?

1012
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,880
She wanted to see me.

1013
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,380
Don't you think

1014
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,380
that's a good sign?

1015
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,360
How are your hands feeling?

1016
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,360
Mmm. Okay.

1017
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,960
My right one's still

1018
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,960
really throbbing.

1019
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,660
But my left one, I actually

1020
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,660
don't feel anything at all.

1021
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,300
Nothing?

1022
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,300
Mmm-mmm.

1023
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,140
Maggie.

1024
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,140
Yeah?

1025
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,910
Oh, God, why does it

1026
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,910
look like that?

1027
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,010
The tissue's dead.

1028
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,620
Page burn service right away.

1029
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,620
Yeah.

1030
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,780
Retractor's in place.

1031
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,780
I can see the entire valve.

1032
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,760
Scissors.

1033
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,500
Starting with the

1034
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,500
anterior leaflets...

1035
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,500
Hold on.

1036
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,290
Those, uh...

1037
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,230
Those cords aren't as diseased

1038
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,230
as I would have imagined.

1039
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,170
I think you can

1040
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,170
just repair them,

1041
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,170
avoid replacing the valve.

1042
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,930
If I do that

1043
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,930
and the repair fails,

1044
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,600
she's gonna be back

1045
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,600
on the table in six months.

1046
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,080
That's if it fails.

1047
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,080
I'm not taking that risk.

1048
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,610
And if it doesn't, she'll be

1049
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,610
in better shape long-term.

1050
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,700
She won't have to take

1051
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,700
blood thinners...

1052
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,940
I'm not gonna do it.

1053
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,780
Like I said, starting

1054
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,780
on the anterior leaflets.

1055
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,390
Thomas's latest

1056
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,390
test results

1057
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,390
just came in.

1058
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,030
Wait, his head CT's negative.

1059
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,960
His random cortisol

1060
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,960
is really low.

1061
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,960
He didn't drop

1062
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,960
his blood pressure

1063
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,960
because of the infection.

1064
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,940
He's in adrenal crisis,

1065
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,940
but that would only happen

1066
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,840
if he'd stopped

1067
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,840
taking his prednisone.

1068
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,800
Isn't that part

1069
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,800
of his chemo regimen?

1070
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,040
Please don't tell my parents.

1071
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,920
Why'd you stop taking

1072
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,920
your prednisone?

1073
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,360
If it's making you sick,

1074
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,360
the oncologist can

1075
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,360
adjust the dose.

1076
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,150
Thomas.

1077
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,090
Not just the prednisone.

1078
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,890
I stopped taking

1079
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,890
all of my chemo drugs.

1080
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,500
I just... I don't

1081
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,500
wanna do it anymore.

1082
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,160
Any of it.

1083
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,840
I...

1084
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:21,210
The chemo, the operations,

1085
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:21,210
the doctors' appointments...

1086
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,450
I'm in pain all the time,

1087
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,450
and my little brother's

1088
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,450
suffering, too.

1089
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,630
What's going on here?

1090
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,630
Nothing.

1091
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,960
What were you

1092
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,960
talking to him about?

1093
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,240
Hey.

1094
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,910
I know you're scared

1095
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,910
of disappointing your parents,

1096
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,970
but you need

1097
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,970
to tell them

1098
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,970
how you feel.

1099
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,850
Disappoint us?

1100
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,390
What is she

1101
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,390
talking about?

1102
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,320
I don't want the transplant.

1103
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,220
Honey...

1104
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,220
I'm sorry...

1105
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,130
I don't wanna

1106
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,130
fight anymore.

1107
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,530
Do you know

1108
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,530
what you're saying?

1109
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,010
I'll donate.

1110
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,140
I'm not scared anymore,

1111
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,140
I promise.

1112
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,450
I know, but I don't

1113
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,450
want you to.

1114
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,480
You're really brave,

1115
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,480
but I'm ready to go.

1116
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,120
I'm ready. I'm so sorry.

1117
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,690
It's okay, son.

1118
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,970
You're not

1119
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,970
disappointing us.

1120
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,500
I promise.

1121
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,270
You could never

1122
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,270
disappoint us.

1123
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,720
Hey, Nat, it's me.

1124
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,450
I guess you're busy,

1125
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,450
but call me when you get this.

1126
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,890
I'd really like to talk.

1127
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,890
How about dinner tonight?

1128
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,790
Thanks.

1129
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,790
Here you go.

1130
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,070
Sophie should be

1131
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,070
down for the count,

1132
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,700
but if you need anything,

1133
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,700
feel free to call.

1134
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,210
Why don't you

1135
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,210
stay for dinner?

1136
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,840
Oh, no, I shouldn't.

1137
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,840
But thank you.

1138
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,250
Nothing fancy, I promise.

1139
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,250
I was gonna order

1140
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,250
Chinese food.

1141
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,740
And you've been so good

1142
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,740
at reminding me to eat,

1143
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,480
I figured the least I could do

1144
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,480
is return the favor.

1145
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,220
Well, I do love

1146
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,220
a good egg drop soup.

1147
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,220
Fantastic.

1148
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,230
The place down

1149
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,230
the street makes

1150
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,230
an excellent egg drop soup.

1151
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,660
Really?

1152
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,220
I'm hoping.

1153
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,640
They're gonna amputate

1154
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,640
all five fingers.

1155
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,560
Man, the cost

1156
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,560
of living in denial.

1157
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,900
She just couldn't accept that

1158
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,900
that chapter of her life

1159
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,900
was over.

1160
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,540
Yeah.

1161
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,280
If nothing else,

1162
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,280
hopefully this wakes her up.

1163
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,680
Finishing the

1164
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,680
left atrial suture line.

1165
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,620
Let's get ready to take off

1166
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,620
the cross-clamp.

1167
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,770
Start warm blood

1168
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,770
and stop cardioplegia.

1169
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,770
Got it.

1170
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,870
She's fibrillating.

1171
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,870
Paddles.

1172
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,640
Let's charge to 20.

1173
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,110
Charging.

1174
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,110
Charged.

1175
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,380
Clear.

1176
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,780
Still fibrillating.

1177
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,780
Charge to 30.

1178
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,180
Charged.

1179
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,180
Clear.

1180
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,120
No change.

1181
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,660
Dammit. Charge to 50.

1182
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,420
If we can't get her

1183
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,420
into a sustainable rhythm,

1184
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
she won't make it

1185
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
off the table...

1186
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,690
You think I don't

1187
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,690
know that? Clear.

1188
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,230
Maximum charge.

1189
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,230
Clear.

1190
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,770
Connor, we can't just

1191
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,770
keep defibrillating.

1192
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,770
We need to re-arrest her.

1193
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,540
Her heart's too sick.

1194
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,540
She'll never come off

1195
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,540
the pump.

1196
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,640
We don't have a choice.

1197
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,520
I'm gonna remove

1198
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,520
the cross-clamp.

1199
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,570
Are you insane?

1200
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,090
Do that and she'll

1201
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,090
still be fibrillating,

1202
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,710
but without

1203
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,710
coronary perfusion.

1204
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,710
You'll kill her.

1205
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,590
When I was in my fellowship,

1206
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,590
we had a patient like this.

1207
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,890
He wouldn't convert.

1208
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,550
This is the only thing

1209
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,550
that worked.

1210
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,530
It's your show.

1211
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,190
Cross-camp off.

1212
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,730
Clamp off, 3:42.

1213
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,310
Wow, she's back

1214
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,310
in sinus rhythm.

1215
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,310
Amazing call, Dr. Rhodes.

1216
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,540
Hey, have fun tonight.

1217
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,540
Will do.

1218
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,050
Um, an orchid

1219
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,050
and a bottle of whiskey.

1220
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,990
What?

1221
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,990
For Vicki's parents.

1222
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,520
Guys always bring flowers

1223
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,520
for mom and forget about dad.

1224
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,360
Good tip, thanks.

1225
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,820
Caroline is doing well.

1226
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,820
Oh, my God.

1227
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,880
We hit a bit of

1228
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,880
a rough patch...

1229
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,530
But we pulled her through.

1230
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,530
She's absolutely fine.

1231
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,130
Your mother's

1232
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,130
a fighter, Robin.

1233
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,420
Oh, thank you.

1234
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,900
Thank you so much.

1235
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,900
Yeah.

1236
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,160
I'm gonna go meet

1237
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,160
my mom in recovery.

1238
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,800
Dad?

1239
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,800
Right behind you, honey.

1240
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,870
Thank you.

1241
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,780
That was a lucky move

1242
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,780
with the cross-clamp.

1243
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,750
Don't you ever put me

1244
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,750
in that position again.

1245
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,610
Oh, there you are.

1246
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,610
I was just about

1247
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,610
to text you.

1248
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,440
Sorry, I was running

1249
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,440
a little late.

1250
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,440
No worries.

1251
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,370
Uh, so, heads up

1252
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,370
for tonight,

1253
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,050
my dad loves sharing

1254
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,050
his travel photography.

1255
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,520
So, apologies in advance

1256
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,520
for the extended slideshow.

1257
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,590
Oh, and my mom is

1258
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,590
probably also gonna...

1259
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,530
Vicki, uh...

1260
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,530
What's wrong?

1261
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,340
This isn't right.

1262
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,810
What are you trying to say?

1263
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,610
I'm not being fair to you.

1264
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,980
Introducing me

1265
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,980
to your parents,

1266
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,410
I know it's something

1267
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,410
you don't take lightly.

1268
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,910
So I shouldn't go tonight.

1269
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,460
It's about April, isn't it?

1270
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,270
It's not good.

1271
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,270
No, no.

1272
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,970
Uh-huh. It was really bad.

1273
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,240
I had a fanny pack

1274
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,240
every day of eighth grade.

1275
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,720
And it wasn't a subtle

1276
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,720
fanny pack, it was like...

1277
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,720
It was like, neon green.

1278
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,080
Well, full disclosure...

1279
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,080
Hmm?

1280
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,950
The fanny pack was there

1281
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,950
to house the inhaler.

1282
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,120
No.

1283
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,120
It was an aggressive

1284
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,120
fanny pack.

1285
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,220
All right,

1286
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,220
well, you know what?

1287
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,220
I am not one to judge,

1288
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,060
because rainbow braces,

1289
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,060
right here.

1290
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,400
Woof! Really?

1291
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,400
Yeah.

1292
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,660
How did you

1293
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,660
make it out alive?

1294
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,660
I have no clue.

1295
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,400
This is so good. I have not

1296
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,400
laughed in a long time.

1297
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,070
Me neither.

1298
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,080
I'm sorry, I shouldn't

1299
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,080
have done that.

1300
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,210
I'm sorry.

1301
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,340
I heard the surgery

1302
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,340
was a success.

1303
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,930
How's CeCe doing?

1304
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,470
Already requested a cocktail.

1305
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,940
That's my girl.

1306
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,340
So, what's next?

1307
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,950
Well, they still

1308
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,950
need to do

1309
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,950
the examination,

1310
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,850
but I expect

1311
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,850
she'll get accepted

1312
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,850
into the clinical trial.

1313
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,790
That's not what I meant.

1314
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,550
What's next for

1315
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,550
the two of you?

1316
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,250
Sharon, come on.

1317
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,130
Look, maybe I've

1318
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,130
always been a bit of

1319
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,130
a puppy dog around CeCe,

1320
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,830
but she moved on

1321
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,830
a long time ago, trust me.

1322
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,230
Mmm-hmm.

1323
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,230
I wouldn't be too sure.

1324
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,610
Nice view.

1325
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,610
Well, lots of privacy.

1326
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,190
Plus brand-new floors,

1327
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,190
fresh paint on the walls.

1328
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,490
You have an in-unit

1329
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,490
washer and dryer,

1330
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,320
and the kitchen was just

1331
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,320
recently remodeled.

1332
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,190
And the building allows pets?

1333
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,100
Yep. There's even a dog park

1334
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,100
around the corner.

1335
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,690
Look, if you want it, I would

1336
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,690
put down a deposit tonight.

1337
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,000
Rentals in this area

1338
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,000
are going fast.

1339
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,000
It'll be gone by tomorrow.

1340
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,090
What do you think?

1341
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,090
Should we mingle?

1342
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,090
All right.

1343
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,180
Hold, hold on. Whoa.

1344
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,760
Kol, come back here.

1345
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,400
Sorry. Don't worry,

1346
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,400
he's friendly.

1347
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,400
Sorry, thank you.

1348
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,500
It's okay.

1349
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,500
Kol, come on, bud.

1350
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,010
He all right?

1351
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,010
Agent Lee.

1352
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,070
Uh, Dr. Halstead.

1353
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,250
Didn't know you live

1354
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,250
in this area.

1355
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,250
Oh, I don't.

1356
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,650
Well, actually,

1357
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,650
I guess I do now.

1358
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,080
Huh.

1359
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,450
Well, welcome

1360
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,450
to the neighborhood.

1361
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,490
Thanks.

1362
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,490
Yeah.
