1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,320
Hey! Get off of her!

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,660
Punk bitch.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,710
They were jumping me in.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,710
Gang initiation.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,970
What if you found

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,970
somewhere else to stay?

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,300
Thank you.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,350
Is this what I think it is?

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,470
Fertility chart.

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,980
Just seeing

11
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,980
the chart is like...

12
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,540
You can get

13
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,540
a little overzealous.

14
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,480
Okay, my lips

15
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,480
are still tingling.

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,890
I'm Ben.

17
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,890
Maggie.

18
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,190
You know, I should

19
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,190
probably eat

20
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,190
an actual lunch after this.

21
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,670
I don't like to eat alone.

22
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,630
This is Ben, my date.

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,970
What're you

24
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,970
doing here?

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,970
Hey.

26
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,530
A patient told me

27
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,530
about a peppermint

28
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,530
and ginger aromatherapy,

29
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,540
it's supposed to help

30
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,540
with the nausea.

31
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,740
Oh, thank you.

32
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,750
I'm sorry you're having such

33
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,750
a hard time with the chemo.

34
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,910
I'd say it's been a bit more

35
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,910
tolerable now that

36
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,910
I have my sidekick.

37
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,020
So, you're the one who's been

38
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,020
stealing my lunch companion?

39
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,450
Guilty as charged. I'm Ben.

40
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,720
Natalie. Nice to...

41
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,060
Ben?

42
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,060
You all right?

43
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
I'm okay, I'm okay.

44
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,300
You look flushed. Maybe you're

45
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,300
coming down with something.

46
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,400
They got me on

47
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,400
a new chemo regimen.

48
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,570
I'm always coming

49
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,570
down with something.

50
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,580
You know, why don't you

51
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,580
pop into the ED

52
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,580
once you're done here?

53
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,880
I'll just give you

54
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,880
a quick exam.

55
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,880
Thanks, but I'm fine, really.

56
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,620
Don't be stubborn.

57
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,620
I'll make sure he gets there.

58
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,380
All right. See you soon.

59
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,080
Thanks, Nat.

60
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,220
Dr. Sexton.

61
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,730
Wait for me outside.

62
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,730
Hey, Dr. Marcel.

63
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,270
Our distended belly

64
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,270
in Two is non-surgical.

65
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,270
Sign her over to GI.

66
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,970
Yeah. You know, I hate to ask,

67
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,970
but you mind putting

68
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,970
in the order?

69
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,100
I just... I gotta run

70
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,100
a quick errand.

71
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,640
Oh, is she your errand?

72
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,640
Looks familiar.

73
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,340
Wasn't she here

74
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,340
a few weeks ago

75
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,340
with those gang guys?

76
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,610
Uh, she's not

77
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,610
with them anymore.

78
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,280
It's true. She's turning

79
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,280
her life around.

80
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,520
Oh. Is that why she's wearing

81
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,520
your Blackhawks jacket?

82
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,490
Please tell me that she's not

83
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,490
shacking up with you.

84
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,620
No. No, no, no.

85
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,000
It's not what

86
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,000
you think. It's, um...

87
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,990
She's crashing

88
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,990
in my guest room

89
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,990
for a couple of days

90
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,090
just until she can

91
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,090
get back on her feet.

92
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,440
If you say so.

93
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,910
Okay. I'll be right back.

94
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,910
I'm just gonna take her home.

95
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,080
Would you do me a solid

96
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,080
and just keep this

97
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,080
between us?

98
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,170
I don't want April to...

99
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,940
Kick your ass, maybe?

100
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,510
Yeah.

101
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,720
Measles?

102
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,720
Nat, are you sure?

103
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,660
The lesions in your mouth,

104
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,660
the elevated fever,

105
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,660
the conjunctivitis,

106
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,820
these are all

107
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,820
very strong indicators.

108
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,960
I don't understand.

109
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,960
I was vaccinated as a kid.

110
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,800
You've also been on chemo

111
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,800
for six months now.

112
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,640
It's likely wiped out

113
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,640
your vaccine antibodies

114
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,940
and left your immune system

115
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,940
too weak to protect itself.

116
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,670
So, do I need to suspend chemo

117
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,670
while we treat this?

118
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,840
I'd like to speak

119
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,840
with your oncologist.

120
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,380
But my guess is yes.

121
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,110
Will I be okay? I mean, people

122
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,110
get over measles all the time.

123
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,820
Yes, they do. I mean,

124
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,820
we can manage this, right?

125
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,120
Put him on bedrest,

126
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,120
make sure he doesn't develop

127
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,120
any secondary infections.

128
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,220
Ideally, yes.

129
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,250
But?

130
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,730
I did hear congestion

131
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,730
in your lungs.

132
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,210
Which means that, most likely,

133
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,210
you've already

134
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,210
developed pneumonia.

135
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,210
So, what happens next?

136
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,200
With your weakened

137
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,200
immune system,

138
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,750
I'm afraid it's only

139
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,750
a matter of time

140
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,970
before the virus starts

141
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,970
attacking your other organs.

142
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,540
Wait, are you saying

143
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,540
this is gonna kill me?

144
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,620
Measles are gonna kill me?

145
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm so sorry, Ben.

146
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,260
Nat, there has

147
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,260
to be something...

148
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,170
How long am I looking at?

149
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,260
Months?

150
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,640
Weeks?

151
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,370
Days?

152
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,810
If what I suspect is true,

153
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,810
I'm afraid so.

154
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,790
Morning, Daniel.

155
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,790
Morning.

156
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,300
I haven't seen CeCe

157
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,300
in a couple of days,

158
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,300
how's she doing?

159
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,760
You know, not too thrilled

160
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,760
that I keep on leaving

161
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,760
my dishes in the sink

162
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,570
but other than that,

163
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,570
hanging in there.

164
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,740
You think she'd be up

165
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,740
for a drink tonight?

166
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,740
Just the four of us?

167
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,680
The four of us?

168
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,680
Yeah.

169
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,250
Turns out, Bert and I

170
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,250
met a few times.

171
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,320
Just for a couple of drinks,

172
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,320
don't get too excited.

173
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,790
He still has a lot

174
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,790
of explaining to do.

175
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,790
Okay.

176
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,620
And I just figured that maybe

177
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,530
CeCe would get a kick out

178
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,530
of all of us getting together.

179
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,530
Are you kidding me?

180
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,530
She'd love it.

181
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,300
I'm just warning you,

182
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,300
you're gonna get

183
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,300
a big "I told you so."

184
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,030
Yeah, well. I'm looking

185
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,030
forward to that.

186
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,230
And that one.

187
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,230
Mmm.

188
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,500
Oh, and it's Trini's

189
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,500
first day at Med,

190
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,980
I was supposed to get her

191
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,980
oriented, but...

192
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,810
Don't worry,

193
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,810
I can answer

194
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,810
all her questions.

195
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,370
Okay.

196
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,370
Hey, I'm April.

197
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,320
Nice to meet you.

198
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,720
We got a nose bleed

199
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,720
in Treatment Five,

200
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,720
why don't you start there?

201
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,550
Thanks.

202
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,550
I'm good.

203
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,290
Maggie, go be with Ben.

204
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,290
Thank you.

205
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey. Have you seen my brother?

206
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,000
I thought he was

207
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,000
on your service today.

208
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,030
He stepped out.

209
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,160
Where?

210
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,270
Said something

211
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,270
about an errand.

212
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,270
I got him covered.

213
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,470
Hey, listen, about

214
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,470
the other night

215
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,270
that move on my part...

216
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,310
Let's just

217
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,310
forget it,

218
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,310
okay? It's...

219
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,340
April...

220
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,180
Look, we were

221
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,180
sippin' Sazeracs,

222
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,180
having a nice time,

223
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,660
I guess I misread

224
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,660
the situation.

225
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,290
Yeah, just...

226
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,290
Let's blame it

227
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,290
on the Sazeracs.

228
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,330
Dr. Halstead, we got

229
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,330
an ambo landing,

230
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,420
you're going

231
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,420
to Trauma One.

232
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,560
Elsa, you're with me.

233
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,700
Lori Shelton, 16 years old,

234
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,570
BP 118 over 82,

235
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,570
heart rate 112,

236
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,940
collapsed on a jog

237
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,940
this morning.

238
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,670
We told her not to push it,

239
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,670
but she just won't listen.

240
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,610
Dad, I'm fine. I skipped

241
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,610
breakfast before my run.

242
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,610
That's why I was dizzy.

243
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,520
Lori, I'm Dr. Halstead,

244
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,520
this is Student Doctor Curry.

245
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,520
Try to relax, we're gonna

246
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,520
get you checked out.

247
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,110
On my count. One, two, three.

248
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,320
Please tell me

249
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,320
her kidney is okay.

250
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,320
Kidney?

251
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,550
She had nephrotic syndrome,

252
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,960
finally got a transplant

253
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,960
about six weeks ago.

254
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,760
Congratulations.

255
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,800
Is it okay if I take a look

256
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,800
at your incision site?

257
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,570
Incision looks good.

258
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,940
No edema

259
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,940
in the lower extremities.

260
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,070
Great.

261
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,050
Lori, you had any fever,

262
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,050
night sweats, chills

263
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,050
over the past few days?

264
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,280
No. Since I got the kidney,

265
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,280
I feel great.

266
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,830
Okay. I did hear

267
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,830
a little congestion.

268
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,490
Honey, tell them

269
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,490
about your cough.

270
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,490
Dad, I'm fine.

271
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,460
Well, it is possible

272
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,460
you developed an infection

273
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,460
in your lungs.

274
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,560
An infection?

275
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,560
Yeah, it's a common

276
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,560
post-op complication.

277
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,400
Curry, what do you think?

278
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,400
We should probably start

279
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,400
with a CBC,

280
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,670
BMP, chest X-ray,

281
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,670
and give 500 milligrams

282
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,670
empiric azithromycin.

283
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,470
And a full transplant panel,

284
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,470
make sure her kidney's okay.

285
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,510
Lori, you just try

286
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,510
to take it easy,

287
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,780
we'll be back

288
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,780
to check on you in a bit.

289
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,020
Hey. Good morning,

290
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,020
I'm Dr. Choi.

291
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,020
You must be Dennis.

292
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,180
Yeah, the one and only.

293
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,780
And this is my girlfriend

294
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,780
and partner, Aviva.

295
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,760
Say hi to Dr. Choi,

296
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,760
you guys.

297
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,760
Excuse me?

298
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,000
You're live in front

299
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,000
of 800,000 people, huh?

300
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,000
Say hello!

301
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,810
Uh, mind if we do this

302
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,810
without the camera?

303
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,810
Sorry, Doc, but we keep

304
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,810
our stream live 24/7.

305
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,510
Hey, I don't really

306
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,510
think this is the place.

307
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,640
Oh, anything you need

308
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,640
to say to me,

309
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,810
you can say in front of

310
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,810
our loyal followers.

311
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,050
All right. Mind taking a seat

312
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,050
so I can examine you?

313
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,450
Well, I don't know,

314
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,450
can I take a seat?

315
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm not following.

316
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,630
Not you, Dr. Choi,

317
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,630
he's talking to our followers.

318
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,690
They're voting.

319
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,460
Sorry, dude, they voted no.

320
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,970
Looks like I'll be

321
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,970
standing, Dr. Choi.

322
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,070
You're not serious?

323
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,970
It... It's in the name.

324
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,980
UrTheJudge.com.

325
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,710
Our followers vote

326
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,710
on all of Dennis' decisions.

327
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,050
Look. If you won't

328
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,050
let me treat you properly,

329
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,410
you should see

330
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,410
another doctor.

331
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,420
Oh, I don't mean

332
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,420
any disrespect, Doc. Oh.

333
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,080
It's just that,

334
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,080
I make my living

335
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,080
honoring the vote.

336
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,850
Please don't send me back

337
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,850
to the waiting room,

338
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,730
my stomach is killing me.

339
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,860
Abdominal pain?

340
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,860
It's definitely

341
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,860
food poisoning.

342
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,900
They made me eat a ton

343
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,900
of discount sushi last night.

344
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,840
Ow! Easy, man.

345
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,910
You're warm

346
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,910
and your belly's

347
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,910
obviously tender.

348
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,870
I'd like to get a CT scan

349
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,870
to rule out anything serious.

350
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll be back to check

351
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,000
on you soon.

352
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,100
Wait, Doc. They're voting.

353
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,550
Okay, good. Yes.

354
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,550
It's a yes to that scan.

355
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,020
Hey. What are you doing?

356
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,680
Oh, April's

357
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,680
covering for me.

358
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,230
You can't go in there.

359
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,230
You're immunocompromised.

360
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,860
A little credit, Nat.

361
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,860
I know how to take

362
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,860
the necessary precautions.

363
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,930
If you catch this virus,

364
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,930
you might not be

365
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,930
able to fight it off.

366
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,530
I'm willing to

367
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,530
take that risk.

368
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,530
Maggie.

369
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,900
Nat, I'm not about to

370
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,900
abandon him now.

371
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,140
Hey, Doris? Can you get

372
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,140
the leg fracture

373
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,580
in Trauma Two

374
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,580
admitted to Ortho?

375
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,580
Help! We need some help!

376
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,990
Hey. Give me a hand over here!

377
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,920
Noah? Oh, my God!

378
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,220
Noah?

379
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,220
What?

380
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,490
What happened?

381
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,490
Don't know.

382
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,430
I found him

383
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,430
on the sidewalk like this.

384
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,490
Get him to Baghdad.

385
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,490
I got C-Spine.

386
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,490
Let's roll!

387
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,730
Easy, easy. Easy.

388
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,470
All right.

389
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,470
On my count, everybody ready?

390
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,470
One, two, three.

391
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,600
Noah, I'm right here.

392
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,340
Come on, come on.

393
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,340
Okay? I'm right here.

394
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,970
Hang in there.

395
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,510
Set up for an X-ray!

396
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,480
Hey, let's get him

397
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,480
on the monitors. Noah?

398
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,810
Hey buddy, do you know

399
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,810
where you are?

400
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,280
Me... Med?

401
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,750
Good, Noah, that's good.

402
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,620
Breath sounds

403
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,620
present bilaterally.

404
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,460
Multiple abrasions

405
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,460
on his face, neck, left flank,

406
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,460
some broken ribs.

407
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,830
Did he get hit by a car?

408
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,460
No. Injuries like this,

409
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,460
looks more like a beating.

410
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,100
Did anyone see

411
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,100
where he was going?

412
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,940
He just said he was

413
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,940
meeting a friend.

414
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,980
I thought you said

415
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,980
he was running an errand.

416
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,310
BP's down to 92.

417
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,310
Hang a unit of O negative.

418
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,650
X-rays. Everybody, clear!

419
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,390
Massive hemopneumothorax

420
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,390
on the left side.

421
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,890
We need a chest tube.

422
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,160
Push five of morphine.

423
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,160
Chest tube. Give it to me!

424
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,390
BP's down to 70.

425
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm in.

426
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,040
Pressure's better,

427
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,040
but his heart rate's still up.

428
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,680
He's still losing blood.

429
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,680
Call CT,

430
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,740
tell them we're bringing

431
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,740
him up to do

432
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,740
a pan-scan now.

433
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,220
Don't worry, buddy.

434
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,220
We got you.

435
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,700
April, how is he?

436
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,730
Stable for now.

437
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,730
Still trying to find

438
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,730
the source of the bleed.

439
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,610
Can I have a word with you

440
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,610
and Dr. Choi, please?

441
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,740
I want Dr. Lanik

442
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,740
running point on this.

443
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,280
Miss Goodwin...

444
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,280
You know as well as I do,

445
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,350
you're too close

446
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,350
to Dr. Sexton.

447
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,580
I can separate

448
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,580
my personal feelings

449
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,090
from him...

450
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,090
No.

451
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,350
Dr. Lanik will keep

452
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,350
you updated.

453
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,420
And you're needed in the ED.

454
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,250
Yes, ma'am.

455
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,800
I'll check back

456
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,800
as soon as I can, okay?

457
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,100
Hey, we get the scans yet?

458
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,400
No.

459
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,900
Hey. What were

460
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,900
you saying earlier?

461
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,900
About Noah meeting a friend?

462
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,640
Just said he had to

463
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,640
help someone.

464
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,770
Who?

465
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,050
Scans are up.

466
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,220
He's got a grade III

467
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,220
splenic laceration

468
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,220
with a central blush,

469
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,590
he's bleeding

470
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,590
into his abdomen.

471
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,100
I'll call the OR, tell them

472
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,100
we're bringing him up.

473
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,960
No, pressure's stable.

474
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,960
No reason why we can't

475
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,960
embolize the bleed.

476
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,090
But if the

477
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,090
pressure drops...

478
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,470
Well, we can worry about that

479
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,470
when the time comes.

480
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,590
IR is less invasive.

481
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,230
I agree with Dr. Lanik.

482
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,470
I don't want to cut

483
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,470
my brother open

484
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,060
unless it's

485
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,060
absolutely necessary.

486
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,910
It's not really your call.

487
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,910
No. It's mine.

488
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,440
We're going to IR.

489
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,440
Let's move.

490
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,780
I just checked

491
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,780
on Lori Shelton's blood work,

492
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,590
uh, the lab should

493
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,590
have it up soon.

494
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,680
Great. Thanks.

495
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,820
Yeah.

496
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,360
Did you know that Fibonacci

497
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,360
is performing tonight?

498
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,340
The mathematician?

499
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,340
Hasn't he been dead

500
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,340
for about a thousand years?

501
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,000
Uh... It's a...

502
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,000
It's a rock band.

503
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,800
They write all of their songs

504
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,800
using Fibonacci's sequence,

505
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,810
so, every note

506
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,810
is the sum total

507
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,810
of the two notes before it.

508
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,150
And their music

509
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,150
is actually quite elegant.

510
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,150
That sounds interesting.

511
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,520
There are still

512
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,520
tickets available...

513
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,180
If you're asking if you can

514
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,180
take off early, go ahead.

515
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,890
Oh, okay. Okay,

516
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,890
thank you. Thanks.

517
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,890
Help!

518
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,790
We need help in here!

519
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,740
It's okay, baby. It's...

520
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,230
Watch out, Dad.

521
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,540
My stomach. It hurts so bad.

522
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,660
Ultrasound.

523
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,660
I got it.

524
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,040
What is it?

525
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,040
What's wrong?

526
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,670
We're gonna

527
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,670
find out.

528
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,380
There's a clot blocking

529
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,380
blood flow out of the kidney,

530
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,510
that's likely what made her

531
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,510
collapse this morning.

532
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,710
I thought it was an infection.

533
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,050
Kidney dysfunction can mimic

534
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,050
signs of an infection.

535
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,590
So, what do we do?

536
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,890
There's a drug called tPA

537
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,890
that should break up the clot,

538
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,160
but we'll need a CT first

539
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,160
to pinpoint its location.

540
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,060
Tell radiology

541
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,060
we're bringing her up.

542
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,060
No, wait.

543
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,660
You cannot give her a CT scan,

544
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,900
she's allergic

545
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,900
to the contrast.

546
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,270
You're sure she's allergic?

547
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,430
She had a CT scan

548
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,430
before her transplant

549
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,600
and had a really

550
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,600
bad reaction.

551
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,900
It almost killed her.

552
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,000
The transplant center

553
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,000
must have not put

554
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,000
that in her chart.

555
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,670
You have the ultrasound,

556
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,670
can't you use that

557
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,670
to locate the clot?

558
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,840
Ultrasound doesn't

559
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,840
give us it detailed enough.

560
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,850
We can't inject the medication

561
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,850
without a precise location

562
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,850
on CT.

563
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,280
Please, make it stop.

564
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,190
Isn't there something

565
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,190
else you can do?

566
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,850
We could try to get

567
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,850
a CT by using

568
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,850
a high dose of steroids

569
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,950
to suppress her allergy.

570
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,050
Yeah, but she could go

571
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,050
into anaphylactic shock.

572
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,600
No. I'm not putting her

573
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,600
through that again.

574
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,260
Do we have

575
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,260
an alternative?

576
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,930
All right.

577
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,930
We'll put her on heparin,

578
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,600
wait to see if the clot

579
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,600
resolves on its own.

580
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,730
At this point,

581
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,730
it's our best option.

582
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,240
Bolus 1,000 units of heparin,

583
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,240
50 mics of fentanyl

584
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,240
for the pain

585
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,440
and repeat her labs.

586
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,440
Lori, hang in there,

587
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,480
we're gonna get you

588
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,480
through this.

589
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,980
Hey. Your scans came back.

590
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,320
Turns out you

591
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,320
didn't have food poisoning,

592
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,320
you have an appendicitis.

593
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,320
I told you guys

594
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,320
this pain was real!

595
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,580
Luckily, we caught it in time.

596
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,790
We can get you up

597
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,790
to an operating room

598
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,790
to remove it before it bursts.

599
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,990
@Mew-buddar is asking,

600
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,990
is there an alternative

601
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,990
to surgery?

602
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,600
In some cases,

603
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,600
it can be managed

604
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,600
with antibiotics,

605
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,110
but surgery is the standard.

606
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,740
Babe, the chat is all

607
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,740
worked up over the pros

608
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,740
and cons of surgery.

609
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,250
Give me the camera.

610
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,310
All right team,

611
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,310
this is a big one,

612
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,310
so, don't do me dirty,

613
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,080
'cause my side

614
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,080
is literally killing me.

615
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,420
Will you let me have surgery?

616
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,850
This is no way

617
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,850
to determine treatment.

618
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,860
You heard him, peeps.

619
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,860
I'm setting up a vote.

620
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,760
Surgery versus

621
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,760
antibiotics. Go!

622
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,760
This is ridiculous.

623
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,190
Votes are tallying...

624
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,530
Okay, the votes are in...

625
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,930
Oh, babe, uh,

626
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,930
surgery's a no-go.

627
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,840
It's a serious

628
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,840
medical decision.

629
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,180
You can't let strangers

630
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,180
on the Internet

631
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,180
make it for you.

632
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,880
If your appendix ruptures,

633
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,880
there's a good chance

634
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,880
you'll die.

635
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,610
I'm sorry,

636
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,610
the decision's been made.

637
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,550
We're going with

638
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,550
the antibiotics.

639
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,900
Doris, order

640
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,900
one gram ceftriaxone

641
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,900
and 500 milligrams Flagyl

642
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,470
for my patient in Four,

643
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,470
and page Dr. Charles.

644
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,010
Maggie, I'm sorry

645
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,010
to hear about Ben.

646
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,980
Thanks, Sharon.

647
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,980
He just wants to go home.

648
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,710
I'm afraid that's not

649
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,710
gonna be possible.

650
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,080
What do you mean?

651
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,590
We need to keep Ben here,

652
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,590
under quarantine.

653
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,350
Why? Hospital protocol

654
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,350
is if a patient has measles,

655
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,360
that they can self-quarantine

656
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,360
as long as they don't take

657
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,360
public transportation.

658
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,420
Yes. Under

659
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,420
normal circumstances.

660
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,430
But there's

661
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,430
a citywide outbreak.

662
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,660
The county health officer has

663
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,660
issued a mandatory quarantine

664
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,670
for all hospitalized patients.

665
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,610
Ben will have to

666
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,610
remain here until he's

667
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,610
no longer contagious.

668
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,410
That's five days.

669
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,410
That could be

670
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,410
all the time he has left.

671
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,840
I'm sorry.

672
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,180
Sharon?

673
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,180
Yes.

674
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,340
Please,

675
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,780
he just wants to go home,

676
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,780
and die in his own bed.

677
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,680
Maggie, you know,

678
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,680
I understand,

679
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,680
but my hands are tied.

680
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,250
It's the law.

681
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,870
How you doing?

682
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,870
I'm Dr. Charles.

683
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,050
Dr. Choi showed me

684
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,050
your website, it's pretty...

685
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,740
Pretty interesting stuff.

686
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,550
His name tag legit says,

687
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,550
"Chief of Psychiatry."

688
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,950
I'm gonna get thrown

689
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,950
in the loony bin

690
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,150
if y'all keep

691
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,150
punking me with these votes.

692
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,090
Dude, we're getting mad love

693
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,090
in the tip jar today.

694
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,760
Definitely gonna top

695
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,760
naked skydiving.

696
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,560
So, Dr. Choi and I just wanna

697
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,560
make sure you understand

698
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,270
that by opting out

699
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,270
of the surgery, that you are

700
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,270
putting your life in danger.

701
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,100
We never go against the vote.

702
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,100
Those are the rules.

703
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,910
No chance of even

704
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,910
a one-time exception?

705
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,280
No can do.

706
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,010
A year ago, we were

707
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,010
living in our car.

708
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,250
Now, we've got

709
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,250
a condo on the lake.

710
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,020
Our followers buy

711
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,020
our merchandise

712
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,790
and watch our ads

713
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,790
for one simple reason,

714
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,490
I always obey the vote.

715
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,160
As soon as I break

716
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,160
that pact, it's over.

717
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,610
Okay. Well, really nice

718
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,610
to meet you both.

719
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,170
So?

720
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,210
He clearly understands

721
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,210
the decision he's making.

722
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,870
Yeah. But he's not

723
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,870
making the decision.

724
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,980
True, but, he's willingly

725
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,980
allowing other people

726
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,980
to do that for him.

727
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,990
He's denying surgery

728
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,990
to boost his online following,

729
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,650
how can we say he doesn't

730
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,650
pose a risk to himself?

731
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,780
Well, just 'cause

732
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,780
he's reckless, doesn't mean

733
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,020
he's suicidal. You know?

734
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,030
So that's it, hmm?

735
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,030
If the antibiotics don't take,

736
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,030
we just watch him die?

737
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,160
Ethan, I don't

738
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,160
like it either.

739
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,560
But we can't lock

740
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,560
a patient up

741
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,690
just because he wants

742
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,690
to be Internet famous.

743
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,870
We spoke to a few

744
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,870
witnesses who were

745
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,870
at the scene

746
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,670
and they confirm

747
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,670
Noah was jumped.

748
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,800
By who?

749
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,210
They weren't able to ID

750
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,210
any suspects except that

751
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,210
they looked Latino.

752
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,150
The guy that

753
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,150
brought Noah in,

754
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,710
he said that there was

755
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,710
a young woman with him.

756
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,310
She helped Noah

757
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,310
into the car.

758
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,150
That friend he was meeting,

759
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,150
could it have been

760
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,150
this young woman?

761
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Dr. Marcel, if there's

762
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
something that can help us...

763
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,720
I did see him leave

764
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,720
with a young woman.

765
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,860
What?

766
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,760
The one that you

767
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,760
and Noah found,

768
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,730
getting jumped in

769
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,730
by that gang.

770
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,700
Said he was taking her home.

771
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,230
You saw him leave with Jacinta

772
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,230
and you didn't tell me?

773
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,040
Do you have a last name

774
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,040
for this Jacinta?

775
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,340
Uh, yes. Nieves.

776
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,340
Jacinta Nieves.

777
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,180
Okay, we'll run

778
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,180
with that.

779
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,010
Listen, we're all thinking

780
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,010
about your brother.

781
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,110
Thank you, Jay.

782
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,030
You didn't think

783
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,030
it was important to tell me

784
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,960
that my brother ran off

785
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,960
with some kind of gangbanger?

786
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,430
He asked me not to.

787
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,800
He is fighting

788
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,800
for his life.

789
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,030
He's a big boy, April.

790
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,270
He makes his own decisions.

791
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,950
I was told to get

792
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,950
a quick blood draw.

793
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,920
Just leave it.

794
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,920
I'll do it.

795
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm sorry.

796
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,050
Okay.

797
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,890
Okay, okay. Okay.

798
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:18,000
You're okay.

799
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:18,000
Do you want some water?

800
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,130
Yeah.

801
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,170
There you go.

802
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,280
Okay.

803
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,410
There you go.

804
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,180
I had finally fallen asleep.

805
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,310
Yeah.

806
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,090
And the hospital can't do

807
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,090
anything for you,

808
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,430
and here you are,

809
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,430
getting poked and prodded

810
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,430
every other minute.

811
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,870
I should never have

812
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,870
brought you here.

813
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,260
Mmm-mmm.

814
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,500
I'm so sorry.

815
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,110
The folks at group

816
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,110
say surrendering...

817
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,810
Isn't weakness.

818
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,720
It just means that you've

819
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,720
accepted your future...

820
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,860
As it comes.

821
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,150
No, Ben.

822
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,130
I won't let you spend any more

823
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,130
of your precious time here.

824
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,750
Do you have any idea

825
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,750
what you're asking me?

826
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,010
I know that it's

827
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,010
technically illegal...

828
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,920
And unethical to have me

829
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,920
change his charts and say

830
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,920
he's post-infectious...

831
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,050
Yeah, but you

832
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,050
and I both know

833
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,350
that I can keep

834
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,350
one measles patient

835
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,830
from infecting the public.

836
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,830
Please, Nat, I...

837
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,270
Please, let me honor

838
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,270
the only wish he has left.

839
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,100
How many times

840
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,100
have I had your back?

841
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,840
This is not about

842
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,840
what I owe you.

843
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,280
This is about what

844
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,280
we owe the public.

845
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,010
And I am sorry, Maggie,

846
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,010
but I can't discharge him.

847
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,080
Maggie, I...

848
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,260
We just got Lori's

849
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,260
latest set of labs back.

850
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,060
Her creatinine

851
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,060
has risen dramatically.

852
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,520
What does that mean?

853
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,530
The heparin isn't working.

854
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,270
Lori, I'm sorry, your kidney

855
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,270
is in serious distress.

856
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,400
No.

857
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,570
Since we're unable

858
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,570
to get the CT needed

859
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,570
to inject the tPA,

860
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,470
I'm afraid there's not

861
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,470
much more we can do

862
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,470
to save your kidney.

863
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,050
Oh, God...

864
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,710
There's still dialysis

865
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,710
and you can go back

866
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,710
on the transplant list...

867
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,750
No, I can't

868
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,750
go through

869
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,750
that again.

870
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,480
Please, there has

871
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,480
to be another way.

872
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,820
I wish there was, but...

873
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,260
What about the thing

874
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,260
you were saying earlier?

875
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,820
About suppressing my allergy?

876
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,320
Well, there

877
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,320
is a chance

878
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,320
we could prevent

879
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,400
an allergic reaction

880
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,400
to the CT contrast

881
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,730
by loading you up

882
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,730
with a high enough

883
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,730
dose of steroids.

884
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,960
That would be

885
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,960
extremely risky.

886
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,090
I wanna do it.

887
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,560
You could... You could go

888
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,560
into anaphylactic shock.

889
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,010
I spent too much time

890
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,010
on the transplant list.

891
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,770
The pain, and the fever,

892
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,770
and the sleepless nights.

893
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,010
I can't go through that again.

894
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,080
But honey...

895
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,080
I can't go back on dialysis.

896
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,350
Lori, I would need

897
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,350
your parents' consent.

898
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,760
Please, I... I can't lose

899
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,760
this kidney.

900
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,490
Lori.

901
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,960
Okay.

902
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,520
Dad?

903
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,940
You have our consent.

904
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,830
All right.

905
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,110
Hey. You can't do this.

906
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,110
She could die in the scanner.

907
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,850
Elsa, I understand the risk,

908
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,850
but we have to try.

909
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,710
Why? I mean, even if

910
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,710
she loses her kidney,

911
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,650
she can still

912
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,650
survive on dialysis until

913
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,650
a new organ is available.

914
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,620
She could also spend years

915
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,620
suffering on dialysis

916
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,960
and still die before getting

917
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,960
another transplant.

918
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,060
This is what Lori wants,

919
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,060
we have parental consent.

920
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,330
Heart rate's up to 140.

921
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,670
When was the last time

922
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,670
he had pain meds?

923
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,710
Two, maybe

924
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,710
three minutes ago.

925
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,870
We need to get him

926
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,870
to the OR now.

927
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,870
He's gonna crash.

928
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,810
What are you talking about?

929
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,810
His vitals are stable.

930
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,040
Not for long.

931
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,040
Pulse pressure's narrowing,

932
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,180
heart rate's climbing

933
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,180
and his lips are turning blue.

934
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,740
I've seen this before.

935
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,740
Means a crash is coming.

936
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,520
No. We almost have

937
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,520
control of the bleed.

938
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,750
If we wait until

939
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,750
his pressure drops,

940
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,750
it'll be too late.

941
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,830
It's Dr. Lanik's call.

942
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,400
Dr. Marcel!

943
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,370
We gotta stop this.

944
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,370
I'm almost there.

945
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,500
Dr. Marcel, you need

946
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,500
to back off.

947
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,770
He needs the OR!

948
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,710
Stay away

949
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,710
from my brother.

950
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,670
Pressure's falling!

951
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,670
Now can we move him?

952
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,510
Let's get him

953
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,510
ready for the OR!

954
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,940
Doris, what's the word

955
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,940
on Noah.

956
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,510
They just rushed him

957
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,510
to the OR.

958
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,510
It's touch and go.

959
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,790
Dr. Choi, I need some help!

960
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,930
What's happening to him?

961
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,400
Ultrasound?

962
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,400
Give him

963
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,400
some room, Aviva.

964
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,870
Breathe in

965
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,870
and out, buddy.

966
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,870
In through the nose,

967
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,870
out through the mouth.

968
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,640
All right. Your appendix

969
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,640
has nearly perforated.

970
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,040
We need to get you

971
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,040
into surgery now.

972
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,740
Babe?

973
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,740
It won't take long

974
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,870
until your

975
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,870
appendix bursts.

976
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,870
No, no.

977
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,750
When that happens,

978
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,750
it may be too late

979
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,750
to save you.

980
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,050
Group chat's saying

981
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,050
you should put him

982
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,050
on a medicine called Cialis?

983
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,710
They have no idea

984
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,710
what they're talking about!

985
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,090
Dennis, what do you say

986
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,090
we give the surgery a shot?

987
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,950
Live to fight another day?

988
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,150
Babe! We just hit

989
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,150
a million followers!

990
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,150
We're going viral!

991
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,630
Oh, my God. We did it!

992
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,260
Dennis, think this through.

993
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,230
Babe, our ad revenue

994
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,230
is going to double.

995
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,290
The antibiotics could

996
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,290
still work, right?

997
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,500
It's highly unlikely.

998
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,500
But is it possible?

999
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,170
Technically, yes, but the odds

1000
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,170
are highly against it.

1001
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,010
Then we're still going

1002
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,010
with the vote.

1003
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,840
Show me some love, people.

1004
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,970
Buy our merch

1005
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,450
and smash that subscribe

1006
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,450
button below!

1007
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,250
Get him up to two grams

1008
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,250
of ceftriaxone.

1009
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,520
Still think

1010
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,520
this guy is sane?

1011
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,160
All right, Lori, we're gonna

1012
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,160
give you the injection

1013
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,160
of steroids

1014
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,290
before we administer

1015
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,290
the CT contrast, okay?

1016
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,520
I'm ready.

1017
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,760
All right.

1018
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,370
And now the contrast.

1019
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,770
All good?

1020
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,280
Great. Let's get her

1021
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,280
into the scanner.

1022
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,180
Hey, Mags.

1023
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,180
Oh, hey, Eddy.

1024
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,280
Dr. Manning's order didn't

1025
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,280
mention this was a transfer.

1026
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,690
Oh, it's not.

1027
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,690
We're taking him home.

1028
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,690
Hospice care.

1029
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,230
Oh, the discharge.

1030
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,230
Yes.

1031
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,660
Dr. Manning's signature.

1032
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,960
All right.

1033
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,960
Let's load him up.

1034
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,060
Yeah.

1035
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,070
Are you sure about this?

1036
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,910
It's time to get you home.

1037
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,250
There we go.

1038
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,200
Sats are dropping.

1039
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,200
We close?

1040
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,870
Doing the best I can.

1041
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,040
We have to get her

1042
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,040
out of there!

1043
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,870
No, she can tolerate it.

1044
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,570
Sats are down to 87.

1045
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,770
How much longer?

1046
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,210
I just need another minute.

1047
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,510
She doesn't have

1048
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,510
another minute.

1049
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,250
All right, we need to

1050
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,250
get in there.

1051
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,560
All right, Lori,

1052
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,560
just relax. Okay?

1053
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,620
I gotta intubate.

1054
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,620
Twenty etomidate, 100 of sux.

1055
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,960
Okay, Lori.

1056
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,960
Sats are down to 72.

1057
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,770
Damn it.

1058
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,770
Airway's totally

1059
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,770
clamped down.

1060
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,300
I might have to trach her.

1061
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,730
Sats are down to 70.

1062
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,470
Wait. I'm in. Bag her.

1063
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,640
Let's move her back through.

1064
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,310
Gurney!

1065
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,640
Sats are climbing.

1066
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,410
What about the scan?

1067
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,410
We got it.

1068
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,150
All right, let's get her

1069
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,150
to IR now, and clear

1070
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,150
the obstruction.

1071
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,420
Give me

1072
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,420
another lap pad.

1073
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,560
There must be

1074
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,560
two liters in there.

1075
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,960
Why'd you wait

1076
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,960
so long to bring him up?

1077
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,090
Great question.

1078
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,890
Curved six.

1079
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,170
Pressure's in the toilet.

1080
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,170
Please tell me this isn't

1081
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,170
gonna take long.

1082
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,100
Clamp's on.

1083
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,420
Spleen's coming out.

1084
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,920
I need an O silk tie

1085
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,920
on a pass.

1086
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,920
BP's down to 100.

1087
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,830
Okay, tying off

1088
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,830
the vessel now.

1089
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,600
Clamp's coming off.

1090
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,760
There, that should do it.

1091
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,760
Pressure's dropping.

1092
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,030
He's still losing blood,

1093
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,030
we have to find the source.

1094
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,940
Aviva, I was hoping

1095
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,940
to get just a quick word.

1096
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,280
One sec.

1097
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,780
Our suppliers can't keep up

1098
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,780
with our merchandise orders.

1099
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,780
Wow.

1100
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,050
Gotta say, very impressive

1101
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,050
what the two of you

1102
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,050
have created here.

1103
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,960
Yeah, no joke.

1104
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,330
Yeah. It'd be such

1105
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,330
a shame to lose it all.

1106
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,460
I just mean, you know,

1107
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,460
if something happened

1108
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,460
to Dennis,

1109
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,520
I gotta imagine that's

1110
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,520
gonna impact your livelihood.

1111
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,700
It's not just about

1112
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,700
the money, Dr. Charles.

1113
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,360
You don't understand.

1114
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,910
In high school,

1115
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,910
Dennis was a ghost.

1116
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,140
Nobody knew

1117
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,140
he was there.

1118
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,140
Hmm.

1119
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,670
But when I got to know him,

1120
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,670
I realized just how

1121
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,670
incredible he was.

1122
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,310
So, I convinced him

1123
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,310
to start live streaming.

1124
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,080
Now the world

1125
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,080
gets to see what I see.

1126
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,890
That's what this is about.

1127
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,250
But what happens when he goes

1128
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,250
into septic shock, though?

1129
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,560
We'll ask our followers

1130
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,560
for another vote.

1131
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,890
They'll let him do

1132
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,890
the surgery for sure.

1133
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
Yeah, but what if they don't?

1134
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,430
They're not trolls,

1135
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,430
they're our homies.

1136
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,270
Well, but then why won't they

1137
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,270
let him have the surgery

1138
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,070
when his appendix

1139
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,070
could rupture at any time?

1140
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,940
They're pranking us.

1141
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,040
Oh.

1142
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,040
But I know our followers

1143
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,410
and if things get worse,

1144
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,350
they'll do what's right.

1145
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,880
I gotta get back to the show.

1146
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,120
Dennis' fever just spiked,

1147
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,120
he's septic.

1148
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,060
Dr. Manning, radiology

1149
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,060
just called, they're ready

1150
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,060
for Ben's chest X-ray.

1151
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,030
Good. Let's get him upstairs.

1152
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,900
Did they take him already?

1153
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,200
Looks like he was discharged.

1154
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,760
Discharged? By who?

1155
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,600
You, Dr. Manning.

1156
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,540
Uh...

1157
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,740
What are we doing up here?

1158
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,150
I figured out how we can

1159
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,150
double your followers

1160
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,150
in an instant.

1161
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,890
I don't think

1162
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,890
you get how this works.

1163
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,050
It took us over a year

1164
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,050
to get to a million.

1165
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,960
I think I know exactly

1166
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,960
how this works,

1167
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,720
which is why I want you

1168
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,720
to ask your followers

1169
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,630
a very simple question...

1170
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,460
Should you jump off

1171
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,460
this roof right now?

1172
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,630
Woah!

1173
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,000
This is not cool, man.

1174
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,630
Wait. Is that a no?

1175
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,630
I thought that they made

1176
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,630
all the decisions.

1177
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,770
Wait, isn't this, like,

1178
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,770
against the rules?

1179
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,970
You said your followers

1180
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,970
love you, right?

1181
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,980
They don't wanna see anything

1182
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,980
bad happen to Dennis.

1183
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,240
You got nothing

1184
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,240
to worry about.

1185
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,440
Babe, the chat's blowing up.

1186
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,250
They wanna vote.

1187
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,250
What do we do?

1188
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,860
All right, guys,

1189
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,860
this is for reals.

1190
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,280
Look at the drop.

1191
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,260
All right, team.

1192
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,430
Should I jump off this roof?

1193
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,300
They're voting.

1194
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,440
Oh, man...

1195
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,650
No...

1196
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,220
What's it gonna be, man,

1197
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,220
what are we doing?

1198
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,460
Oh.

1199
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,370
I'm not jumping.

1200
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,400
Oh, my God. They're all

1201
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,400
unfollowing us.

1202
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,680
Hold on, you guys. That wasn't

1203
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,680
even a fair question.

1204
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,510
It doesn't count.

1205
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,510
You can still be the judge.

1206
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,820
What do you say, Dennis?

1207
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,820
Can we get you into surgery?

1208
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,520
Yeah.

1209
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,090
How is she?

1210
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,700
They were able to successfully

1211
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,700
break up the clot.

1212
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,540
And her kidney?

1213
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,540
Function's improving.

1214
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,270
We expect Lori

1215
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,270
to make a full recovery.

1216
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,080
Thank you.

1217
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,380
Thank you for saving

1218
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,380
our little girl.

1219
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,050
I'll have someone grab you

1220
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,050
as soon as they get

1221
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,050
her settled into recovery.

1222
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,720
Thank you again.

1223
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,260
Dr. Halstead, thank you again.

1224
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,260
You take care.

1225
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,520
That was amazing.

1226
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,770
Yeah, we had

1227
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,770
a good save, didn't we?

1228
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,460
No, you had a good save.

1229
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,540
I should never

1230
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,540
have doubted you.

1231
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,940
You know, Elsa, I've been

1232
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,940
a doctor for ten years.

1233
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,540
After a while, you develop

1234
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,540
a kind of intuition.

1235
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,210
You just get better

1236
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,210
at guessing when it's

1237
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,210
right to take a risk.

1238
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,920
Thank you.

1239
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,100
As soon as we're inside,

1240
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,100
we'll get you a nice

1241
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,100
warm bath,

1242
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,070
and a neb treatment.

1243
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,670
There you go.

1244
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,680
Maggie.

1245
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,290
It's okay.

1246
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,030
Let's go back.

1247
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,000
I found it.

1248
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,140
The short gastrics

1249
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,140
are still bleeding.

1250
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,640
I don't have the angle,

1251
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,640
can you clamp them

1252
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,640
from your side?

1253
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,480
Yes, sir. Hemostat.

1254
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,610
Better hustle,

1255
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,610
I can't keep

1256
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,610
his pressure up.

1257
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,710
Don't rush me, Marty.

1258
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,720
Got it. Two-oh silk stitch.

1259
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,360
Pressure's improving.

1260
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,360
Nice work, Crockett.

1261
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,830
Let's tie

1262
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,830
this off and close.

1263
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,910
Get him quarantined, now.

1264
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,660
You forged my signature?

1265
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,550
I'm sorry, Nat.

1266
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,930
I didn't know

1267
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,930
what else to do. I...

1268
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,860
I couldn't turn

1269
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,860
my back on him.

1270
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,520
That doesn't give you

1271
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,520
the right to endanger

1272
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,520
the public.

1273
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,000
I realized that as soon

1274
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,000
as I stepped outside but...

1275
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,200
I can't believe

1276
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,200
you did this, Maggie.

1277
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,840
I'm sorry.

1278
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,610
Go, be with him.

1279
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,520
How's he doing?

1280
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,520
The appendectomy went well.

1281
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,090
The surgeon expects him

1282
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,090
to make a full recovery.

1283
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,220
Great.

1284
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,390
Daniel, what's going on?

1285
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,200
Can you please explain to me

1286
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,200
why there's a video showing

1287
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:29,210
my chief of psychiatry

1288
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:29,210
asking a patient

1289
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:29,210
to jump off the roof?

1290
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,940
I realize that the optics

1291
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,940
aren't good.

1292
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,980
You're supposed to be

1293
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,980
mitigating psychiatric crises,

1294
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,980
not creating them.

1295
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,410
What if he had tried to jump?

1296
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,250
First of all, Sharon,

1297
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,250
there was never any danger

1298
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,250
of that happening.

1299
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,310
But if it had, I would've put

1300
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,310
him on a psych hold

1301
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,310
and mandated the surgery.

1302
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,430
This video's going viral.

1303
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,380
What happens if

1304
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,380
the Tribune picks it up?

1305
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,950
Wouldn't be good.

1306
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,090
No.

1307
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,060
I'll see you tonight.

1308
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,800
Hey, you're Elsa, right?

1309
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,470
Uh, these concert tickets

1310
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,470
just came off the printer.

1311
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,470
Your name is on 'em.

1312
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,600
Thanks. I was just

1313
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,600
about to grab 'em.

1314
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,570
How was your first day?

1315
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,300
Um...

1316
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,640
Great.

1317
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,640
Everyone was so helpful.

1318
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,580
Uh, excuse me.

1319
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,280
Um, Will...

1320
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,280
Sorry. Dr. Halstead,

1321
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,520
I was just wondering

1322
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,520
if maybe you...

1323
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,520
There you are!

1324
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,620
Somebody promised me

1325
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,620
a Stoli Up, extra dirty.

1326
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,690
Ready to go?

1327
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,690
Definitely.

1328
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,490
Juliette, this is Elsa,

1329
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,490
fourth year med student.

1330
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,590
Juliette's one of our

1331
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,590
new paramedics.

1332
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,590
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1333
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,690
Mmm-hmm.

1334
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,030
Yeah, did you need something?

1335
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,870
No, no, no.

1336
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,870
Uh, it's nothing important.

1337
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,970
I'll see you tomorrow.

1338
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,870
All right, you bet.

1339
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,870
Good night.

1340
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,380
Let's go.

1341
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,380
All right.

1342
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,620
Hank, do you call this

1343
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,620
a decent pillow?

1344
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,990
It's all that was left

1345
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,990
in central supply.

1346
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,790
Then you go to plastics

1347
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,790
and you find me some silicone.

1348
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,060
I don't care

1349
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,060
how you do it.

1350
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,230
Let's make

1351
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,230
this patient comfortable.

1352
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,840
Hey, Daniel.

1353
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,890
Hey. Where's CeCe?

1354
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,480
You cannot imagine

1355
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,480
how excited she was

1356
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,480
when I told her about tonight.

1357
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,980
But she just wasn't up to it.

1358
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,160
Did, however,

1359
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,160
absolutely insist

1360
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,160
that I join you.

1361
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,760
So, how about a quick drink?

1362
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,500
Sounds good.

1363
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,770
Good to see you.

1364
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,880
Please get this young man

1365
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,880
whatever he's drinking.

1366
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,020
Hey, hey.

1367
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,020
You're gonna be okay.

1368
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,220
Hey, April?

1369
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,130
I'm here.

1370
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,460
I'm right here.

1371
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,200
Just get some rest, okay?

1372
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,740
I'll check back in a while.

1373
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,890
Hey, Crockett.

1374
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,760
Thank you.

1375
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,660
I'm just glad he's okay.
