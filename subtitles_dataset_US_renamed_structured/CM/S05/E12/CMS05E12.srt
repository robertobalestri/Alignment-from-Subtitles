1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,330
From the looks of that rock,

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,330
I'm guessing you didn't

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,330
tell Ethan.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,460
No, I didn't,

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,800
and I would appreciate it

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,800
if you didn't

7
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,800
mention it again.

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,140
Mention what?

9
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,040
I want us to try

10
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,040
to get pregnant again.

11
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,300
I'm proposing opening

12
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,300
a safe injection site

13
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,300
at the hospital.

14
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,980
Preventing deaths would

15
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,980
save the hospital money

16
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,980
in the long run.

17
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,850
Allow drug use

18
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,850
on our premises?

19
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,510
"A PR nightmare"

20
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,510
is how I'd put it.

21
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,220
There's another way.

22
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,220
An unsanctioned site?

23
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,060
But they're illegal.

24
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,060
You could lose your license.

25
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,190
You in?

26
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm in.

27
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,630
Did you get any sleep?

28
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,960
Nah, got busy

29
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,960
around midnight

30
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,960
and never let up.

31
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,170
I did a lot of counseling,

32
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,170
though, and set up that

33
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,170
rehab consult.

34
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,370
Great. And I just heard back

35
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,370
from our new hookup

36
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,370
on clean needles.

37
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,740
Get me a Narcan inhaler.

38
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,240
She OD'd. Hang in there.

39
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,850
It's okay. You're okay.

40
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,420
What...

41
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,920
You overdosed.

42
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,920
But you're gonna be all right.

43
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,900
Overdosed...

44
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,530
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

45
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,530
Oh, my God.

46
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,370
No. Oh, my God...

47
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,930
What's your name?

48
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,450
Val.

49
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,940
Okay, Val.

50
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,050
Let's get you into a bed,

51
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,950
and you know, maybe later,

52
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,950
we can have a talk.

53
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,720
Okay.

54
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,320
All right.

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,160
This is why we're here.

56
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,440
You realize I could do this

57
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,440
myself, right?

58
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,610
True, but Dr. Patchefsky

59
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,610
did say IVF is a team effort.

60
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,680
So any negative effects

61
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,680
from the hormones?

62
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,340
Headaches, mood swings?

63
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,950
Are we counting

64
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,950
the growing urge

65
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,750
to pump my teammate

66
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,750
full of hormones?

67
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,450
I hope not.

68
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,620
I'm doing great, babe.

69
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,620
Good.

70
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,600
Maggie, good morning.

71
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,660
I guess.

72
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,660
What's the matter?

73
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,960
My oncologist.

74
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,330
She says I'm not responding

75
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,960
to the radiation the way

76
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,960
she'd hoped.

77
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,910
We have to add a course

78
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,910
of hormone therapy.

79
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,510
Oh, Maggie...

80
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,310
It's fine. I guess

81
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,310
that's how it goes.

82
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,940
Well, I'll call someone in.

83
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,940
You take the day off.

84
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,080
No, really, I'm fine.

85
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,680
It's only one day.

86
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,680
There'll be others.

87
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,190
Yeah... Oh, no.

88
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,720
What's up?

89
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,920
We've got a school bus crash.

90
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,920
How bad?

91
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,460
They need doctors

92
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,460
over there right now.

93
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,300
Dr. Marcel,

94
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,300
Dr. Manning,

95
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
I need you to hop

96
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
on an ambo

97
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,930
and get to mass cas

98
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,930
MVC school bus.

99
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,490
How many passengers?

100
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,490
Thirty to thirty-five.

101
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,700
I'll get the packs.

102
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,100
Guess I'm gonna be here

103
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,100
for a while.

104
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,140
Keep me posted.

105
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,140
Will do.

106
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,690
Natalie, hey! I need you

107
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,690
over here, guys.

108
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,890
What happened?

109
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,890
We got two kids

110
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,890
in the front seat.

111
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,970
It's gonna be tricky

112
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,970
getting them out.

113
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,970
Why? What's wrong?

114
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,130
A bunch of rebar flew

115
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,130
off this truck,

116
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,130
went through the windows.

117
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,670
Luckily, most of the kids

118
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,670
were in the back.

119
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,200
Help. Help us.

120
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,510
Help us! Please, help!

121
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,840
Okay,

122
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,840
hang on, bud.

123
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,840
We're coming.

124
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,840
Oh, my God.

125
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,280
Help us, please.

126
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,550
Get us out.

127
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,870
Okay.

128
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,910
Getting cold.

129
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,750
I know. We're gonna get you

130
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,750
out of here right now.

131
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,880
Are we good?

132
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,880
Yeah.

133
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,050
You're doing great.

134
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,660
I'll be right back, okay?

135
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,660
Hang in there.

136
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,900
Lieutenant,

137
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,900
a word please.

138
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,410
Henry's got good pulses

139
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,410
in his neck,

140
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,340
but Kate's bleeding

141
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,340
into her belly, fast.

142
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,410
Normally,

143
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,410
I'd cut the bar

144
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,410
in between,

145
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,670
but they're

146
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,670
pinned together

147
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,670
pretty tight.

148
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,800
So what do we do now?

149
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,470
Slide her down

150
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,470
a couple inches,

151
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,470
make some space?

152
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,450
No, she's already shocky

153
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,450
from blood loss.

154
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,250
Moving her could shear

155
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,250
the vessel wide open.

156
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,090
Just let me know

157
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,090
what works for you.

158
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,090
We'll make it happen.

159
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,620
Can you give us a moment?

160
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,460
He's right, there is no

161
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,460
other way to move them.

162
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,930
Yes, there is.

163
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,930
We get more blood

164
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,930
to up their reserves,

165
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,160
then we cut them out together.

166
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,960
What? But we don't know

167
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,960
where the rebar

168
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,960
is in Henry's neck.

169
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,830
One wrong move

170
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,830
and we could tear

171
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,830
into a vessel.

172
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,340
Maybe, but if we slide Kate,

173
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,340
we'll lose her for sure.

174
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,440
Look, you are gambling

175
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,440
a kid's life on a Hail Mary.

176
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,310
Natalie, we got

177
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,310
two kids here.

178
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,970
If there's any chance

179
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,970
of saving them both,

180
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,970
I'm taking it.

181
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,480
All right.

182
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,190
Doctor.

183
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,160
Someone you should

184
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,160
take a look at.

185
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,960
I gotta get to work.

186
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,030
All right.

187
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,730
What's wrong?

188
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,810
He's got a fever, pale,

189
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,810
short of breath.

190
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,270
Hi. I'm a doctor.

191
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm Mike.

192
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,380
How long have you

193
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,380
had a fever, Mike?

194
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,010
I don't know.

195
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,010
A few days?

196
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,690
You've got a pretty

197
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,690
significant heart murmur.

198
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,720
It's very likely

199
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,730
you could have something

200
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,730
called endocarditis.

201
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,500
Give me a break, man.

202
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,900
Have you had it before?

203
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,030
Yeah, I've had it.

204
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,510
I got my valve replaced

205
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,510
last year.

206
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,710
I need to take you

207
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,710
to the hospital.

208
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,250
No. I'll just end up

209
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,250
back here.

210
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,050
We can find a way

211
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,050
to treat your addiction.

212
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,050
Forget it. Nothing helps.

213
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,610
We have resources

214
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,610
to help you.

215
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,920
Babe. Please.

216
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,390
Mike, you know better

217
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,390
than anyone.

218
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,920
If we don't fix

219
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,920
your heart valve,

220
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,920
it'll kill you.

221
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,960
Let me take you in.

222
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,230
All right, first wave of kids

223
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,230
are coming in.

224
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,400
Dr. Choi, you're up.

225
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,400
On it.

226
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,140
Alice Winston, 12-year-old

227
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,650
with shortness of breath

228
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,650
and chest trauma.

229
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,880
Respiration's at 24,

230
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,880
heart rate 83, sats 92%.

231
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,580
Hey, Alice, I'm Dr. Choi.

232
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,580
You're gonna be okay.

233
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,060
We're gonna take good care

234
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,060
of you, okay?

235
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,820
All right, let's transfer her

236
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,820
on my count.

237
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,590
All right, nice and easy.

238
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,590
Ready? One, two, three.

239
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,420
Good.

240
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,000
That sounds like it hurts.

241
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey, Alice?

242
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,940
Any dizziness, nausea,

243
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,940
blurry vision?

244
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,900
No.

245
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,900
Good, that's good.

246
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,140
Any pain anywhere else?

247
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,140
Alice.

248
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,500
Sweetie, are you okay?

249
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,680
I have a feeling she has

250
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,680
some broken ribs.

251
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,810
Is it bad?

252
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,110
We'll get some

253
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,110
X-rays right now,

254
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,450
but other than

255
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,450
a little heavy breathing

256
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,750
from the stress,

257
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,750
she looks good.

258
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,420
Okay, okay.

259
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,420
Oh, thank God.

260
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,510
Hey, Alice.

261
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,990
I'm gonna give you

262
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,990
a little more medicine

263
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,990
for the pain.

264
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,430
Does that sound okay?

265
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,190
You're a champ.

266
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,190
I'll be back in just a bit.

267
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,090
Hey.

268
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,940
April, Dr. Marcel

269
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,940
is bringing in two traumas.

270
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,030
Be on standby.

271
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,660
Dr. Marcel?

272
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,660
Can someone else do it?

273
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,610
April.

274
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,110
Please, I...

275
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,110
I'm really messed up.

276
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,010
I don't want to,

277
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,010
but I can't stop

278
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,010
thinking about him.

279
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,680
Okay, but whatever

280
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,680
you're feeling, you've got

281
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,680
to get over it.

282
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
You hear me?

283
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
I know.

284
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,280
Thank you.

285
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,690
Gary.

286
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,170
Thought I recognized you.

287
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,330
Maggie, right?

288
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,460
Mmm-hmm.

289
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,900
Taxotere, Adriamycin, and...

290
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,240
Cytoxan, right?

291
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,500
Yeah! My old chemo regimen.

292
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,370
We know each other

293
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,370
from the infusion center.

294
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,640
Mmm...

295
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,410
So what's going on?

296
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,410
If I remember, you

297
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,410
were having trouble

298
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,250
finding a match

299
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,250
for your bone marrow

300
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,250
transplant.

301
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,350
Took eight months,

302
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,350
but we got one.

303
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,680
A woman,

304
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,680
scheduled for next week.

305
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,890
That's great!

306
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,890
So what happened today?

307
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,250
He passed out.

308
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,260
You have severe anemia

309
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,260
from the leukemia,

310
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,920
and it's giving you

311
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,920
intermittent dysrhythmias.

312
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,060
I'm gonna get you some blood,

313
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,060
and then we're gonna see

314
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,060
how you respond.

315
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,660
Great. Thank you.

316
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,770
Okay.

317
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,670
Excuse me, Dr. Reid.

318
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,670
So, how bad is it?

319
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,910
We need to move

320
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,910
the transplant up

321
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,910
as soon as possible.

322
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,580
Okay, I'll call the donor.

323
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,580
See if we can get her

324
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,580
in today.

325
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,950
I'd see if we can get her in

326
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,950
in the next hour.

327
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,060
Dr. Halstead.

328
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,690
I have assessed your

329
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,690
endocarditis patient,

330
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,790
and I've decided not

331
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,790
to perform

332
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,790
the valve replacement.

333
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,040
But he has plus-four

334
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,040
aortic regurgitation.

335
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,540
He won't survive

336
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,540
without a new one.

337
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,630
But he's already infected

338
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,140
and destroyed two

339
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,140
healthy heart valves.

340
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,940
Every indication is that

341
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,940
he will do so again.

342
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,980
Not if he stops using.

343
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
I don't see any evidence

344
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
that he will,

345
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,420
and heart valves are

346
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,420
quite costly both in time

347
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,420
and resources.

348
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,980
And there are

349
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,980
too many children

350
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,980
from the bus crash

351
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,460
who require

352
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,460
my attention.

353
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,620
Dr. Latham, I think

354
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,620
beneath the addiction,

355
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,620
Mike may be depressed.

356
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,430
So if we can treat that,

357
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,430
it might push him

358
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,430
in the right direction

359
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,060
so that eventually

360
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,060
we can get him off drugs.

361
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,490
Then the new valve

362
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,490
would be safe.

363
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,900
Dr. Charles.

364
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,000
Dr. Halstead has a patient

365
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,000
who is a heroin addict.

366
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,800
I'd like you

367
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,800
to evaluate him

368
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,800
for surgery.

369
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,840
Oh! Be happy to meet him.

370
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,300
Thank you.

371
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,440
If Dr. Charles clears

372
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,440
your patient, then I will

373
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,440
schedule the procedure.

374
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,510
Thank you.

375
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,250
Hey, um,

376
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,150
you wouldn't have

377
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,150
happened to have come

378
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,150
across this patient

379
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,090
at your friend's

380
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,090
safe injection site,

381
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,090
would you?

382
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,460
I did, and I know

383
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,460
you think it's a bad idea.

384
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,790
It's illegal, buddy.

385
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,000
We're doing

386
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,000
a lot of good there.

387
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,120
Yeah, well,

388
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,120
you're not gonna be

389
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,120
doing any good anywhere

390
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,600
if you lose your license

391
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,600
and go to jail.

392
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,870
We can talk

393
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,870
about that later.

394
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,800
Please, just go talk

395
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,800
to Mike.

396
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,350
Blood's in.

397
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,350
Stay with me, okay?

398
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,180
Just hang in there. Hey.

399
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,720
WOMAN ON POLICE RADIO:

400
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,720
Do you need civilian vehicles

401
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,840
to get out of the way?

402
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,450
There's still time

403
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,450
to change our minds.

404
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,010
No. We're doing this.

405
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,220
Hey. You ready?

406
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,990
Yeah?

407
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,990
Yeah.

408
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,060
Okay, we have to keep

409
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,060
these kids perfectly still.

410
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,030
There's no movement,

411
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,030
shifts, nothing, all right?

412
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,890
All right.

413
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,370
You're doing great.

414
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,480
Let's get them out.

415
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,480
Okay, easy, guys.

416
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,820
You ready?

417
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,220
Nice and easy.

418
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,220
Here we go.

419
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,220
Careful. Slowly.

420
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,250
You all right?

421
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,360
Okay. We're gonna

422
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,360
get you out, okay?

423
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,090
Ready?

424
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,090
Yeah.

425
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,060
Thanks.

426
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,840
I hope you're right

427
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,840
about this.

428
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,180
Open the Hybrid Room.

429
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,180
We're coming straight in.

430
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,590
Need an extra gurney.

431
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,860
How do they look?

432
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,860
Boy's stable.

433
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,630
Girl got three units

434
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,630
in the field, GCS 11,

435
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,630
BP's 80 over palp.

436
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,930
All right, start her

437
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,930
on the MTP,

438
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,930
four plasma, four blood.

439
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,970
Right away.

440
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,970
Let's get two FAST scans.

441
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,640
You're okay, bud.

442
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,640
You're all right.

443
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,480
What are you doing?

444
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,880
Just taking a quick look,

445
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,880
okay, bud?

446
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,790
I can't get a window.

447
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,790
Must be in the kidney.

448
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,720
She's got a ton

449
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,720
of free fluid in there.

450
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,880
What about him?

451
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,880
Rebar got the jugular.

452
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,790
You gotta be kidding.

453
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,790
How bad is it?

454
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,660
We won't know

455
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,660
until we lift him off.

456
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,790
Hell of a move,

457
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,790
bringing him in

458
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,790
like a shish kebab.

459
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,060
We need some Betadine

460
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,060
and a lot of Kerlex.

461
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,730
Dr. Manning.

462
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,830
Kate? Hey, Kate,

463
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,830
stay with me.

464
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,570
Is she okay?

465
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,570
She's unconscious.

466
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,900
We need to move them.

467
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,900
All right, buddy.

468
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,000
It's time to get you off

469
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,000
this thing. You ready?

470
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,480
Am I gonna die?

471
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,640
No, hey, no.

472
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,180
No, you've got

473
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,180
a whole hospital of people

474
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,650
who just want

475
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,650
to take care of you, okay?

476
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,350
Okay.

477
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,450
All right. My count.

478
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,450
One, two, go.

479
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,180
That hurts.

480
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,520
You're doing great, Henry.

481
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,520
Keep him steady.

482
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,020
You're okay, buddy.

483
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,020
You're okay.

484
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,530
Little more.

485
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,530
Okay, he's off. Gauze.

486
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,460
Get me some gauze.

487
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,470
Okay, yep,

488
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,470
he's still bleeding.

489
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,530
All right, let's get him up

490
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,530
to CT, see how bad it is.

491
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,770
All right, if it's just

492
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,770
the vein, he could be okay.

493
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,780
It's gonna be okay.

494
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,780
All right? Okay.

495
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,790
All right, Dr. Marcel,

496
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,790
let's scrub in. We've got

497
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,790
a lot of work ahead of us.

498
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,190
Hey, Doc.

499
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,190
What do you think?

500
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,670
Well, it's tricky, you know,

501
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,670
because active addiction

502
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,670
tends to mask

503
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,140
whatever underlying pathology

504
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,140
might be present.

505
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,170
Sure.

506
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,180
I mean, he could very well

507
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,180
be self-medicating, but what?

508
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,150
Is it depression,

509
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,150
is it bipolar,

510
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,150
or, you know...

511
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,310
Yeah, understood.

512
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,510
And we can figure that out

513
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,510
later, but right now,

514
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,490
a diagnosis is what's

515
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,490
gonna save his life.

516
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,850
It's not quite

517
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,850
that simple, though.

518
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,910
You understand his heart

519
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,910
is a ticking time bomb.

520
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,750
Every minute we let go by

521
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,920
increases the chances

522
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,920
he's gonna die right here

523
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,920
in front of us.

524
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,360
I wanna help him, too,

525
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,690
but in order for the surgery

526
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,690
to be successful,

527
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,260
he's gotta be willing

528
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,260
to get clean,

529
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,660
and right now,

530
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,660
I'm just not seeing

531
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,070
a whole lot of evidence

532
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,070
that he wants to do that.

533
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,070
We're doing

534
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,070
everything we can.

535
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,870
The doctors are still

536
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,870
examining the victims.

537
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,410
Any word on our son,

538
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,410
Henry Chase?

539
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,070
We heard they brought him

540
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,070
in with Kate Lawson.

541
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,240
She's our daughter.

542
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,240
They're best friends.

543
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,790
Henry is being evaluated

544
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,790
in radiology, and Kate

545
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,790
is still in the OR.

546
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,690
They're still operating?

547
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,690
Oh, my God.

548
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,020
Could you just let us know

549
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,020
when they're out?

550
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,020
We just wanna see them.

551
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,460
Yes, of course.

552
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,460
I'll let you know

553
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,860
as soon as I hear something.

554
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,400
Thank you.

555
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,530
Dr. Reid.

556
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
Did you schedule

557
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
the transplant?

558
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,270
Oh, Gary's donor

559
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,270
has the flu.

560
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,870
Her temp is 100.3.

561
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,270
But that shouldn't affect

562
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,270
her bone marrow.

563
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,440
The cutoff is 99.9.

564
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,880
But Gary has a rare HLA type.

565
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,480
No one else in the system

566
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,480
is a match.

567
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,120
Well, hopefully the donor

568
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,120
will get better soon.

569
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,490
The longer we wait, the more

570
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,490
unstable his rhythm gets.

571
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,320
It's only half a degree.

572
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,760
Can't we just

573
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,760
make an exception?

574
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,670
I'm sorry, but no.

575
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,670
We can't.

576
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,900
Maggie, we got two more

577
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,900
coming in from the bus.

578
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,570
Okay.

579
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,280
Hey, what's wrong?

580
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,910
The girl with

581
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,910
the broken ribs, Alice.

582
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,140
Her pain's under control,

583
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,410
but her breathing

584
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,410
just keeps getting worse.

585
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,990
Anything abnormal

586
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,990
in her labs?

587
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,590
No. X-rays showed

588
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,590
a few mild opacities,

589
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,320
but nothing that

590
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,320
should be causing this.

591
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,450
Mmm.

592
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,750
Yeah, hi.

593
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,660
Has Alice had

594
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,660
a fever recently?

595
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,100
Runny nose, sore throat?

596
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,990
No. No.

597
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,370
Any history of asthma

598
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,370
or pneumonia?

599
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,300
No, nothing.

600
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,300
No.

601
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,840
Her sats are down to 87.

602
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,840
Want me to put on the mask?

603
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,540
Yeah, and call

604
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,540
for a nebulizer treatment,

605
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,540
too, just in case.

606
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,010
Anything that could

607
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,010
cause any sort of

608
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,010
breathing trouble at all?

609
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,980
Family history,

610
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,980
asbestos exposure, mold?

611
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,320
She did smoke cigarettes

612
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,320
last year.

613
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,190
But only

614
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,190
for a little while.

615
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,730
We caught her

616
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,730
and made her quit.

617
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,120
Is that true?

618
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,960
Yeah.

619
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,570
Either way,

620
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,570
this really isn't

621
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,570
what we normally see

622
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,400
from a smoking

623
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,400
related illness.

624
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,400
So we need to keep looking.

625
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,570
Right.

626
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,970
If that was our daughter,

627
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,750
her smoking history's

628
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,750
the first thing I'd be

629
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,750
telling the doctor.

630
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,750
I'm sure they're just

631
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,750
embarrassed.

632
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,720
I mean, they probably

633
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,720
feel like they've got it

634
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,720
under control.

635
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,150
Yeah, I guess.

636
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,420
It just makes me wonder

637
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,420
if there's anything else

638
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,420
they're not telling us.

639
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,530
Dr. Halstead.

640
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,870
He's tachycardic in a-fib.

641
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,610
Doc, my chest

642
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,610
is killing me.

643
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,730
Want me to push Cardizem?

644
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,000
His pressure's dropping.

645
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,100
Milligram of morphine

646
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,200
and Versed, synchronize

647
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,200
and charge paddles to 50.

648
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,940
Mike, tear on your valve

649
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,210
must be extending

650
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,210
into the electrical system

651
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,210
of your heart.

652
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,580
I need to reset your rhythm.

653
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,180
Okay, let's go.

654
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,920
Charged to 50.

655
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,250
Clear.

656
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,630
Rhythm's back.

657
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,630
Start him on

658
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,630
an esmolol drip.

659
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,260
They giving me a new valve?

660
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,060
I'm working on it.

661
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,370
It's just taking

662
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,370
some time.

663
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,040
Hey, Doc.

664
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,710
Whatever it takes. Please.

665
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,980
I don't want to live

666
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,980
like this anymore.

667
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,710
Hey, you seeing this?

668
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,620
He is running out of time

669
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,620
and needs our help.

670
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,630
And believe me, Will.

671
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,630
I wanna help.

672
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,420
Then do it.

673
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,420
Do what?

674
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,790
You want me to just,

675
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,790
like, make something up?

676
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,000
Look, I appreciate that

677
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,000
the clock is ticking here.

678
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,730
So if you want me to try

679
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,730
and talk to Dr. Latham...

680
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,930
And tell him what?

681
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,600
You know what?

682
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,600
Forget it.

683
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,290
All right.

684
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,290
Kidney's free.

685
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,780
Oh, man.

686
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,190
Got the lateral cortex,

687
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,190
and three centimeters

688
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,190
into the hilum.

689
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,590
Maybe we should salvage.

690
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,290
Nah, there's

691
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,290
too much damage.

692
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,590
We're gonna have

693
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,590
to take out the whole thing.

694
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,360
Sure hope we're not

695
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,360
wasting our time here.

696
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,940
Dr. Marcel,

697
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,940
there's an emergency

698
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,940
in the CT scanner.

699
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,640
It's your other patient

700
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,640
from the bus.

701
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,440
I'll handle

702
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,440
the boxed kidney, okay?

703
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,710
Go check on the boy.

704
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,180
Sats are down to 81.

705
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,680
His hematoma's expanding.

706
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,680
He must've started to bleed.

707
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,130
It's compressing his airway,

708
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,130
let's get a tube in fast.

709
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,790
Let's get etomidate and sux.

710
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,200
Getting a lot of resistance.

711
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,800
His sats are down to 72.

712
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,300
It's not going through.

713
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,040
Sixty-eight,

714
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,040
give me a cric kit.

715
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,140
No, we're not gonna put

716
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,140
another hole in his neck.

717
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,310
Crockett.

718
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,750
Got it.

719
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,480
Okay.

720
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,160
He's still actively bleeding.

721
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,590
Damn it.

722
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,030
I'll call the OR.

723
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,910
Dr. Halstead.

724
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,680
I'm puzzled by this order.

725
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,580
Yeah?

726
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,780
Your patient was written

727
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,780
for antidepressants,

728
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,190
but it's not

729
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,190
from psychiatry,

730
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,190
it's from you.

731
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,520
Yeah, right,

732
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,520
I totally forgot

733
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,520
to tell you,

734
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,720
Dr. Charles was

735
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,720
gonna write it,

736
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,630
but he got pulled off

737
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,630
on an emergency.

738
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,860
Yeah, with the bus crash

739
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,860
it's been just crazy

740
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,860
down here.

741
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,600
Ah...

742
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,730
Of course.

743
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,140
Very well, then. I'll let

744
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,140
the OR know that Mr. Monroe

745
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,140
will be coming up immediately.

746
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,270
Thank you, Dr. Latham.

747
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,090
Five...

748
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,990
Hey, Maggie.

749
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,990
Hey.

750
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,620
Can I get you something?

751
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,450
I just forgot to ask

752
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,450
if you're still

753
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,450
with that guy.

754
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,060
Vincristine... Leucovorin...

755
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,790
Ben.

756
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,230
And yes, I am.

757
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,900
Seems like a good guy.

758
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,070
Anyway, I just wanted

759
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,070
to say thanks.

760
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,080
I know you've been

761
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,080
fighting for me.

762
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,350
Well, you can thank me

763
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,350
after the transplant.

764
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,570
I'm not done yet.

765
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,580
I'm sure you're not,

766
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,580
but you know how this goes.

767
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,790
One day your numbers are bad,

768
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,790
and you're crushed.

769
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,610
Then they get good again,

770
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,420
and you can just

771
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,420
beat the world.

772
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,620
Up and down, over and over.

773
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,290
But this time,

774
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,860
it feels different.

775
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,630
I don't know if I've got

776
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,630
another "up" left in me.

777
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,860
Gary.

778
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,040
You don't talk like that.

779
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,540
Uh-uh.

780
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,850
You may not know this

781
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,850
about me,

782
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,120
but when I put my mind

783
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,120
to something,

784
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,050
I get it done.

785
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,880
So you just stick with me.

786
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,010
Hey.

787
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,280
Where am I gonna go?

788
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,390
That's right.

789
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,900
Doris.

790
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,900
Hmm?

791
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,910
How do Gary's labs look?

792
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,170
Lower than when he got here.

793
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,340
Hmm.

794
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,580
Come here.

795
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,580
What?

796
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,090
I'm gonna draw

797
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,090
your blood.

798
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,090
What?

799
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,550
She can't breathe!

800
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,720
Sats are down to 74.

801
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,200
We need to intubate.

802
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,200
Fifteen of etomidate,

803
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,200
seventy of sux.

804
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,390
Alice, sweetie,

805
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,390
I'm gonna have to sedate you

806
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,330
so we can put a tube in

807
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,330
to help you breathe, okay?

808
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,430
Wait, wait, wait, you mean

809
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,430
the machine is gonna

810
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,430
breathe for her?

811
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,340
She can't do it

812
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,340
anymore on her own.

813
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,340
We don't have a choice.

814
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,570
Meds are in.

815
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,840
There you go.

816
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,840
Alice?

817
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,210
I'm in.

818
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,410
Sats up to 83.

819
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,210
Why is this happening?

820
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,180
I don't know.

821
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,050
Order a new round of tests.

822
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,050
We're gonna figure this out.

823
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,220
I need to get some air.

824
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,040
How'd she do?

825
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,370
The surgery went well,

826
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,370
but then again,

827
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,370
eight units of blood,

828
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,740
so she may end up

829
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,740
with deficits, or not

830
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,740
even wake up at all.

831
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,540
Just gotta wait and see.

832
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,710
I assure you,

833
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,710
as soon as we

834
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,710
know any answers,

835
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,450
I will let you know.

836
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,450
Is that Dr. Marcel?

837
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,740
Uh...

838
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,820
Why didn't you

839
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,820
separate Henry and Kate

840
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,820
before bringing them in?

841
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,950
My brother's a doctor.

842
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,580
He says you never move

843
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,580
people together like that.

844
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,050
Kate was in bad shape.

845
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,430
We didn't have a choice.

846
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,820
What do you mean?

847
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,730
Well, keeping them together

848
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,730
was the only way to save her.

849
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,890
She was gonna die.

850
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,930
Wait, so you endangered

851
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,930
our son?

852
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,060
How could you?

853
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,010
I didn't have a choice.

854
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,010
Not if they both could have

855
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,010
a chance to live.

856
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,770
No, you did have a choice.

857
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,770
And you have no right

858
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,770
to make it.

859
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,110
I understand. I do.

860
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,010
And I'll speak with you

861
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,010
after your son's surgery.

862
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,610
Okay?

863
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,150
If you'll excuse me.

864
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,920
I tried to keep them calm.

865
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,920
Yeah.

866
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,320
No, they're right.

867
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,290
I'll come back to answer

868
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,290
their questions as soon as

869
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,290
Henry's carotid is tied off.

870
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,430
What? You're gonna

871
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,430
tie it off?

872
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,990
But he wouldn't have normal

873
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,990
blood flow to his brain

874
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,990
for the rest of his life.

875
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,130
Why not reconstruct?

876
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,540
Reconstruction is long

877
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,540
and risky. He's already

878
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,540
lost a lot of blood.

879
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,130
So?

880
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,370
So, it makes him

881
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,370
a poor candidate

882
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,370
for prolonged anesthesia.

883
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,180
Well, I know what it means.

884
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,180
I just don't understand

885
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,950
why you're suddenly

886
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,950
trying to play it safe.

887
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,780
Because I've already done

888
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,780
enough damage today.

889
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,290
I'm not gonna do any more.

890
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,020
Crockett. Hey.

891
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,290
That boy deserves

892
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,560
to come out of this with

893
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,560
the best outcome possible.

894
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,360
So you need to go in there

895
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,360
and do everything that you can

896
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,700
to make sure that happens.

897
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,130
Okay?

898
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,850
What's going on here?

899
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,490
I'm checking

900
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,490
the staff to see

901
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,090
if there's a donor

902
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,090
for Gary.

903
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,320
Maggie, we've got an ED

904
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,320
full of injured children.

905
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,920
Our staff

906
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,920
is needed in there.

907
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,060
I know.

908
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,760
And that's why I'm going

909
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,760
as fast as I can.

910
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,200
Maggie, we can't have this.

911
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,500
But if we...

912
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,030
If we don't find a donor

913
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,030
for him today, he's gonna die.

914
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,000
After battling cancer

915
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,000
for a year, every day,

916
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,610
and then to have

917
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,610
a cure right there,

918
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,610
right in his hands,

919
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,080
and then to have it

920
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,080
taken away?

921
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,350
I've got a hospital

922
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,350
full of patients

923
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,350
who need care.

924
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,220
Everybody.

925
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,220
Back to work.

926
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,230
Excuse me.

927
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,140
My little boy's in there.

928
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,610
He was on the school bus.

929
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,300
And I hope someone

930
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,300
would do this for him.

931
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,610
Where do you want me?

932
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,790
Right here.

933
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,830
What the hell

934
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,830
is wrong with you?

935
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,830
What did you do?

936
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,900
Dr. Charles,

937
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,900
I already lost an addict

938
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,410
that I helped get hooked

939
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,410
on opioids. I'm not

940
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,410
about to lose another.

941
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,810
You let this get

942
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,810
way too personal, Will.

943
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,810
Never a good idea.

944
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,850
For God's sakes,

945
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,850
isn't it personal?

946
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,650
You lost a brother to drugs.

947
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,280
What's that got to do

948
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,280
with anything?

949
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,960
You've been there.

950
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,080
Okay, you should know

951
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,630
that we can't

952
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,630
endlessly deliberate

953
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,630
over every patient.

954
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,750
Enough!

955
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,350
You have a lot of nerve

956
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,350
bringing up my little brother.

957
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,760
But since you have,

958
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,760
not a day goes by

959
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,760
when I don't miss him

960
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,100
or wonder what I could

961
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,100
have done differently,

962
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,690
but what I never do

963
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,690
is bring that to work

964
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,970
and let it affect

965
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,970
my professional judgment.

966
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,970
Okay, how we doing?

967
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,810
Carotid's mobilized.

968
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,810
Ready to tie.

969
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,370
Okay,

970
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,370
silk tie on a pass.

971
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,160
Dr. Marcel.

972
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,830
Open a patch. We're switching

973
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,830
to reconstruction.

974
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,670
You sure? He's pretty

975
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,670
coagulopathic.

976
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,210
I'm sure.

977
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,190
Adjusting

978
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,190
the upper clamp.

979
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,030
He's bradying down. Crockett.

980
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,260
Give me a three-inch shunt.

981
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,920
Dr. Marcel, if we just

982
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,920
tie the carotid off...

983
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,690
Give me the shunt.

984
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,900
Come on, come on. Shunt.

985
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,670
Shunt.

986
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,840
Rate's down to 42.

987
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,040
Thirty-six.

988
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,750
Crockett.

989
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,410
I'm in.

990
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,560
Rate's back up, 63.

991
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,610
Let's get started

992
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,610
on this patch.

993
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,640
Mr. Walker, there's no vaping

994
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,640
allowed in the hospital.

995
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,620
Oh, sorry.

996
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,620
I didn't know.

997
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,390
Let me ask you something.

998
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,390
Does your daughter vape?

999
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,580
What? No.

1000
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,160
Well, I mean, she did,

1001
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,160
but just to get her off

1002
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,160
the cigarettes.

1003
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,250
You know.

1004
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,390
Doctor?

1005
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,500
What's going on?

1006
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,500
She's been vaping.

1007
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,960
Mind if I look at this?

1008
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,960
Sure?

1009
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,440
I don't think you're gonna

1010
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,440
find anything. She stopped

1011
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,440
vaping six months ago.

1012
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,640
She's 12 years old.

1013
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,640
Do you have any idea

1014
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,640
how dangerous that is?

1015
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,240
It's better than smoking.

1016
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,240
That causes cancer.

1017
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,410
She only did it

1018
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,410
for three weeks. She did

1019
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,410
it long enough to quit.

1020
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,510
I mean,

1021
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,510
it's totally safe.

1022
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,450
Vaping's not addictive

1023
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,450
like cigarettes are.

1024
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,920
Oh, my God.

1025
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,920
Are these yours?

1026
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,750
No.

1027
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,660
She must've gotten them

1028
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,660
from school or

1029
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,660
from her friends.

1030
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,930
We had no idea.

1031
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,760
Oh, my God.

1032
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,030
Let's wait and see

1033
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,030
what the last few tests show.

1034
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,700
We'll be back

1035
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,700
in a little bit.

1036
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,720
Ronnie? Any luck?

1037
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,980
No.

1038
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,730
You do realize you found

1039
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,730
almost 40 potential donors?

1040
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,230
We usually don't get

1041
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,230
that many in a month.

1042
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,460
Wait.

1043
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,370
It's a match.

1044
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,370
We got a match.

1045
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,670
Are you sure?

1046
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,800
Maggie...

1047
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,030
This is the one.

1048
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,870
Oh, my God.

1049
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,410
Thank you so much, Ronnie.

1050
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,040
We've got a match!

1051
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,040
Clear.

1052
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,060
Oh, my God. Gary?

1053
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,490
Doris, I'll take over.

1054
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,490
Come on, Gary.

1055
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,590
Charging to 200.

1056
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,750
Come on, Gary.

1057
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,660
We'll get you through this.

1058
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,000
Clear.

1059
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,500
Come on. Let's go!

1060
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,340
Charge to 200!

1061
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,510
Come on, Gary.

1062
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,910
I'm sorry, Maggie.

1063
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,750
Charge it!

1064
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,080
Maggie.

1065
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,250
No.

1066
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,250
Maggie.

1067
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,060
Time of death is 17:36.

1068
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,040
It'll be okay,

1069
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,040
little man.

1070
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,090
Dr. Marcel,

1071
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,090
I'm sorry about before.

1072
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,930
Thanks for saving our son.

1073
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,490
Yeah, of course.

1074
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,660
How's Kate?

1075
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,500
We don't know yet.

1076
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,300
Crockett.

1077
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,300
Kate's waking up.

1078
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,170
Kate, sweetie,

1079
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,170
do you remember

1080
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,170
where you first saw me?

1081
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,320
The bus?

1082
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,360
Yeah, good. Really good.

1083
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,320
Can you wiggle your toes

1084
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,320
for me, sweetheart?

1085
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,370
That's good.

1086
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,970
Can you squeeze

1087
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,970
my finger? Tight.

1088
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,800
Like that?

1089
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,370
Yeah, just like that.

1090
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,060
Hi.

1091
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,490
Did you get

1092
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,490
the other tests back?

1093
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm afraid they

1094
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,000
were all negative.

1095
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,500
So, it was the vaping.

1096
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,010
We call it EVALI.

1097
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,580
E-cigarette

1098
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,580
or vaping-associated

1099
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,580
lung injury.

1100
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,580
She must've

1101
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,580
already had it,

1102
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,550
but the bus accident

1103
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,550
pushed her over the edge.

1104
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,550
So how long

1105
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,550
till she gets better?

1106
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,090
I wish I could tell you,

1107
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,720
but we don't know

1108
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,720
if she will.

1109
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,860
What do you mean?

1110
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,760
This condition

1111
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,760
is so new,

1112
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,030
we're still

1113
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,030
figuring it out.

1114
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,400
Your daughter may begin

1115
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,400
to breathe again on her own,

1116
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,870
but she may not.

1117
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,030
Never?

1118
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,770
It's possible.

1119
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,580
But the truth is,

1120
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,580
some people

1121
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,580
don't survive.

1122
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,580
Oh, my God.

1123
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,380
I'm very sorry.

1124
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,700
Those poor parents.

1125
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,700
And Alice.

1126
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,870
Yeah.

1127
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,740
All day long, I just...

1128
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,380
I had a feeling

1129
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,380
I wasn't being

1130
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,380
told the truth.

1131
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,800
Hey, I'm sorry

1132
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,800
about today.

1133
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,010
And for bringing up

1134
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,010
your brother.

1135
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,150
But you know what?

1136
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,150
It was all for this.

1137
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,290
I just, um,

1138
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,490
caught his girlfriend

1139
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,490
trying to pass that to him.

1140
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,700
Right now? Here?

1141
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,460
Yeah.

1142
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,970
What...

1143
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,440
Oh, my God.

1144
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,680
It's a long road, Will.

1145
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,680
No shortcuts.

1146
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,620
Hey.

1147
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,390
Quite a day.

1148
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,390
Yep.

1149
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,520
Risky call.

1150
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,320
But you did it.

1151
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,230
Yeah, well,

1152
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,230
didn't do it alone.

1153
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,530
Crockett.

1154
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,570
You were so adamant

1155
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,570
this morning on the bus.

1156
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,640
I've never seen you

1157
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,640
like that before.

1158
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,900
What was going on?

1159
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,580
Nothing.

1160
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,580
It was a choice.

1161
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,480
A choice no one else

1162
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,480
would've made.

1163
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,880
Why did you?

1164
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,220
Because no one should have

1165
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,220
to lose a child.

1166
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,560
No, of course not,

1167
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,560
but it was still...

1168
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,430
I'll see you in the morning,

1169
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,430
Dr. Manning.

1170
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,510
Hey, Maggie?

1171
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,880
Oh, hey.

1172
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,210
I heard about Gary.

1173
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,210
I'm so sorry.

1174
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,460
And I'm sorry for making

1175
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,460
a difficult day worse.

1176
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,950
Oh...

1177
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,390
I've got something

1178
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,390
I want to show you.

1179
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,030
Come with me.

1180
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,470
What's this?

1181
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,410
We were able

1182
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,410
to match some

1183
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,410
of the donors you found

1184
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,720
with other patients waiting

1185
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,720
on the transplant list.

1186
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,150
All these people?

1187
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,580
Yeah. And there are

1188
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,580
more on the way.

1189
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,730
You saved a lot

1190
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,730
of lives today, Maggie.

1191
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,940
Hey. Ready

1192
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,940
to do it again?

1193
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,250
Listen, Sean, I'm sorry,

1194
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,250
but I don't think

1195
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,250
I can do this anymore.

1196
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,920
What...

1197
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,920
What's going on?

1198
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,750
Just not cut out for it.

1199
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,190
Will, we have all

1200
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,190
had these moments.

1201
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,790
Doctor, there's someone

1202
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,790
here to see you.

1203
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,830
Hey.

1204
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,840
Hi.

1205
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,840
I met you this morning.

1206
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,680
When I was foaming

1207
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,680
on the ground.

1208
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,980
Yeah, I remember.

1209
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,450
Um...

1210
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,350
I'm new here, and...

1211
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,350
This place is a godsend.

1212
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,130
Anyway, I just wanted

1213
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,130
to say thanks

1214
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,230
for saving my life.

1215
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,340
I'm gonna try

1216
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,340
to turn things around.

1217
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,210
Good.

1218
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,050
I'm glad to hear that.

1219
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,880
Yeah.

1220
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,380
Okay.

1221
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,370
Ooh...

1222
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,000
Hey, Uncle Dan.

1223
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,280
Practice always end

1224
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,280
this late? When do you

1225
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,280
do your homework, man?

1226
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,710
I'm a psych major.

1227
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,870
You can basically make it

1228
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,870
all up as you go.

1229
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,120
That's funny.

1230
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,920
You, uh...

1231
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,920
You hungry?

1232
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,620
Is that a question?

1233
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,120
Come with me.

1234
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,120
All right.

1235
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,520
So, you checking up on me?

1236
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,190
Eh...

1237
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,530
No. Not really.

1238
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,630
Maybe. Sort of.

1239
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,630
I don't know.

1240
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,430
All right,

1241
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,430
don't worry.

1242
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,430
I'm still clean.

1243
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,570
The team checks

1244
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,570
my pee every month.

1245
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,640
I loved my dad,

1246
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,640
but I'm not gonna

1247
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,640
end up like him.

1248
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,650
You know how proud I am

1249
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,650
of you, right?

1250
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,590
Yeah.

1251
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,590
Do you?

1252
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,130
Yeah.

1253
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,130
Good.
