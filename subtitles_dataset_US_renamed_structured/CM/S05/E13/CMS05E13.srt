1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,160
You have to work out

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,160
whatever feelings you're

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,160
having about Dr. Marcel.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,800
Fast.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,400
Get me a Narcan inhaler.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,200
You overdosed.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,200
But you're gonna be all right.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,040
You let this get

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,040
way too personal, Will.

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,040
Never a good idea.

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,780
For God's sakes,

12
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,780
isn't it personal?

13
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,410
You lost a brother to drugs.

14
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,780
Enough!

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,320
I met you this morning.

16
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,050
I'm gonna try to

17
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,050
turn things around.

18
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,050
Good.

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,630
Hey.

20
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,030
Hi.

21
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,570
I love you.

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,810
Easy.

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,810
Oh, God.

24
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,110
Sorry.

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,110
Only me.

26
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,550
I wasn't expecting that.

27
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,420
Hey, I know

28
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,420
work's not the place

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,540
for ambush affection,

30
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,820
but I couldn't help myself.

31
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,590
I won't hold it against you.

32
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,450
What's up?

33
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,990
I haven't seen

34
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,990
a smile this big

35
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,290
since Navy beat Army.

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,660
Just thinking about

37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,660
being a dad.

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Birthday parties,

39
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,200
coaching teams.

40
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,730
That's a decade down the road.

41
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,730
We are three weeks into IVF.

42
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,900
You know what they say,

43
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,530
you blink

44
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,530
and the kids are grown.

45
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,840
Hey.

46
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,840
What up?

47
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,540
Pelicans covered

48
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,540
the spread.

49
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,380
How many rings

50
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,380
do the Pelicans have?

51
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,540
Go Bulls.

52
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,050
Yeah, we'll see.

53
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,720
I'm a horrible person,

54
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,720
aren't I?

55
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,920
No, you're human.

56
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,030
What can I do to help?

57
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,030
You got a time machine?

58
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,930
Hey, you.

59
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,930
Hey.

60
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,730
Date last night, spill it.

61
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,140
It was nice.

62
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,140
He was polite,

63
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,340
handsome, smart, but...

64
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,340
I don't think so.

65
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,480
Oh. Well, polite, smart

66
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,480
and handsome. Sounds awful.

67
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,610
All right, the real reason,

68
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,610
he's a psych professor.

69
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,180
The way he looked at me,

70
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,190
I just couldn't shake

71
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,190
the feeling that

72
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,190
I was being analyzed.

73
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,480
This is the fourth

74
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,480
first date

75
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,060
without even

76
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,060
considering a second.

77
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,920
Well, I'm glad

78
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,920
you're counting, Mom.

79
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,120
Look, it doesn't matter,

80
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,960
because none of those guys

81
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,960
were gonna work out anyways.

82
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,460
Wow. ESP.

83
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,540
Say, do you know

84
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,540
when the Saints

85
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,700
are gonna win

86
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,700
another Super Bowl?

87
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,200
All right, well, let me know

88
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,200
if you get another vision.

89
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,440
All I'm saying is the right

90
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,440
second date is out there,

91
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,110
and I'll know it

92
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,110
when I meet him.

93
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,610
Help! Please, my son!

94
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,710
Oh, my...

95
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,710
I got him.

96
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,210
Where am I going?

97
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,210
Trauma One.

98
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,350
Help

99
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,350
my husband and son!

100
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,290
Help!

101
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,290
Help, help, help, help!

102
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,330
Help him, I...

103
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,330
I didn't know what to do.

104
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,470
Okay, bruising on his neck.

105
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,470
Protect it and bag him.

106
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,570
Hold C-spine. What's his name?

107
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,970
Jamie.

108
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,640
Jamie. Hey, Jamie.

109
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,740
Can you hear me?

110
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,810
Okay, okay. Take it easy.

111
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,810
You're okay. Take it easy.

112
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,950
What happened?

113
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,320
It was an accident.

114
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,850
I choked him out.

115
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,690
I had to.

116
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,370
It all happened so fast.

117
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,550
I didn't realize,

118
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,550
I just wanted it to stop.

119
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,610
Jamie was screaming,

120
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,610
Dylan was crying and...

121
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,690
Gordon, I want you

122
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,690
to take a deep breath, okay?

123
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,410
Take a deep breath.

124
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,880
All right.

125
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,420
Have a seat. Sit down.

126
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,520
Okay.

127
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,530
And, um... I...

128
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,730
I just want you

129
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,730
to tell me...

130
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,730
Tell me what happened.

131
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,430
Okay, so I was driving,

132
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,370
talking with Bella, my wife.

133
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,600
Um... The boys were

134
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,600
in the back.

135
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,800
Jamie was playing

136
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,800
with his iPad.

137
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,780
Dylan grabbed it from him,

138
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,780
wouldn't give it back.

139
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,540
Jamie can't control his anger.

140
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,540
He started punching Dylan,

141
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,180
got out of his seatbelt

142
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,180
and got on top of him

143
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,180
and kept pounding.

144
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,590
Bella couldn't pull him off.

145
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,600
I could hear Jamie's fists

146
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,600
cracking against Dylan's face.

147
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,800
He was screaming for help,

148
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,800
so I pulled over.

149
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,080
I just threw myself

150
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,080
on top of Jamie.

151
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,980
I wrapped my arms

152
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,980
around him and held him

153
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,980
as tight as I could.

154
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,080
When he gets like this,

155
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,080
the bear hugs are the only

156
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,080
thing that bring him back.

157
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,150
Bring him back?

158
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,790
From his dark place.

159
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,820
Huh.

160
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,630
Okay.

161
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,800
Will you... Will you excuse me

162
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,800
for a moment, Gordon?

163
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,360
Yeah.

164
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,040
We're gonna take care

165
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,040
of you, little man, okay?

166
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,240
All right.

167
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,820
Ordered a CT, but

168
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,820
I'm almost positive

169
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,360
there's a bilateral

170
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,360
mandible fracture.

171
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,950
Gonna need surgery

172
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,950
to wire it shut.

173
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,190
Man, Ethan, kid's only

174
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,190
six years old.

175
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,660
Jamie?

176
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,640
He's stable, but tormented.

177
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,640
Dad choked him out.

178
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,340
Probably so he couldn't defend

179
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,340
his little brother.

180
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,640
Sometimes I hate the ED.

181
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,520
Jamie, how you doing?

182
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,520
I'm Dr. Charles.

183
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,650
Um, would you mind

184
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,650
if I looked at your hands?

185
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,600
Fifth metacarpal

186
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,600
is broken on each hand.

187
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,690
That's really gotta hurt.

188
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,940
Um, look, we're gonna get you

189
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,940
completely fixed up, okay?

190
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,070
It's nice

191
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,070
to meet you.

192
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,310
This is not child abuse.

193
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,590
Thanks, man.

194
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,960
You know,

195
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,960
one of the volunteers

196
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,730
works at a rehab center.

197
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,860
If you'd like,

198
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,230
she can tell you

199
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,230
about their program.

200
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,070
Yeah, sure.

201
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,800
Maybe another time.

202
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,810
If you change your mind,

203
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,810
we're here.

204
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,110
Will.

205
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,110
Yeah?

206
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,880
You have been here for hours.

207
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,880
Go home, get some rest.

208
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,560
Yeah. I could use some sleep

209
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,560
before I start my shift.

210
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,150
Ah, damn it!

211
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,150
Starts in a half-hour.

212
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,290
Uh, okay. All right,

213
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,290
that woman over there,

214
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,290
her name's Susan.

215
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,990
When she comes down,

216
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,990
she's gonna be hungry.

217
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,260
I stashed some

218
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,260
protein bars...

219
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,260
I know.

220
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,930
I saw.

221
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,930
The electrolyte drinks,

222
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,930
too. Get to work.

223
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll be back later.

224
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,000
You call me

225
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,000
if you need anything.

226
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,910
That's the cry, that one.

227
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,950
It's not "I'm hungry"

228
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,950
or "I'm tired." It's new.

229
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,590
Okay. I know,

230
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,590
I know, Axel.

231
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,290
You're in pain,

232
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,290
and my touching

233
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,290
is only making it worse.

234
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,360
Any changes in

235
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,360
his sleep pattern?

236
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,260
No. Every baby book I read

237
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,260
said put your child on

238
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,260
a schedule and stick to it.

239
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,160
Been there.

240
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,160
My son's almost four.

241
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,260
I know, I know.

242
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,260
Almost finished.

243
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,500
Okay. What about diet?

244
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,370
I had to start using formula.

245
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,870
Just not enough

246
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,870
hours in the day

247
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,810
to pump, work, nurse,

248
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,810
do laundry, pump again.

249
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,210
Single mom?

250
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,650
Yeah, me, too.

251
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,880
Dad still in the picture?

252
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,880
No. But I'm okay with it.

253
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,490
Well, I'm not seeing anything

254
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,490
out of the ordinary.

255
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,150
I mean, the switch from

256
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,150
breast milk to formula

257
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,820
could be upsetting

258
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,820
Axel's stomach.

259
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,020
Have you noticed any diarrhea

260
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,020
since the change?

261
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,120
Here and there, but this cry

262
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,120
has been consistent

263
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,120
for the last month.

264
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,360
I'll test for allergies,

265
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,360
but infants and crying...

266
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,630
Don't say colic. I've been to

267
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,630
three pediatricians.

268
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,000
They all diagnosed colic

269
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,000
and sent me home.

270
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,840
No, something else

271
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,840
is going on.

272
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,400
Run tests, X-rays, scans.

273
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,400
Just please, figure it out.

274
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,140
Okay, well,

275
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,140
why don't we start

276
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,850
with some basic labs

277
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,850
and go from there?

278
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,410
Is that okay?

279
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,820
Sure. Thank you.

280
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,160
I'll send a nurse in

281
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,160
to get started.

282
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,270
Thank you.

283
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey, Jamie,

284
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,000
you hungry? Thirsty?

285
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,510
I know your casts are bulky.

286
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,510
I can help you.

287
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,540
I'll leave the tray

288
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,540
right here, just in case.

289
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,750
They're talking about me.

290
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,790
About what I did

291
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,790
to my little brother.

292
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,760
I didn't mean to hurt him.

293
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,260
Okay.

294
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,390
I'm so sorry.

295
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,870
It's okay, okay. Okay.

296
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,970
After two miscarriages

297
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,970
and five failed IVF attempts,

298
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,280
we'd had enough heartbreak.

299
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,970
We adopted Jamie

300
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,970
when he was a few days old.

301
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,210
Best day of our lives.

302
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,780
Do you know anything

303
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,780
about his birth parents?

304
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,390
Nothing really.

305
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,390
Um, Mom was young,

306
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,390
in foster care.

307
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,660
We don't know

308
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,660
anything about Dad.

309
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,630
Well, Jamie's 11 now,

310
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,630
so how old was he when

311
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,630
he first started acting out?

312
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,430
As an infant,

313
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,430
he didn't like being held,

314
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,430
was always fidgety.

315
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,970
Hmm. How about

316
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,970
as a toddler?

317
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,510
Sitting still, taking turns,

318
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,510
following directions,

319
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,940
they were all a challenge.

320
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,140
When did Jamie's behavior

321
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,140
start becoming aggressive?

322
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,780
Elementary school. Fights with

323
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,780
classmates and teachers.

324
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,680
We're homeschooling now.

325
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,280
And your other son, Dylan,

326
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,280
is he adopted as well?

327
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,480
Yeah.

328
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,820
It was initially Jamie's idea.

329
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,820
He wanted to be a big brother.

330
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,330
And in the beginning, Dylan's

331
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,330
presence seemed to calm Jamie.

332
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,270
He would push his stroller,

333
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,270
feed him his bottle,

334
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,500
let him climb all over him.

335
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,270
They are so... Were so close.

336
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,510
I'm assuming that Jamie's been

337
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,510
evaluated by a psychiatrist.

338
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,700
Several.

339
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,180
They all just add

340
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,180
to the diagnosis.

341
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,720
Intermittent

342
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,720
Explosive Disorder.

343
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,720
Co-morbid ADHD.

344
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,010
Disruptive Mood

345
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,010
Dysregulation Disorder.

346
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,610
Tell me, what meds

347
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,610
is he on right now?

348
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,290
Risperidone, Valproic Acid,

349
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,290
Lithium, Adderall, Tenex.

350
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,890
They all work for a bit,

351
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,890
but then...

352
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,470
He always ends up

353
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,470
in his "dark place."

354
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,040
Mr. and Mrs. Shaw,

355
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,040
Dylan's out of surgery.

356
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,040
I'll take you to Recovery.

357
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,910
Look, what I'd like to do

358
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,910
is admit Jamie

359
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,910
for a five-day hold.

360
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,480
That'll give us a chance

361
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,480
to assess the situation

362
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,310
and come up with some

363
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,310
treatment options for you.

364
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,410
Anything. Please,

365
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,410
just help him.

366
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,720
Shh. He's out.

367
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,720
Cried himself to sleep.

368
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,190
What'd the tests say?

369
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,390
The labs were normal, um,

370
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,390
but the babygram revealed

371
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,390
a mild bowel distention.

372
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,730
There are no obstructions,

373
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,530
however, the stool

374
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,530
in Axel's diaper was watery.

375
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,270
That suggests a GI issue.

376
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,860
Okay, what do you do for that?

377
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,000
Endoscopy.

378
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,840
So, under general anesthesia,

379
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,940
a surgeon will guide

380
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,940
a camera down Axel's throat

381
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,380
into his GI tract

382
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,380
to search for abnormalities.

383
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,780
And if necessary,

384
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,780
we'll do a colonoscopy

385
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,780
as well.

386
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,710
Can I be there?

387
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,610
I wouldn't recommend that.

388
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,890
I mean, seeing

389
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,890
the scope inside Axel,

390
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,890
it might be upsetting.

391
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,790
No, I really wanna be there.

392
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,300
Are you sure? Because I can't

393
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,300
overstate how distressing

394
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,260
this procedure can be

395
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,260
for a parent to watch.

396
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,600
I mean, seeing your child

397
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,600
on the table unconscious...

398
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,100
I'll be okay.

399
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,880
All right. Techs will be by

400
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,880
shortly to bring up Axel.

401
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,880
I'll be there as well.

402
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,900
Signed.

403
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,900
Thank you.

404
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,110
Hey, Doris.

405
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,980
Julia, the mom

406
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,980
in Treatment Three,

407
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,980
did you get a read?

408
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,560
I like her.

409
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,560
I wish all parents

410
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,560
would handle

411
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,560
the ED that smoothly.

412
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,420
You don't think

413
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,420
she's too composed?

414
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,400
I mean, her son

415
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,400
is clearly in distress

416
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,950
and she hasn't even

417
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,950
broken a sweat.

418
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,970
There's that

419
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,970
Manning ESP again.

420
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,300
Okay. She asked me to run

421
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,300
more tests on her baby

422
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,300
than necessary,

423
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,460
and now she wants to be front

424
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,460
row when he gets scoped.

425
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,600
You don't think

426
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,600
that's a little odd?

427
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,170
Uh... If you say so.

428
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,640
Call Dr. Frisch. I wanna put

429
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,640
Axel on today's schedule

430
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,640
for an endoscopy.

431
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,810
She's busy.

432
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,810
Omphalocele repair.

433
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,250
Gonna be

434
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,250
locked away all day.

435
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,590
But I'm free. I can

436
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,590
take care of it right now,

437
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,590
if you'd like.

438
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,750
Okay, thanks.

439
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,460
Meet you upstairs.

440
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,460
Nurse Doris.

441
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,920
Thank you.

442
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,920
Sure.

443
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,860
Nurse April.

444
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,860
Dr. Marcel.

445
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,660
Okay, stomach and esophagus

446
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,660
appear normal. Let's reset

447
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,660
for a colonoscopy.

448
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,440
Julia, are you okay?

449
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,040
You don't have to

450
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,040
keep watching, you know.

451
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,140
No, I'm okay. It's just...

452
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,140
I have a scrape on my stomach.

453
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,980
I forgot to change

454
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,980
the bandage, and it's

455
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,980
beginning to slide around.

456
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,050
Why don't I have a nurse

457
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,050
change that out for you

458
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,050
when we're back in the ED?

459
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,790
Oh. Okay.

460
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,050
Yeah. Thanks.

461
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,050
Yeah.

462
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,460
Somehow I keep

463
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,460
scraping myself

464
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,460
right there.

465
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know how.

466
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,000
Mom brain, I guess.

467
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,670
Right there.

468
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,210
Okay. Sharp

469
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,210
or dull pain, Chloe?

470
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,400
I think both.

471
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,400
Is that even possible?

472
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,200
Unfortunately.

473
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,470
How long have you

474
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,470
been feeling off?

475
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,490
I don't know, couple weeks.

476
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,050
Three months.

477
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,050
She downplays everything.

478
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,490
We just got married.

479
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,320
I figured the pain

480
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,320
was just nervous energy.

481
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,920
But the wedding's

482
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,920
behind us now

483
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,920
and I still feel blah.

484
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,430
Any constipation, bloating?

485
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,370
She hasn't pooped

486
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,370
in a week.

487
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,360
So, Chloe, I'm gonna need

488
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,360
to take a closer look

489
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,360
to see what's going on.

490
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,670
We'll get some X-rays,

491
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,670
a pelvic and a rectal.

492
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,540
Just keeping the sexy

493
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,540
flowing, aren't I?

494
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,510
Till death do us part.

495
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,580
Well, a nurse

496
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,580
will come in and

497
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,580
get things going.

498
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Congratulations,

499
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Mr. and Mrs. James.

500
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,710
Crockett.

501
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,850
Yeah?

502
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,850
Perfect timing.

503
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,880
Single vehicle accident

504
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,880
landing now. Massive trauma.

505
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,880
I'll have Baghdad ready.

506
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,690
Got it.

507
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,260
What do you got?

508
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
Lucy Seaver, 20, GCS three,

509
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
intubated in the field.

510
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,260
Bilateral femur fractures

511
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,260
and traction splints.

512
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,430
SATS 100% on oxygen.

513
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,200
Okay, Lucy, don't be afraid.

514
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,210
You're in the ED.

515
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,210
We're gonna take

516
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,210
good care of you.

517
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,300
Parents should be here

518
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,300
any second.

519
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,740
They were on the scene.

520
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,280
They were in the car

521
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,280
behind Lucy.

522
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,110
They saw the crash?

523
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,110
And the aftermath.

524
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,150
Lucy's car was so mangled,

525
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,880
it took us 20 minutes

526
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,880
to extricate her and

527
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,880
get her in the ambo.

528
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,910
Okay, all right. Here we go.

529
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,910
On my count, one, two, three.

530
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,290
Good breath sounds

531
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,290
bilaterally.

532
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,270
Belly's hard as a rock.

533
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,770
BP is 70s.

534
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
Two of plasma,

535
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
two of blood

536
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
on the transfuser.

537
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,740
Trigger the MTP.

538
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,740
Let's FAST her.

539
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,510
Ton of soft tissue damage.

540
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,780
Glass everywhere.

541
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,350
All right, no,

542
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,350
scrap the X-ray.

543
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,350
No time.

544
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,950
Give me that wand.

545
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,190
FAST is positive. Yeah,

546
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,190
I gotta get into her belly.

547
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,990
All right, let's go.

548
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,990
Let's

549
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,990
open up the Hybrid OR.

550
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,500
Oh, my God, Lucy!

551
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,500
Get her

552
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,500
prepped, all right?

553
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,430
Lucy!

554
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,430
Let's get her

555
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,430
on the move.

556
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,600
All right.

557
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,600
Mr. and Mrs. Seaver,

558
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,600
if you will.

559
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,300
Your daughter has been

560
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,300
seriously injured.

561
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,640
She needs immediate surgery

562
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,640
to control internal bleeding.

563
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,610
It's fixable?

564
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,610
She's gonna live?

565
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,550
We will do everything we can.

566
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,290
Huh.

567
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,790
So, uh, what is

568
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,790
your favorite sport?

569
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,360
Football, I guess.

570
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,630
Bears fan?

571
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,300
My dad likes them.

572
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,300
I like the Chiefs.

573
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,570
Oh, really? Well,

574
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,570
how'd that happen?

575
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,980
The quarterback.

576
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,980
Saw a video of him throw

577
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,980
the ball out of the stadium.

578
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,310
That was cool.

579
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,510
I saw that clip, too.

580
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,510
And you're right,

581
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,510
it was cool.

582
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,920
You know, I was wondering

583
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,920
if we could talk

584
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,920
a bit about...

585
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,720
About what happens,

586
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,720
you know, about how it feels

587
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,350
when you start

588
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,350
to get upset?

589
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,390
I don't know... Kind of...

590
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,330
It's fuzzy.

591
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,740
Fuzzy? So kind of like,

592
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,740
um, like a dream?

593
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,830
I guess.

594
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,040
And when that happens,

595
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,040
I mean, what does it...

596
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,580
What does it feel like?

597
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,170
I mean, like, you know,

598
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,170
I mean, in here?

599
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,740
I mean, do you feel anything

600
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,740
in your body?

601
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,060
It feels like

602
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,060
I'm gonna explode.

603
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,590
Wow, I'm sorry.

604
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,520
That must be

605
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,520
really scary.

606
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,390
You wanna take

607
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,390
a little break?

608
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,520
I want this off. It's sticking

609
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,520
to me. I can't stand it.

610
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,620
Okay. Okay.

611
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,760
Don't touch me!

612
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,390
Don't touch me!

613
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,390
I hate you! I hate you!

614
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,230
Let go! Stop it!

615
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,300
Go away! Stop it!

616
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,040
Go away! Go away!

617
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,040
Two of Haldol!

618
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,200
Stop it! No! No!

619
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,200
I don't want that!

620
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,980
Stop! Stop it! No! Stop! No!

621
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,380
I don't want that!

622
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,380
Stop! Stop it!

623
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,380
I wish I could tell you

624
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,380
exactly what happened

625
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,380
in there,

626
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,330
what triggered Jamie,

627
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,330
but honestly, I can't.

628
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,830
I have reviewed

629
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,830
his medical records.

630
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,450
I've spoken with

631
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,450
several of his doctors.

632
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,560
And what is clear to me

633
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,560
is that your son

634
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,560
is struggling

635
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,330
with multiple impulse control

636
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,330
and mood regulation disorders.

637
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,800
So what do we do?

638
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,800
We just wanna help him.

639
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,500
Well, it's the hospital's

640
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,500
recommendation

641
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,810
that Jamie be admitted

642
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,810
to a residential facility

643
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,970
where he can receive

644
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,970
sustained clinical care

645
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,950
as well as supportive therapy.

646
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,180
A residential facility?

647
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,180
Mmm-hmm.

648
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,410
Yeah. Mrs. Shaw,

649
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,410
you know, Jamie's 11.

650
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,420
Puberty is fast approaching.

651
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,480
And that surge of hormones

652
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,480
is just gonna undoubtedly

653
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,480
exacerbate his conditions.

654
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,620
You know, just

655
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,620
make him more difficult

656
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,620
to treat in general,

657
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,600
you know, find the right

658
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,600
balance of meds.

659
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,460
And a specialized

660
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,460
setting like this

661
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,940
will have the behavioral

662
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,940
resources Jamie needs

663
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,940
for the future.

664
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,340
And it'll be a safe place

665
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,340
for him right now.

666
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,450
Anything for our son.

667
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,350
All right. I'll take care

668
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,350
of all the arrangements.

669
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,020
Okay. Looking good.

670
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,720
Four tears in the small bowel

671
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,720
mesentery tied off.

672
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,820
Liver's packed and hemostatic.

673
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,860
Pressure's no good.

674
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,360
We maxed out on pressors?

675
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,960
Yeah, and I've given ten units

676
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,960
of blood and ten of plasma.

677
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,560
She's still

678
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,560
bleeding somewhere.

679
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,900
I don't...

680
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,840
Hematoma on the pelvis.

681
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,840
Bigger than my first look

682
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,840
and growing.

683
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,500
Gotta assume the pelvis

684
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,500
is shattered and bleeding.

685
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,840
Okay, team, new deal.

686
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,840
Preperitoneal packs.

687
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,840
Let's go.

688
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,680
Hey, Chloe,

689
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,680
how you feeling?

690
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,350
Like a stuffed turkey.

691
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,190
X-rays showed

692
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,190
your bowel is FOS.

693
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,220
Full of...

694
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,220
Stool.

695
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,820
The pelvic suggests

696
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,820
your uterus is enlarged.

697
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,160
So I suspect a fibroid

698
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,160
is sitting on the uterus,

699
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,670
putting pressure

700
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,670
on the rectum.

701
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,260
You were right.

702
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,240
The last few weeks

703
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,240
she was scouring the web

704
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,240
with her symptoms,

705
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,100
and a fibroid fit the bill.

706
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,870
We're trying to have a baby.

707
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,430
Internet says fibroids

708
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,430
hinder the ability

709
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,430
to conceive.

710
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,910
Not all fibroids

711
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,910
are created equal.

712
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,710
Okay, I'm gonna order a pelvic

713
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,710
ultrasound and a gyne consult.

714
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,080
I'll check back soon.

715
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,590
And no more googling, okay?

716
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,590
Doctor's orders.

717
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,690
How's it going with

718
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,690
your six-month-old?

719
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,690
Dead end.

720
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,730
Nothing's jumping out on

721
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,730
any of the labs

722
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,920
and the endoscopy

723
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,920
and colonoscopy report.

724
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,370
I'm starting to wonder

725
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,370
if it's really baby Axel

726
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,370
who's the one that's sick.

727
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,560
What do you mean?

728
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,560
Well, Mom, she's just...

729
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,540
She's got this air about her.

730
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,540
This nonchalance that screams,

731
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,440
"Yeah, my baby's in the ED,

732
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,440
but it's just another day."

733
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,640
Well, it wouldn't be

734
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,640
the first time we see

735
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,640
a parent pretend

736
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,080
their child was sick

737
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,080
to get attention.

738
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,080
Yeah, unfortunately.

739
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,080
Have you seen Dr. Charles?

740
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,780
He's upstairs.

741
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,780
I'll page him for you.

742
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,290
Thanks.

743
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,290
Yeah.

744
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,280
Dr. Manning, it's Julia.

745
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,280
There's something

746
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,280
you need to see.

747
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,780
You know, I had my appendix

748
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,780
taken out when I was

749
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,780
in tenth grade.

750
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,230
All right, well,

751
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,230
let's take a look.

752
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,230
Oh, my God.

753
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,230
This is a fistula.

754
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,270
Basically, a tunnel

755
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,270
between your small bowel

756
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,270
and your skin.

757
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,780
The green fluid

758
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,780
is leaking from

759
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,780
your intestines.

760
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,470
Seriously?

761
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,470
Mmm-hmm.

762
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,100
I've been getting

763
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,100
these scrapes for years.

764
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,100
They heal up.

765
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,480
It's been my intestines

766
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,480
oozing out?

767
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,280
The tissue sample taken

768
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,280
during Axel's endoscopy,

769
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,280
I'd like it biopsied.

770
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,410
Biopsy? You're testing

771
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,410
for cancer?

772
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,790
No, something new.

773
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,120
And now I'm thinking

774
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,120
you may have it as well.

775
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,990
The test that I ran on

776
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,990
your son, I'd like

777
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,990
to run on you as well.

778
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,020
Okay.

779
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,040
All right, pelvis is packed.

780
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,040
Bleeding is under control.

781
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,330
Call ICU and tell them

782
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,330
Lucy is coming up to rewarm.

783
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,960
Something's wrong.

784
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,960
Pressure's still

785
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,960
in the toilet.

786
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,670
74 over 38

787
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,670
and falling.

788
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,710
What?

789
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,710
She's peri-arrest.

790
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,640
She's still bleeding?

791
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,710
The abdomen is dry.

792
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,690
Pelvis is contained. I mean,

793
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,690
we are hemostatic, Marty.

794
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,620
She's bradying down.

795
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,780
No pulse.

796
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,950
Come on.

797
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,890
Milligram of epi.

798
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,160
Epi's in.

799
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,160
Pulse check?

800
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,160
Go.

801
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,830
Still nothing.

802
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,000
Come on, Lucy.

803
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,200
Hold compressions.

804
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,480
What do you got?

805
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,470
Asystole.

806
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,740
Come on.

807
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,850
Come on, Lucy. Come on.

808
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,820
Damn it!

809
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,710
Time of death, 16:17.

810
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,380
Okay, if everyone

811
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,380
could clear the room, please.

812
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,580
I'd like a moment alone

813
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,580
with my patient.

814
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,390
What's going on?

815
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,100
There's room for Jamie

816
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,100
at Meyerbrook,

817
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,400
which is the only

818
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,400
residential facility capable

819
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,400
of handling his needs.

820
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,770
Unfortunately,

821
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,770
neither his private insurance

822
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,540
or State Medicaid

823
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,540
is gonna cover the cost.

824
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,700
What about an individual

825
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,700
care grant from the state?

826
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,370
I already looked into it.

827
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,370
It's no help.

828
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,080
Yeah, the grant's

829
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,080
so underfunded, it wouldn't

830
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,080
come close to what's needed.

831
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,380
So what's plan B?

832
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,910
Well, you know, I'm gonna just

833
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,910
try to use the five-day hold

834
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,720
to normalize his meds

835
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,720
as best I can.

836
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,380
And I do know

837
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,380
a brilliant guy

838
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,620
who specializes in

839
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,620
these kind of disorders

840
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,620
that I wanna refer him to.

841
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,260
An outpatient service?

842
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,260
Jamie pummeled Dylan

843
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,260
over an iPad.

844
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,930
The kid's jaw

845
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,930
is wired shut.

846
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,400
He's only six years old.

847
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,100
He's going to invade

848
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,100
his brother's space again.

849
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,940
And when that happens

850
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,940
and Jamie loses his temper,

851
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,980
I'm worried

852
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,980
he could kill Dylan.

853
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,410
I don't like it either, Ethan,

854
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,570
but I mean, you know,

855
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,570
I can't hold him here forever.

856
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,520
I get it, but we have

857
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,520
an obligation

858
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,520
to protect Dylan.

859
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,610
And he needs our help

860
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,610
just as much as Jamie.

861
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,330
Dr. Halstead, the gyne

862
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,330
attending on call came down

863
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,330
a few minutes ago.

864
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,490
She's with Chloe right now.

865
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
Great, thanks.

866
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,300
...if you feel

867
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,300
comfortable with that.

868
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,840
Okay.

869
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,670
Dr. Hannah Asher, Gynecology.

870
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,020
Will Halstead.

871
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,020
It's nice to meet you.

872
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,040
Yeah. Likewise.

873
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,450
I was just explaining to

874
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,050
Chloe and David that

875
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,050
I reviewed

876
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,050
her pelvic ultrasound.

877
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,520
Considering the location

878
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,520
and size of the fibroid,

879
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,890
I believe

880
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,890
removing it surgically

881
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,290
is the best course

882
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,290
of treatment.

883
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,990
A myomectomy?

884
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,990
By who? When?

885
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,860
Me. Today.

886
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,000
Chloe, David, you should know

887
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,000
this surgery can be risky.

888
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,470
Yes. I've explained

889
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,470
the pros and cons,

890
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,470
Dr. Halstead.

891
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,870
Was clear that while

892
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,870
this is a big operation,

893
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,870
it's also a common one.

894
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,640
You know, nevertheless,

895
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,640
complications could arise.

896
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,980
So, I would suggest

897
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,980
non-surgical options.

898
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,980
Hormone therapy will

899
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,980
shrink the fibroid.

900
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,250
Well, that's what

901
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,250
Dr. Asher said,

902
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,260
but to ensure that

903
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,260
it doesn't grow back, Chloe

904
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,260
would have to go on the pill.

905
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,190
We're anxious

906
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,190
to start a family.

907
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,850
The pill takes that

908
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,850
off the table.

909
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,090
In the short term, yes,

910
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,090
but not permanently.

911
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,330
Actually,

912
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,330
it kind of does.

913
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,060
I'm 41, Dr. Halstead.

914
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,690
My window for getting pregnant

915
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,690
is already closing.

916
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,840
If I choose hormones,

917
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,840
I might as well slam it shut.

918
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,740
We appreciate your passion,

919
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,740
Dr. Halstead.

920
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,340
But surgery is

921
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,340
the best for us.

922
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,010
I'll get that started.

923
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,010
It was so nice

924
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,010
meeting both of you.

925
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,080
Doctor.

926
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,420
Excuse me just a moment.

927
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,030
Dr. Asher? Doctor!

928
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,960
Hmm?

929
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,090
You can't perform

930
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,090
this surgery.

931
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,090
Hmm?

932
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,760
I mean, you shouldn't

933
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,760
even be working.

934
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,060
Look, thank you for your help

935
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,060
last week, but I'm better now.

936
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,060
I'm over that hump.

937
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,960
So, heroin addiction

938
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,960
is like a cold?

939
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,700
What, you just

940
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,700
get over it?

941
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,240
What I saw

942
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,240
at that injection site...

943
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,970
Was me having a bad day.

944
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,200
A bad day?

945
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,200
Mmm-hmm.

946
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,300
You...

947
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,910
You OD'd.

948
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,810
For all I know,

949
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,810
you're high right now.

950
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,950
Right. And how many

951
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,950
all-nighters

952
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,610
you pull over there

953
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,610
since I saw you last, huh?

954
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,550
Three? Four?

955
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,420
Maybe I should be the one

956
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,420
worried about your judgment.

957
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,130
Don't twist this. I'm not

958
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,130
an addict about to operate.

959
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,900
You step into that OR, you put

960
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,900
Chloe's life in jeopardy.

961
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,960
I would never risk

962
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,960
the well-being of a patient.

963
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,270
And not that it is

964
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,270
any of your business,

965
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,270
I'm sober now.

966
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,510
I'd expect an addict

967
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,510
to say that.

968
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,910
Chloe is in good hands

969
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,910
with me.

970
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,130
Axel has Crohn's disease?

971
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,130
But he's only six months old.

972
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,860
Well, it's rare

973
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,860
in children,

974
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,440
let alone infants,

975
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,440
but not unheard of.

976
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,000
Isn't Crohn's a diet thing?

977
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,870
Axel's barely

978
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,870
started on solids.

979
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,270
Well, diet aggravates

980
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,270
Crohn's, but it's not

981
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,270
the cause. Genetics is.

982
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,640
Crohn's tends to

983
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,640
cluster in families.

984
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,680
Whoa. My test results...

985
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,340
Show that you have

986
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,340
Crohn's as well.

987
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,010
The fistula is just evidence

988
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,010
of the severity.

989
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,060
This doesn't make sense.

990
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,060
If I've got Crohn's

991
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,060
badly enough

992
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,180
to burn a hole in my skin,

993
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,180
shouldn't it bother me?

994
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,450
Well, fistulas themselves

995
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,450
are painless,

996
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,500
but, yes, a Crohn's flare-up

997
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,500
is excruciating.

998
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,900
You should be in pain. Agony.

999
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,490
Yeah, well,

1000
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,490
I don't feel a thing.

1001
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,870
This is weirding you out,

1002
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,870
isn't it?

1003
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,170
It's definitely unusual.

1004
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,740
Or actually, maybe it's...

1005
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,050
Maybe it's rare.

1006
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,890
Let me ask you a question.

1007
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,890
What emotion are you

1008
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,890
feeling right now?

1009
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,060
Uh, I'm not sure

1010
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,060
what you mean.

1011
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,590
Well, I just told you

1012
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,590
that you and your son

1013
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,600
have an inflammatory

1014
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,600
bowel disease.

1015
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,330
I mean, what are you feeling?

1016
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,330
Stress? Anxiety? Fear?

1017
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,100
Confusion, that's for sure.

1018
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,570
You know what? I'd like to

1019
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,570
run one more test. Okay?

1020
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,200
Okay.

1021
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,710
B, it's taking too long.

1022
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,710
Check with Dr. Asher?

1023
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,380
Again? I've already gone

1024
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,380
in there twice for you,

1025
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,380
Dr. Halstead.

1026
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,620
Please, I'm treating Chloe

1027
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,620
in the ED.

1028
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,630
I just wanna make sure

1029
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,630
Dr. Asher's got

1030
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,630
everything under control.

1031
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,790
Fine.

1032
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,190
Thank you.

1033
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,630
Dr. Asher said, "Go away."

1034
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,140
Nope. Staying right here.

1035
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,710
Hey.

1036
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,110
Got your page.

1037
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,880
You have a new plan

1038
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,880
to help Jamie?

1039
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,450
Yeah.

1040
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,650
Yep, I do.

1041
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,490
So, Mr. and Mrs. Shaw,

1042
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,490
I have given this a

1043
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,490
tremendous amount of thought.

1044
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,830
I've consulted with

1045
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,830
numerous colleagues,

1046
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,130
with social workers,

1047
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,130
with our Executive Director

1048
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,130
of Patient Services.

1049
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,670
Jamie needs to be

1050
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,670
at the Meyerbrook

1051
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,670
Residential Facility.

1052
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,010
So the insurance companies,

1053
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,010
they agreed to pay?

1054
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,640
No. Both your

1055
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,640
private insurance

1056
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,640
and Medicaid won't budge.

1057
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,270
Then, uh... I'm confused.

1058
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,490
There is a way to force

1059
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,490
Medicaid to cover

1060
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,490
Meyerbrook's cost in full.

1061
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,190
It's called

1062
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,190
a psychiatric lockout.

1063
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,360
But it will require you

1064
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,360
to surrender Jamie

1065
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,360
to this hospital.

1066
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,290
Surrender? I don't understand.

1067
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,630
If you were to leave Jamie

1068
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,630
here and refuse to come back,

1069
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,640
Child Protective Services

1070
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,640
would have to take

1071
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,640
custody of him.

1072
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,110
Then, as a ward of the state,

1073
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,110
legally, Illinois

1074
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,110
would have to provide him

1075
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,340
with the mental health

1076
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,340
services that he needs.

1077
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,110
Meyerbrook.

1078
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,620
This is insane.

1079
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,620
We're not doing this.

1080
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,120
So there's no other way?

1081
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,990
I'm so sorry,

1082
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,990
but there just isn't.

1083
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,380
We would absolutely

1084
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,380
find a way

1085
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,190
for you to maintain

1086
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,190
contact with Jamie,

1087
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,060
but you also

1088
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,060
need to know that,

1089
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,560
legally, you won't have

1090
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,560
any say in his care.

1091
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,000
We're still his parents.

1092
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,400
This doesn't change that.

1093
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,400
Nothing changes that.

1094
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,410
No. No, no, no.

1095
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,410
We're not abandoning our son.

1096
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,480
Mrs. Shaw, you will

1097
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,480
not be abandoning him.

1098
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,570
This...

1099
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,570
This won't be forever.

1100
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,340
Jamie needs us to do this.

1101
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,590
When?

1102
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,760
I cannot imagine how agonizing

1103
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,760
this decision must be,

1104
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,030
but the sooner Jamie

1105
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,030
starts to heal,

1106
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,900
the sooner you all can

1107
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,900
look forward to

1108
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,900
becoming a family again.

1109
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,770
Bella,

1110
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,240
it's to save him.

1111
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,540
Hi.

1112
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,980
There's something

1113
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,980
that we need

1114
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,980
to tell you. Okay?

1115
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,780
Listen, buddy, it's gonna be

1116
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,780
okay. But right now,

1117
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,780
the best thing...

1118
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,880
We think it's better

1119
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,880
if... For you to stay

1120
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,880
with the doctors.

1121
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,220
They'll help you.

1122
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,990
No, Mom!

1123
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,990
Please, I'll be better!

1124
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,230
It's okay. Just stay.

1125
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,770
I wanna go home!

1126
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,240
I wanna go home!

1127
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,240
Please, no!

1128
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,300
Dr. Marcel, Lucy's parents

1129
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,300
are still in the waiting room.

1130
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,340
You haven't told them...

1131
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,340
She should be alive.

1132
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,430
Well, it's been over an hour.

1133
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,480
They need to know that

1134
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,480
their daughter has passed.

1135
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,280
I won't speak to them until

1136
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,280
I can explain how she died,

1137
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,190
why I couldn't save her.

1138
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,200
Can you give me some light?

1139
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,860
Right here.

1140
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,400
Every other injury was either

1141
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,400
a tear or a rip in the skin.

1142
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,970
This one's a hole.

1143
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,680
Something embedded inside.

1144
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,980
More shrapnel

1145
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,980
from the windshield?

1146
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,810
Doesn't really

1147
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,810
feel like glass.

1148
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,510
Can you swing that

1149
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,510
X-ray machine around?

1150
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,260
Go ahead.

1151
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,540
That's a bullet.

1152
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,170
Lucy was shot?

1153
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,610
Lucy was shot? How?

1154
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,620
She was driving

1155
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,620
down the highway,

1156
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,620
alone in the car.

1157
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,790
The steep angle of entry

1158
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,790
shows that the bullet

1159
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,790
struck from above

1160
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,920
and lodged

1161
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,920
into Lucy's pelvis.

1162
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,760
It severed

1163
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,760
her external iliac artery.

1164
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,200
Shot from above?

1165
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,200
Yes.

1166
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,900
Now, the police

1167
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,900
will run ballistics.

1168
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,740
But they believe,

1169
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,740
and the science backs it up,

1170
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,250
that someone, somewhere

1171
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,250
in the city, fired

1172
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,250
a gun into the air.

1173
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:52,040
And when that bullet

1174
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:52,040
came down,

1175
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:52,040
it struck Lucy.

1176
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,450
Someone? Somewhere?

1177
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,450
And now our daughter is dead?

1178
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,560
I'm so sorry.

1179
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,220
A nurse will come to

1180
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,220
take you to see Lucy.

1181
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,770
Excuse me.

1182
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,740
Hey. The additional blood work

1183
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,740
you ordered on Axel's mom.

1184
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,270
Oh, wow.

1185
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,580
This whole time,

1186
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,580
my take on Julia has been off.

1187
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,580
Way off.

1188
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:34,260
We love fun

1189
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:34,260
We're going out

1190
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:34,260
and having some

1191
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,860
We love fun

1192
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,860
You know we're gonna

1193
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,860
have a ton

1194
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,990
I've never heard

1195
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,990
that song before.

1196
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,000
We Love Fun by

1197
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,000
The Bouncing Souls.

1198
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,030
I don't know

1199
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,030
any real lullabies.

1200
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,840
Julia, all day I've been

1201
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,840
troubled by your demeanor

1202
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,880
because you didn't seem

1203
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,880
worried about Axel.

1204
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,310
But now I know

1205
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,310
you really aren't

1206
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,310
worried.

1207
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,840
And I suspect you've never

1208
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,840
felt anxious, depressed

1209
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,620
or even afraid

1210
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,620
your entire life,

1211
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,620
have you?

1212
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,820
No, not really.

1213
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,520
Same goes for

1214
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,520
physical pain,

1215
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,520
doesn't it?

1216
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,370
Kind of feels like this is

1217
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,370
a trick question or something.

1218
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,840
No. Okay. So,

1219
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,840
when I had my son,

1220
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,840
labor was a beast.

1221
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:23,210
Intense pressure, cramps,

1222
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:23,210
spasms. But you didn't feel

1223
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:23,210
any of that, did you?

1224
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,800
Nope, whole thing

1225
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,800
just kind of tingled.

1226
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,350
But I've always had

1227
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,350
an extremely

1228
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,350
high pain tolerance.

1229
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,250
I know. There's something

1230
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,250
wrong with me, right?

1231
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,910
My friends have been

1232
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,910
saying it forever.

1233
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,420
Wait, is there something

1234
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,420
wrong with me?

1235
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,830
No. No. But there

1236
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,830
is something

1237
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,830
missing from you.

1238
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,490
So, we all have what's called

1239
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,490
a FAAHP1 pseudogene.

1240
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,060
Your preliminary blood work

1241
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,060
shows that you have

1242
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,060
a rare microdeletion

1243
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,900
which affects

1244
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,900
your insensitivity

1245
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,900
to pain.

1246
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,540
When I was a kid, my dad would

1247
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,540
say everyone else were wimps,

1248
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:57,870
that we were a hardy breed,

1249
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:57,870
that pain was just a word.

1250
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,040
Well, microdeletion is

1251
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,040
a genetic thing.

1252
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,410
So, it's likely that

1253
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,410
your father and other family

1254
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,410
members have it as well.

1255
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,780
Julia?

1256
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,530
What's wrong?

1257
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,460
I passed Axel

1258
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,460
the gene for Crohn's,

1259
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,940
but not the one

1260
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,940
so he won't be tortured by it.

1261
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,070
And if I didn't know

1262
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,070
when I hurt myself,

1263
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,470
I wouldn't have known

1264
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,470
when I hurt my son.

1265
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,410
I probably made the bath

1266
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,410
too hot, didn't dress him

1267
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,410
warm enough...

1268
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,470
Hey, you knew

1269
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,470
it wasn't colic.

1270
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,780
You knew to bring your son

1271
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,780
into the ED.

1272
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,320
You may not feel

1273
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,320
everything he feels,

1274
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,120
but you're his mother, you'll

1275
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,120
always know what he needs.

1276
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,070
Uh, keep going.

1277
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,070
Grab her husband,

1278
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,070
I'll meet you in Recovery.

1279
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Wonderful.

1280
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
You're still here.

1281
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,970
Is Chloe okay?

1282
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,570
Yeah. She's fine.

1283
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,570
Operation was flawless.

1284
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:12,910
This time.

1285
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,250
How about you and I keep

1286
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,250
our distance from one another?

1287
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,120
Yeah, fine. Just as soon as

1288
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,120
you stop treating patients,

1289
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,490
and seek treatment

1290
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,490
for your addiction.

1291
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,860
Screw you, Halstead.

1292
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,360
In that case,

1293
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,360
I'm going to submit a letter

1294
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,930
to the hospital's

1295
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,930
Chief Medical Officer,

1296
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,430
and that decision

1297
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,430
will be made for you.

1298
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,870
That's a stupid idea.

1299
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,440
You out me,

1300
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,440
I out your own involvement

1301
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,000
in a not-quite-legal

1302
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,000
injection site.

1303
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,440
So if I go down,

1304
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,440
so do you.

1305
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,380
So if you wanna report me,

1306
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,710
have at it, cowboy.

1307
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,230
Hey.

1308
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,850
Heard you had

1309
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,850
a rough one today.

1310
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,850
You all right?

1311
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,460
Yeah. Little boy and his mom,

1312
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,460
your ESP pan out?

1313
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,670
Not even close.

1314
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,870
I'll see you tomorrow.

1315
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,000
Night.

1316
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,550
Hey.

1317
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,660
Today sucked.

1318
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,770
Yes, it did.

1319
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:39,500
We just don't have

1320
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:39,500
enough psychiatric

1321
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:39,500
resources for kids.

1322
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,730
And unfortunately, the Shaws

1323
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,780
won't be the last family

1324
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,780
to face a lockout.

1325
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,750
But Jamie will get

1326
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,750
the help he needs.

1327
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,010
And that's a good thing.

1328
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,570
Hey, buddy.

1329
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,570
Come on, let's go.
