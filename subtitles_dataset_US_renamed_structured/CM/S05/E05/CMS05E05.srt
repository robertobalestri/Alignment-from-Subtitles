1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,230
Maggie?

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,230
I need to take a minute.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,070
<i>Don't you feel</i>

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,070
<i>worn down from your chemo?</i>

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,400
If you don't want us

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,400
to treat you medically,

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,770
then you're getting help.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,340
That Crockett guy,

9
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,340
what's the deal with him?

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,710
<i>Not sure he's my speed.</i>

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,010
Strikes me as someone

12
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,010
who doesn't take

13
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,010
things seriously.

14
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,520
We told your supervisor

15
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,520
we didn't want you

16
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,520
treating our daughter.

17
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,210
I just need to

18
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,210
check one last thing.

19
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,210
Dr. Manning?

20
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,790
I'm gonna want to

21
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,790
oversee all your cases,

22
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,830
until we know your TBI

23
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,830
isn't adversely affecting

24
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,830
your patients.

25
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,360
You don't have

26
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,360
the authority.

27
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,730
It's for your

28
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,730
own protection.

29
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,400
I'll go

30
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,400
talk to her.

31
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,830
I know, I know, I'm late.

32
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,810
It was hard getting out

33
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,810
of the house this morning.

34
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,970
You sleep okay?

35
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,810
I got a full eight hours.

36
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,810
I had breakfast.

37
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,040
I don't have a headache.

38
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,040
I feel great.

39
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,710
Toddler in

40
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,710
Treatment Six.

41
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,450
Nanny brought him in.

42
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,450
Parents just got here.

43
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,720
A bloody nose?

44
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,420
I'll do the intake

45
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,420
and then pass it

46
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,420
off to Terry.

47
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,430
This has med student

48
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,430
written all over it.

49
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,560
I don't know.

50
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,390
Lanik wants you

51
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,390
to take it.

52
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,530
But I've got pediatric

53
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,530
charts to follow up on

54
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,530
from the night shift.

55
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,470
I'll take care of them.

56
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,470
Are you kidding?

57
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,200
I was late

58
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,200
because traffic sucked,

59
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,200
not because of my TBI.

60
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,040
That's not my decision.

61
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,470
I am fine.

62
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,240
Natalie.

63
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,050
Thank you.

64
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,260
What?

65
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,390
The wink wasn't

66
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,390
exactly natural.

67
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,870
I was trying to

68
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,870
match your sexy.

69
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,270
Just keep being you.

70
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,770
You catch any of that?

71
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,450
You mean you

72
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,450
ogling my sister

73
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,780
like she put

74
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,780
the gris-gris on you?

75
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,150
Yeah.

76
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,150
Yes,

77
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,690
it's now burned

78
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,690
into my retinas.

79
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,810
Sorry.

80
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,180
"Gris-gris"?

81
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,320
It's a voodoo thing,

82
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,980
means you're

83
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,980
under the spell.

84
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,490
At least I think it does.

85
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,490
Dr. Marcel drops a lot

86
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,490
of Cajun nuggets.

87
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,260
You're starting

88
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,260
your surgical

89
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,260
residency with him,

90
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,890
not prepping

91
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,890
for Mardi Gras.

92
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,330
Speaking of,

93
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,330
how's it going?

94
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,300
It's intense.

95
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,300
I mean, one minute

96
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,300
I'm cracking

97
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,300
open a chest,

98
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,970
the next I'm digging

99
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,970
through a belly.

100
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,800
Just remember there's

101
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,800
an actual person

102
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,800
on that table,

103
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,930
not just a body.

104
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,070
Of course.

105
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,710
Dr. Choi.

106
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,450
Good morning to you.

107
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,450
Dr. Sexton,

108
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,450
right on time.

109
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,680
Let's go.

110
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,680
Cool.

111
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,380
Hey, hey there,

112
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,380
Ms. April.

113
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,090
Good morning, Dr. Marcel.

114
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,120
Did Noah say

115
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,120
anything to you

116
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,630
about working

117
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,630
with Dr. Marcel?

118
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,660
Just that

119
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,660
he's keeping him

120
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,660
really busy,

121
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,130
which I figure

122
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,130
is a good thing.

123
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,190
Yeah.

124
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,500
You know, I got

125
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,500
a question for you.

126
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,500
What?

127
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,870
Why are

128
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,870
you so damn sexy?

129
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,990
Stop it! Stop...

130
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,300
How you gonna be

131
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,300
talking nasty in the

132
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,300
middle of the hospital!

133
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm not nasty.

134
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,400
She's nasty,

135
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,700
trust me.

136
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,330
Well, you two

137
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,330
look happy.

138
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,880
I'm here with my man.

139
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,880
What's not to

140
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,880
be happy about?

141
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,170
Where are you off to?

142
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,940
You know,

143
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,940
I've been doing that

144
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,940
volunteer upstairs.

145
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,810
So we gonna go

146
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,810
grab a cup of coffee

147
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,980
and then he's gonna

148
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,980
walk me

149
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,980
upstairs afterwards.

150
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,390
Wait a minute.

151
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,390
You should join us.

152
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,150
Honey, I'm so sorry,

153
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,150
it's the ED.

154
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,150
I gotta skip coffee.

155
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,330
Okay.

156
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,330
What, well you do,

157
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,330
but we don't.

158
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,220
Uh, sorry, I have

159
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,220
a staff meeting

160
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,220
in 20 minutes.

161
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,130
Well, then, we gotta

162
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,130
drink fast then, right?

163
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,330
Come on,

164
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,330
give me some.

165
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,530
I love you.

166
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,530
I'll see you later.

167
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,660
I love you, too.

168
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,200
I love you, too,

169
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,200
but in a different way.

170
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,500
Whatever.

171
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,080
So, Carl, how long

172
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,080
has the pain and nausea

173
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,080
been bothering you?

174
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,810
Kind of lost track.

175
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,810
Let's just say, years.

176
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,940
So it comes and goes?

177
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,350
No, it came

178
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,350
and never left.

179
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,650
I've learned

180
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,650
how to cope.

181
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,950
But some days,

182
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,950
I just can't look

183
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,950
the other way.

184
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,660
Yeah... Yeah,

185
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,660
today's one of them.

186
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,020
Actually, this is the

187
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,020
worst it's ever been.

188
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,760
Vitals are normal.

189
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,760
Afebrile.

190
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,030
Is this the first time

191
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,030
you've seen

192
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,030
a doctor for it?

193
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,970
Here in Chicago.

194
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,970
I'm from

195
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,970
Tennessee, though.

196
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,300
I was a regular

197
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,300
at the Westwood

198
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,300
Regional ED.

199
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,840
Pretty sure every

200
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,840
doc there poked,

201
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,840
prodded and scanned me.

202
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,970
I'll have them

203
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,970
forward his records.

204
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,020
Did Westwood Regional

205
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,020
make a diagnosis?

206
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,310
No, they had

207
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,310
a lot of theories.

208
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,310
IBS, IBS-C, ulcer.

209
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,510
One doc thought I had

210
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,510
an eating disorder.

211
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,190
Believe me, I would pile on

212
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,190
the pounds if I could,

213
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,990
but eating sends me

214
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,990
right to the bathroom.

215
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,190
Vomiting?

216
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,190
Most of the time.

217
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,660
I just can't believe

218
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,660
this is what

219
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,660
I've been reduced to.

220
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,260
I'm 26.

221
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,860
I should've

222
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,860
graduated college,

223
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,860
met someone special.

224
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,670
Instead, my life

225
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,670
is making sure

226
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,540
I always know where

227
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,540
the nearest bathroom is.

228
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,830
We'll figure this out.

229
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,910
Mo, let's get a chest X-ray,

230
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,910
KUB, CBC, CMP and a UA.

231
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,910
Mmm-hmm.

232
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,840
I know you've seen

233
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,840
a lot of doctors for this.

234
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,470
I'll do my best

235
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,470
to be the last one.

236
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,820
Here you go...

237
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,820
Good morning,

238
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,820
I'm Dr. Manning.

239
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,550
See?

240
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,550
I'm Kyle. This is

241
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,550
my wife, Janet.

242
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,990
Hi.

243
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,990
And the little

244
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,990
guy is Lucas.

245
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,420
Hey, Lucas...

246
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,720
Hi.

247
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,520
Peekaboo.

248
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,520
Peekaboo.

249
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,230
Well, he seems happy.

250
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,230
That's a good start.

251
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,530
I see the bloody

252
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,530
nose has stopped.

253
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,830
Can you tell me

254
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,830
what happened?

255
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,100
He was at the park

256
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,100
with his nanny

257
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,100
and it just started gushing.

258
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,700
And she couldn't

259
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,700
reach either of us,

260
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,600
so since they were

261
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,600
around the corner,

262
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,730
she brought him here.

263
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,210
I have a three-year-old

264
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,210
and a nanny, I get it.

265
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,540
All right.

266
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,050
Yeah, the nosebleeds

267
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,050
aren't a new thing.

268
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,880
We've been dealing

269
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,880
with them all summer.

270
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,350
Can I see

271
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,350
your nose?

272
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,380
Turbinates are swollen

273
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,380
and irritated.

274
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,580
Seasonal allergies?

275
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,580
Oh, yeah.

276
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,420
They've been brutal for

277
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,420
all of us this year.

278
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,520
For Lucas, it's nosebleeds

279
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,520
and this rash on his arm.

280
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,390
Oh, yeah, and

281
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,390
that little cough.

282
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,860
Hey, buddy. Can you

283
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,860
open your mouth for me?

284
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,200
Real wide,

285
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,200
like this... Aah!

286
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,870
Good, good, good.

287
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,870
I am seeing evidence

288
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,870
of post nasal drip.

289
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,240
That's likely what's

290
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,240
causing the cough.

291
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,370
Is it worse at night?

292
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,370
It was.

293
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,140
But then we put an atomizer

294
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,140
with eucalyptus oil

295
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,140
by his crib.

296
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,370
It's helped a lot.

297
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,040
Let's take a look.

298
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,250
All right,

299
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,250
let's see.

300
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,280
He's a little wheezy.

301
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,280
Any fever?

302
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,550
Yeah. He felt

303
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,550
a little warm yesterday

304
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,550
morning. He...

305
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,260
He was fussy

306
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,260
at breakfast,

307
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,420
but by lunch,

308
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,420
and ever since then,

309
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,400
he's been a bundle

310
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,400
of energy.

311
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,400
Good.

312
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,300
Is this the rash

313
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,300
you mentioned?

314
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,300
Yes.

315
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,270
Have you been using

316
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,270
a topical hydrocortisone

317
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,270
cream on it?

318
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,470
No. I've been mashing

319
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,470
up a chewable fish oil

320
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,470
tablet in his yogurt.

321
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,580
Oh, okay.

322
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,580
Well, if it's working.

323
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,310
All evidence is pointing

324
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,980
towards allergies and

325
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,980
an overcautious nanny.

326
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,460
But since Lucas may have

327
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,460
had a fever yesterday,

328
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,290
I would like to do

329
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,290
some blood tests.

330
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,020
Is something wrong?

331
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,120
We just have adopted

332
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,120
a naturopathic approach

333
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,120
to our health care.

334
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,690
Look, the thing

335
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,690
with blood tests is,

336
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,640
they will not introduce

337
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,640
anything new into

338
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,640
Lucas' system.

339
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,040
They'll just show us

340
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,040
if something's there

341
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,040
that shouldn't be.

342
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,370
Yeah. Okay.

343
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,370
Go ahead.

344
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,310
Great. I'll send

345
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,310
a nurse in.

346
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,810
Maggie? Doris said

347
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,810
you were looking for me.

348
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,790
Yes. I've got

349
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,790
an appointment

350
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,790
this afternoon.

351
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,050
I need you to take over

352
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,050
for me while I'm gone.

353
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,220
No problem.

354
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,380
What time

355
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,380
will you be back?

356
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,520
I won't.

357
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,790
Okay.

358
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,560
Guess that's all

359
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,560
I need to know.

360
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,060
Monique,

361
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,060
what am I missing?

362
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,700
These last few weeks

363
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,700
Maggie's been

364
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,700
so short with me.

365
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,830
It's not just you.

366
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,240
The other day I saw her

367
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,240
sneak into an open

368
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,240
treatment room and lie down.

369
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,400
So I asked her if she was

370
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,400
feeling okay and she

371
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,400
bit my head off.

372
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,740
Huh.

373
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,310
I'm elbow-deep

374
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,310
in this guy's belly,

375
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,310
and it was a big belly.

376
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,650
Highly doubtful

377
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,650
this fellow ever

378
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,650
skipped a meal.

379
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,220
No, not surgical.

380
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,020
So I go to sew up

381
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,020
a hole in the small

382
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,020
bowel and, bam!

383
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,060
Out pops

384
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,060
this critter.

385
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,930
No lie, this thing

386
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,930
looked straight at me,

387
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,160
dropped back

388
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,160
into the bowel,

389
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,160
disappeared.

390
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,110
What the hell?

391
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,110
What was it?

392
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,530
A tapeworm.

393
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,940
The biggest one

394
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,940
I've ever seen.

395
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,440
Only one I ever seen.

396
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,040
Uh, also, not surgical.

397
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,840
So what did you do?

398
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,040
Went after it.

399
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,080
I stuck ringed forceps

400
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,080
into that bowel and I

401
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,080
yanked that old worm out.

402
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,280
All three feet

403
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,280
of him.

404
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,620
Then I sent him

405
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,620
off to pathology

406
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,620
and finished the case.

407
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,730
If Dr. Marcel's

408
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,730
taking Noah under his wing,

409
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,760
he should teach more

410
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,760
and brag less.

411
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,290
Yeah, his style's

412
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,290
just different

413
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,290
than yours.

414
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,770
That's probably why

415
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,770
you don't like it.

416
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,200
Come on, you buy

417
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,200
that tapeworm story?

418
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,440
Come on,

419
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,440
Dr. Marcel may be

420
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,440
a personality,

421
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,310
but he's a good

422
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,310
surgeon.

423
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,250
Carl's labs and

424
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,250
X-rays are back.

425
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,050
What about his

426
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,050
medical records from

427
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,050
his previous hospital?

428
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,250
Still working on it.

429
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,250
Seems Westwood

430
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,250
Regional went bankrupt.

431
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,060
I've got a call into

432
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,060
the company appointed

433
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,060
to handle patient affairs.

434
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,150
Thanks, Mo.

435
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,150
Mmm-hmm.

436
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,130
Uh-oh.

437
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,130
You look concerned.

438
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,570
Your white cell count

439
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,570
is high.

440
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,070
X-ray showed dilated loops

441
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,070
of bowel and your overall

442
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,070
blood count is low.

443
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,900
Means more

444
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,900
tests, right?

445
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,340
Yeah.

446
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,340
So what's next?

447
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,940
A CT angiogram

448
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,940
of your blood vessels

449
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,910
and a CT with contrast

450
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,910
for your bowel.

451
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,280
Did you ever have

452
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,280
either of these

453
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,280
tests before?

454
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,750
Angiogram...

455
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,750
I don't know,

456
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,750
maybe.

457
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,420
The CT with contrast,

458
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,420
is that the scan you

459
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,420
drink something first?

460
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,130
Ugh. Then I've had

461
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,130
one of them. Didn't like

462
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,130
that drink at all.

463
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,190
Well, unfortunately,

464
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,190
it hasn't gotten

465
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,190
any better.

466
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,830
Sorry, man. I'll go

467
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,830
put in the order.

468
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,130
Thanks.

469
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,340
Hey, so in T Four...

470
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,540
...something worth

471
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,540
looking into.

472
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,680
Mmm-hmm.

473
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,120
Don't forget.

474
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,120
Don't forget.

475
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,120
Don't forget.

476
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,530
Don't forget legal research

477
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,530
regarding contractor's

478
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,530
negligence for the complaint.

479
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,960
Issue. Rule.

480
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,960
Eunice Kim, 25.

481
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,130
First year associate

482
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,130
at some big time law firm.

483
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,230
Anyway, her roommate

484
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,230
called us

485
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,240
when the ranting and

486
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,240
the pacing started to

487
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,240
annoy the neighbors.

488
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,240
She say anything about

489
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,240
the last time she slept?

490
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,070
Yeah, been

491
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,070
at least two days.

492
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,880
When we showed up,

493
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,880
she was screaming

494
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,880
at herself in the mirror.

495
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,710
We tried to calm

496
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,710
her, but...

497
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,710
Yeah.

498
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,580
She wasn't having

499
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,580
any of that.

500
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,580
Yeah.

501
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,090
Find any drugs

502
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,090
in the apartment?

503
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,710
Nope. Tons of books,

504
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,710
nothing sketchy.

505
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,250
Charges pending?

506
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,390
Figured you could help

507
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,390
more than lock-up.

508
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,550
I appreciate it.

509
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,590
Hey, let's get some

510
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,590
M-tabs for Eunice.

511
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,230
Don't forget.

512
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,230
Don't forget! Don't forget.

513
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,390
Eunice, how you doing?

514
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,390
Get legal research...

515
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,770
I'm Dr. Charles.

516
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,770
...regarding contractor's

517
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,770
negligence.

518
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,910
IRAC. Issue. Rule. IRAC.

519
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,910
Eunice?

520
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,570
IRAC. IRAC.

521
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,570
Eunice!

522
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,580
Hey! How you doing?

523
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,580
I'm Dr. Charles.

524
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,740
You think we could maybe

525
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,740
sit and talk a bit?

526
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,040
Only a moment, I don't have

527
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,040
anything more to spare.

528
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,410
I got it.

529
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,410
A motion to strike

530
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,410
the affirmative defense.

531
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,680
Eunice...

532
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,680
Wait, can't do that

533
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,950
because there is

534
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,950
a genuine issue

535
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,950
of material fact.

536
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,180
Gotta do discovery...

537
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,180
Eunice!

538
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,450
I can see you're under

539
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,450
a whole lot of pressure.

540
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,120
I'd like to give you

541
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,120
some medicine to help

542
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,120
you calm down a bit,

543
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,930
you know, maybe

544
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,930
think more clearly.

545
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,300
Think more clearly.

546
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,300
Yeah.

547
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,470
That might help.

548
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,470
Okay.

549
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,590
I need

550
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,590
to organize.

551
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,960
Yeah.

552
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,470
I don't know where I am.

553
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,730
You're in

554
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,730
a safe place, Eunice.

555
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,980
What's going on?

556
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,980
He's losing it.

557
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,460
I need to get out!

558
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,460
How much longer

559
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,460
till we get the scan?

560
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,430
Twenty seconds.

561
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,430
Two milligrams

562
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,430
of midazolam.

563
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,290
Carl, it's Dr. Choi.

564
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,290
We're almost done.

565
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,630
I'm gonna be sick.

566
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,790
Slow breaths.

567
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,790
Only ten more seconds.

568
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,770
I'm not gonna make it.

569
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,570
Yes, you can.

570
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,570
You can do this, Carl.

571
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,840
Five seconds.

572
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,840
Four, three,

573
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,410
two, one. You good?

574
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,640
Get him out.

575
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,640
Get him out.

576
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,640
Get him out.

577
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,810
You did it, Carl.

578
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,780
Good job, buddy.

579
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,410
It's over.

580
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,150
Good job.

581
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,520
I'm sorry.

582
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,520
It's okay, hey.

583
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,990
It's all right.

584
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,500
Good job, man.

585
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,270
I mean, that's not

586
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,270
a normal calf, right?

587
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,440
Yeah, it's swollen.

588
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,840
And you

589
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,840
didn't injure it?

590
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,840
Nope. Nothing.

591
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,180
I went to bed,

592
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,180
it was fine. Woke up,

593
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,180
thing's a grapefruit.

594
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,460
Press against my hand.

595
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,460
One to ten,

596
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,460
how bad's the pain?

597
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,280
I'd say a seven,

598
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,280
maybe an eight.

599
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,350
That's in line with what

600
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,350
I'm thinking. Blood clot.

601
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,990
It's called a DVT,

602
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,990
deep vein thrombosis.

603
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,290
Seriously? Me?

604
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,800
I exercise a few times

605
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,800
a week. I don't sit

606
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,800
for long periods of time.

607
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,340
Yeah, unfortunately,

608
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,340
not fitting the profile

609
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,900
doesn't mean you

610
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,900
can't develop one.

611
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,880
Beating the odds.

612
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,880
Lucky me.

613
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,410
CBC, BMP, protein C, S

614
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,410
and Factor V Leiden.

615
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,490
Let's get Mr. Bowe a DVT scan

616
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,490
and put him on a heparin drip.

617
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,550
I'll check on you in a bit.

618
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,380
Dr. Halstead,

619
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,380
before you leave,

620
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,420
can you grab my phone?

621
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,750
Front pocket of my jeans.

622
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,160
Sure.

623
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,490
I kept the swollen

624
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,490
calf under wraps

625
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,930
'cause I didn't want

626
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,930
my fiancée to freak out.

627
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,700
But I think we're to the point

628
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,700
where I'd better let her

629
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,700
know what's going on.

630
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,830
Got you.

631
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,840
Oh, man.

632
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,410
That's one

633
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,410
angry belly.

634
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,440
What's going on?

635
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,690
Surgical consult.

636
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,690
I didn't call for one.

637
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,180
It was only

638
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,180
a matter of time.

639
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,280
Good find, Noah.

640
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,620
Dr. Marcel, Dr. Sexton,

641
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,620
can I speak

642
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,620
with you outside?

643
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,390
All this stalking

644
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,390
around the ED,

645
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,390
peeking in on patients.

646
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,300
You hanging outside

647
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,300
Carl's room earlier,

648
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,800
you were sniffing

649
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,800
for surgical cases.

650
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,270
And Noah's your intern.

651
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,470
Best you could

652
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,470
do is show him

653
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,470
how to poach patients?

654
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,910
Whoa. Poaching

655
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,910
implies stealing.

656
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,810
Hardly think that

657
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,810
applies in Carl's case,

658
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,940
seeing as how you were

659
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,940
gonna call us anyway.

660
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,710
Possibly.

661
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,710
Possibly?

662
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,140
Dr. Choi, Carl's belly

663
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,140
was so hot it nearly

664
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,140
burned my hands.

665
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,450
There's an issue

666
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,450
in there that requires

667
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,450
surgical attention.

668
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,120
Or do my hands

669
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,120
deceive me?

670
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,830
No. CT showed a partial

671
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,830
small bowel obstruction

672
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,330
with a likely

673
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,330
transition point.

674
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,670
So it is surgical.

675
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,670
Possibly.

676
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,460
The CT imagery is poor

677
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,460
because Carl was agitated

678
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,460
during the scan.

679
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,560
I'm not comfortable

680
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,560
making any treatment

681
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,560
decisions

682
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,170
before I know

683
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,170
exactly what's causing

684
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,170
the obstruction.

685
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,810
So I'm ordering an MRI.

686
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,910
Pending the results,

687
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,850
I'll let you know

688
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,850
if a surgical consult

689
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,850
is needed.

690
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,240
Okay.

691
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,740
I apologize

692
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,740
for overstepping.

693
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,990
Protocol, etiquette,

694
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,250
they mean something.

695
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,320
I'll do better at

696
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,320
remembering that.

697
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,660
Okay.

698
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,210
Doris, any word from

699
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,210
the lab on Lucas' tests?

700
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,870
Not yet. Word's out your

701
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,870
case screams allergies.

702
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,510
It's probably

703
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,510
last in line.

704
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,040
Maggie?

705
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,710
Yeah.

706
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,710
There are patients

707
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,710
waiting to be seen

708
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,880
and I have absolutely

709
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,880
nothing going on.

710
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,050
Light case load.

711
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,050
Lanik was very clear.

712
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,390
This is ridiculous.

713
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,480
Then talk to Lanik

714
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,480
and stop bugging me.

715
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,800
Because you're giving me

716
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,800
one more headache

717
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,800
that I don't need.

718
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,120
Okay.

719
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,400
Look, I'm sorry.

720
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,800
I've somewhere to be

721
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,800
and I can't be late.

722
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,730
April, I'm leaving.

723
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,640
Eunice, how you doing?

724
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,250
I'm happy

725
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,250
to see that, um,

726
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,480
you seem to be

727
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,480
a little better.

728
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,320
Embarrassed

729
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,320
is more like it.

730
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,850
It's all a blur,

731
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,850
but I know I wasn't

732
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,260
myself.

733
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,330
I understand how...

734
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,330
How scary that can feel.

735
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,000
It can't happen again.

736
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,840
Now on, no matter

737
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,840
how busy I am,

738
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,840
I'll make time for sleep.

739
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,670
I mean, sleep is crucial.

740
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,110
But counseling, medication,

741
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,110
other lifestyle changes

742
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,870
are all things that

743
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,870
we need to talk about.

744
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,610
Little extreme, no?

745
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,220
I mean, I had

746
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,220
a panic attack,

747
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,220
not a nervous breakdown.

748
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,450
It wasn't

749
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,450
a panic attack.

750
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,850
I'm quite sure that

751
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,850
you were experiencing

752
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,850
a manic episode, Eunice,

753
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,020
symptomatic of

754
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,020
bipolar disorder.

755
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,560
No, no, no...

756
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,460
I can't have bipolar.

757
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,230
I have $300,000

758
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,740
in student loans

759
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,740
and my salary doesn't

760
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,740
even make a dent.

761
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,470
I need to make partner.

762
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,940
Takes most lawyers

763
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,940
five years,

764
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,570
I'm on track

765
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,570
to do it in three.

766
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,470
Can't you just give me

767
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,470
more of that medication?

768
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,910
Or something else?

769
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,710
Well, thing is,

770
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,710
bipolar disorder doesn't

771
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,710
really work that way.

772
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,220
Unless you address it

773
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,220
comprehensively,

774
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,590
the manic episodes

775
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,590
will likely return.

776
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,950
They'll increase in intensity

777
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,950
and can even be followed

778
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,320
by cycles of depression...

779
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,320
But I know the signs now.

780
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,920
I can get out in front

781
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,920
of it if I start

782
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,920
to feel off, control it.

783
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,560
I don't think anybody

784
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,560
can control this.

785
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,460
You know,

786
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,460
not even somebody

787
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,460
as determined as you.

788
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,960
But, Eunice,

789
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,960
you can absolutely

790
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,960
learn how to manage it.

791
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,270
Why don't you

792
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,270
let me admit you

793
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,110
and let's start looking

794
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,110
for a stable medication?

795
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,170
No. I'd like

796
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,170
to be discharged.

797
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,680
Today's not

798
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,680
a wash yet.

799
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,940
I can still put in

800
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,940
some face time

801
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,940
at the firm.

802
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,420
Look, I know the criteria

803
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,420
for involuntary commitment.

804
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,250
Legally, you can't

805
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,250
keep me here.

806
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,200
Does the furrow

807
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,200
of your brow

808
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,830
suggest a surgical

809
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,830
consult is now needed?

810
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,710
MRI revealed

811
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,710
a focal solitary mass

812
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,710
in the distal pancreas.

813
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,610
May be a cyst.

814
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,610
I concur.

815
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,550
Gotta assume it's

816
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,550
what's riling Carl's

817
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,550
belly up so fiercely.

818
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,710
He needs a distal

819
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,710
pancreatectomy.

820
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,290
You take out the section

821
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,290
of the pancreas

822
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,290
housing the mass,

823
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,830
no more

824
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,830
chaos downstream.

825
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,450
That is a huge

826
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,450
procedure.

827
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,500
Not to mention, it won't

828
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,500
do a thing for Carl if

829
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,500
the mass isn't the issue.

830
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,720
If the mass

831
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,720
isn't the problem,

832
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,860
then what are

833
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,860
we looking at?

834
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,560
Carl's been

835
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,560
suffering for years.

836
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,360
The mass could have

837
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,360
been there the whole

838
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,360
time, unchanged,

839
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,170
which means it's

840
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,170
likely not a factor.

841
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,640
Or the mass has been

842
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,640
growing over time.

843
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,640
We leave it in,

844
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,640
the inflammation worsens,

845
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,080
the bowel

846
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,080
completely obstructs,

847
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,150
then perforates

848
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,150
and Carl becomes septic.

849
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,210
The first step of that

850
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,210
potentially fatal

851
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,210
catastrophe is a fever,

852
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,980
which, by the

853
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,980
looks of him,

854
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,850
has set in.

855
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,720
100.6.

856
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,430
But holding.

857
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,430
Yeah, for now.

858
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,860
You operate

859
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,860
on his pancreas

860
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,860
and you're wrong,

861
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,160
it does way more

862
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,160
harm than good.

863
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,560
But if I'm correct,

864
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,560
he lives.

865
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,690
And I don't like if's.

866
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,100
Carl will be treated

867
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,100
medicinally until his

868
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,100
previous scans arrive

869
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,360
and I can compare them

870
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,360
against today's MRI.

871
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,010
That's gonna

872
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,010
be a problem.

873
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,900
His medical records from

874
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,900
Westwood Regional are

875
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,900
being held hostage.

876
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,250
This is a mess.

877
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,260
You know, Westwood

878
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,260
Regional's bankruptcy

879
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,190
has created the

880
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,190
legal equivalent

881
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,190
of a battle royale.

882
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,590
MRS. Medical

883
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,590
Record Services.

884
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,630
I'm assuming they control

885
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,630
Westwood's patient charts?

886
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,630
Correct. It's MRS

887
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,630
that have

888
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,630
the files on lockdown,

889
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,640
they're actually

890
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,640
threatening

891
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,640
to destroy them.

892
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,730
My main concern

893
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,730
right now is Carl.

894
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,140
My opinion

895
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,140
is not changed.

896
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,310
His distal pancreas

897
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,310
is wreaking havoc and

898
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,310
it needs to come out.

899
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,900
Without Carl's previous scans,

900
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,900
which it's clear

901
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,900
we're not gonna get,

902
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,210
you can't prove

903
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,210
that's the fix.

904
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,370
No, I cannot.

905
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,370
Then you shouldn't operate.

906
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,050
The pancreas is

907
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,050
the most unforgiving

908
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,050
organ in the body.

909
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,490
The potential for

910
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,490
surgical complications

911
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,490
is through the roof.

912
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,580
True. But God

913
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,580
only gave us

914
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,580
so many heartbeats.

915
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,290
No sense in Carl

916
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,290
running out

917
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,290
of his early.

918
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,560
Excuse me?

919
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,560
Is there something

920
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,560
going on here

921
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,820
that I should

922
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,820
know about?

923
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,090
Nothing

924
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,090
I'm aware of.

925
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,460
Dr. Choi?

926
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,730
Then give me

927
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,730
recommendations.

928
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,600
Let me operate now

929
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,470
before his bowel perforates

930
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,470
and it's too late.

931
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,450
Ms. Goodwin,

932
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,450
it's a risky procedure

933
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,450
that may be unnecessary.

934
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,280
Let me admit Carl

935
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,280
for more tests.

936
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,250
Hon?

937
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,250
Hi.

938
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,450
I'm sorry, the lab took

939
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,450
longer than expected.

940
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,420
So, Lucas' BUN, creatinine

941
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,420
and white cell count

942
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,420
are all elevated.

943
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,090
That suggests

944
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,090
dehydration.

945
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,790
And between

946
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,790
the white cell count,

947
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,130
his persistent cough

948
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,130
and the post nasal drip,

949
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,460
it's likely a bacterial

950
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,460
sinus infection.

951
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,870
Okay. Thanks,

952
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,870
Dr. Manning.

953
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,870
Yeah.

954
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,000
So, what do you think?

955
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,870
We could make popsicles

956
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,870
from coconut water.

957
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,950
That should help

958
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,950
with the dehydration.

959
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,280
Yeah, maybe add an

960
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,280
herbal antihistamine, too.

961
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,820
I can pick up some

962
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,820
powdered quercetin

963
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,820
at the farmer's market.

964
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,940
Great.

965
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,490
I'm sorry, perhaps

966
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,490
a more immediate

967
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,490
treatment...

968
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,120
You mean antibiotics?

969
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,120
No. Not after last time.

970
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,160
Lucas had an ear

971
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,160
infection last year.

972
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,220
The doctor prescribed

973
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,220
amoxicillin.

974
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,800
One dose and

975
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,800
he broke out in

976
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,800
hives everywhere.

977
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,830
I mean,

978
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,830
his recovery

979
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,830
from the antibiotic

980
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,330
was worse than

981
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,330
the ear infection.

982
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,460
And since then,

983
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,230
if there are natural

984
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,230
options without

985
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,230
side effects,

986
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,460
we try those first.

987
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,670
Look, like you two,

988
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,670
my son's health comes

989
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,670
before anything else.

990
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,240
But, you know, sometimes

991
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,240
there's just some things

992
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,340
that a holistic approach

993
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,340
alone won't cure.

994
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,180
We agree. A sinus

995
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,180
infection isn't one

996
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,180
of them, though.

997
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,310
You're right.

998
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,410
Over time, natural remedies

999
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,410
may help his immune system

1000
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,410
resolve the infection.

1001
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,920
But the dehydration...

1002
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,420
Lucas needs

1003
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,420
more than popsicles.

1004
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,490
At least let me give him

1005
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,490
an electrolyte drink.

1006
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,060
How much?

1007
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,030
Twenty-four ounces

1008
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,030
to sip throughout the day.

1009
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,870
Twenty-four ounces

1010
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,870
through a sippy cup,

1011
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,870
he won't do it.

1012
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,100
Is there another way?

1013
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,430
Saline IV.

1014
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,910
I know

1015
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,910
it's another needle,

1016
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,600
but no side effects,

1017
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,600
I promise.

1018
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,180
Saline, but no

1019
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,180
antibiotics.

1020
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,210
Understood.

1021
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,080
Thank you.

1022
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,080
Thank you.

1023
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,710
Dr. Halstead,

1024
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,950
the blood thinner,

1025
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,950
I don't think it's working.

1026
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,790
The calf's still huge

1027
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,790
and my foot's starting

1028
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,790
to swell up, too.

1029
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,360
You having

1030
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,360
trouble breathing?

1031
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,960
More like winded.

1032
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,100
I wanna send you for a CT.

1033
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,100
I gotta get a better

1034
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,100
look at that clot.

1035
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,040
This will help you

1036
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,040
breathe better.

1037
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,040
Get a hold

1038
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,040
of your fiancée?

1039
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,200
Voicemail.

1040
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,210
She's still looking

1041
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,210
at dresses.

1042
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,110
Pretty sure she's not

1043
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,110
checking her phone.

1044
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,120
So, when's the big day?

1045
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,120
Spring.

1046
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,650
Still debating locations.

1047
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,050
Well, congratulations.

1048
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,980
Techs will be

1049
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,980
by in a few.

1050
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,950
The surgery,

1051
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,950
it's your choice.

1052
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,590
Okay. All right.

1053
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,590
Thank you.

1054
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,910
So, I explained both

1055
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,910
of your positions.

1056
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,910
Philosophically,

1057
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,910
he agrees with you,

1058
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,910
Dr. Choi,

1059
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,240
preferring

1060
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,240
a conservative approach.

1061
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,610
But, realistically,

1062
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,610
he's in pain

1063
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,410
and desperate

1064
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,410
to feel better.

1065
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,180
So he chose the surgery.

1066
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,450
Dr. Marcel, Mr. Harris

1067
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,450
is now your patient.

1068
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,190
All right,

1069
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,190
let's do this.

1070
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,590
See you in the OR.

1071
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,160
This is huge.

1072
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,680
Eunice?

1073
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,010
You're right.

1074
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,020
I can't control this.

1075
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,220
I need help.

1076
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,830
Well, you're

1077
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,830
gonna get it.

1078
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,130
Come on.

1079
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,910
How long

1080
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,910
will the CT take?

1081
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,410
Just a few moments.

1082
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,410
You'll be back

1083
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,410
before you know it.

1084
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,050
Okay, because

1085
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,050
I haven't been able

1086
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,050
to reach my fiancée

1087
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,690
and my phone's at,

1088
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,690
like, 4%.

1089
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,250
I'll call her.

1090
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,060
Thanks.

1091
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,060
Yeah.

1092
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Her name's Aubrey.

1093
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Number's my

1094
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,160
emergency contact.

1095
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,560
Got it.

1096
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,370
Wait, now you think

1097
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,370
it's pneumonia?

1098
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,370
It's a possibility.

1099
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,380
We thought you

1100
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,380
were gonna tell us

1101
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,380
we could go home.

1102
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,000
I mean, Lucas

1103
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,000
isn't dehydrated

1104
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,000
anymore, right?

1105
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,670
Right, but he is still

1106
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,670
wheezing and his

1107
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,670
temperature has ticked up.

1108
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,740
The nurse said

1109
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,740
he was 99.3.

1110
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,740
Is that even a fever?

1111
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,550
He looks fine.

1112
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,550
He's up, he's active.

1113
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,860
On the outside,

1114
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,860
he may look normal,

1115
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,860
but on the inside,

1116
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,730
pneumonia is notorious

1117
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,730
for its slow progression.

1118
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,730
Or it is just

1119
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,730
a sinus infection,

1120
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,390
which you've been

1121
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,390
saying all day until,

1122
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,390
apparently, right now.

1123
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,770
Okay.

1124
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,400
How would you

1125
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,400
know for sure if

1126
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,400
it's pneumonia or not?

1127
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,060
A chest X-ray.

1128
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,230
You're kidding,

1129
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,230
right?

1130
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,370
We said no

1131
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,370
to antibiotics.

1132
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,280
We're definitely

1133
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,280
not letting you zap

1134
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,280
Lucas full of radiation.

1135
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,400
These hospitals.

1136
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,370
You scare people

1137
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,370
with diagnoses

1138
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,420
and then you sell them

1139
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,420
on treatments

1140
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,420
they don't need

1141
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,750
that actually

1142
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,750
make them sicker.

1143
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,550
Dr. Manning, we'd like

1144
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,550
to go home. Okay?

1145
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,780
If Lucas doesn't improve,

1146
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,780
we'll take him to our doctor.

1147
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,090
Your doctor?

1148
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,890
An actual MD?

1149
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,960
No. He's a holistic healer.

1150
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,590
So his answer for

1151
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,590
pneumonia's gonna

1152
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,590
be what, oil of oregano?

1153
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,830
Horseradish with lemon?

1154
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,630
Look, you don't agree

1155
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,630
with alternative

1156
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,630
medicine, fine.

1157
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,570
But don't insult us.

1158
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,570
I'm not. I'm trying

1159
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,570
to inform you.

1160
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,080
Dr. Manning?

1161
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,080
Yes.

1162
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,010
Speak with you

1163
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,010
a moment?

1164
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,940
Please excuse me.

1165
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,410
What's going on?

1166
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,480
My boy with the bloody

1167
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,480
nose, it may very well

1168
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,480
be pneumonia,

1169
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,790
but his parents

1170
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,790
won't allow me

1171
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,790
to do a chest X-ray.

1172
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,120
They would rather go home

1173
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,290
and take their chances

1174
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,290
with herbs and teas.

1175
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,660
Let me see the chart.

1176
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,670
Yeah, these symptoms,

1177
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,670
okay, pneumonia has to

1178
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,670
be on the differential.

1179
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,640
Yeah.

1180
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,640
Let me talk to them.

1181
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,930
Okay.

1182
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,500
Alone.

1183
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,380
I'm the

1184
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,380
attending physician.

1185
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,040
We don't know.

1186
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,550
These tests are the only

1187
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,550
way to provide us...

1188
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,360
Do what you need to do.

1189
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,360
Thank you

1190
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,360
for working with us.

1191
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,620
Yeah.

1192
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,990
They agreed to

1193
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,990
the chest X-ray.

1194
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,020
This is the second

1195
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,020
time this month

1196
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,300
that parents

1197
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,300
have lost faith

1198
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,300
in your judgment.

1199
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,900
They may be

1200
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,900
upset now,

1201
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,530
they won't be

1202
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,530
when I'm right.

1203
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,580
I gotta tell you,

1204
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,580
these labs, they look

1205
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,580
like a sinus infection.

1206
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,670
So you'd better be right

1207
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,670
that it's pneumonia.

1208
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,250
Hello, hello, hello.

1209
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,050
This is your last week?

1210
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,390
Oh, girlie.

1211
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,360
You're looking good!

1212
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,360
Girlfriend's a champ!

1213
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,330
You still walk

1214
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,330
around in my sweater.

1215
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,600
Thank you.

1216
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,600
That's a good catch.

1217
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,600
Maggie.

1218
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,510
Caroline.

1219
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,380
I'm so sorry,

1220
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,380
I didn't know.

1221
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,760
No one does,

1222
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,760
except for Sharon.

1223
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,050
And I'd like to keep it

1224
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,050
that way, please.

1225
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,850
Yeah.

1226
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,250
I've been there.

1227
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,260
You mind if I sit?

1228
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,100
Girl, you got a whole bag

1229
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,100
hanging. You ain't going

1230
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,100
nowhere no time quick.

1231
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,570
Okay.

1232
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,110
Come on.

1233
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,110
Come on.

1234
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,870
Come on.

1235
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,310
So, where's the badness?

1236
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,420
In my breast.

1237
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,580
And what's

1238
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,580
the prognosis?

1239
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,660
Still waiting to see

1240
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,660
how I respond

1241
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,660
to chemo stage.

1242
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,890
I've been there.

1243
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,160
Sisters in arms.

1244
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,000
So, you know this

1245
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,000
keeping a secret thing,

1246
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,000
it's not gonna...

1247
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,300
It's not gonna be

1248
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,300
that easy, right?

1249
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,170
I'm managing.

1250
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,170
Oh!

1251
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,980
That cancer's

1252
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,980
a heavy lift and I know

1253
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,980
it sounds like a cliché,

1254
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,070
but there's strength

1255
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,070
in community.

1256
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,510
And pity.

1257
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,920
Mmm-hmm.

1258
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,920
And obligation.

1259
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,410
And I don't want

1260
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,410
any of that.

1261
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,410
I hear you.

1262
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,790
And I was afraid to

1263
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,790
tell my friends, too.

1264
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,590
But once I let 'em in,

1265
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,120
I let my friends

1266
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,120
be my friends.

1267
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,500
That was a real comfort.

1268
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,840
It's time to heal

1269
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,840
with steel, Dr. Sexton.

1270
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
Incision is yours.

1271
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
What's it gonna be?

1272
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,180
Midline...

1273
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,180
Is that a question

1274
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,180
or a statement?

1275
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,510
Midline.

1276
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,880
Okay. Then what?

1277
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,350
Divide and tie off

1278
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,350
the falciform ligament.

1279
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,550
Keep going.

1280
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,690
Eviscerate the patient

1281
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,490
and find

1282
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,490
the transition point

1283
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,490
of the small bowel.

1284
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,530
I like

1285
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,530
what I'm hearing.

1286
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,530
Don't stop now.

1287
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,030
We open the lesser sack

1288
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,030
and take down

1289
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,030
the lienocolic ligament...

1290
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,900
Hey, Carl. I'm gonna

1291
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,900
take good care of you.

1292
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,030
Dr. Marcel?

1293
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,470
I'm gonna be by your side

1294
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,470
the whole time, Carl.

1295
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,970
What are you doing?

1296
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,970
Okay?

1297
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,370
This isn't

1298
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,370
an easy surgery.

1299
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,500
I'm just letting Carl know

1300
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,500
that we're gonna take

1301
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,500
special care of him.

1302
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,880
You think he can hear you?

1303
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,240
Unsure.

1304
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,870
But what the

1305
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,870
body can't hear,

1306
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,870
perhaps the soul can.

1307
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,850
That said, Carl

1308
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,850
needs to know exactly

1309
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,850
what's gonna happen.

1310
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,250
So continue,

1311
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,250
Dr. Sexton.

1312
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,890
Isolate the spleen,

1313
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,660
put a curved eight

1314
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,660
around the hilum and

1315
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,660
then take the spleen out.

1316
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,830
From there we mobilize

1317
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,830
the distal pancreas

1318
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,070
and put a TA 90

1319
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,070
stapler across it.

1320
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,370
Okay.

1321
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,370
Let's get started.

1322
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,410
Hey!

1323
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,880
Hey!

1324
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,880
Sorry I'm late.

1325
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,880
Patient surprised me.

1326
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,390
In a good way.

1327
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,390
Hey.

1328
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,080
Not always the case.

1329
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,250
Mmm.

1330
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,690
How you doing?

1331
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,690
How's your day going?

1332
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,790
You know what?

1333
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,730
I am so happy.

1334
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,260
You know? I wish everyone

1335
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,260
could feel this way.

1336
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,400
Nice.

1337
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,440
You know what?

1338
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,440
Let's make some lasagna.

1339
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,270
I wanna make some.

1340
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,970
I love your lasagna.

1341
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,470
I do.

1342
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,980
All right, let's invite

1343
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,980
Sharon over. It'd be nice

1344
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,980
to hang out with friends.

1345
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,620
Done.

1346
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,620
I love that.

1347
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,890
Come on, lasagna.

1348
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,720
Thank you.

1349
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,910
Nurse moved me up

1350
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,910
to the oxygen mask,

1351
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,840
but I still can

1352
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,840
hardly breathe.

1353
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,840
Yeah.

1354
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,580
Your CT shows

1355
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,580
a large proximal

1356
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,580
pulmonary embolism.

1357
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,780
Okay, that means your

1358
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,780
blood clot from your leg

1359
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,780
has moved to your lungs.

1360
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,690
I played

1361
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,690
tennis yesterday.

1362
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,660
Now, I don't have

1363
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,660
the energy to sit up.

1364
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,460
Why is this happening,

1365
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,460
Dr. Halstead?

1366
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,930
Well, we'll figure that out

1367
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,930
later. Right now, we need

1368
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,930
to deal with that clot.

1369
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,160
I'm gonna send you

1370
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,160
up to IR to treat it

1371
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,160
endoscopically.

1372
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,330
Okay? Let's go.

1373
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,380
Were you able to get in touch

1374
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,380
with my fiancée, Aubrey?

1375
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,280
No, and I'm really sorry.

1376
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,280
I was about to

1377
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,280
and I got pulled away.

1378
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,550
I promise I will call her

1379
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,550
soon as you're on the move.

1380
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,490
Neal?

1381
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,880
Neal!

1382
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,460
No pulse.

1383
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,460
VF on the monitors.

1384
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,460
Bag him.

1385
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,470
Paddles. Charge to 200.

1386
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,470
Charged.

1387
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,370
Clear.

1388
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,040
Epi. One milligram.

1389
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,340
Epi's in.

1390
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,520
Okay, here we go.

1391
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,860
Clear.

1392
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,860
Clear.

1393
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,770
No, no, no.

1394
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,770
Another round

1395
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,770
of epi.

1396
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,400
Come on, Neal!

1397
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,370
Clear.

1398
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,040
Asystole.

1399
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,580
Damn it!

1400
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,530
Time of death, 17:48.

1401
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,740
Tough one, Halstead.

1402
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,580
But don't sweat

1403
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,580
the review.

1404
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,750
I looked over the chart

1405
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,750
and the PE is clearly

1406
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,750
the cause of death.

1407
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,650
There's nothing

1408
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,650
you could've done.

1409
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,750
Dr. Halstead,

1410
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,750
Neal's fiancée

1411
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,750
Aubrey just arrived.

1412
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,790
Hello? Mama,

1413
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,790
I'm here.

1414
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,630
I don't know, they're not

1415
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,630
telling me anything.

1416
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,610
I don't know

1417
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,610
who to find.

1418
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,400
Can you please

1419
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,400
just come now?

1420
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,660
No complications.

1421
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,290
Lucky for us, too,

1422
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,290
'cause Carl's bowel

1423
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,290
was in bad shape.

1424
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,460
Dr. Marcel was right

1425
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,460
to push for surgery.

1426
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,760
Yeah. He was right.

1427
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,960
Yeah.

1428
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,960
This time.

1429
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,620
But Dr. Marcel's style,

1430
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,620
the risks he's willing

1431
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,620
to take...

1432
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,690
Man, Ethan,

1433
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,690
can't you even enjoy

1434
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,690
the moment, man?

1435
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,110
I mean, we won.

1436
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,600
We saved his life.

1437
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,940
Yeah.

1438
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,940
Yeah.

1439
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,980
Okay.

1440
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,980
Noah. Noah!

1441
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,960
I'm sorry.

1442
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,190
I should be

1443
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,190
celebrating.

1444
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,550
If we'd waited

1445
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,550
like I wanted,

1446
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,320
Carl's bowel would

1447
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,320
have perforated.

1448
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,230
Well, it turned out okay.

1449
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,230
Yeah. Noah...

1450
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,800
I want you to succeed,

1451
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,800
you know that.

1452
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,700
After two years

1453
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,700
at Dr. Choi boot camp,

1454
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,570
and what I've seen

1455
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,570
from Dr. Marcel,

1456
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,740
don't know

1457
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,740
why I wouldn't.

1458
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,420
You ever need anything,

1459
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,420
questions, advice,

1460
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,390
just wanna talk

1461
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,390
something out...

1462
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,020
Yeah. I know

1463
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,020
where to find you.

1464
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,090
I gotta get back

1465
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,090
to recovery.

1466
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,890
Want to be there

1467
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,890
when Carl wakes up.

1468
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,260
Go, go.

1469
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,900
Or maybe you

1470
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,900
can't go to bed.

1471
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,030
Why?

1472
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
Maggie?

1473
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,570
You okay?

1474
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,120
Maggie,

1475
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,120
what's going on?

1476
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,460
Honey?

1477
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,440
I'm in the kitchen.

1478
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,110
Are you sure

1479
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,110
that we don't need

1480
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,110
any more wine?

1481
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,010
It's very easy for me

1482
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,010
to just sort of jump back...

1483
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,310
Hey, Bert.

1484
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,310
Hey! Wine's

1485
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,310
covered, Dan.

1486
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,610
Got red and white.

1487
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,850
I know both go well

1488
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,850
with CeCe's lasagna.

1489
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,790
Honey? Honey,

1490
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,790
dinner's almost ready.

1491
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,520
So will you set the table?

1492
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,520
The dishes are already

1493
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,520
out there, please.

1494
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,600
Mmm. Let me.

1495
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,600
The least I can do.

1496
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,920
Thanks, Bert.

1497
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,690
Good to

1498
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,690
see you, pal.

1499
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,690
Hey, man.

1500
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,190
How you doing?

1501
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,190
Oh, I'm good.

1502
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,190
Good, yeah.

1503
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,260
Sharon's gonna

1504
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,260
be here, like,

1505
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,260
any minute.

1506
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,860
Why didn't you tell me

1507
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,860
Bert was coming?

1508
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,030
Because

1509
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,030
if I told, I know you

1510
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,030
wouldn't invite her.

1511
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,510
And three people

1512
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,510
don't exactly make

1513
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,510
a couples dinner party.

1514
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,270
Couples?

1515
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,270
What are you doing?

1516
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,650
I do not wanna hear how you

1517
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,650
think this is a bad idea.

1518
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,780
It is way beyond a bad idea.

1519
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,780
It's atrocious.

1520
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,340
Okay, yes,

1521
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,340
I am meddling.

1522
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,050
And I would've preferred

1523
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,050
to warm Sharon up

1524
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,050
to the idea,

1525
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,390
but I happen to be

1526
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,390
a little short on time.

1527
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,220
You cannot spring this

1528
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,220
on them unannounced.

1529
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,960
These two people went

1530
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,960
through a terrible divorce.

1531
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,520
They haven't talked to

1532
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,520
each other for a year.

1533
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,330
Danny, you and I found

1534
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,330
our way back to each other.

1535
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,460
That's completely

1536
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,460
different.

1537
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,830
Who says that

1538
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,830
Sharon and Bert

1539
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,830
can't do the same thing?

1540
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,670
I just want them

1541
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,670
to be happy. That's it.

1542
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,230
Well, you can't

1543
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,230
manipulate people

1544
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,570
into doing what you want

1545
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,570
if it's not what they want.

1546
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,910
Hey.

1547
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,590
I remembered that CeCe's

1548
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,590
lasagna pairs well with

1549
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,590
both red and white, so...

1550
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,190
That's right,

1551
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,190
it does.

1552
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,500
It's good with red

1553
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,500
and with white.

1554
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,100
And rosé.

1555
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,930
Daniel.

1556
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,530
Sharon!

1557
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,270
Bert.

1558
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,410
So, who's hungry?

1559
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,620
You said an X-ray

1560
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,620
would confirm pneumonia.

1561
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,950
I thought it would.

1562
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,950
But you still

1563
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,950
aren't sure?

1564
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,020
And now you wanna

1565
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,020
try to pump our son

1566
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,020
full of antibiotics again?

1567
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,360
To be safe, yes.

1568
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,300
No. We have been

1569
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,300
here for hours

1570
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,270
agreeing to things

1571
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,270
we're not

1572
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,270
comfortable with.

1573
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,890
No more.

1574
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,890
We're going home.

1575
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm sorry, but I won't

1576
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,200
approve that discharge.

1577
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,470
Then get me

1578
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,470
your boss.

1579
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,930
Now!

1580
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,480
Hey! Hey, I need

1581
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,480
to see a supervisor.

1582
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,880
We're calling

1583
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,880
our lawyer.

1584
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,250
Lucas most likely

1585
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,250
has pneumonia.

1586
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,780
He needs these

1587
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,780
antibiotics, now!

1588
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,980
No!

1589
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,980
You're not hearing me.

1590
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,420
Pneumonia for toddlers

1591
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,420
can be fatal.

1592
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,960
Janet, get Lucas now.

1593
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,220
No. You're

1594
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,220
endangering his life.

1595
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,600
We are taking

1596
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,600
our son.

1597
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,570
So either get out

1598
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,570
of the way or I'll go

1599
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,570
through you.

1600
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,300
Hey. Hey!

1601
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,300
Security!

1602
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Open the door!

1603
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Are you out

1604
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
of your mind?

1605
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,100
Security!

1606
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,100
I won't let you take him.

1607
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,170
We need security!

1608
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,170
Open the door!

1609
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,400
Security!

1610
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,400
It's gonna be okay.

1611
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,740
Open the door, please!

1612
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,740
Hey, open the door!

1613
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,950
Now! Lucas,

1614
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,950
it's okay. It's okay.

1615
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,950
Honey, it's okay.

1616
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,350
Come on,

1617
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,350
don't you have a key?

1618
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,410
Please! Hey!

1619
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,350
Look, don't you dare, no!

1620
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,480
Please!

1621
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,290
Get him out of there!

1622
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,290
Lucas, it's okay,

1623
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,290
honey. It's okay.

1624
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,660
It's okay, buddy.

1625
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,960
Everything's gonna

1626
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,960
be all right.

1627
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,500
Open the door!

1628
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,190
You guys

1629
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,190
are kidding me!

1630
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,530
Open this door!
