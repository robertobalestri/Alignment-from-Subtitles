1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,970
I will turn myself in.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,700
I'm looking for Dr. Asher.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,700
She hasn't come in yet.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,210
My phone crashed on me,

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,210
and I had to get it fixed.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,710
And I caught a flat.

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,710
You expect me to believe that?

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,800
You didn't seem to have

9
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,800
a problem last night.

10
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,350
Your patient and her baby

11
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,350
almost died today,

12
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,640
while you were off somewhere

13
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,640
getting high.

14
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,050
You think whatever

15
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,050
you want to.

16
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,020
Yeah, what do you need?

17
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,020
A favor.

18
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,890
That was a mistake thinking

19
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,890
you'd turn yourself in.

20
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,020
Hey, how's your

21
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,020
hormone therapy going?

22
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,990
It feels like my skin

23
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,990
is crawling with ants.

24
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,000
How lucky am I to

25
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,000
have found you?

26
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,000
You give me hope, Ben.

27
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,260
All right, Maggie,

28
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,260
the radiologist should read

29
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,260
your scans sometime today,

30
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,430
so that just leaves

31
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,430
your labs.

32
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,440
Come back at 6:00 p.m.

33
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,440
for a blood draw.

34
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,540
Okay, yeah.

35
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,540
Thanks. Ooh, Dr. Singh?

36
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,740
The results, how soon?

37
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,510
I'll ask the lab

38
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,510
to put a rush on it.

39
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,650
Yeah...

40
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,520
The wait is hell,

41
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,520
I know.

42
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,180
Yeah.

43
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,180
But I got a good feeling.

44
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,760
Yeah.

45
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,450
I'm not worried.

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,100
Hey. I gotta get to work.

47
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,100
See you at 6:00.

48
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,670
Okay.

49
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,010
Wait. Your bowling

50
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,010
semi-finals are tonight.

51
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,010
You should go.

52
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,010
I can handle this alone.

53
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,120
Nah, I'm gonna skip.

54
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,120
I wanna be there.

55
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,780
Are you kidding?

56
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,780
Your team needs you.

57
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,320
Go.

58
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,320
Baby, don't sweat it.

59
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,590
They'll call in an alternate.

60
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,320
I said I'll be fine.

61
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,320
Okay? Just...

62
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,660
What's up?

63
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,760
Why are you boxing me out

64
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,760
all of a sudden?

65
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,390
I'm not boxing you out.

66
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,390
You are.

67
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,900
Just...

68
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,040
Just, don't miss

69
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,040
your game, okay?

70
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,800
I'll be there

71
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,800
as soon as I can

72
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,800
after my appointment.

73
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,280
I gotta get back

74
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,280
to the ED.

75
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,640
Word is, Doc Crock's

76
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,640
fooling around with

77
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,640
Lena Maynor. CT Tech.

78
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,880
Funny, I heard

79
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,880
he was hooking up with

80
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,880
Camille in the pharmacy.

81
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,680
What?

82
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,690
Don't you all

83
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,690
have anything

84
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,690
better to do?

85
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
Morning, Sexton.

86
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,460
Mags, I think I left

87
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,460
my badge in the car.

88
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,590
I'll be right back.

89
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,830
All right.

90
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,830
Make it snappy.

91
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,300
You okay?

92
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,670
Yeah. Why do I care

93
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,670
who he sees?

94
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,070
Don't forget, appointment

95
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,070
with Dr. Patchefsky tonight.

96
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,710
See how many

97
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,710
eggs fertilized.

98
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,110
You mean

99
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,110
if any eggs fertilized.

100
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,710
After, I was thinking

101
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,710
we can grab dinner

102
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,710
at Galit,

103
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,280
celebrate.

104
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,820
The eternal optimist.

105
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,820
All right, I'm in.

106
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,960
Dr. Manning!

107
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,400
You'd probably

108
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,400
call this ill fortune,

109
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,100
but I'd call it fate.

110
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,870
Your shift started

111
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,870
an hour ago.

112
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,000
What, did you have

113
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,340
one too many bourbons

114
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,340
last night?

115
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,810
Didn't know you were

116
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,810
punching my time card,

117
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,940
but no, actually.

118
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,350
Not this time.

119
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,150
Left my badge

120
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,150
in the car. Again.

121
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,520
Should probably

122
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,520
super glue it to my forehead.

123
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,350
Stapler would work, too.

124
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,890
Help! Help, please!

125
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,350
Whoa, what's going on?

126
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,660
My wife, she's in labor.

127
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,660
She's bleeding real bad!

128
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,220
Okay.

129
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,060
Were you

130
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,060
in an accident?

131
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,400
Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,530
Did she have problems

133
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,530
with her pregnancy

134
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,530
before today?

135
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,030
Not sure.

136
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,870
Gimme your phones,

137
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,870
and get in.

138
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,870
What?

139
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,050
Hey, you don't

140
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,050
need to do this.

141
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,510
Gimme your damn phone.

142
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,350
Okay, listen.

143
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,290
I'm the surgeon, okay?

144
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,290
I can help him.

145
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,450
You let her go, okay?

146
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,450
I said get in!

147
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,920
Okay, okay, okay.

148
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,050
Listen.

149
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,790
Now! Get in!

150
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,200
Sit down.

151
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,200
Okay. Easy.

152
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,390
Easy.

153
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,420
That's a nasty laceration.

154
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,420
Want to tell me what happened?

155
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,790
Watch it.

156
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,790
You're gonna kill him!

157
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,220
He nicked his femoral vein.

158
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,120
Belt's not gonna

159
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,120
stop the bleeding.

160
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,790
Hand me that paintbrush.

161
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,790
Okay.

162
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,630
I need you to lift

163
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,630
your leg for me, okay?

164
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,320
That's too tight,

165
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,320
damn it!

166
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,420
Any looser, and you'll

167
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,420
bleed out in minutes.

168
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,120
Look, if he

169
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,120
doesn't get surgery,

170
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,420
he's gonna lose his leg.

171
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,150
We need to get him

172
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,150
to the hospital now.

173
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,920
No hospital!

174
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,920
Figure something out!

175
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,790
What?

176
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,420
Maybe you take us to get

177
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,420
supplies, okay?

178
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,530
There's a pharmacy

179
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,530
right down the road.

180
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,760
No, security's

181
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,760
too tight there.

182
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,500
Is there still

183
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,500
that gas station

184
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,500
up on Cermak, Jimmy?

185
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,840
Yeah.

186
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,840
Go!

187
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,240
Easy, man.

188
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,240
All right. All right.

189
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,510
Hey, Will Halstead,

190
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,650
here to see Dr. Hannah Asher.

191
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,730
Let's see. Asher.

192
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,130
Looks like she was admitted

193
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,130
yesterday morning.

194
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,260
Yeah.

195
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,730
We typically don't

196
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,730
recommend visitors

197
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,200
for the first 48 hours.

198
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,030
Yeah, she's expecting me.

199
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,830
You know, I don't wanna

200
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,830
leave her hanging.

201
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,840
Room 2268.

202
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,840
Make it brief.

203
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,570
Thank you.

204
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,760
Hey! Excuse me?

205
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,360
What dose of methadone

206
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,360
is Dr. Asher on?

207
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,490
She's sick as a dog.

208
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,160
She's being tapered

209
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,160
way too fast.

210
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,670
This facility doesn't

211
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,670
permit the use

212
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,070
of opioid agonists

213
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,070
like methadone

214
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,070
for medical staff.

215
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,730
Most peer-run

216
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,730
centers don't.

217
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,180
Wait, wait.

218
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,180
So, you're telling me

219
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,180
she's gotta go cold-turkey?

220
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,180
No methadone?

221
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,180
Because she's a doctor?

222
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,510
It's the protocol.

223
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,320
Dr. Choi, Treatment 3.

224
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,090
Oh, no. Jasmine.

225
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,350
You know her?

226
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,620
She's been in and out of ED

227
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,620
for end-stage liver disease.

228
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,320
Hey.

229
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,320
April.

230
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,960
That's her friend, Lauren.

231
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,090
Hey, Lauren.

232
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,230
April, oh, my God.

233
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,360
Hey, boys.

234
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,700
Momma's not feeling

235
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,700
so well.

236
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm so sorry to hear that.

237
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,800
What's going on?

238
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,380
Jasmine was making

239
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,380
the boys' breakfast,

240
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,470
and she just

241
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,470
started throwing up,

242
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,640
and then she passed out.

243
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,080
Is she gonna be okay?

244
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,050
We're gonna take

245
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,050
good care of her, okay?

246
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,210
I promise. Come on.

247
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,220
Why don't you take them

248
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,220
to the day care center, okay?

249
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,310
Okay.

250
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,310
I'll keep you posted.

251
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,440
All right. Thanks.

252
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,580
Right through there.

253
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,220
Hey, Jasmine.

254
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,620
April! April,

255
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,620
where are my babies?

256
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,790
Lauren just took them...

257
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,790
Easy.

258
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,060
...to the day care center.

259
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,060
Don't worry. Just lie back.

260
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

261
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,000
No nodes,

262
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,000
but eyes are icteric.

263
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,800
Jasmine, I'm gonna

264
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,800
push on your belly, okay?

265
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,170
Okay.

266
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,170
Severe ascites.

267
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,110
Let's get a CBC, CMP,

268
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,110
UA and chest X-ray.

269
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,270
Jasmine, says here

270
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,270
you're scheduled

271
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,820
for a living donor

272
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,820
transplant next week,

273
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,280
but I'm thinking

274
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,280
they may move it up to today.

275
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,650
They found you a donor?

276
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,650
That's great.

277
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,950
Last time you were here,

278
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,950
you were still waiting

279
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,950
on the list.

280
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,460
I found my own, actually.

281
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,460
My biological mom, Annette.

282
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,330
I didn't know

283
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,330
you were adopted.

284
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,030
Petitioned the courts

285
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,030
to disclose her information.

286
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,600
Thank God she was

287
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,600
willing to donate.

288
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,130
She's my last shot.

289
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,640
That's some good luck.

290
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,770
Yeah.

291
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,210
More like a miracle.

292
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,510
All right, I see

293
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,510
Annette's info here.

294
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,770
Is it okay if I contact her?

295
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,280
Uh-huh.

296
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,280
Please do. Thank you.

297
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,510
Okay.

298
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,380
Baghdad!

299
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,180
Has anyone seen Dr. Marcel?

300
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,180
He left for his car ages ago.

301
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,160
I paged him twice.

302
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,290
Because methadone

303
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,290
and suboxone

304
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,290
are technically opiates,

305
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,130
the concern is they're gonna

306
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,130
cause impairment on the job.

307
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,870
But doctors can

308
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,870
take depression meds

309
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,870
and sleeping pills?

310
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,670
And residents can

311
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,670
work 30-hour shifts?

312
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,670
Where's the concern there?

313
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,300
I hear ya. You know,

314
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,300
it's complicated.

315
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,970
No, you know what?

316
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,970
It's inhumane.

317
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,810
They're punishing addicts

318
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,810
because of the stigma.

319
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,010
Look, Will,

320
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,250
it must have been

321
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,250
an agonizing decision,

322
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,380
you know, turning in Hannah?

323
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,380
I can only imagine.

324
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,720
But for what it's worth,

325
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,550
I think you did

326
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,550
the right thing.

327
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,020
Yeah.

328
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,930
Will, patient in 4.

329
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,930
College kid, passed out

330
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,930
on campus.

331
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,520
Suffering from dizziness

332
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,520
and a headache.

333
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,570
Dr. Charles, turns out

334
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,570
she's an old patient

335
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,570
of yours. Krista Butler.

336
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,230
Oh, Krista.

337
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,500
Early-onset schizophrenia

338
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,500
presented when she was

339
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,500
about 15.

340
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,440
All right.

341
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,440
Good to know.

342
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,540
Krista.

343
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,540
Dr. Charles.

344
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,670
How ya doing?

345
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,110
They didn't...

346
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,110
They didn't call

347
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,110
my mom, did they?

348
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,240
'Cause I'm 18 now.

349
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,050
She has not been contacted.

350
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,180
Everything okay

351
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,180
with you two?

352
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,590
Since I started college,

353
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,590
she's just...

354
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,090
She's gone all psycho

355
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,090
helicopter mom on me.

356
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,090
I just...

357
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,630
I've had to stay

358
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,630
at my boyfriend's place

359
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,430
the past couple nights,

360
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,430
just to catch a break.

361
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,760
Hmm.

362
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,530
Mothers and daughters.

363
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,530
Krista, this is Dr. Halstead.

364
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,540
I have brought him

365
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,540
up to date

366
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,540
on your history.

367
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,700
Okay.

368
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,210
Hi there.

369
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,210
So, other than

370
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,210
the dizziness and headache,

371
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,710
anything else

372
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,710
bothering you?

373
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,150
Stomach doesn't

374
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,150
feel so great.

375
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,380
Heart rate's

376
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,380
a bit elevated.

377
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,650
I'm thinking

378
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,650
you're dehydrated.

379
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,380
Any chance you had

380
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,380
a few drinks last night?

381
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,920
Maybe a couple.

382
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,920
But nothing crazy.

383
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,090
Look, you're in college,

384
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,090
you wanna try new things,

385
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,930
I completely get it,

386
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,930
but you know,

387
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,000
you gotta be really

388
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,000
careful mixing alcohol

389
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,000
and antipsychotics, right?

390
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,630
What are you taking

391
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,630
right now?

392
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,630
Nothing.

393
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,070
I'm not taking

394
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,070
risperidone anymore.

395
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,900
I haven't taken it

396
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,900
for months, actually.

397
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,470
Krista, it's really important

398
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,470
you remain compliant

399
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,470
with your meds...

400
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,950
It makes me feel numb.

401
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,950
Less creative.

402
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,650
What, so, you're just

403
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,650
symptom free?

404
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,680
Yeah, totally.

405
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,680
Never felt better.

406
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,980
Okay. I wanna talk about

407
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,980
this more a little later.

408
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,690
But in the meantime,

409
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,690
let's get you feeling better.

410
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,830
Yeah, CBC, BMP,

411
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,830
hang a normal liter

412
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,830
of saline,

413
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,090
and two milligrams

414
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,090
of metoclopramide

415
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,090
for the nausea.

416
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,260
Krista, I'll be back

417
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,260
to check on you soon.

418
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,130
So, just out of curiosity,

419
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,600
when's the last time

420
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,600
you checked in

421
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,600
with your mom?

422
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,710
Fine. You can call her.

423
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,650
Okay. I'll be back

424
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,650
in a bit.

425
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,820
All right. Make sure

426
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,820
you keep his leg elevated

427
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,820
until I get back.

428
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,050
Okay.

429
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

430
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360
She comes with me,

431
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360
you stay here.

432
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,020
Listen, I'm the surgeon.

433
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,020
I know what to get.

434
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,620
Cuff him. Catch.

435
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,160
Come on, do it!

436
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,730
Okay.

437
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,900
Let's go!

438
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,730
I'm sorry.

439
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,140
No, no. Hands above

440
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,140
his head. That bar.

441
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,410
Okay.

442
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,650
It's all right.

443
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,850
All right, all right.

444
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,850
Cover your hands.

445
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,690
Come on.

446
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,330
Move.

447
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,440
That your boy on your arm?

448
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,640
Just...

449
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,090
You just keep...

450
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,090
How old is he?

451
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,060
Get back!

452
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,060
Get in there, come on!

453
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,570
Move!

454
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,670
What the hell

455
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,670
did you do to him?

456
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,240
Nothing!

457
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,240
He just passed out.

458
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,470
What the hell you doing?

459
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,410
See? He's alive, okay?

460
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,910
Bro?

461
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,320
His calf is rock solid.

462
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,320
We need to move.

463
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,120
I need my hands

464
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,120
to work, man.

465
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,960
Come on.

466
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,960
Pull around the corner.

467
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,860
Over there.

468
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,860
Okay. Okay.

469
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,640
Hey, Miss Hill.

470
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,640
I'm Dr. Choi.

471
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,200
How's my daughter?

472
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,200
Is she doing okay?

473
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,610
I told Jasmine

474
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,610
that I would watch the boys,

475
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,370
so she could rest up

476
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,370
till the transplant,

477
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,370
but that girl,

478
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,310
she thinks

479
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,310
she's superwoman,

480
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,310
I swear.

481
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,480
So, they're getting

482
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,480
her ready for surgery?

483
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,990
Yeah, the transplant team

484
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,990
is just

485
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,990
running some tests to ensure

486
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,990
everything goes smoothly.

487
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,050
Oh, it's gonna go smoothly.

488
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,050
Been praying on it

489
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,050
since I got the call.

490
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,380
I like your attitude.

491
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,330
And while they finish up

492
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,330
with Jasmine,

493
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,330
I just need to check your BP,

494
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,330
if you don't mind.

495
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,490
Not at all.

496
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,700
I heard your story.

497
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,000
Pretty incredible

498
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,000
being reunited

499
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,000
with your daughter

500
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,230
under the circumstances.

501
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,040
God works in mysterious ways,

502
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,510
and I've learned not

503
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,510
to question Him.

504
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,500
Your hard work paid off.

505
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,500
BP's improved.

506
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,880
Amen!

507
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,490
Miss Hill, your chart

508
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,490
says you had an episode

509
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,490
of malignant hyperthermia?

510
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,490
When I got foot surgery

511
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,490
a few years back.

512
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,490
That drug...

513
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,500
I forget the name...

514
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,500
Succinylcholine.

515
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,060
I had a real

516
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,060
bad reaction to it.

517
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,330
But they said I could still

518
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,330
donate to Jasmine...

519
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,870
I just have to use

520
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,870
a different anesthesia, right?

521
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,940
That's correct.

522
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,940
Just double checking.

523
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,170
Excuse me.

524
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,580
I have been calling

525
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,580
and texting you nonstop!

526
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,020
You're supposed to

527
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,020
come home every night,

528
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,020
no exceptions...

529
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,680
Mom, chill!

530
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,680
I was busy studying.

531
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,780
I was about to

532
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,780
call the police.

533
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,250
You see what

534
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,250
I'm talking about?

535
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,950
How about we let

536
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,950
Krista rest a bit?

537
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,430
I'm gonna go get you

538
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,430
some food.

539
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,430
Okay.

540
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,790
I bet you've been living

541
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,790
on vending machine crap.

542
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,230
Don't you know...

543
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,230
I will be right back.

544
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,530
You know me so well.

545
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,270
Joanne? Look,

546
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,270
I don't wanna overstep,

547
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,600
but sometimes,

548
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,600
when we loosen

549
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,600
the reigns a bit...

550
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,700
Loosen the reigns,

551
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,700
like what?

552
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,800
Let her drink?

553
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,470
Krista's no longer

554
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,470
a minor. I'm not

555
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,470
at liberty to discuss...

556
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,810
Don't give me that.

557
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,810
She is a week over 18.

558
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,940
Dr. Charles.

559
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,940
Some help in here.

560
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,490
Honey? Oh, my God!

561
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,990
Two of Ativan.

562
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,990
What's wrong with her?

563
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,960
Having a seizure.

564
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,960
Has she ever had one before?

565
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,260
No, never.

566
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,090
Okay, so,

567
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,090
give me a BMP, a CBC,

568
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,070
a head CT,

569
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,070
EKG and a urine tox.

570
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,130
Copy that.

571
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,130
Mmm-hmm.

572
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,130
Also, an EEG.

573
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,970
Shh.

574
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,410
Wait, you don't think

575
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,410
Annette is Jasmine's

576
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,410
biological mother?

577
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,780
Malignant hypothermia

578
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,780
is a genetic disorder.

579
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,790
If Annette can't tolerate

580
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,790
succinylcholine,

581
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,150
Jasmine shouldn't

582
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,150
be able to, either.

583
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,190
But I checked Jasmine's chart,

584
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,190
they used it in her

585
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,190
previous surgeries.

586
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,950
Yeah, but look,

587
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,950
the transplant team

588
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,950
didn't flag it.

589
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,000
Are we really gonna

590
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,000
jeopardize Jasmine's life

591
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,000
over a possibility?

592
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,260
If it were me on that gurney,

593
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,260
I'd at least wanna know.

594
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,360
Look, Ethan, wait.

595
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,810
If Annette

596
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,810
changes her mind,

597
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,170
that is it for Jasmine.

598
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,170
She doesn't have

599
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,170
any time left.

600
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,370
Think of her boys.

601
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,180
Please, you don't

602
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,180
have to do this.

603
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,550
Krista's EEG is normal.

604
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,160
No epileptiform activity.

605
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,160
She didn't have a seizure.

606
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,660
So, we're looking

607
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,660
at what, dyskinesia?

608
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,350
Right. CT was normal

609
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,350
as well.

610
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,900
No previous signs

611
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,900
of strokes.

612
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,860
Yeah, it can

613
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,860
also be caused by

614
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,860
a drug interaction.

615
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,400
Urine tox is clean.

616
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,400
It's not dyskinesia.

617
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,890
Unless,

618
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,700
you gave her

619
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,700
metoclopramide

620
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,860
for the nausea, right?

621
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,860
Yeah.

622
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,170
How much?

623
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,170
Two milligrams, why?

624
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,740
I'm gonna order

625
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,740
a couple more labs.

626
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,690
Hey, Doris? I got

627
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,690
a peds patient

628
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,690
in Treatment 2.

629
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,520
Grab Dr. Lanik for me?

630
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,520
Peds? Where's Dr. Manning?

631
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,050
I mean, first Crockett

632
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,050
goes AWOL,

633
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,180
and now, Nat's late

634
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,230
with no call-in.

635
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,230
It's not like her.

636
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,850
Dr. Manning's car

637
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,850
is in the lot.

638
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,850
I just passed it.

639
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,900
That's strange.

640
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,900
She's not picking up

641
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,900
her phone.

642
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,760
Can you track

643
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,760
her location

644
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,760
on "Drop A Pin"?

645
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,890
Yeah.

646
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,500
That's weird.

647
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,740
It says that she's been

648
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,740
just outside of the hospital

649
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,740
for the last hour.

650
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,080
Kristi, grab the brick.

651
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,670
This thing says

652
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,670
she should be

653
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,670
right here.

654
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,890
I'm gonna

655
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,890
call her again.

656
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,510
Come on, Nat.

657
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,390
It's coming from in here.

658
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,690
Oh, my God.

659
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,430
Wait. There's

660
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,430
another phone here.

661
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,560
Be careful.

662
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,730
There could be prints.

663
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,040
That's Crockett's phone.

664
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,380
Okay. Uncuff him.

665
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,980
All right, come on,

666
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,980
let's go!

667
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,390
Come on, do it!

668
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,660
All right,

669
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,660
easy with that trigger.

670
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,250
Come on, let's do it.

671
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,250
Okay.

672
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,000
Sterilize him.

673
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,500
This is gonna hurt.

674
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,500
Easy.

675
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,440
Just be quick.

676
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,080
Yeah. Yeah. No, the alley

677
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,080
near the back end

678
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,080
of the south parking lot.

679
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,010
Any luck?

680
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,520
No. There's a blind spot.

681
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,190
Thank you.

682
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,190
Two of my doctors

683
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,190
are missing.

684
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,430
Possibly,

685
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,430
in grave danger.

686
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,430
What do you have?

687
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,530
Okay, so, the prints were

688
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,530
smeared, but techs were

689
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,530
able to lift two partials.

690
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,470
And they're a match

691
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,470
for an escaped convict's

692
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,470
brother, Jim Clemons.

693
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,870
And the blood?

694
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,610
It's a DNA match

695
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,610
for Tyler Clemons,

696
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,610
convicted murderer.

697
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,270
So, what now?

698
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,940
Now? We don't stop

699
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,940
'til we find them.

700
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,490
I got a BOLO out,

701
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,490
and an investigative alert.

702
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,390
I have officers across

703
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,390
the city sitting on their

704
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,390
known associates,

705
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,050
and their family members.

706
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,050
So far, no hits.

707
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,890
Meantime, no one else

708
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,890
can know about this.

709
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,720
If the news catches wind

710
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,720
of the kidnapping,

711
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,660
the abductors might

712
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,660
try to cut their losses...

713
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,000
Understood. But please,

714
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,000
keep us posted?

715
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,130
Will do.

716
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,860
Yeah.

717
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,410
I'm going to run Tyler

718
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,410
and Jim Clemons

719
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,410
through our system,

720
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,570
see if any medical

721
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,570
records come up.

722
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,180
What do you mean

723
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,180
Krista didn't have a seizure?

724
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,720
I saw it with my own eyes.

725
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,550
So, the involuntary

726
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,550
movements you saw

727
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,520
were caused by something

728
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,520
called dyskinesia.

729
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,520
Is that due

730
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,520
to her schizophrenia?

731
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,750
No.

732
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,160
It can be caused

733
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,160
by an adverse

734
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,160
drug interaction.

735
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,060
In this case,

736
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,060
between the drug

737
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,060
we gave Krista for her nausea,

738
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,570
metoclopramide,

739
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,570
and her antipsychotic

740
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,570
medication, risperidone.

741
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,230
But here's the thing,

742
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,430
Krista told us that

743
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,740
she had stopped

744
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,740
taking her risperidone,

745
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,840
and yet, the labs showed

746
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,940
a low level of the drug

747
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,940
in her system.

748
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,340
Do you have any idea

749
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,340
why that might be?

750
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,850
I don't know.

751
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,850
What does it matter?

752
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,440
At least, she's taking

753
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,440
her medicine again.

754
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,750
I think we can all

755
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,750
agree that that's

756
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,750
a good thing. Right?

757
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,020
So, based on the half-life

758
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,020
of risperidone,

759
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,180
we know that Krista

760
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,690
hasn't taken the drug

761
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,690
in roughly 48 hours.

762
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,920
The amount of time

763
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,920
she's been crashing

764
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,920
at her boyfriend's,

765
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,790
away from home.

766
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,200
Joanne, have you been

767
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,200
giving Krista risperidone

768
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,200
without her knowledge?

769
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,240
She had been doing

770
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,240
so well, I just...

771
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,810
When she told me

772
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,810
she was stopping,

773
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,810
I had to do something.

774
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,710
Dr. Charles, please,

775
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,410
you remember

776
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,410
her hallucinations,

777
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,410
how bad it got.

778
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,240
You can't say anything.

779
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,880
I'm only trying

780
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,880
to protect her.

781
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,750
I am begging you. Please.

782
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,660
Joanne, dosing her

783
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,660
without her knowledge

784
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,160
it's just,

785
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,160
it's extraordinarily

786
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,160
dangerous.

787
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,730
It's also

788
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,730
a direct violation

789
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,730
of her autonomy.

790
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,320
Now the best thing would be

791
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,320
for you to tell her,

792
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,730
but if you're

793
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,730
not up for that,

794
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,330
I'm sorry,

795
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,330
but it is my duty

796
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,330
to let her know.

797
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,810
Please don't.

798
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,510
Hurry up, God damn it!

799
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,510
We gotta get back on the road!

800
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,450
With the tourniquet

801
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,450
turned down,

802
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,450
I can only move so fast.

803
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,650
I gotta deal with

804
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,650
these bleeders

805
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,650
individually.

806
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,020
We don't have time.

807
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,110
You want it

808
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,110
to go fast? Move.

809
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,600
There.

810
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,600
The bleeding's stopped.

811
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,140
Easy, easy.

812
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,140
You crazy bitch.

813
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,470
All right,

814
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,470
easy. Easy.

815
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,830
Let's go.

816
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,100
Oh! Whoa!

817
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,170
Hey! We did our part,

818
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,170
you let us go.

819
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,010
You're not going anywhere.

820
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,610
Come on.

821
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,350
Jasmine did great.

822
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,980
The transplant

823
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,980
couldn't have

824
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,980
gone any better.

825
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,120
Thank you.

826
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,030
She's really lucky

827
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,030
to have a friend like you.

828
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,300
Will you excuse me?

829
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,700
I should probably go tell

830
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,700
the boys the good news.

831
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah, of course.

832
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,740
Lauren! Hey!

833
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Hey, April.

834
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Was that Lauren Knight?

835
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,670
Do you know her?

836
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,310
Yeah. From when

837
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,310
I worked at Children

838
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,310
and Family Services.

839
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,650
Wait. Lauren used

840
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,650
to work at DCFS?

841
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,020
Mmm-hmm.

842
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,320
Do you know

843
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,320
if she still works there?

844
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,580
Pretty sure, yeah. Why?

845
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,090
No, I just thought she said

846
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,090
she worked at a bank.

847
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,030
Doesn't DCFS keep

848
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,030
adoption records?

849
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,400
Mmm-hmm.

850
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,170
Excuse me, Arlene.

851
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,170
I need to make a call.

852
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,900
Thank you so much for calling.

853
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,400
Okay.

854
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,510
Sharon!

855
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,510
Yeah.

856
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,550
A clerk from

857
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,550
a local gas station in

858
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,550
the West Loop just called,

859
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,840
said he found

860
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,840
Natalie's badge.

861
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,210
Please tell me

862
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,210
he laid eyes on her?

863
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,910
He did. She was okay.

864
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,350
Okay, I'll call

865
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,350
Detective Halstead,

866
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,790
hopefully, they'll have

867
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,790
security cameras there.

868
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,790
Yeah. Oh, Sharon.

869
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,790
Yeah?

870
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,260
Where are we

871
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,260
with the medical records?

872
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,920
I'm still working on it.

873
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,190
Okay.

874
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,800
How's my mom?

875
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,800
Any side effects

876
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,800
from the anesthesia?

877
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,600
None. She started asking

878
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,600
about you the moment

879
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,600
she woke up. Sweet lady.

880
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,440
Yeah, she is.

881
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,380
Jasmine, how could you?

882
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,380
Both of you?

883
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,540
April, what are you

884
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,540
talking about?

885
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,280
They conned Annette.

886
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,480
She posed as her daughter.

887
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,480
They catfished her

888
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,480
for an organ.

889
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,650
That's not true.

890
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,730
Jasmine, yeah,

891
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,730
you were adopted,

892
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,560
your biological parents

893
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,830
are Derrick and Janine,

894
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,830
both deceased.

895
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,490
You accessed

896
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,490
adoption records

897
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,490
to set up Annette?

898
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,300
Of course not.

899
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,300
That's ridiculous.

900
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,930
Jasmine?

901
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,340
Say something!

902
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,460
Jasmine, don't answer him.

903
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,140
Annette put her life

904
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,140
on the line for you!

905
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,950
I know.

906
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,950
I know she did.

907
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,450
And I didn't set out

908
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,450
to hurt her, I promise.

909
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,780
It's just, when I found out

910
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,690
that my biological parents

911
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,690
were dead,

912
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,120
I had no other option.

913
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,660
My boys.

914
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,830
I couldn't leave my boys,

915
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,830
I couldn't.

916
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,700
What you did is illegal.

917
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,340
Annette could press charges.

918
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,940
What was the plan?

919
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,840
Were you gonna ditch her

920
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,840
while she's recovering?

921
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,970
God, no.

922
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,840
Never.

923
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,550
Annette may not be

924
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,550
my biological mom,

925
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,150
but she's become family

926
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,150
to me and the boys.

927
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,450
We love her.

928
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,450
We'd never abandon her.

929
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,460
This isn't Jasmine's fault.

930
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,050
Listen, this whole thing

931
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,050
was my idea.

932
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,560
Okay, please.

933
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,360
I cannot believe

934
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,360
you would do this.

935
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,490
April.

936
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,010
Where are you taking us?

937
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,210
Just be quiet, go.

938
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,480
Come on, man.

939
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,570
We done with them?

940
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,980
No, no, no. I need them,

941
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,980
they're my insurance policy.

942
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,180
But you... You go

943
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,850
and I will see you soon,

944
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,850
okay? I love you, man.

945
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,560
Don't even think

946
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,560
about it, girl.

947
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,490
Please, I have a son...

948
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,400
Come on. Just go,

949
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,400
just go in the house.

950
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,400
Let's go.

951
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,090
All right.

952
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,090
Easy, man. Easy!

953
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,600
Go. Just keep quiet.

954
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,600
Go. Move.

955
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,670
Come on, inside.

956
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,910
I can't believe

957
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,910
you're really here.

958
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,040
But...

959
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,420
Go now, Ma.

960
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,420
I just need you

961
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,420
to go. Go.

962
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,620
In the living room.

963
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,560
Go.

964
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,220
He's ill.

965
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,150
Maybe we can help him.

966
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,900
Nah. You can't.

967
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,830
Just grab these chairs.

968
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,830
Put 'em back to back.

969
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,830
And sit down.

970
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,400
But we can help.

971
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,600
Just do it, please.

972
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,800
Okay.

973
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,830
Close the door. I may have

974
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,830
something to help

975
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,830
with your investigation.

976
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,380
Bobby Clemons,

977
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,380
Tyler's son's

978
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,380
medical records.

979
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,210
How'd you get those?

980
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,210
We can't unseal

981
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,210
medical records.

982
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,840
All that matters

983
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,840
is I got them.

984
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,610
Bobby was

985
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,610
treated for stage four

986
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,610
brain cancer at East Mercy.

987
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,620
He's terminal.

988
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,620
His grandmother

989
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,620
signed him out,

990
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,880
took him home

991
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,880
for hospice.

992
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,720
His grandmother?

993
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,720
We couldn't track her down,

994
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,720
her last known was demolished.

995
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,730
3768 South Parnell Ave.

996
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,300
Everybody, listen up,

997
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,300
this is Halstead.

998
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,340
I need you to meet at Sox lot

999
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,340
for a pre-raid brief.

1000
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,230
I got a solid location

1001
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,230
on our target.

1002
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,360
Copy that.

1003
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,510
I was hoping you were

1004
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,510
Jasmine and my grandbabies.

1005
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,180
Annette, that's

1006
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,180
what we came

1007
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,180
to talk to you about.

1008
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,250
I'm so sorry,

1009
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,250
but we have to tell you,

1010
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,980
Jasmine is not actually

1011
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,980
your daughter.

1012
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,520
Miss Hill?

1013
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,930
I already knew.

1014
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,930
What?

1015
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,860
My daughter, Zora,

1016
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,730
died 12 years ago,

1017
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,730
in a shelter.

1018
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,840
At least,

1019
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,840
that's what the folks in

1020
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,840
the neighborhood tell me.

1021
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,240
But, if you knew Jasmine

1022
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,240
wasn't yours, why didn't

1023
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,240
you say something?

1024
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,510
I was just a baby myself

1025
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,510
when I got pregnant.

1026
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,050
I made some bad choices

1027
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,060
trying to provide

1028
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,060
for my little girl,

1029
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,790
and I ended up doing time.

1030
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,120
That's how I lost her.

1031
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,860
But I never stopped

1032
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,860
thinking about her.

1033
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,740
So, when Jasmine called?

1034
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,770
I knew it was God

1035
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,470
giving me another chance

1036
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,470
to do some good.

1037
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,910
To make it up

1038
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,910
to Zora, somehow.

1039
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,820
So, I played along.

1040
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,950
I didn't tell Jasmine

1041
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,950
that someone must've

1042
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,950
made a clerical error,

1043
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,290
and I wasn't really

1044
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,290
her mother.

1045
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,500
Annette, it wasn't

1046
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,500
a clerical error.

1047
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,660
Jasmine knew

1048
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,660
you were not her mother.

1049
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,660
She conned you.

1050
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,670
I don't care.

1051
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,520
Miss Hill,

1052
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,520
what they did was wrong.

1053
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,610
For the first time

1054
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,610
in my life,

1055
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,420
I have a family.

1056
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,590
And I don't

1057
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,590
wanna lose her

1058
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,590
or those boys.

1059
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,660
Um...

1060
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,330
Our obligation

1061
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,330
was to inform you.

1062
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,770
How you deal with it

1063
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,770
is up to you.

1064
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,140
Thank you.

1065
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,190
So, can you ask them,

1066
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,290
my family, to come see me?

1067
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,070
She'd rather

1068
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,070
live in a lie.

1069
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,900
Guess sometimes,

1070
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,900
the truth is more painful.

1071
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,010
Help!

1072
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,010
Somebody, help!

1073
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,910
No! No.

1074
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,910
Stop it!

1075
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,580
No!

1076
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,580
Krista, don't. Ow!

1077
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,810
They're under my skin.

1078
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,320
I have to get

1079
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,320
them out! Please!

1080
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,320
Two of Haldol IV.

1081
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,550
Need help.

1082
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,550
Let's go, let's go.

1083
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,550
No, please, no!

1084
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,030
No, no! No, no! No, please!

1085
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,150
You're poisoning me!

1086
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,060
Mom! No, you have

1087
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,060
to listen, it's poison! Stop!

1088
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,660
I'm sorry,

1089
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,660
but you're a danger

1090
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,660
to yourself, we have to

1091
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,260
give you medication.

1092
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,260
Please!

1093
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,700
Meds are in.

1094
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,930
Joanne, are you all right?

1095
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,700
Let's take a look

1096
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,700
at your face.

1097
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,700
Are you okay?

1098
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,170
If you hadn't told her.

1099
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,210
If you'd just let me continue

1100
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,210
helping her. Now what?

1101
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,940
If she continues to exhibit

1102
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,940
self-harming behavior,

1103
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,070
we'll put her

1104
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,070
on a psych hold.

1105
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,910
And what if

1106
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,910
she doesn't take

1107
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,910
her medicine?

1108
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,610
In that case,

1109
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,610
the next step would be

1110
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,610
to seek a court order

1111
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,250
to get her committed

1112
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,250
so that she can receive

1113
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,250
the necessary treatment.

1114
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,760
But let's not get ahead

1115
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,760
of ourselves...

1116
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,760
Institutionalize her?

1117
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,760
She's gonna have to

1118
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,760
drop out of college.

1119
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,520
I had this under control.

1120
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,890
You've ruined her life.

1121
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,730
I'm sorry, son.

1122
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,710
I'm so sorry

1123
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,710
I wasn't there.

1124
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,920
This is Detective

1125
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Jay Halstead with

1126
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Chicago Police Department.

1127
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,890
Tyler,

1128
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,890
we have you surrounded.

1129
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,660
I don't want you

1130
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,660
or your family to get hurt.

1131
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,500
I want you to come out

1132
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,500
the front door, with your

1133
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,500
hands where we can see them.

1134
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,800
No one's going to shoot.

1135
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,570
I know you're

1136
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,570
with Natalie Manning

1137
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,570
and Crockett Marcel.

1138
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,980
As an act of good faith,

1139
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,980
have them come out first.

1140
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,680
If you do not comply...

1141
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,080
Here. Uncuff her.

1142
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,820
...we'll be forced

1143
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,820
to breach the house.

1144
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,190
Okay, you can go.

1145
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,170
Go ahead. Go. You go.

1146
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,030
No, I...

1147
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,030
It's okay.

1148
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,670
Do as he says. It's okay, go.

1149
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,670
It's okay. It's okay.

1150
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,040
Shut the door behind you.

1151
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,870
Shut the door.

1152
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,220
Hold, stand down.

1153
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,220
Friendly coming out.

1154
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,820
Hold the door. Hold your fire.

1155
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,820
Hostage coming out.

1156
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,630
Shields. Go, go.

1157
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,720
Go! Go, go, now! Get her out.

1158
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,130
I got you. Hey.

1159
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,530
Get her out of there.

1160
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,530
Move! Move!

1161
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,370
I'm sorry about your son.

1162
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,210
Go ahead.

1163
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,200
Hey, no! No!

1164
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,200
Come on, come on, man!

1165
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,710
Don't do that!

1166
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,780
Crockett!

1167
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,780
Breach! Breach! Breach!

1168
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,510
No!

1169
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,090
Crockett!

1170
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,010
No!

1171
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,350
Wait!

1172
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,090
Natalie!

1173
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,130
Come here.

1174
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,230
Are you okay?

1175
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,230
Are you hurt?

1176
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,900
Yes. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1177
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,900
But Crockett...

1178
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,100
Where is he?

1179
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,970
I don't know.

1180
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,970
He was in the house,

1181
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,970
and there was a gunshot,

1182
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,600
and all the officers

1183
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,600
swarmed in.

1184
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,240
But they won't let me in.

1185
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,240
They won't tell me anything.

1186
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,110
Crockett!

1187
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,220
I was so scared.

1188
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,120
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1189
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,660
You all right?

1190
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,660
Yeah.

1191
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,440
All right.

1192
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,440
Get him to the ED,

1193
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,270
make sure you

1194
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,270
get him two units

1195
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,270
of uncrossed blood, stat.

1196
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,340
That man owes you his life.

1197
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,270
For what it's worth,

1198
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,270
I completely understand

1199
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,270
why you did what you did.

1200
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,310
Oh, I wish I could

1201
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,310
just shake her.

1202
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,810
I wanna make her see

1203
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,810
she's just throwing

1204
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,810
her future away.

1205
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,680
I mean,

1206
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,680
it's our most basic,

1207
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,550
primal instinct as parents,

1208
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,550
is protect our kids,

1209
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,350
often from themselves, right?

1210
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,720
Which is when it gets

1211
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,720
really tricky.

1212
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,800
If you can resist

1213
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,800
that instinct,

1214
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,800
if you can just...

1215
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,960
Just try and let Krista

1216
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,960
figure things out on her own.

1217
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,900
You mean, let her

1218
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,900
lose everything.

1219
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,130
If that's what

1220
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,130
it takes, yeah.

1221
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,170
I mean, if you can tolerate

1222
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,170
watching her experience

1223
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,910
the consequences

1224
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,910
of her own decisions,

1225
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,500
there's a really

1226
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,500
good chance that eventually,

1227
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,210
she will see the benefits

1228
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,210
of staying compliant.

1229
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,540
And Joanne,

1230
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,540
that's the only

1231
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,540
real shot she has,

1232
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,560
at learning how

1233
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,560
to manage her illness.

1234
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,040
What are you doing here?

1235
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,080
So, I brought you something.

1236
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,080
What's that?

1237
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,890
It's suboxone.

1238
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,890
I'll bring you more tomorrow.

1239
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,890
You should not have

1240
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,890
to suffer like this.

1241
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,600
First, you snitch on me.

1242
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,970
Then, you come in here,

1243
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,900
and you jeopardize

1244
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,900
my recovery.

1245
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,900
They catch me,

1246
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,640
I will never be able

1247
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,640
to practice again.

1248
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,140
Hannah, I was

1249
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,140
just trying to...

1250
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,140
Go.

1251
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,580
Go and don't come back again.

1252
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,550
Go! Go! Go!

1253
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,750
Get out! Get out!

1254
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,750
Get out, now!

1255
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,380
Hannah, is everything okay?

1256
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,270
Ben.

1257
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,270
Now, look here.

1258
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,900
I know you're used

1259
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,900
to running things

1260
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,900
in the hospital,

1261
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,340
but I am my own man.

1262
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,310
You do not make decisions

1263
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,310
for me, okay?

1264
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,120
You still waiting

1265
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,120
for your results?

1266
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,150
I'm sorry, babe.

1267
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,150
I just can't.

1268
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,020
What if it's bad news?

1269
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,020
What if the hormone therapy

1270
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,020
isn't working?

1271
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,000
Then we'll figure

1272
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,000
something else out.

1273
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,090
I'm gonna be with you

1274
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,090
every step of the way.

1275
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,330
I know you will.

1276
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,330
And that's what scares me.

1277
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,660
What's that mean?

1278
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,210
Ben, no!

1279
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,210
Maggie!

1280
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,510
You were by my side

1281
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,510
at my lowest.

1282
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,540
And now,

1283
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,540
you're in remission.

1284
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,710
You should be out there,

1285
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,710
having fun.

1286
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,110
Not stuck in

1287
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,110
the hospital with me.

1288
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,790
And there you go again.

1289
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,790
Telling me what to do.

1290
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:51,880
You don't get it, do you?

1291
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:51,880
You are my life.

1292
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,720
Sorry to interrupt.

1293
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,800
I come bearing

1294
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,800
very good news.

1295
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,360
What?

1296
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,900
Do you want to step

1297
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,900
into my office?

1298
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,900
No.

1299
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,500
Please, tell me now.

1300
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,880
The radiologist

1301
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,880
read your scans.

1302
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,880
No sign of a mass.

1303
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,070
And your blood work,

1304
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,070
it was remarkable, really.

1305
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,010
No detectable

1306
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,010
tumor markers.

1307
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,250
So, does that mean...

1308
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,750
You're officially

1309
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,750
in remission.

1310
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,900
After inseminating the eggs,

1311
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,770
unfortunately, we found

1312
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,770
that none of them fertilized.

1313
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,910
I know this is not

1314
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,910
the news you wanted,

1315
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,000
but it doesn't

1316
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,000
have to be

1317
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,000
the end of the road.

1318
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,410
You can start another cycle

1319
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,410
in as little as six weeks.

1320
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,220
We'll talk about it,

1321
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,220
and let you know.

1322
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,220
No. I'll do it.

1323
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,300
All right.

1324
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,300
So, what do you wanna

1325
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,300
do to celebrate?

1326
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,200
Spa treatment? Dinner?

1327
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,200
You name it, I got you.

1328
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,070
Just being with you,

1329
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,070
that's enough.

1330
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,070
Oh, come on! Come on,

1331
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,070
come on, come on.

1332
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,440
Weren't you just

1333
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,440
lecturing me about

1334
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,440
having fun?

1335
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,600
Yeah!

1336
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,270
Go big or go home.

1337
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,040
If you had

1338
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,040
one wish right now,

1339
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,610
anything in the world,

1340
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,610
what would it be?

1341
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,450
Honestly?

1342
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,920
Mmm-hmm.

1343
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,460
If... The only thing

1344
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,460
I would wish is...

1345
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,900
To spend the rest

1346
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,900
of my life with you.

1347
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,930
Are you serious?

1348
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,600
You better not be

1349
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,600
playing with me,

1350
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,170
because I'd marry

1351
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,170
you tomorrow.

1352
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,480
I'm not playing.

1353
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,010
Oh, baby.
