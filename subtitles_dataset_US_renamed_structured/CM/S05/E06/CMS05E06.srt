1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,490
Hey, Bert.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,130
What are you doing?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,690
These two people

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,690
went through

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,690
a terrible divorce,

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,200
they haven't talked

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,200
to each other for a year.

8
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,040
I just want them to

9
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,040
be happy. That's it.

10
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,710
Sharon?

11
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,710
Bert?

12
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,480
Toddler in Treatment Six.

13
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,480
Parents just got here.

14
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,140
If there are natural

15
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,140
options without side effects,

16
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,310
we try those first.

17
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,010
Perhaps a more

18
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,010
immediate treatment...

19
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,850
You mean antibiotics? No.

20
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,850
On the outside, he may look

21
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,850
normal, but on the inside,

22
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,620
pneumonia is notorious

23
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,620
for its slow progression.

24
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,420
You scare people

25
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,420
with diagnoses

26
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,330
and then you sell them

27
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,330
on treatments they don't need.

28
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,060
This is

29
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,060
the second time this month

30
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,100
that parents have lost faith

31
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,100
in your judgment.

32
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,690
No more. We're going home.

33
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,360
He needs these

34
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,360
antibiotics. Now!

35
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,360
No!

36
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,400
Hey!

37
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,400
Security!

38
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,500
Are you out of your mind?

39
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,500
Security!

40
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,010
It's okay, buddy.

41
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,010
Everything's gonna

42
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,010
be all right.

43
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,510
Open this door!

44
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,880
Well? Where are we?

45
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,190
In a better position

46
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,190
than we were four hours

47
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,190
ago, but barely.

48
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,050
Lucky for you, Kalmick

49
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,050
did some quick maneuvering

50
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,060
and wrangled up

51
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,060
a court order

52
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,060
to treat Lucas.

53
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,820
Well, that's a relief.

54
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,190
Still, there's no excuse

55
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,190
for your extremely

56
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,190
reckless behavior.

57
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,930
I made every effort to keep

58
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,930
Dr. Manning on a short leash.

59
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,870
I understand my actions

60
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,870
appear rash...

61
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,000
You locked that boy

62
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,000
in a room!

63
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,000
I didn't have a choice.

64
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,100
Kidnapped him

65
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,100
from his guardians.

66
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,610
They were risking his life!

67
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

68
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,240
Why don't we all just bring it

69
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,240
down a few notches, okay?

70
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,770
Dr. Manning, you understand

71
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,770
administering antibiotics

72
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,650
against the parents' wishes

73
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,650
and before securing

74
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,650
a court order

75
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,620
left this hospital open

76
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,620
for a major lawsuit.

77
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,850
Lucas' parents gave me

78
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,850
no other options.

79
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,760
Okay? They were unwilling

80
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,760
to accept the diagnosis

81
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,880
and wanted to leave

82
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,880
the hospital.

83
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,260
Well, she's right about that.

84
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,960
I want that boy discharged

85
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,960
as soon as possible.

86
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,240
Not so fast.

87
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,280
If you are in any way

88
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,280
compromised,

89
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,780
you need to recuse yourself

90
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,780
from this case immediately.

91
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,120
I assure you,

92
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,120
my medical judgment is sound.

93
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,820
I hope for Lucas' sake, and

94
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,820
your own, that that's true.

95
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,770
Hey, I heard what happened.

96
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,960
I don't need another

97
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,960
lecture right now.

98
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,960
I wasn't gonna lecture you.

99
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,840
I was gonna offer to talk...

100
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,840
I don't need to be supervised,

101
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,670
and I don't need your help.

102
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,940
Hey. Just cleared

103
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,940
two more shelves for you.

104
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,810
Can you just give me the guest

105
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,810
room closet? His and hers.

106
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,290
All yours, have at it.

107
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,550
And after we're married,

108
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,680
you know we're getting

109
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,680
a bigger place, right?

110
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,680
With a lot of closets.

111
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,280
Ah, yes, ma'am.

112
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,460
Good news. I got out of

113
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,460
pulling a double tomorrow.

114
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,460
Dinner and a movie?

115
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,860
I can't. Training a new nurse.

116
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,040
How about Saturday?

117
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,500
I got that Navy

118
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,500
recruiting event.

119
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,540
I do have a lunch break

120
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,540
from 1:00 to 1:30.

121
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,310
What are we gonna do

122
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,310
with half an hour?

123
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,210
Oh... I have some ideas.

124
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,340
See...

125
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,850
Time to hit

126
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,850
the pavement! Hurry up!

127
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,590
The gentle sounds

128
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,590
of Noah in the morning.

129
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,960
Coming! Bye.

130
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,960
Bye. Have fun.

131
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,140
What happened to

132
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,140
all that noise you

133
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,140
were talking? Keep up!

134
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,370
Hey, did you

135
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,370
hear that?

136
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,370
Yeah.

137
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,750
It's coming from the alley.

138
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,010
Come on! Get up!

139
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,350
I changed my mind!

140
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,350
I'm going to follow him!

141
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,440
Hey! Get off of her!

142
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,550
Hey!

143
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,550
Punk bitch.

144
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,020
Get off her!

145
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,020
Come on, come on. Let's go!

146
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,430
Call 9-1-1.

147
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,430
Okay.

148
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,090
It's okay. It's okay.

149
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,090
I'm calling.

150
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,170
No police!

151
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,170
Please! I'm illegal.

152
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,100
Okay. Okay, all right.

153
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,700
Hey. We work at the hospital.

154
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,470
We'll keep you safe. Okay?

155
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,470
No!

156
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,010
End the call, April.

157
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,710
What if they come back?

158
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,710
Just do it. Hey, hey.

159
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,710
What's your name?

160
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,910
Jacinta...

161
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,910
Jacinta, just stay put

162
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,610
and let me check you out,

163
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,610
okay? I'm a doctor.

164
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,810
Deep head lac.

165
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,980
Use this.

166
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,730
All right, look. We really

167
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,730
need to get you to the

168
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,730
emergency room, all right?

169
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,820
No!

170
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,820
I'm fine.

171
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,930
Jacinta?

172
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,930
Hey, hey, hey.

173
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,930
Jacinta, Jacinta!

174
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,400
Come on, man.

175
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,400
Come on, come on.

176
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,400
Stay with us. Jacinta.

177
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,070
Jacinta. Stay with me.

178
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,070
Come on, come on.

179
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,480
The bleeding's stopped.

180
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,480
IV bag is out,

181
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,480
I'll grab another.

182
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,480
Okay.

183
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,920
Where am I?

184
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,860
Jacinta, I'm Dr. Sexton.

185
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,590
My sister and I,

186
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,000
we found you after you'd been

187
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,000
attacked this morning.

188
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,590
You're at the hospital.

189
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,760
The hospital?

190
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,760
Yeah.

191
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,130
No. No. I can't be here.

192
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,000
It's okay.

193
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,000
We didn't call the police.

194
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,840
But you shouldn't

195
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,840
move right now.

196
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,710
You suffered a small

197
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,710
pneumothorax.

198
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,710
A collapsed lung.

199
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,840
I don't feel anything.

200
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,610
We gave you some

201
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,610
morphine for the pain.

202
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,840
Your lung should

203
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,840
re-expand on its own,

204
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,890
but you really need to

205
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,890
stay in bed for a while.

206
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,810
Meantime, you want to tell us

207
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,810
what happened this morning?

208
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,960
It's okay. I know it's hard.

209
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,960
Take your time.

210
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,470
You wanna start with

211
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,470
where you were heading?

212
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,570
To a friend's house.

213
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,000
Should we notify your friend?

214
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,000
No.

215
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,200
I don't want them

216
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,200
to see me like this.

217
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,470
Okay.

218
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,580
Hold that elevator.

219
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,870
Morning.

220
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,230
Sharon, again,

221
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,230
I swear on my life,

222
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,570
I had not a clue that CeCe

223
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,570
was gonna invite Bert

224
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,570
to dinner last night.

225
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,900
I found out literally a minute

226
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,900
before you walked in the door.

227
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,030
Yeah, so...

228
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,030
Literally, a minute.

229
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,340
So you said.

230
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,910
And now, you know,

231
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,910
he's asked me out for a drink.

232
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,380
Well, are you gonna go?

233
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,710
Of course not.

234
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,720
All right, somehow,

235
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,720
CeCe got it into her head

236
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,260
that, you know, you guys

237
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,260
need to get back together.

238
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,380
That it'd make you happy.

239
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,760
Is that what she thinks?

240
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,260
Listen. I am not defending

241
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,260
her actions or saying

242
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,260
I agree, I just...

243
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,130
I just hope you

244
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,130
understand that her heart

245
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,130
is in the right place.

246
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,030
Look, Daniel, uh,

247
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,030
I think it's wonderful

248
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,440
that you and CeCe found

249
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,440
your way back to one other,

250
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,370
I really do, but that's not

251
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,370
gonna happen with me and Bert.

252
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,770
I get it.

253
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,770
Good.

254
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,110
Then tell her, no more

255
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,110
surprise reunions.

256
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,240
You got it.

257
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,140
Dr. Charles, good morning.

258
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,080
Mmm. At least somebody's

259
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,080
happy to see me.

260
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,650
Huh?

261
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,650
What's up?

262
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,380
Doris told me

263
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,380
there's a patient

264
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,380
in Treatment Three

265
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,050
that's asking for you.

266
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,050
A Titus Witherdale.

267
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,150
Oh.

268
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,280
Not exactly

269
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,280
a name that you

270
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,280
hear every day.

271
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,090
No, it isn't. Grew up

272
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,090
down the street from me.

273
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,290
Shoot me his chart, will you?

274
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,290
Done.

275
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
He used to play soccer

276
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
with my little brother.

277
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,000
Titus... Witherdale.

278
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,170
I go by Claire now.

279
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,170
I'm sorry.

280
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,650
It's fine. Um, it's still

281
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,650
Titus on the insurance.

282
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,650
I haven't finished the process

283
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,650
of legally changing my name.

284
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,190
Good to see you, Dan.

285
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,650
Well, it is really good

286
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,650
to see you, too, Claire.

287
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
Ah, so, how you been?

288
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,460
I retired a little

289
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,460
over a year ago.

290
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,290
Ah. Congratulations.

291
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,800
Yeah. It was time to focus

292
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,800
on other areas of my life.

293
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,330
I hope I didn't pull you

294
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,330
away from anything?

295
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,100
It's just, I find doctors

296
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,100
can be a bit intrusive.

297
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,140
And I remember you as being

298
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,140
so sweet and respectful.

299
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,330
Oh. That's nice of you to say.

300
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,270
Um, so, what brings you

301
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,270
in here today? You sound

302
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,270
a little short of breath.

303
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,010
Yeah, it's been on and off

304
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,010
the last few weeks.

305
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,110
And, uh, I've had some pain

306
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,110
on the left side of my chest.

307
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,450
It's probably nothing, but...

308
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,820
Why don't I just...

309
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,820
I'll take a little listen?

310
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,690
Um, full disclosure,

311
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,690
I'm actually a psychiatrist,

312
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,230
but on a good day,

313
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,230
I still know my way

314
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,230
around a stethoscope.

315
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,700
So, why don't you put this on

316
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,320
and I'll be back in a few.

317
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,320
Oh, jeez.

318
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,990
You all right?

319
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,990
I...

320
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,000
It just it really hurts.

321
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,340
Okay. Okay. Lie back,

322
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,340
lie back. Legs up. Legs up.

323
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,210
Oh, jeez.

324
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,210
Here we go.

325
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,710
Oh, God.

326
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,570
Dr. Choi! I need you!

327
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,320
Phillip? What are

328
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,320
you doing here?

329
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,590
Well, I know I shouldn't

330
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,590
stop by unannounced,

331
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,720
but I just wanted to

332
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,720
bring you breakfast

333
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,060
'cause I know you were

334
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,060
working late last night.

335
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,260
And brought you

336
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,260
your favorite, chilaquiles.

337
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,740
Thank you.

338
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,740
And what is that for?

339
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,600
Our six-month anniversary.

340
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,440
Phillip, I'm so sorry.

341
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,440
I just... My head is all over

342
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,440
the place right now.

343
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,100
It's okay. That's all right.

344
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,100
You don't need to apologize.

345
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,170
We're still on

346
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,170
for dinner tonight?

347
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,910
Honestly, I don't know

348
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,910
how today's gonna pan out.

349
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,880
I mean, my patient

350
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,880
isn't even discharged yet,

351
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,290
and I have so much work.

352
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,290
It's okay.

353
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,220
You don't need to say

354
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,220
another word. I get it.

355
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,230
Just keep me posted, okay?

356
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,230
Sure.

357
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,220
Okay, well,

358
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,220
I'll leave you to it.

359
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,600
Bye.

360
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,430
Here we go, incoming.

361
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,430
Will, Crockett, you're going

362
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,430
to Baghdad. Level one MVC.

363
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,970
Copy.

364
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,370
David Bridges. Twenty-year-old

365
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,370
male. Car rolled. Ejected out

366
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,370
the side window.

367
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,940
Wild guess. No seat belt?

368
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,940
Correct.

369
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,610
GCS, three. HR, 125. BP, 100

370
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,610
over 72. Sats, 100 percent.

371
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,780
Tried to clean

372
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,780
him up for you guys,

373
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,650
but some of that glass

374
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,650
is in there pretty deep.

375
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,780
Appreciate the effort.

376
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,250
David, can you hear me, bud?

377
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,300
All right.

378
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,300
Transfer on my count.

379
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,300
One, two, three.

380
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,290
Thanks, guys.

381
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,290
Yep.

382
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,100
Bilateral

383
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,100
breath sounds.

384
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,970
Hey, David, can you hear me,

385
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,970
bud? Can you open

386
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,970
your eyes for me?

387
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,100
Fluid in his belly.

388
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,480
All right, let's find

389
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,480
the source of the bleed.

390
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,840
Chest and pelvis X-ray.

391
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,350
While this pressure's

392
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,350
still holding, let's

393
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,350
send him over to CT.

394
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,120
Get a panscan. Get a type

395
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,120
and cross, CBC, CMP, coags,

396
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,120
and a urine tox.

397
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,620
Hold on a second.

398
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,990
He's got a "No Blood"

399
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,990
card in his wallet.

400
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,990
He's a Jehovah's Witness.

401
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,800
Doris, let me see that.

402
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,030
Okay, card's almost

403
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,030
a decade old.

404
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,430
It was signed by his parents

405
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,430
when he was still a minor.

406
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,170
All right, well let's

407
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,170
get them down here

408
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,170
and ask 'em about it then.

409
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,710
Meantime, let's see what

410
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,710
the scans show, hope things

411
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,710
don't go from bad to worse.

412
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,220
Dr. Manning?

413
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,220
Yeah?

414
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,840
Lucas' latest labs.

415
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,220
How's he looking?

416
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,220
His temp just spiked again

417
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,050
to 102.2. Higher than before.

418
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,220
His sputum gram stain

419
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,220
came back negative.

420
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,390
It's not pneumonia.

421
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,360
I can double-check

422
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,360
with the lab.

423
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,660
No. No, that's okay. Just...

424
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,010
Okay. If it's not pneumonia,

425
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,010
but... Let me think.

426
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,840
What am I missing?

427
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,480
Draw a lactic acid and, um,

428
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,480
repeat blood cultures.

429
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,150
Keep his fluids at 100 and add

430
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,150
vancomycin to his antibiotics.

431
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,850
You think he's septic?

432
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,260
We're operating under that

433
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,260
assumption. For now.

434
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,690
Should I call Dr. Lanik?

435
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,690
No.

436
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,220
That is not necessary.

437
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,630
Hey. Check this out.

438
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,600
Looked Jacinta up.

439
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,080
She was admitted here in '07

440
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,080
with a case of food poisoning.

441
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,700
I thought she was

442
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,700
terrified of hospitals.

443
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,580
Yeah. And get this, she listed

444
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,580
a social security number.

445
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,450
Was it real?

446
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,450
Yeah.

447
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,420
Turns out she was

448
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,420
born in Indiana.

449
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,980
I don't get it. Why would

450
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,980
someone lie about

451
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,980
being undocumented?

452
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,390
Unless they really needed

453
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,390
to avoid the police.

454
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,220
I'm still waiting on your

455
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,220
second set of cardiac labs,

456
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,460
but it looks like you've had

457
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,460
a small heart attack.

458
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,590
Oh, my God.

459
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,900
All those

460
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,900
late nights at the office

461
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,900
and greasy takeout.

462
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,110
Didn't do myself

463
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,110
any favors, I guess.

464
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,670
Well, but you're

465
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,670
retired now, right?

466
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,180
So, plenty of time to

467
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,180
focus on turning it around.

468
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,640
Yeah.

469
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,150
We're gonna send you

470
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,150
up to the cath lab

471
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,520
so Cardiology can take

472
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,520
a closer look at the

473
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,520
vessels in your heart.

474
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,790
Oh, sorry, I must have

475
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,790
the wrong room. I thought

476
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,790
the nurse said that...

477
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,790
Excuse me, miss...

478
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,790
Oh, my God.

479
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,330
Melinda?

480
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,850
Wait.

481
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,660
Titus?

482
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,500
What's my ex-wife doing here?

483
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,780
You didn't have

484
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,780
an emergency contact

485
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,780
listed on your intake form.

486
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,780
I just used the most recent

487
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,780
contact in your records.

488
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,450
I'll be right back, okay?

489
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,450
Right back.

490
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,690
Excuse me. Melinda?

491
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,360
Melinda,

492
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,360
it's Melinda, isn't it?

493
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,720
Melinda, hi. I'm Dr. Charles.

494
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,560
I'm one of the doctors who's

495
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,560
looking after Claire today.

496
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,230
Claire?

497
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,730
That's his...

498
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,300
I mean, her name?

499
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,640
Yeah. Listen. Do you have

500
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,640
a few minutes, maybe

501
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,640
for a cup of coffee?

502
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,510
Okay.

503
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,690
Hey.

504
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,430
You all right?

505
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,430
Yeah, thanks. All good.

506
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,060
You're talking to the queen

507
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,060
of "got it all together."

508
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,060
Can't put one over on me.

509
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,000
Maggie.

510
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,840
I have been a terrible friend.

511
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,280
I am so sorry.

512
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,340
I should have known something

513
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,340
was going on. I feel awful.

514
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,440
Stop it.

515
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,090
You've got nothing

516
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,090
to apologize for.

517
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,690
I did my best to keep

518
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,690
my cancer under wraps,

519
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,450
and you had a lot going on.

520
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,730
I promise to fill you

521
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,730
in on everything.

522
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,130
Okay.

523
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,730
Now, spill it.

524
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,570
I was wrong about

525
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,570
Lucas' diagnosis.

526
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,610
I have been combing through

527
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,610
case reports and trying to

528
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,610
make sense of his symptoms,

529
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,780
and I'm just at a loss.

530
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,310
What if it is just

531
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,310
a sinus infection?

532
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,890
What if when I locked

533
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,890
Lucas in that room,

534
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,400
a small part of me

535
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,400
was doing it to just...

536
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,160
I don't know...

537
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,930
Prove Will wrong?

538
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,470
Absolutely not.

539
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,110
No matter what

540
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,110
you've got going on,

541
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,270
you would never jeopardize

542
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,270
a patient to prove a point.

543
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,340
Trust your instincts.

544
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,340
I've never seen them

545
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,340
steer you wrong.

546
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,250
Thanks, Mags.

547
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,310
Come on.

548
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,120
Hey, Monique. Will you

549
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,120
set up a punch biopsy?

550
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,700
I wanna sample the rash

551
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,700
on Lucas' arm. See if that

552
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,700
gives us any direction.

553
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,370
You got it.

554
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,370
Thanks.

555
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,880
Oh, baby.

556
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,880
Mr. and Mrs. Bridges, your

557
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,880
son suffered significant

558
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,880
laceration to the spleen.

559
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,960
Now, we already took him

560
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,960
to interventional radiology

561
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,960
to embolize it,

562
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,360
but he's still

563
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,360
actively bleeding.

564
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,460
I bought him that car

565
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,460
when he started pioneering.

566
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,520
I kept telling him

567
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,520
to get those tires checked.

568
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,070
Pioneering?

569
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,070
Spreading the ministry.

570
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,040
David has a real gift

571
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,040
for connecting with people.

572
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,640
What can you do for our son?

573
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,170
Well, we need

574
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,170
consent to operate,

575
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,080
which will require

576
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,080
giving David blood.

577
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,150
No. As Witnesses, we can't

578
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,150
accept any blood products.

579
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,880
Mr. and Mrs. Bridges, I wanna

580
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,880
make sure you understand

581
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,010
the severity of

582
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,010
David's condition.

583
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:10,350
Without this surgery,

584
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:10,350
it's unlikely he will survive.

585
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,380
We'll pray.

586
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,500
Listen, I'm a man

587
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,500
of faith myself.

588
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,940
But if you're praying

589
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,940
for a miracle...

590
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,510
We don't pray for miracles.

591
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:32,000
We pray that Jehovah will

592
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:32,000
sustain and comfort David.

593
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,740
Baby.

594
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,960
You went through my stuff?

595
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,390
I didn't. I was

596
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,390
just itemizing...

597
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,390
Just stay outta my business!

598
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,060
Jacinta, we just

599
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,060
wanna help you.

600
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,060
That's all we're trying to do.

601
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,600
I gotta go.

602
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,600
If they find me here...

603
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,760
If who finds you?

604
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,760
Is someone after you?

605
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,930
Listen, if you're in

606
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,930
some kind of trouble...

607
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,140
I promise you we won't judge.

608
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,810
And anything you say

609
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,810
stays confidential.

610
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,040
They...

611
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,480
They were jumping me in.

612
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,480
It's how you become legit.

613
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,320
Jumping you in?

614
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,320
Like a gang initiation?

615
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,980
You let them do this to you?

616
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,830
I knew you wouldn't get it!

617
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,950
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

618
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,120
You're right.

619
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,760
We do not know the first

620
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,760
thing about your life,

621
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,930
what you've been through.

622
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
But we really want to.

623
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,930
If you just...

624
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,930
If you just trust us.

625
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,950
I always felt Titus was

626
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,950
keeping something from me.

627
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,780
I tried so hard to

628
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,780
get him to let me in,

629
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,150
but eventually, I just

630
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,150
couldn't take it anymore.

631
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,780
Constantly being shut out.

632
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,250
Why didn't he trust me enough

633
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,250
to share this with me?

634
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,420
A lot of times, when we

635
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,420
hide who we really are,

636
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,520
it's because

637
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,520
we fear rejection.

638
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,660
We're scared of losing the

639
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,660
people that we love the most.

640
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,540
I'm not saying

641
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,540
it would have been easy.

642
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,680
I think I would have

643
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,680
tried to understand.

644
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,540
Well, maybe you have

645
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,540
that opportunity now.

646
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,720
No. It's too late.

647
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,520
Thanks for the coffee,

648
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,520
Dr. Charles.

649
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,890
You take good care of her.

650
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,630
You update that for me?

651
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,040
So, what? That's it?

652
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,040
We're just gonna

653
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,040
let David die?

654
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,900
Not up to us.

655
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,900
You heard his parents.

656
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,840
We just gotta hope

657
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,840
he turns around on his own.

658
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,880
What about using pressors

659
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,880
to get through the operation?

660
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,380
Hemoglobin's too low.

661
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,380
He needs blood and surgery.

662
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,710
I do one without the other,

663
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,710
I'm not a surgeon,

664
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,710
I'm an executioner.

665
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,050
How can you accept this?

666
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,380
Those folks obviously

667
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,380
love their boy.

668
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,350
So, way I see it, if they're

669
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,350
willing to take this chance...

670
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,390
No. You mean if they're

671
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,390
willing to risk his life.

672
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,520
For the Bridges,

673
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,520
the consequences

674
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,520
of receiving blood

675
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,990
are worse than death.

676
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,160
May not like it,

677
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,160
but we do have to respect it.

678
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,230
You may need a little

679
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,230
refresher in medical ethics.

680
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,510
Lucas, honey?

681
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,510
Desatted down to 89.

682
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,540
Call respiratory

683
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,540
for a breathing treatment.

684
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,180
Oh, my God. Honey.

685
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,580
You said it was pneumonia!

686
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,580
Why is it getting worse?

687
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,180
The tests don't

688
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,180
support pneumonia.

689
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,580
I knew it!

690
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,580
What?

691
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,450
Yeah, but your son

692
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,450
is still very ill.

693
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,450
What is wrong with him?

694
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,030
Well, coughing up blood could

695
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,030
be a bleeding disorder...

696
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,260
You expect us to

697
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,260
believe a word you say?

698
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,530
He's worse because you're

699
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,530
pumping him full of

700
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,530
antibiotics he doesn't need!

701
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,260
Get that IV out of my son!

702
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,260
Is everything okay in here?

703
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,460
We're leaving.

704
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,460
Come on,

705
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,460
let's go, Janet.

706
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,040
It's my understanding

707
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,040
Dr. Manning has a court order

708
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,040
to treat this child.

709
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,600
I don't give a damn

710
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,600
about any court order.

711
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,600
I am taking my son.

712
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,770
No, you can't!

713
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,770
Sir?

714
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,930
Get your hands off me!

715
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,570
Earl, please remove

716
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,570
Mr. and Mrs. Harper

717
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,570
from the room.

718
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,310
I'm sorry, but if you

719
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,310
take Lucas home,

720
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,280
you are putting him in serious

721
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,280
danger. I need to scope him.

722
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,550
Don't you lay

723
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,550
another finger on him.

724
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,250
Hurry. You won't

725
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,250
have much time.

726
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,650
Monique, transfer him to the

727
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,650
PICU and prepare the scope.

728
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,420
Dr. Manning, are you sure...

729
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,420
Do it! Now!

730
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,160
It's okay, sweetie.

731
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,470
When I aged

732
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,470
out of foster care,

733
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,470
I had nowhere to go.

734
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,250
Was living out of my car,

735
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,250
but I had to sell it.

736
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,610
You didn't have any

737
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,610
family you could call?

738
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,650
Just my cousin,

739
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,650
Angel. That's who

740
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,650
I'm crashing with now.

741
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,920
He's part of the gang?

742
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,090
He brought me in.

743
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,090
Yeah, they're my family now.

744
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,290
What if you found

745
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,290
somewhere else to stay?

746
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,300
You can't just quit.

747
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,300
They'll kill you before

748
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,300
they let you out.

749
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,960
Excuse me? Miss Nieves,

750
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,960
you have some visitors.

751
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,100
Angel.

752
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,610
Hey, cuz, how you doin'?

753
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,480
I'm fine. I didn't

754
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,480
even wanna come here.

755
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,480
Get dressed. We're bouncing.

756
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,010
Hey, I'm Dr. Sexton.

757
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,650
Jacinta actually needs to stay

758
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,650
and rest for a while.

759
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,210
Oh, I promise you, Doc,

760
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,210
I'll take good care

761
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,210
of her at home.

762
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,160
She's like a little

763
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,160
sister to me.

764
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,130
Did you ever get

765
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,130
Miss Nieves' labs back yet?

766
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,960
No. The lab's been pretty

767
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,960
backed up, but I can call

768
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,960
and see if they'll rush it.

769
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,730
Sorry, but we have to go.

770
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,460
You can call her

771
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,460
when you get the results...

772
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,870
It's really better

773
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,870
that she waits.

774
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,340
We just need to rule out

775
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,340
anything serious.

776
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,970
Hey, man, you want her

777
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,970
healthy, don't you?

778
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,910
Fine. We'll stick around.

779
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,680
Okay, I will show you

780
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,680
to the waiting room.

781
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,580
Damn it, man!

782
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,820
You should've just

783
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,820
left me how I was.

784
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,730
You shoulda let them finish

785
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,730
what they started.

786
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,850
They were beating you.

787
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,760
That's better than what

788
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,760
they're gonna do to me now.

789
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,170
What are you talking about?

790
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,900
If they don't get

791
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,900
to jump you in,

792
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,900
they sex you in.

793
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,850
Did you push the Versed?

794
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,850
Yes. We're ready to go.

795
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,280
All right, let's take

796
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,280
a look at his lungs.

797
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,850
Natalie, wait!

798
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,290
Lucas' parents

799
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,290
had their lawyer

800
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,290
look into the court order.

801
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,420
They just found out that

802
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,420
you started treating him

803
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,420
prior to having it.

804
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,590
The police are on their way.

805
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,190
Then this is my last chance.

806
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,130
I have to figure out

807
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,130
what's wrong with Lucas.

808
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,390
Okay.

809
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,430
Almost there.

810
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,040
Oh, my God.

811
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,120
There is massive amounts

812
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,120
of bloody inflammation

813
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,120
in his airways.

814
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,390
This is no sinus infection.

815
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,390
It never was.

816
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,090
Dr. Halstead?

817
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,090
David Bridges' tox screen.

818
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,740
Hey, cath lab just

819
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,740
sent Claire's results.

820
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,330
What are we looking at?

821
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Significant coronary

822
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
artery disease.

823
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,410
Cardiology placed

824
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,410
several stents.

825
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,570
And there's something else.

826
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,640
Claire's been taking

827
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,640
feminizing hormone therapy

828
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,640
for a little over a year.

829
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,690
And coronary artery

830
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,690
disease is a possible

831
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,690
contraindication.

832
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,590
And cardiology is advising

833
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,590
that she go off the hormones.

834
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,630
Does she know yet?

835
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,360
Not yet.

836
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,290
I'd like to be there

837
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,290
when you tell her.

838
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,160
Of course.

839
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,870
Hey, look at this.

840
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,810
I don't think

841
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,810
David's a practicing

842
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,810
Jehovah's Witness.

843
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,510
Because there's booze in his

844
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,510
system? That's a big reach.

845
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,110
His blood alcohol level's

846
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,110
three times the legal limit.

847
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,810
And he tested

848
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,810
positive for marijuana.

849
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,320
So, he isn't winning Witness

850
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,320
of the Year. Doesn't mean

851
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,320
he left the faith.

852
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,290
And his tattoo? You know

853
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,290
what it is? A symbol

854
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,290
for the Holy Trinity.

855
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,660
Witnesses don't believe

856
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,660
in the Trinity doctrine.

857
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,790
Someone's been studying up.

858
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,530
What if he converted

859
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,530
and didn't tell his parents?

860
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,370
Speculation, at best.

861
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,570
A tattoo is not

862
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,570
an advanced directive.

863
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,570
Look, fact is, David was

864
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,570
in the ED less than a year

865
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,570
ago with strep throat,

866
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,550
and put his parents down

867
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,550
as his emergency contact.

868
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,810
That was strep throat.

869
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,250
I doubt he imagined

870
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,250
they'd be choosing

871
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,250
whether he lives or dies.

872
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,720
Yeah, nobody ever does.

873
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,090
But if it were me

874
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,090
lying in that bed,

875
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,350
I'd want my family

876
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,350
making that call, not you.

877
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,260
Take this down

878
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,260
to the lab. Quickly.

879
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,600
You got it.

880
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,440
Stop right there,

881
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,440
Dr. Manning.

882
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,940
Lucas! You scoped him?

883
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,270
We told her not to!

884
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,440
Dr. Manning, I'm sorry,

885
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,440
but you need to come with us.

886
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,070
Hold on.

887
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,070
What are the charges?

888
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,780
Unlawful restraint, as well as

889
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,780
medical assault and battery.

890
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,510
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Harper,

891
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,510
Lucas has clots

892
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,510
and inflammation

893
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,110
in his lungs and airways.

894
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,890
This is not a sinus infection.

895
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,890
It is far more serious.

896
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,930
We want our son

897
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,930
discharged now.

898
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,090
Let's go, Dr. Manning.

899
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,600
No, please, if you wanna help

900
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,600
your son, okay,

901
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,100
just wait for the labs

902
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,100
to come back.

903
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,100
Do not take him

904
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,100
out of the hospital. Please.

905
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,600
I'll page Peter Kalmick

906
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,600
and have him meet

907
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,600
her at the station.

908
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,140
Absolutely not.

909
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,370
Excuse me?

910
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,570
The hospital's not

911
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,570
gonna protect her.

912
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,110
She got herself

913
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,110
into this mess. She can

914
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,110
get herself out of it.

915
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,920
Get out of my face!

916
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,050
Hey, I'm not asking you.

917
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,290
I ain't goin' nowhere.

918
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,960
You can either come

919
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,960
with us voluntarily

920
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,060
or you go in cuffs.

921
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,140
I told you not

922
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,140
to call the cops.

923
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,650
I was not gonna

924
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,650
let you put that girl

925
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,650
or yourself at risk.

926
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,580
The cops can protect her

927
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,580
better than we can. Noah...

928
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,850
Where'd Jacinta go?

929
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,290
Didn't you discharge her?

930
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,590
Wait, why do I have to

931
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,590
go off the hormones?

932
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,840
I thought you said they

933
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,840
were not responsible

934
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,840
for my heart disease.

935
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,260
They're not.

936
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,140
But because of

937
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,140
your severe atherosclerosis,

938
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,610
we want to

939
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,610
mitigate any factors

940
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,040
that increase your risk

941
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,040
of developing a clot.

942
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,870
What if I'm willing

943
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,870
to take the risk?

944
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,950
That's your choice

945
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,950
to make, Claire.

946
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,780
But the next heart attack

947
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,780
will probably kill you.

948
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,180
Claire?

949
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,210
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

950
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,210
I'm sorry, too.

951
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,990
I'm sorry I left you.

952
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,860
It's okay.

953
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,870
Mrs. Harper...

954
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,870
There's nothing more to say.

955
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,500
We've been put through enough.

956
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,170
I understand why

957
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,170
you'd feel that way,

958
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,540
but are you 100 percent sure

959
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,540
you wanna sign those papers?

960
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,870
We have always tried

961
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,870
to do right by our son.

962
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,380
We would never, ever

963
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,380
do anything to hurt him.

964
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,610
I know you wouldn't.

965
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,260
And I'm sorry you felt

966
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,260
that your devotion to your

967
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,260
son was in question.

968
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,100
You know, it isn't fair,

969
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,720
the medical community's

970
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,720
dismissal of holistic

971
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,720
treatments.

972
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,260
And it's created a lot of

973
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,260
mistrust on both sides.

974
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:08,210
Which is deeply unfortunate,

975
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:08,210
because it isn't an

976
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:08,210
either/or situation.

977
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,570
There's a place for both.

978
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,710
I just don't know

979
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,710
what to believe anymore.

980
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,280
All I want is for

981
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,280
my son to be okay.

982
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,410
Yes, I know.

983
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,320
And right now, your son

984
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,320
needs more than you

985
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,320
can give him at home.

986
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,950
Now, I'm not gonna

987
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,950
defend the way Dr. Manning

988
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,950
handled this, I can't.

989
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,650
But regardless

990
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,650
of your differences,

991
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,930
I'm asking you to trust

992
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,930
that you have the same goals.

993
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,940
Everything that Dr. Manning

994
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,940
did was to save your son.

995
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,680
Did you find Jacinta?

996
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,950
No.

997
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,320
Noah, I'm sorry...

998
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,320
I told you I had it covered.

999
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,950
You didn't give

1000
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,950
me any details.

1001
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,950
See?

1002
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,660
That's the problem,

1003
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,660
right there.

1004
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,600
You still see me as some

1005
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,600
knucklehead kid that you

1006
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,600
have to micromanage.

1007
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,140
You were making

1008
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,140
a huge mistake.

1009
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
Then it was my

1010
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
mistake to make.

1011
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,330
Just back off

1012
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,330
and let me breathe.

1013
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,940
So, wait you're saying

1014
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,940
no one has seen him at his

1015
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,940
Kingdom Hall in months?

1016
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,170
Has anyone tried

1017
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,170
to contact him?

1018
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,280
Well, what...

1019
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,280
Dr. Halstead!

1020
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,390
I'm sorry, Mr. Baker,

1021
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,390
I gotta go.

1022
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,810
Excuse me.

1023
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,290
BP is down 72 over 47.

1024
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,290
Heart rate is 148.

1025
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,300
Twenty-five grams of albumin

1026
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,300
and start him on Neo.

1027
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,630
Page Dr. Marcel.

1028
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,660
If we don't operate on David

1029
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,660
within the next few minutes,

1030
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,660
he will die.

1031
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,360
We already told you,

1032
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,360
it goes against

1033
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,360
our son's wishes.

1034
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,230
I don't believe

1035
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,230
you know your son's wishes.

1036
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,830
What are you talking about?

1037
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,970
David stopped pioneering.

1038
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,400
I just spoke

1039
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,400
with the Overseer

1040
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,400
at his congregation.

1041
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,380
David hasn't turned in

1042
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,380
a service report in months.

1043
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,180
And when he crashed,

1044
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,180
he was drunk and high.

1045
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,880
No, no. I don't understand

1046
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,880
any of this. There

1047
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,880
must be some mistake.

1048
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,820
What about this?

1049
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,930
Why would he put

1050
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,930
this heresy on his body?

1051
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Because he no longer

1052
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
shares your beliefs.

1053
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,330
It's not right

1054
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,330
he should die for them.

1055
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,250
Okay.

1056
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,410
What'd you do?

1057
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,820
The Bridges have

1058
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,820
abandoned their son.

1059
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,720
We now have the authority

1060
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,720
to make all decisions

1061
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,720
on David's care.

1062
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,160
Do the surgery

1063
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,160
and transfuse him.

1064
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,720
Open the Hybrid OR.

1065
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,720
Let's move.

1066
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,820
Let's go.

1067
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,970
Maggie.

1068
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,970
Nat.

1069
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,340
They said the charges

1070
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,340
were dropped?

1071
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,610
Yeah. Goodwin.

1072
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,610
She worked her magic.

1073
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,920
And what about Lucas?

1074
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,920
Is he okay? Did the

1075
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,920
lab results come back?

1076
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,010
Along with the rash biopsy,

1077
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,190
Lucas has an autoimmune

1078
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,190
disorder, granulomatosis

1079
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,190
with polyangiitis.

1080
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,760
GPA?

1081
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,760
Yeah.

1082
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,690
Wow.

1083
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,600
I have never seen

1084
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,600
an actual case before.

1085
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,860
Untreated, it would have

1086
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,860
attacked all of his organs.

1087
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,840
So, the parents came around?

1088
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,840
Yeah. Lucas has already

1089
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,840
started plasmapheresis.

1090
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,170
You saved his life, Nat.

1091
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,220
But, wait, I can still live

1092
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,220
without my spleen?

1093
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,190
Absolutely.

1094
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,190
You're gonna be just fine.

1095
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,000
Can I see my mom and dad?

1096
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,000
Are they here yet?

1097
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:30,160
David, I'm sorry to tell you,

1098
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:30,160
they were here, but they left.

1099
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,900
I don't understand.

1100
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,900
Why would they leave?

1101
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,410
When they found out

1102
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,410
you were no longer

1103
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,410
a Jehovah's Witness...

1104
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,210
What?

1105
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,210
What are you talking about?

1106
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,010
Well, we knew you'd need blood

1107
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,010
during the surgery.

1108
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,650
Blood?

1109
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,850
You gave me blood?

1110
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,100
Oh, I can't. I can't.

1111
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,030
No! No, no, no, no. No!

1112
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,260
Okay, David.

1113
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,260
Take it easy, buddy, okay?

1114
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,600
Take it easy.

1115
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,170
I'm sorry, David.

1116
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,330
You had alcohol and marijuana

1117
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,330
in your system,

1118
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,670
and the tattoo

1119
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,670
on your chest...

1120
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,670
That was a mistake!

1121
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,510
I was gonna get that removed!

1122
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,580
I was lost for a while,

1123
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,580
but I was finding my way back.

1124
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,710
I was gonna repent.

1125
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,720
What have you done to me?

1126
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,460
Hey.

1127
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,730
Hey.

1128
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,700
Any interest in

1129
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,700
a quick cocktail?

1130
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,710
Ugh. Not tonight, thanks.

1131
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,710
It was a rough day.

1132
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,970
Oh.

1133
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,570
Okay. Well, uh,

1134
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,570
another time then.

1135
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,050
Hey, Daniel?

1136
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,050
How about you?

1137
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,380
How was your day?

1138
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,480
My day?

1139
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,750
Um, well, you know,

1140
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,750
since you're asking,

1141
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,750
I think that I'm...

1142
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,400
I might've just witnessed

1143
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,400
something kind of remarkable.

1144
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,730
Yeah?

1145
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,970
Yeah. Two people who had

1146
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,970
hurt each other greatly,

1147
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,810
I think, becoming a source of

1148
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,810
real comfort to each other.

1149
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,280
Food for thought, eh?

1150
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,280
Night, Sharon.

1151
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,650
Okay. Guest room's

1152
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,650
right over here.

1153
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,360
Bathroom is down

1154
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,360
the hall to the right.

1155
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,430
And the futon's kind of old,

1156
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,430
but it's comfy.

1157
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,050
Oh, and if you get cold,

1158
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,050
there's an extra blanket

1159
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,050
in the bottom drawer.

1160
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,720
This is just for

1161
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,720
a couple of days.

1162
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,720
So you can rest and heal.

1163
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,450
Then we'll find a way

1164
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,450
to get you out of town.

1165
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,320
Dr. Sexton...

1166
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,720
It's Noah.

1167
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,360
Noah. Thank you.

1168
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,800
Thank you so much.

1169
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,350
He's doing well.

1170
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,350
Good.

1171
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,890
I promised Phillip

1172
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,890
I'd meet him for dinner.

1173
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,030
Hey, you told me

1174
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,030
to trust my instincts.

1175
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,930
And you should.

1176
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,010
Okay. Then that's

1177
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,010
what I have to do.

1178
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,460
Sharon. You came.

1179
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,300
Well, I wasn't sure

1180
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,300
I was going to.

1181
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,070
Please.

1182
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,470
You still take

1183
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,470
your whisky neat?

1184
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,800
Better make it a double.

1185
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,370
Yeah.

1186
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,250
Excuse me, miss?

1187
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,250
Whiskey, double?

1188
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,250
Whiskey double.

1189
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,960
Oh, good. I hate

1190
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,960
to drink alone.

1191
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,090
No, thanks.

1192
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,730
We're off duty.

1193
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,290
It'll be all right.

1194
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,970
Oh.

1195
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,480
Well, come on, you can say it.

1196
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,150
Oh, I don't like to kick a man

1197
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,150
when he's down.

1198
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,590
Especially when it looks like

1199
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,590
he's beaten me to it.

1200
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,520
Besides, you did

1201
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,520
save that boy's life.

1202
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,130
Yeah, but he thinks

1203
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,130
it's cost him

1204
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,130
his eternal life.

1205
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,590
I was convinced David

1206
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,590
was no longer a Witness.

1207
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,700
I couldn't accept the choice

1208
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,700
his parents were making.

1209
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,710
Yeah, you weren't

1210
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,710
altogether wrong.

1211
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,630
You heard the kid, you know,

1212
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,630
he was questioning his faith.

1213
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,010
I did the same thing

1214
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,010
to Natalie.

1215
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,640
What's that?

1216
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,770
I wanted to believe,

1217
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,770
because of her TBI,

1218
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,980
that she didn't remember

1219
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,980
she still loved me.

1220
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,890
The truth is,

1221
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,890
she chose Phillip.

1222
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,560
Right, that night in my car,

1223
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,560
she was coming to tell me

1224
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,560
she was engaged,

1225
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,820
show me her ring.

1226
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,820
I didn't wanna accept it.

1227
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,660
I don't know

1228
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,660
what she was gonna say to you,

1229
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,560
but I do know she wasn't gonna

1230
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,560
show you any ring.

1231
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,000
What are you talking about?

1232
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,240
Hey! Do you need

1233
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,240
a second to change?

1234
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,570
We can always go

1235
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,570
back to your place.

1236
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,670
I think the reservations

1237
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,670
will be held for, like,

1238
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,670
15 minutes or something.

1239
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,680
No. I'm not going to dinner.

1240
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,380
Oh!

1241
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,420
Is everything okay

1242
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,420
with your patient?

1243
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,420
Yeah. My patient's fine.

1244
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,420
It's about us.

1245
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,150
What about us?

1246
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,530
On the surface,

1247
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,530
everything seems perfect,

1248
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,510
but in my gut, it just

1249
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,510
doesn't feel right.

1250
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,070
I'm sorry, Phillip, but I have

1251
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,070
to trust my instincts.

1252
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,040
I can't marry you.

1253
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,570
Natalie, can...

1254
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,780
Please just leave it

1255
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,780
at that. I'm sorry.

1256
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,010
Natalie!

1257
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,450
He's been lying to you.

1258
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,450
What?

1259
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,590
He slipped the ring

1260
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,590
on your finger

1261
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,590
when you were unconscious.

1262
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,360
I don't...

1263
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,360
Wait, I don't understand.

1264
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,360
What does he mean?

1265
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,530
You never said

1266
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,530
you'd marry him.

1267
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,530
He made you think that.

1268
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,730
Is that true?

1269
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,640
No. Of course not.

1270
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,600
Natalie, look at him,

1271
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,600
he's jealous.

1272
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,770
He's looking at you right now

1273
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,770
and lying to you.

1274
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,250
You know what? It doesn't

1275
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,250
matter. Because it's over.

1276
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,880
Hey! Natalie.

1277
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,220
Hey, you stay away from her.

1278
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,790
From the moment

1279
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,790
I met him...

1280
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,790
Just stop.

1281
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,990
Look, I'm sorry. I just...

1282
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,990
I should've done something.

1283
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,120
No!

1284
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,120
Said something.

1285
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,170
Here you are again

1286
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,170
trying to save me!

1287
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,400
I can take care of myself.

1288
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,440
I don't need your help.

1289
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,440
I don't want your help.

1290
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,310
Please.

1291
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,310
Just get out of my life.
