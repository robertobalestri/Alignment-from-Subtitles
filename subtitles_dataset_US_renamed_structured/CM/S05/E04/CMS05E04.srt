1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,770
The infection indicates

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,770
flesh-eating bacteria.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,060
It's not a strain

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,060
that we're familiar with.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,150
Do you think this fire

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,150
has something to do

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,150
with the bacterial outbreak?

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,770
My gut tells me this fire

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,770
was deliberately set.

10
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,540
Patient zero,

11
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,540
Stuart Anderson.

12
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,090
He's been sending threatening

13
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,090
messages saying that

14
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,090
there's gonna be

15
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,420
some sort of apocalyptic

16
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,420
event in Chicago.

17
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,960
It's too late.

18
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,960
You can't stop it.

19
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,730
There are now

20
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,730
five confirmed cases

21
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,690
within the city

22
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,690
in the last 48 hours.

23
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,700
I saw what this infection

24
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,700
does up close.

25
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,170
If anything, people

26
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,170
aren't scared enough.

27
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,100
Hailey, is that

28
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,100
her blood on you?

29
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,230
She collapsed on me.

30
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,340
You stay right there.

31
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,340
Don't touch anything.

32
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,810
In the last 48 hours,

33
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,810
we've treated multiple cases

34
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,810
of necrotizing fasciitis.

35
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,190
That's flesh-eating bacteria?

36
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,690
No, it doesn't eat anything.

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,660
And it can be caused

38
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,660
by many different bacteria.

39
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,600
But it is fatal.

40
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,690
No. Only if it's not treated

41
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,690
in a timely manner.

42
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,740
Listen, there is

43
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,740
no need for alarm.

44
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,860
How do we know that?

45
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,210
It can only

46
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,210
enter the body

47
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,210
through a wound.

48
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,830
How can we be sure...

49
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,570
Listen, we will update you

50
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,570
when we have more information.

51
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,570
Thank you.

52
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,750
No cuts back here.

53
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,750
Looking good, Hailey.

54
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,120
How about your legs?

55
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,660
I just shaved them

56
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,660
this morning.

57
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,920
I'm gonna check them

58
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,920
for nicks, all right?

59
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,020
That girl

60
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,020
I brought in. Veronica.

61
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,020
Is she gonna be okay?

62
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Tissue is pale

63
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
and malperfused.

64
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,100
Damn.

65
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,580
I can't

66
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,580
believe this.

67
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,670
BP's tanking.

68
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,670
70 over 33.

69
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,870
Marty, I need more time.

70
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,110
I'm maxed out

71
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,110
on pressors.

72
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,340
She's in septic shock.

73
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,820
If we don't get her

74
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,820
off the table,

75
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,820
we're gonna lose her.

76
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,620
Yeah. Well,

77
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,620
she'll die in ICU if we don't

78
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,620
get this dead tissue off.

79
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,950
So... give me

80
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,950
five minutes.

81
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,630
What happened here?

82
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,130
I don't know, I probably bit

83
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,130
a hangnail or something.

84
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,130
Is that a problem?

85
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,520
She's in v-fib.

86
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,520
No pulse.

87
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,980
Start CPR,

88
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,980
and push epi.

89
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,280
Maggie, get the paddles!

90
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,780
Paddles.

91
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,720
Charged?

92
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,720
Charged.

93
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,990
Clear!

94
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,190
Still no pulse.

95
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Okay, one more of epi.

96
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Charge again.

97
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,190
Charged.

98
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,860
Clear?

99
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,860
Clear.

100
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,040
She's asystolic.

101
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,310
She's gone.

102
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,420
Okay,

103
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,420
stop compressions.

104
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,650
Time of death, 10:38.

105
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,610
I'm Dr. Ethan Choi.

106
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,610
Where are we headed?

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,010
Follow me.

108
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,010
Okay.

109
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,920
Ms. Goodwin?

110
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,920
Dr. Danover, CDC.

111
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,990
Ms. Goodwin.

112
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,990
Ah, yes.

113
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,990
Welcome to Chicago Med.

114
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,590
We have expedited

115
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,590
a response team, so we...

116
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,620
Hi, Andrea.

117
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,620
Will Halstead?

118
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,460
You two

119
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,460
know each other?

120
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,740
Dr. Danover and I,

121
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,740
were bio majors together

122
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,740
in undergrad.

123
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,470
It's good to see you, Will.

124
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,800
You, too. Wish it were

125
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,800
better circumstances.

126
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,780
You tell us what you need,

127
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,780
and we'll assist you

128
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,780
in any way we can.

129
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,640
Our goals are containment

130
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,640
and treatment.

131
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,620
First, we need to isolate

132
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,620
where and how victims

133
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,620
are getting infected.

134
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,280
Then, we need to determine

135
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,280
a path to treatment

136
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,280
that will prevent death,

137
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,620
and eliminate the threat

138
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,620
of infection.

139
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,590
All right, you have

140
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,590
free rein over our facilities.

141
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,590
But, Dr. Halstead, do you mind

142
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,630
acting as liaison to assure

143
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,630
all of her needs are met?

144
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,890
Yeah, sure.

145
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,890
We've collected some

146
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,890
soft tissue samples already.

147
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,670
Great.

148
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,770
I understand you've already

149
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,770
ID'd a sixth victim?

150
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,570
Yes. Veronica Song.

151
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,910
She worked in the lab.

152
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,350
I'll need to speak with her

153
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,350
as soon as possible...

154
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,110
I'm sorry. We just lost her.

155
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,850
DISPATCHER OVER RADIO:

156
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,850
Ambo 61, man down

157
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,850
from unknown causes,

158
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,150
45 South Fairfield,

159
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,150
apartment 12.

160
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,960
Did your call just say

161
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,960
45 South Fairfield?

162
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,150
Apartment 12.

163
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,690
We just got one

164
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,690
for apartment 10.

165
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,360
Could be a duplicate.

166
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,100
We got one for

167
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,100
apartment 15.

168
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,560
Fire Department!

169
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,420
Drop two milligrams of Versed.

170
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,420
Got it.

171
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,050
What the hell

172
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,050
is going on here?

173
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,090
Ah. Dr. Halstead.

174
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,460
I just spoke with Sharon,

175
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,460
and she says the only way

176
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,260
to get this thing

177
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,260
is through an open wound.

178
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,640
But we just got five cases

179
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,640
on a single floor,

180
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,210
so how is that possible?

181
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,410
Clearly, there are other

182
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,410
modes of transmission.

183
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,570
Yeah, maybe

184
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,570
an insect vector?

185
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,080
Like, tick? Mosquito?

186
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,210
Or, it could be

187
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,210
physical contact.

188
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,580
People shaking hands,

189
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,580
touching their eyes,

190
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,580
touching their mouth.

191
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,280
Oh, my God.

192
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,280
You don't know.

193
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,250
Heads up, Chief.

194
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,250
Coming through.

195
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,330
I've never seen a staph

196
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,330
this aggressive before.

197
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,830
Look, my people are out there

198
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,830
dealing with this thing.

199
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,930
I want to know

200
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,930
that they are safe.

201
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,900
So, I need more

202
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,900
than guesswork.

203
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,000
We have to treat that building

204
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,000
like it's ground zero.

205
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,240
Hey, hey.

206
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,620
Excuse me. Excuse me!

207
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,620
Trying to get to my vehicle,

208
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,620
thank you.

209
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,420
I got nothing for you.

210
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,420
I've got nothing for you.

211
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,790
Ms. Goodwin, we've gotten

212
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,790
the go-ahead to evacuate

213
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,790
the apartment building.

214
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,660
I want every resident

215
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,660
transferred to quarantine.

216
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,100
Okay, I'll coordinate

217
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,100
with Fire, CPD,

218
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,930
and we'll quarantine

219
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,930
the patients here.

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,660
And I'm gonna need

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,660
an extra set of hands.

222
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,830
Dr. Choi?

223
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,830
Of course.

224
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,300
Once the building's clear,

225
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,300
we'll see if we can

226
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,470
locate the source

227
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,470
of the infection.

228
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,470
Okay.

229
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,980
Sharon?

230
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,980
Yeah.

231
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,140
Brett says that there might be

232
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,140
upwards of 30 patients.

233
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,110
There's not enough room

234
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,110
in the ED to quarantine

235
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,110
that many.

236
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,340
You're right.

237
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,450
Uh... April? Let's set up

238
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,450
the tents in the old wing.

239
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
Got it.

240
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,850
We're dealing with

241
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,850
an infectious disease.

242
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,690
Three more people

243
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,690
are dead, Maggie.

244
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,820
Sharon, if you're

245
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,820
concerned about me being

246
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,820
immunocompromised,

247
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,870
don't be...

248
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,870
Maggie, you're going home.

249
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,900
But, I just...

250
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,900
Don't fight me on this.

251
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,310
No, no, no.

252
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,310
I've got a meeting,

253
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,310
I've gotta get to...

254
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,350
I'm sorry, sir.

255
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,350
Afraid you'll

256
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,350
have to reschedule.

257
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,980
How long is this

258
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,980
going to take?

259
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,220
We'll get you back home

260
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,220
as soon as possible.

261
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,310
Uh, hey, need any help?

262
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,310
Excuse me?

263
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,830
Dennis Quan. I'm training

264
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,830
to be a fireman.

265
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,660
I passed the EMTB test

266
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,660
last week.

267
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm scheduled to start

268
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,720
the Academy next month.

269
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,920
You live here?

270
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,920
Yeah. I know the terrain.

271
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,730
Well, appreciate the spirit,

272
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,730
Dennis, but we need

273
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,730
you to remain

274
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,330
a civilian for now.

275
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,330
I gotta get you in quarantine.

276
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,500
Whatever you say.

277
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,940
Manager says

278
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,940
there's a hold-out.

279
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,200
Sharlene Hughes.

280
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,200
You should check on her.

281
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,570
Let's go.

282
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,840
Ms. Hughes?

283
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,110
Sharlene?

284
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,620
You sure she's in there?

285
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,210
Yeah, she never goes out.

286
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,050
Open the door, please.

287
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,060
You have

288
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,060
no right to come in here.

289
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,100
Ms. Hughes, you're at risk

290
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,100
for having come in contact

291
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,260
with a dangerous bacterium.

292
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,360
You need to be examined

293
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,360
by medical professionals.

294
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,540
No. You keep away from me.

295
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,470
I'm sorry, ma'am,

296
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,470
but the officer will

297
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,470
remove you forcefully

298
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,910
if you do not comply.

299
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
Hailey.

300
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,960
Hey.

301
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,470
Did you finish interviewing

302
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,470
the lab personnel yet?

303
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,770
Yeah. No red flags.

304
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,770
We're checking on alibis.

305
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,900
What about people that

306
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,900
had access to the lab?

307
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,000
Vendors, security guards,

308
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,000
cleaning staff.

309
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,170
The lab keeps an

310
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,170
electronic visitor log-in,

311
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,340
so we're just

312
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,340
going through it.

313
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,910
Right this way, people.

314
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,910
Please find a tent.

315
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,180
Oh, man...

316
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,940
Okay, thank you.

317
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,350
All right, I'm gonna get

318
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,350
back to the case.

319
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,650
But the second I hear

320
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,650
anything, I'll report back.

321
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,160
Thanks, I appreciate it.

322
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,290
They did this

323
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,290
on purpose.

324
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,950
They're lying.

325
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,930
Ma'am, please, people here

326
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,930
are just trying to help us.

327
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,030
No, they're not.

328
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,030
It's the same they did

329
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,030
with Lyme disease.

330
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,260
And what did

331
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,260
they do, Sharlene?

332
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,260
Who are you?

333
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,170
How do you know my name?

334
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,170
I'm Dr. Charles.

335
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,940
And I know your name because

336
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,840
the manager of your building

337
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,840
gave it to me.

338
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,780
The CIA, they're behind this.

339
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,510
How? How so?

340
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,510
How does that work?

341
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,310
It's a biological weapon.

342
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,380
Just like Lyme disease

343
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,380
and AIDS. They sprayed it

344
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,380
all over the building.

345
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,010
And why?

346
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,010
Why are they doing that?

347
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,220
You know.

348
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,220
We're the guinea pigs.

349
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,060
You're gonna watch

350
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,060
and see how long

351
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,060
it takes us to get sick.

352
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,720
Oh, I see. You know,

353
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,720
that's a terrifying thought.

354
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,130
I can see why

355
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,130
you're so upset.

356
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,890
I need to get out of here.

357
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,970
Look, Sharlene. I know that

358
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,970
we don't know each other.

359
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,560
But I can see

360
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,560
that you're angry.

361
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,560
And you're... You're scared,

362
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,160
and I'd like to help you.

363
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,160
You just wanna drug me.

364
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,830
I won't let you.

365
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,040
Can I help you, son?

366
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,010
Uh... Yeah.

367
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,150
Um...

368
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,880
I think I might

369
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,880
have some information

370
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,880
that might be helpful?

371
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,500
So, this guy goes

372
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,500
to an interview for

373
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,500
a baby-sitting job.

374
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,440
And, today, he recognizes

375
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,440
the woman he talked to

376
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,440
from the news.

377
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,230
She's the Jane Doe

378
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,230
with the baby

379
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,230
who died from the bug.

380
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,860
They just

381
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,860
moved here from Utah.

382
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay.

383
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,840
While she's

384
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,840
interviewing him,

385
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,900
she gets in a beef

386
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,900
with an exterminator,

387
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,910
she doesn't want him

388
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,910
spraying near the apartment

389
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,110
because it's toxic

390
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,110
and she has a baby.

391
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,350
Guess where she lived.

392
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,420
45 South Fairfield?

393
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,020
Ground zero.

394
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,430
Hi.

395
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,570
Hi.

396
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,570
I'm Hailey.

397
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,200
Amanda.

398
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,270
How'd you wind up

399
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,270
here, Amanda?

400
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,810
I live in the building

401
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,810
where people got that disease

402
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,140
they're talking about.

403
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,810
Where are your folks?

404
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,550
It's just me and Grandma.

405
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,550
She was out.

406
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,490
They're looking for her.

407
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,490
She's at the River Casinos.

408
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,320
How old are you?

409
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,660
I'll be 15 in January.

410
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,420
Ninth grade?

411
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,760
That's a tough year.

412
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,100
Not for you, I bet.

413
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,300
For anyone.

414
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,070
All right, so, all of our

415
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,070
victims have come from

416
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,840
one of two places,

417
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,840
the CCU lab,

418
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,430
or this

419
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,430
apartment building.

420
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,180
Then there's some

421
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,180
mystery bug sprayer.

422
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,180
So, when was this?

423
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,910
This was

424
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,910
yesterday morning.

425
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,180
Well, it definitely wasn't

426
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,180
Stuart Anderson, I mean...

427
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,910
He was dying in

428
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,910
his hospital bed.

429
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,620
On top of that,

430
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,620
the OCD techs

431
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,620
ran the source code

432
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,250
behind

433
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,250
the threatening messages

434
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,250
on the college server,

435
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,190
Anderson's IP address

436
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,190
was spoofed.

437
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,290
Somebody made it look

438
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,290
like the threats

439
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,290
came from Anderson.

440
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,530
So, that's gotta

441
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,530
be our offender.

442
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,530
He's covering his tracks.

443
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,300
Hey, look, this guy had

444
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,300
access to the CCU lab.

445
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,830
He steals the bacteria,

446
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,830
then burns the lab down

447
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,830
to destroy any evidence.

448
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,770
So, let's track

449
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,770
where he bought

450
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,770
his bug spraying equipment,

451
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,310
and I want a full run down

452
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,310
on South Fairfield.

453
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,210
We're gonna nail

454
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,210
this son of a bitch before

455
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,210
he infects more people.

456
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,650
So, when we did

457
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,650
your initial intake, Amanda,

458
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,160
we didn't find

459
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,160
any cuts or bruises.

460
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,160
How are you feeling now?

461
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,320
Okay.

462
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,320
Any pain or numbness?

463
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,320
Does anything hurt?

464
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,450
No.

465
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,230
All right, well I'm glad

466
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,230
to hear that because

467
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,230
everything looks good.

468
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,360
I'll be back to check on you

469
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,360
again later, okay?

470
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,640
How about you, Hailey.

471
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,640
how're you doing?

472
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,180
I'm okay. How are you?

473
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,180
I should've asked you earlier.

474
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,730
I heard you got knocked

475
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,730
on the head pretty bad.

476
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,310
I'm doing fine, thanks.

477
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,310
Okay.

478
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,900
You guys hang in there, okay?

479
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,900
Thanks.

480
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,550
That was good news.

481
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,510
Yeah, I guess.

482
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,380
So, when did you know

483
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,380
you wanted to be

484
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,380
a police officer?

485
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,590
There was a sergeant,

486
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,590
her name's Trudy Platt.

487
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,840
When I was 12, this guy

488
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,840
robbed my dad's restaurant,

489
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,370
he pistol-whipped my dad,

490
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,370
stuck a gun in my face.

491
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,370
And they took me down

492
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,370
to the police department,

493
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,040
and I got to watch

494
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,040
the most badass woman

495
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,040
in the world doing her thing.

496
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,280
She commanded the room,

497
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,280
talked to officers and perps,

498
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,510
both like she was the boss

499
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,510
of everything and everyone.

500
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,960
And I wanted to be like her.

501
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,360
And now you are.

502
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,290
Not even close.

503
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,890
But, I keep trying.

504
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,770
Make sure to swab

505
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,770
all handrails and doorknobs.

506
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,070
Again, we are checking

507
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,070
anywhere people might

508
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,070
put their hands.

509
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,910
If this bug

510
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,910
is more communicable

511
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,910
than other strains of staph,

512
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,970
it could explain why so many

513
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,970
people are getting infected.

514
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,310
Hold on, I just got word

515
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,310
from my brother.

516
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,280
They think someone

517
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,280
may be spreading this

518
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,280
with a bug sprayer.

519
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,610
Bug sprayer?

520
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,820
Just found something

521
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,820
in the furnace.

522
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,440
Think you could take

523
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,440
anything off that?

524
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,400
Let's hope.

525
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,240
This is no outbreak,

526
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,240
it's an act of terrorism.

527
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,610
The bacteria in the nozzle,

528
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,850
it's the same staph

529
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,850
we found in the victims.

530
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,910
Okay.

531
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,450
So, now we start combining

532
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,450
antibiotics to extend

533
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,450
the spectrum of activity

534
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,860
and stave off resistance.

535
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,090
Now, if I remember

536
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,090
my microbiology,

537
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,130
some drugs attack the cell

538
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,130
walls, some the DNA inside.

539
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,140
Therefore, we have to hit

540
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,140
the infection from

541
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,140
multiple directions.

542
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,470
Now, there's the Will

543
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,470
I remember from undergrad.

544
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,110
Oh, my God.

545
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,170
Whoa. It did not look

546
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,170
like that a few hours ago.

547
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,110
I have never seen

548
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,110
anything like this.

549
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,290
It's reproducing so quickly.

550
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,380
It's unbelievable.

551
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,530
We need the people

552
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,530
from the university lab.

553
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,190
Maybe, they'll have some idea

554
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,190
how to deal with this.

555
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,360
Look, we still haven't

556
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,360
even ID'd the suspect,

557
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,460
let alone found the connection

558
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,460
to 45 South Fairfield.

559
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,630
So, I need to interview

560
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,630
the tenants of that building,

561
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,040
and see if they know anything.

562
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,310
Well, they're in quarantine.

563
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,310
And we can't release them

564
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,250
until we're sure that

565
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,250
they haven't been infected,

566
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,010
and that they're

567
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,010
not contagious.

568
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,750
So, I'll interview

569
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,750
them in quarantine.

570
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,320
A number of these people

571
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,320
are emotionally

572
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,320
extremely fragile.

573
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,190
I got one woman

574
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,190
who might even be psychotic.

575
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,820
She's definitely suffering

576
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,820
from paranoid delusions.

577
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,090
All right.

578
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,090
Well, you're a doctor.

579
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,660
Give 'em some drugs.

580
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,660
Sedate 'em.

581
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,250
I can't do that

582
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,250
without their permission.

583
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,490
There is someone out there

584
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,490
who targeted that building

585
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,230
with weaponized bacteria.

586
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,440
The key to why

587
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,440
may well be

588
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,440
within that group.

589
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,040
Now, you're telling me

590
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,040
some of these people

591
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,040
are emotionally fragile.

592
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,940
So, Dan,

593
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,940
then come with me,

594
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,270
keep 'em calm.

595
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,750
But I have to talk to 'em.

596
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,680
Upton.

597
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,790
Hey, Sarge.

598
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,550
Hailey, how you feel?

599
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,020
Like I should be

600
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,020
doing something.

601
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,890
I can arrange that.

602
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,770
Do you have any connection

603
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,770
to the CCU lab or know anyone

604
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,770
in the building who might?

605
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,240
No, I don't.

606
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,800
Yesterday, did you see

607
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,800
an exterminator,

608
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,800
a man spraying for bugs?

609
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,310
Oh, for God's sakes,

610
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,310
when are they gonna let us

611
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,310
out of this place?

612
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,470
If you're asymptomatic,

613
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,450
and your throat culture comes

614
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,450
back negative, you can leave.

615
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,810
In the meantime,

616
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,810
I would really appreciate it

617
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,650
if you'd try and answer

618
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,650
the detective's questions.

619
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,820
So, exterminator?

620
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,390
Yeah, he was wearing

621
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,390
this meth suit.

622
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,950
Did you see where

623
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,950
he was spraying?

624
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,730
Down the hall.

625
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,790
We have an ant problem,

626
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,790
so I thought that was why.

627
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,430
Can you describe him?

628
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,430
Race, height?

629
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,070
Definitely white.

630
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,070
I could see his face

631
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,070
around his mask.

632
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,730
He was on the tall side.

633
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,730
About 6 feet.

634
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
Anything else you can

635
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
tell us about him?

636
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,770
No.

637
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,410
Thanks for your time.

638
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,010
So, look, I'd like to,

639
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,010
um, take another crack

640
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,010
at Sharlene,

641
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,020
but I wanna

642
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,020
do it alone. Okay?

643
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,020
Okay.

644
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,490
Gimme five minutes.

645
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,490
Yeah.

646
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,360
Dr. Danover? Bruno Geller.

647
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,860
Hi.

648
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,860
Central Chicago University.

649
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,520
David Seldon.

650
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,520
How are you?

651
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,500
Heather Holcomb.

652
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,500
Microbiologists.

653
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,500
Hi.

654
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,190
Dr. Halstead,

655
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,190
Chicago Med.

656
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,670
Thank you for coming.

657
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,670
We hope you can help.

658
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,940
Do you recognize this staph?

659
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,540
Oh, my God. David?

660
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,650
That's E-87.

661
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,650
But that's changed.

662
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,640
How in God's name

663
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,640
did this get out?

664
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,840
Well, you tell us.

665
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,840
What was your level

666
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,840
of security?

667
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,780
Well, the highest...

668
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,780
Level four. There's no way

669
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,780
that could've gotten out.

670
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,520
Well, it did.

671
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,520
Why were you even culturing

672
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,520
something so dangerous?

673
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,780
For research.

674
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,780
Research for...

675
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,820
Well, we're working

676
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,820
to develop antibiotics

677
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,990
to help fight this kind

678
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,990
of resistant bacteria.

679
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, did you have any luck

680
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,000
finding anything?

681
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,830
Actually, we might have

682
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,830
been quite close, but...

683
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,030
All our data was

684
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,030
destroyed in the fire.

685
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,030
Yeah.

686
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,300
Incredible.

687
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,670
Well, Dr. Seldon, Dr. Holcomb,

688
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,870
you have experience

689
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,870
working with this bacterium.

690
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,680
Would you assist us?

691
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,080
Um, hold on.

692
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,080
But that research,

693
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,910
whatever remains,

694
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,910
is proprietary.

695
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,550
The university can't just

696
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,550
hand over intellectual...

697
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,020
People are dying

698
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,020
and you're worried

699
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,020
about your bottom line?

700
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,490
No, that's not...

701
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,490
We will help.

702
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,720
Of course, we will help.

703
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,720
I mean, at the very least,

704
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,090
I can help you to rule out

705
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,090
the antibiotic combinations

706
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,090
I know to be ineffective.

707
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,220
Great.

708
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,020
Let's get to work.

709
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,070
Marty,

710
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,070
I need that epi.

711
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,400
One milligram, it's in.

712
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,350
Paddles.

713
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,350
Two hundred. Clear.

714
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,050
She's still in v-fib.

715
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,050
Damn it. Again.

716
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,060
Charge. Come on, Lynn.

717
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,060
Don't leave us now.

718
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,290
Epi's in.

719
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,720
Clear.

720
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,570
Damn it. Asystole.

721
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,570
Another round?

722
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,300
No, we lost her.

723
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,300
Stop compressions.

724
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,410
Lynn Messick,

725
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,410
time of death, 14:42.

726
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,990
Has the family arrived yet?

727
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,990
Not yet.

728
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,330
Okay.

729
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,960
I'm going to put on

730
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,960
some fresh scrubs,

731
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,960
and get something to eat.

732
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,130
Find me when they're here.

733
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,130
All right.

734
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,970
It turns out that

735
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,970
you were absolutely right.

736
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,740
Your building was deliberately

737
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,740
infected with bacteria

738
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,840
that was very likely

739
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,840
genetically altered.

740
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,840
By the CIA.

741
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,780
They have secret

742
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,780
labs everywhere.

743
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,780
But you know all about that.

744
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,980
You know, I wish

745
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,980
I could convince you that

746
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,980
I don't actually know

747
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,280
all about that, but...

748
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,280
You're not gonna drug me.

749
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,850
Hey, that's fine.

750
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,850
That's your choice.

751
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,850
But, um...

752
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,760
Sharlene, tell me,

753
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,760
how'd you figure it out?

754
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,460
I mean, this person who

755
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,460
was spraying your building,

756
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,200
how did you know

757
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,200
that he was CIA?

758
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,830
You're just playing

759
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,830
games with me.

760
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,830
You're trying to trick me?

761
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,140
Sharlene, I'm just trying to

762
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,140
figure out what happened here.

763
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,140
I promise you.

764
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,270
I'm not blind.

765
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,270
I see everything.

766
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,970
From my window, everything.

767
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,970
The drones with their cameras,

768
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,210
the helicopters...

769
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,210
Yeah, but the guy

770
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,010
that was actually

771
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,010
doing the spraying.

772
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,710
How did you know he was CIA?

773
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,480
He wasn't a real exterminator.

774
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,480
He didn't even have a van.

775
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,820
Just a little blue truck.

776
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,820
It was so obvious.

777
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,980
I see. And what kind of truck

778
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,490
does the CIA prefer

779
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,490
these days, like, what make?

780
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,000
They change it all the time,

781
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,000
so it isn't suspicious.

782
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,690
Well, can you remember

783
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,690
what kind this one was?

784
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,290
A blue one.

785
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,700
The one with

786
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,700
the silver circle.

787
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,700
The silver circle.

788
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,000
Somebody help me.

789
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,000
I need a doctor!

790
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,670
Help me!

791
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,310
April?

792
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,310
Somebody help me!

793
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,170
Need a wheelchair!

794
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,170
I thought

795
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,170
it was a bruise,

796
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,300
and it's just

797
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,300
got worse, and...

798
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,500
We're gonna

799
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,500
take you to surgery.

800
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,870
Somebody, help, help, look.

801
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,870
Help! Look at it.

802
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,680
Come on, let's go.

803
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,680
Sit down. Cover it up.

804
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,910
Let's go!

805
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,760
That's Mr. Quan,

806
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,760
he lives next door

807
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,760
to me and grandma.

808
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,190
And he's got it!

809
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,190
Okay. We don't know

810
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,190
what his exposure

811
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,320
to the bacteria was,

812
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,320
how strong his

813
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,320
immune system is...

814
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,390
Gotta be stronger than mine.

815
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,390
I mean, he's always

816
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,390
working out.

817
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,230
Amanda, stop.

818
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,230
Hey, hey, hey,

819
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,230
calm down.

820
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,530
Look at me.

821
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,700
Breathe.

822
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,030
You gotta think good thoughts.

823
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,550
All right, Dr. Charles

824
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,550
pulled some information

825
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,550
off one of the tenants.

826
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,280
I don't know

827
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,280
how reliable it is,

828
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,280
but according to her,

829
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,850
the vehicle in question

830
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,850
is a blue pickup

831
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,850
with a silver circle logo.

832
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,120
Okay, so that's gotta be

833
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,120
either a Toyota or a Nissan.

834
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,120
Nothing domestic.

835
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,720
Well, I got Burgess

836
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,720
dumping all the pods

837
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,720
outside the building,

838
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,130
running it through

839
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,130
the Secretary of State

840
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,130
and CHRIS system.

841
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,390
All right, I'll get with

842
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,390
Ruzek and Atwater,

843
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,630
we'll go through

844
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,630
truck rental companies.

845
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,630
Beautiful.

846
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,070
I understand

847
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,070
your concerns.

848
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,140
I do, but let's take this

849
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,140
one step at a time, okay?

850
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,800
You're in good hands here.

851
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,800
All right?

852
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,610
Okay, Mr. Quan, I'll be back,

853
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,610
all right? Hang tight.

854
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,820
How's Mr. Quan?

855
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,760
Meds are helping

856
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,760
him stay calm.

857
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,490
But he's scared

858
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,490
and rightfully so.

859
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,890
Did he tell you

860
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,890
he wants to be

861
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,890
a firefighter?

862
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,100
Yeah.

863
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,400
So, if he loses his arm...

864
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,960
Not gonna think

865
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,960
about that right now.

866
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,170
We should get scrubbed.

867
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,180
I'll be right there.

868
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,950
Okay, trimming layer

869
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,950
of fat and soft tissue

870
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,950
from the infected area.

871
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,930
You nasty bug.

872
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,860
Where did you come from?

873
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,610
Come on, Quan.

874
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,610
Show me the good stuff.

875
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,200
Is it still spreading?

876
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,140
Always.

877
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,640
You're in deep,

878
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,640
you son of a bitch.

879
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,060
Let's go. Show me

880
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,060
some blood flow.

881
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,520
Come on.

882
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,500
Damn it.

883
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,230
None of the muscle

884
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,230
is alive.

885
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,470
You're down

886
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,470
to the bone.

887
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,170
Mmm-hmm.

888
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,240
You can't

889
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,240
save his arm, can you?

890
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,640
No.

891
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,750
I made him believe

892
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,750
it was gonna be okay.

893
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,020
Hey, there's nothing wrong

894
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,020
with pushing hope.

895
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,830
I would've done

896
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,830
the same thing.

897
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,860
Give me the saw.

898
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,370
When you

899
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,370
spoke to us earlier today,

900
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,040
you said we had nothing

901
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,040
to worry about.

902
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,170
Look, we didn't have

903
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,170
all the information

904
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,170
that we have now.

905
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,420
The key is to be mindful

906
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,420
of hygiene and sanitation.

907
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,350
Wash our hands?

908
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,350
That's the best you can do?

909
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,220
That was our own Jim Myers

910
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,220
with Sharon Goodwin

911
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,890
from Gaffney Chicago

912
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,890
Medical Center.

913
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,590
Truly horrifying...

914
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,630
Flesh-eating terror?

915
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,630
That won't cause a panic.

916
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,070
I spoke to them for over

917
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,070
10 minutes. Gave 'em facts,

918
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,070
precautions,

919
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,240
but all they show

920
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,240
are 10 seconds

921
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,240
edited to sell fear.

922
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,140
Well, what do you expect?

923
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,910
Nine people have died,

924
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,910
Daniel. I expected that,

925
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,320
maybe, this time,

926
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,320
they'd take the high road.

927
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,220
Goodwin.

928
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,400
You saw them

929
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,400
take him away!

930
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,660
We gotta get out of here

931
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,660
or we're gonna get sick, too!

932
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,900
Listen to her.

933
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,900
She's right!

934
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,900
Yeah!

935
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,100
Sharlene, I need

936
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,100
you to stop yelling.

937
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,100
Okay, please don't...

938
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,510
You're the problem.

939
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,510
Let me out of here.

940
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,900
Let me out! Let me out!

941
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,740
Let me out!

942
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,810
Let me out!

943
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,810
Everyone stay calm.

944
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,850
The lab is analyzing your

945
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,850
cultures as fast as they can.

946
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,520
And as soon as

947
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,520
the results are in,

948
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,520
we'll start letting people go!

949
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,120
Let me out!

950
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,120
I'm scared.

951
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,630
Amanda, I'm not gonna

952
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,630
let anything happen to you.

953
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,530
You stay focused on me, okay?

954
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,620
Let me out!

955
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,620
You can't keep us here!

956
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,690
Let me out!

957
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,930
Sharlene, I need you to stop!

958
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,870
If you don't stop,

959
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,870
I'm gonna have

960
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,870
to medicate you, all right?

961
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,500
Let me out!

962
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,840
Five of Haldol,

963
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,840
IM number 7, right now.

964
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,040
No!

965
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,040
We just...

966
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,040
Please, we just need...

967
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,810
Let's go! Let's go!

968
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,810
Run, everybody! Run!

969
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,780
You're making

970
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,780
a big mistake!

971
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,150
You're a danger

972
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,150
to yourselves and the public!

973
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,620
Maybe we should go, too.

974
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,560
No, we stay put.

975
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,560
We're safe here,

976
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,560
I promise you.

977
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,390
Wait. Wait.

978
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,000
Listen, no more questions.

979
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,000
No more.

980
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,200
You guys have been

981
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,200
misquoting me, anyway!

982
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,240
Ms. Goodwin.

983
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,240
Yeah.

984
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,150
We were able to round up

985
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,150
most of the escapees.

986
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,880
But Sharlene Hughes

987
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,880
and a few others

988
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,880
are still out there.

989
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,080
I got names and descriptions.

990
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,080
Kevin, you've got

991
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,080
to find them.

992
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,890
If they are active carriers,

993
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,890
they're putting themselves,

994
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,590
and the city at risk.

995
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,990
I got you.

996
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,990
Okay.

997
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,590
We'll find 'em.

998
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,590
Thank you.

999
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,920
You can't do this.

1000
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,920
What gives you the right?

1001
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,950
No skin-to-skin contact.

1002
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,950
Five feet apart.

1003
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,390
I want more food, blankets

1004
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,390
and water down here,

1005
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,390
right away.

1006
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,550
These people are exhausted.

1007
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,550
Yes, sir.

1008
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,550
Right on it.

1009
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,110
You took my arm.

1010
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,580
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1011
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,740
But we did

1012
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,740
everything we could.

1013
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
The infection

1014
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
was just too deep.

1015
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,090
What am I gonna do now?

1016
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,560
Well, we have

1017
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,560
occupational therapists.

1018
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,750
And I'll send one up

1019
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,750
to talk to you.

1020
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,090
Look, we saved a good part

1021
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,090
of your upper arm.

1022
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,570
All right, and when you heal,

1023
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,570
we can talk about

1024
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,570
a prosthesis.

1025
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,500
Mr. Quan,

1026
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,640
you are clearly a man

1027
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,640
with a lot of focus

1028
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,640
and determination.

1029
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,140
Now, I'm certain

1030
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,140
you're gonna find another

1031
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,140
place to put that drive.

1032
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,450
Okay.

1033
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,980
Now, I'll come back

1034
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,980
and check on you.

1035
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,340
Dr. Marcel?

1036
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,540
Nurse Sexton.

1037
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,320
Bet you won't mind

1038
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,320
when this day is over.

1039
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,360
You don't have to do that.

1040
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,730
Live life lightly,

1041
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,730
Nurse Sexton.

1042
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,300
Live life lightly.

1043
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,720
Ms. Goodwin?

1044
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,390
John Sorenstein from

1045
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,390
the Mayor's Office.

1046
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,870
You let 30 infected people

1047
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,870
escape quarantine.

1048
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
I expect it might make things

1049
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
worse than they already are.

1050
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,670
Have you made any progress

1051
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,670
on finding a cure?

1052
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,770
We're devoting all

1053
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,770
of our resources...

1054
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,770
So, no progress?

1055
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,610
You are the public

1056
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,610
face of this crisis.

1057
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,340
Everyone's gonna be looking

1058
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,340
to you for assurances.

1059
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,520
For God's sake,

1060
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,520
give 'em something, anything.

1061
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,580
Tell them we'll be toasting

1062
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,580
to a cure at Oktoberfest.

1063
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,180
You need to

1064
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,180
cancel Oktoberfest.

1065
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,020
Are you joking?

1066
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,120
It's one of the biggest

1067
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,120
weekends of the year.

1068
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,120
We're not canceling anything.

1069
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,630
Well, that's your call.

1070
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,630
But I'm not gonna lie.

1071
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,360
This city is on the verge

1072
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,360
of a meltdown.

1073
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,800
And if that happens,

1074
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,800
people are going to be

1075
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,800
looking to assign blame.

1076
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,800
I'm gonna make damn sure

1077
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,800
nobody's pointing

1078
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,800
a finger at the mayor.

1079
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,270
Yeah. Well, blame is

1080
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,270
the least of my concerns.

1081
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,070
But then again,

1082
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,070
I'm not a politician.

1083
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,140
People are dying, sir.

1084
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,140
And you're wasting my time.

1085
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,650
Hailey. Good news,

1086
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,650
your observation

1087
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,650
has been cleared,

1088
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,750
and your cultures came back

1089
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,750
free of infection.

1090
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,460
What about Amanda?

1091
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,430
I don't know yet.

1092
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,430
Her cultures

1093
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,430
are still incubating.

1094
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,830
I'll sit with Amanda.

1095
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,600
Thank you.

1096
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,430
Amanda, you're gonna

1097
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,430
be okay, too.

1098
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,080
All right? Look, I'm proof

1099
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,080
that not everyone in here

1100
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,080
contracted the bacteria.

1101
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,580
I had my hand covered in it,

1102
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,580
ample opportunity to get it.

1103
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,680
You know what?

1104
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,680
I gotta go back

1105
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,680
to work.

1106
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,120
But Dr. Manning's

1107
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,120
gonna take my place.

1108
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,690
Okay.

1109
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,800
Could you see if they

1110
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,800
found my grandma?

1111
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,860
Yeah, I'll check.

1112
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,130
Remember, only

1113
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,130
good thoughts, okay?

1114
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,150
So, Amanda,

1115
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,150
what are you into?

1116
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,480
YouTube clips? Memes?

1117
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,480
Give it to me.

1118
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,860
Amanda, what's wrong?

1119
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,190
My leg, it feels weird here.

1120
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,190
Kind of, like, numb.

1121
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,130
All right, let me see.

1122
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,130
When did this sensation start?

1123
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,060
I don't... I don't know,

1124
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,060
a few minutes ago.

1125
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,170
Come on.

1126
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,170
Let's get you upstairs,

1127
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,830
and see what's going on

1128
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,830
with that leg, okay?

1129
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,040
Ah, there she is.

1130
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,040
You all right?

1131
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,550
Flesh-eating-bacteria-free.

1132
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,590
Glad you're okay.

1133
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,590
Thanks.

1134
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,850
You okay to work?

1135
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,850
Yeah, all set.

1136
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,390
Good.

1137
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,390
We got something, guys.

1138
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,520
All right.

1139
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,190
I got a blue pickup truck

1140
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,190
two blocks away

1141
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,190
from the apartment,

1142
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,760
right in our time frame,

1143
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,760
and check this out.

1144
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,360
Hazmat suit.

1145
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,860
License plate?

1146
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,100
LEADS has

1147
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,100
the vehicle registered

1148
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,200
to Mersh Equipment Vehicle

1149
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,200
and Rental.

1150
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,680
You and Ruzek. Let's go.

1151
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,480
Looks like the bacteria

1152
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,480
are sensitive to the Vanc.

1153
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,600
I know. Great.

1154
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,240
No, it's not.

1155
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,450
Damn it.

1156
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,820
The Vancomycin

1157
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,820
is only bacteriostatic.

1158
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,050
It's slowing the infection,

1159
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,600
but it's not

1160
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,600
actually killing it.

1161
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,650
We need something that works

1162
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,650
stronger and faster.

1163
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,330
Try gentamicin, then?

1164
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,330
Dose it higher?

1165
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,330
Yeah.

1166
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,330
Let's do it.

1167
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,980
How are you doing, Amanda?

1168
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,980
You all right in there?

1169
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,570
I'm trying.

1170
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,570
Okay. We're almost

1171
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,570
done here, okay?

1172
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,950
Image is up.

1173
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,990
There it is.

1174
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,990
Air and fluid in

1175
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,990
the deep fascia.

1176
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,120
Yeah.

1177
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,480
Ow!

1178
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,130
Dr. Manning!

1179
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,490
You all right?

1180
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,490
It really hurts.

1181
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,930
I feel something moving.

1182
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,600
All right, just take

1183
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,600
a deep breath, okay?

1184
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,470
Keep breathing.

1185
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,470
I'll take a look, okay?

1186
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,940
Oh, no! No, no, no, no!

1187
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,880
Call the OR, and tell them

1188
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,880
we're on our way up.

1189
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,540
And get me

1190
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,540
an isolation gurney. Now!

1191
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,940
It's okay. We're gonna

1192
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,940
take care of this, all right?

1193
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,180
Just keep breathing.

1194
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,290
Am I gonna die?

1195
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,290
No, you're not.

1196
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,860
We caught this very early.

1197
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,860
Dr. Marcel is gonna

1198
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,860
fix your leg.

1199
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,840
Amanda?

1200
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,840
Hailey!

1201
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,740
I'm right here. I just heard.

1202
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,200
Let's go.

1203
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,210
Everything's gonna be okay.

1204
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,380
Thanks.

1205
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,490
What's up, Dalton?

1206
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,060
Uh, the sky.

1207
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,270
Yeah, let me tell you,

1208
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,270
we're not in the mood

1209
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,270
for that.

1210
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,500
What'd you need?

1211
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,270
Blue Nissan Pickup,

1212
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,270
Wisconsin license plate

1213
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,270
WXT-221.

1214
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,600
We need a list of who rented

1215
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,600
it in the last two weeks.

1216
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,840
Okay, y'all have a warrant,

1217
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,840
or what's going on...

1218
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,510
Listen, we don't have

1219
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,510
time for this, pal. All right?

1220
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,180
We're working the infection

1221
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,180
case that's already killed

1222
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,180
a half-dozen people.

1223
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,340
So, we need you to focus,

1224
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,340
we need you to

1225
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,340
answer our questions.

1226
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,510
Blue Nissan.

1227
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,350
Yeah.

1228
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,060
Yeah, that pickup's

1229
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,060
only been rented once.

1230
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,720
I got a name,

1231
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,720
but it's Mike Smith.

1232
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,720
He paid cash. So...

1233
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,120
When?

1234
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,690
Uh, three days ago.

1235
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,100
Okay, let's try

1236
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,100
a little harder?

1237
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,100
Okay, what time?

1238
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,800
Morning? Afternoon? When?

1239
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,900
Yeah, yeah. Afternoon,

1240
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,900
it was right before

1241
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,900
I ate my lunch.

1242
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,940
I take my break at 2:00.

1243
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,940
So, it was right around then.

1244
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,310
Great.

1245
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,310
What did he look like?

1246
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:38,320
Oh, white guy. Um, yea big.

1247
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:38,320
Kinda his height.

1248
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:38,320
I think he had a blue hat.

1249
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,320
Is there a video?

1250
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,320
Yeah, yeah.

1251
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,120
But it's hosted off-site.

1252
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,120
So, security company's

1253
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,660
gonna have to dropbox you

1254
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,660
the footage.

1255
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,990
Call them. We want footage

1256
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,990
for the entire day.

1257
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,390
Right on.

1258
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,400
Now, Dalton.

1259
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,400
Yup, you got it.

1260
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,230
NEWSCASTER ON TV:

1261
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,230
An as yet undisclosed

1262
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,230
number of patients

1263
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,770
who fled quarantine

1264
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,770
remain at large.

1265
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,100
Authorities are working

1266
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,100
diligently to track

1267
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,100
them down...

1268
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,610
It's wall-to-wall coverage

1269
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,610
with this now.

1270
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,730
While there is still

1271
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,730
no sign of a cure...

1272
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,440
Yep. Cindy called.

1273
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,440
They're closing Luke's school.

1274
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:11,420
Seems that somebody over

1275
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:11,420
at that building happens

1276
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:11,420
to be a janitor over there,

1277
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,010
and now a bunch of

1278
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,010
the parents are demanding

1279
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,990
that the entire place

1280
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,990
get disinfected.

1281
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:20,090
Guys, this is that restaurant

1282
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:20,090
up the street we go to,

1283
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,420
Garcia's Hacienda.

1284
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,960
What the hell?

1285
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,360
It's one of those

1286
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,360
conspiracy sites.

1287
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,630
It's trending on Twitter.

1288
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,790
What's it say?

1289
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:34,330
That the outbreak is some kind

1290
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:34,330
of MS-13 El Salvadoran plot

1291
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,840
to get revenge on America.

1292
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,850
Mama Garcia must be

1293
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,850
somehow involved

1294
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,440
because her food truck

1295
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,440
was over at Soldier Field,

1296
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,710
and her restaurant is

1297
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,710
only a half a block

1298
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,550
from the quarantined

1299
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,550
apartment buildings.

1300
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,820
That's ridiculous.

1301
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,690
Mama Garcia is pretty much

1302
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,690
the sweetest lady in Chicago.

1303
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,700
Those who must commute

1304
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,700
via train or bus

1305
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,660
are wearing store-bought

1306
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,660
protective gear...

1307
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,530
That's the kind of news

1308
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,530
that gets people killed.

1309
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,570
...to remain calm.

1310
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,200
In the next hour

1311
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,200
we'll be speaking

1312
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,200
with a representative

1313
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,210
from the CDC, who will

1314
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,210
give us a status report

1315
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,640
on their research progress.

1316
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,640
Truck 81,

1317
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,640
public disturbance...

1318
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,060
Blue hat,

1319
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,060
right before 2:00.

1320
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,360
Got it.

1321
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,410
I know this guy.

1322
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,410
He works at the CCU lab.

1323
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,220
You see, Heather,

1324
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,220
why don't you join

1325
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,220
the others, get a bite.

1326
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,090
Yeah. I could use it.

1327
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,210
Bring you something?

1328
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,760
No. No, I'm good. Thanks.

1329
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,550
What're you doing?

1330
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,650
I'm sorry?

1331
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,990
You're destroying our work.

1332
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,960
Oh, no. No, these were

1333
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,960
contaminated samples.

1334
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,060
You know what?

1335
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,060
You need to stay right here.
