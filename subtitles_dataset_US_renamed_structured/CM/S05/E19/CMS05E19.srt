1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,000
That day, when I found out

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,000
I couldn't have children...

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,370
You pushed me away

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,370
and ran into

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,370
another man's arms.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,870
This is Auggie.

7
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,870
One of my students.

8
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,530
I haven't been

9
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,530
able to reach his foster mom.

10
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,140
It's too much,

11
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,140
and I can't...

12
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,840
No one wants a sick kid.

13
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,550
DCFS is gonna start

14
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,550
looking for a new foster

15
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,550
placement tomorrow.

16
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,880
And we'll spend

17
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,880
the night with Auggie.

18
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,510
You wanna come up?

19
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,720
I just wonder

20
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,720
if that's

21
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,720
a good idea.

22
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,020
There's actually

23
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,020
very little difference

24
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,020
between drug addiction...

25
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,490
And romance addiction?

26
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,050
Let's go up

27
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,050
and discuss it.

28
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,190
Did you really use

29
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,190
all of my floss?

30
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,540
I told you, if we're gonna

31
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,540
keep doing this,

32
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,830
I need a toothbrush.

33
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,970
I don't know.

34
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,700
I feel like it gives a guy

35
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,700
too great a sense of security.

36
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,570
Or does it just

37
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,570
prevent cavities?

38
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,410
No, that is

39
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,410
a gateway toiletry.

40
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,540
And before I know it,

41
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,240
you're gonna have your

42
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,240
own curling iron here,

43
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,110
you'll have your

44
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,110
own loofah...

45
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,190
You've clearly given this

46
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,190
a great deal of thought.

47
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,410
Maybe a little bit.

48
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,590
It's been a really

49
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,590
good couple of weeks.

50
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,020
Yeah, it has.

51
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,990
And not just us.

52
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,660
You've been knocking it

53
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,660
out of the park.

54
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
I mean, work.

55
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
Everything. Rehab.

56
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,930
I'm really

57
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,930
proud of you.

58
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,480
Just so you know,

59
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,920
the more you kiss me,

60
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,260
the more it makes

61
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,260
me think I should get

62
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,260
you that toothbrush.

63
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,590
Oh, yeah?

64
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,590
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

65
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,020
What's nice is

66
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,020
as we progress

67
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,020
through the surgery

68
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,400
we can slide

69
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,400
the retractor down,

70
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,400
there you go,

71
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,130
go ahead and bring

72
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,130
that blade down.

73
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,570
Now, you wanna keep

74
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,570
the most tension on,

75
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,870
so go ahead

76
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,870
and tighten it up.

77
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,070
Hey, April?

78
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,970
Never mind.

79
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,970
Ethan!

80
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,310
Ethan, hey.

81
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,050
He was showing me

82
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,050
some new equipment.

83
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,050
I'm sure he was.

84
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,460
I'm his Hybrid OR nurse.

85
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,460
You know that.

86
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,290
Learning is part

87
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,290
of the job.

88
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,290
Right.

89
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,620
What is this?

90
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,590
You're sleeping

91
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,590
on the couch,

92
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,430
you want nothing

93
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,430
to do with me.

94
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,830
Why do you care?

95
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,300
Hey, Dr. Marcel,

96
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,300
I'm sorry.

97
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,440
No, it's all good.

98
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,980
I gotta deal with some

99
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,980
inventory anyway.

100
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,170
We'll finish up later.

101
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,210
Morning, Dr. Manning.

102
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,210
Morning, Crockett.

103
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,810
How's your day?

104
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,810
Great.

105
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,150
You realize you say

106
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,150
that every day.

107
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,520
Every day is great.

108
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,180
We got two

109
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,180
traumas coming in.

110
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,620
Dr. Choi!

111
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,620
You're going to Two.

112
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,320
Dr. Marcel?

113
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,320
Take her to Baghdad.

114
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,320
Copy.

115
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,160
What do we got?

116
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,000
Zach Brand, 15,

117
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,000
says he fell off

118
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,000
an overpass.

119
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,300
Is that true?

120
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,300
You fell?

121
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,390
Fractured his left arm,

122
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,560
he's got a pretty good

123
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,560
bruise on his head.

124
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,700
GCS 13, pressure

125
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,700
and heart rate

126
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,700
are good.

127
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,740
All right, Zach.

128
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,740
Any of this hurt?

129
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,740
Uh-uh.

130
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,210
All right.

131
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,210
He looks stable,

132
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,640
but let's get a chest

133
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,640
X-ray and a pan scan

134
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,640
just to be safe.

135
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,150
Let's get ready to transfer.

136
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,150
Wait a second.

137
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,120
Zach, where did this

138
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,120
glass come from?

139
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,680
Zach?

140
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,350
We'll figure this out.

141
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,980
All right, let's transfer

142
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,980
on my count. Ready?

143
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,980
One, two, three.

144
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,520
I've got Terrie Cross,

145
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,520
intubated in the field.

146
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,060
Status post-MVC,

147
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,060
car versus divider,

148
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,490
GCS 3T, BP 95 over 60,

149
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,260
heart rate 130,

150
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,260
satting at 86%.

151
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,500
Yeah, I'm not

152
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,500
liking this rhythm.

153
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,660
Gimme an EKG with

154
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,660
trops and trauma labs.

155
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,660
Let's go.

156
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,710
She's coding.

157
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,710
No pulse.

158
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,170
Get him up for those scans.

159
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,170
I'll check in as soon

160
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,170
as you're back.

161
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,770
Here we go.

162
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,710
Come on, folks.

163
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,710
We know what this is.

164
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,580
What's up?

165
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,580
She's in v-fib.

166
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,580
Let's go.

167
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,920
On my count.

168
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,920
One, two, three.

169
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,150
Gimme the paddles.

170
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,150
Charge to 200.

171
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,720
She could be in

172
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,720
blunt cardiac arrest.

173
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,920
Charged.

174
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,920
Open it up.

175
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,190
Clear.

176
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,860
I got a pulse.

177
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,860
Sinus tach.

178
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,060
For now.

179
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,060
What happened?

180
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,430
Single vehicle crash.

181
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,430
Any drugs or alcohol

182
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,430
on board?

183
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,630
Rapid tox

184
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,630
was negative.

185
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,230
Why'd she hit the median?

186
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,230
Stroke? Seizure?

187
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,940
Wait, wait, wait.

188
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,940
She's got glass

189
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,940
shards on her.

190
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,810
So does the kid in Trauma Two.

191
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,810
It's from her windshield.

192
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,780
How do you know?

193
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,780
He fell off an overpass.

194
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,180
And landed on her.

195
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,490
No breath sounds

196
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,490
on the left.

197
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,500
Let's set her up

198
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,500
for a chest tube.

199
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,500
What do you got?

200
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
Some fluid on the right,

201
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
but I can't find her spleen.

202
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,260
What do you mean

203
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,260
you can't find it?

204
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,500
I mean it's not there.

205
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,800
It's gotta

206
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,800
be in there

207
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,800
somewhere.

208
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,340
Go back up.

209
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,240
Right there.

210
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,340
That's the tip.

211
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,470
Can't be.

212
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,470
It's too high.

213
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,020
That's right, 'cause

214
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,020
it's in her chest.

215
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,610
All right.

216
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,610
She must've ruptured

217
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,610
her diaphragm.

218
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,920
Chest tube's ready.

219
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,920
Nope, she's hypotensive.

220
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,120
We're going to

221
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,120
the Hybrid OR, now.

222
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,620
No, no, no, no. Stop.

223
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,620
If it's a tension pneumo,

224
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,990
we can't move her

225
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,990
till we decompress the lung.

226
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,150
There's no time.

227
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,150
I'll do it in the OR.

228
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,150
Let's go. Come on.

229
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,530
Easy, easy.

230
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,030
We just

231
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,030
wanted to come

232
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,030
say a quick hello

233
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,470
before we finished up

234
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,470
the paperwork.

235
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,670
Of course.

236
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,300
Maggie,

237
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,300
Madeline's found

238
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,810
foster parents

239
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,810
for Auggie.

240
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,540
That's great.

241
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,540
He can't wait to get

242
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,540
out of the hospital.

243
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,720
So?

244
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,720
What a sweet kid.

245
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,820
He is.

246
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,020
Except when he doesn't get

247
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,020
his Nutella for breakfast.

248
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,560
Oh, and he doesn't

249
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,560
like anything but

250
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,560
bubblegum toothpaste.

251
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,290
No fruit flavors and

252
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,290
definitely not mint.

253
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,390
As you can see,

254
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,400
Maggie has become

255
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,400
quite attached in the

256
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,400
past couple of weeks.

257
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,700
We know how it is.

258
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,830
We've been fostering

259
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,830
for 12 years.

260
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,070
Auggie is going

261
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,070
to a loving family.

262
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,140
So let's cross the T's,

263
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,140
dot the I's,

264
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,200
hopefully you'll be

265
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,200
able to take him

266
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,200
home tonight.

267
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,150
Who's winning?

268
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,350
We both have 16

269
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,350
life points left,

270
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,330
but as soon as

271
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,330
my Jace uses his

272
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,330
Ultimate, he's toast.

273
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,390
I have no idea

274
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,390
what's going on.

275
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,570
So, what did you

276
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,570
think of those people?

277
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,740
They're nice.

278
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,740
Yeah?

279
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,750
I'm sorry, you two,

280
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,750
but I gotta get to school.

281
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,880
Finish this later?

282
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,880
Wanna drag it out?

283
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,110
Mmm.

284
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,240
I'm good.

285
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,380
Okay, honey.

286
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,850
You keep an eye

287
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,850
on this guy.

288
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,850
Oh, I will.

289
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,560
You mind

290
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,560
if I take a look?

291
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,190
Okay.

292
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,190
Yeah?

293
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,460
Ooh.

294
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Your tummy hurt?

295
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Mmm-hmm.

296
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,940
You getting cold?

297
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,080
You know what

298
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm gonna do?

299
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm gonna ask my

300
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,050
friend Dr. Manning

301
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,310
to come and take

302
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,310
a look at you.

303
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,880
Just to make sure

304
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,880
everything's all right.

305
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,550
Okay.

306
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,290
Meanwhile, why don't

307
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,290
you get some rest?

308
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,730
And when

309
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,730
Mr. Campbell comes?

310
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,990
Don't go easy on him.

311
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,510
Hey, Zach.

312
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,140
So we got

313
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,140
your scans back.

314
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,980
Good news, it's just

315
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,980
a simple fracture.

316
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,950
Okay.

317
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,950
And your parents

318
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,950
are on their way.

319
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,090
Mind if I check

320
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,090
your eyes?

321
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,300
So, how did you

322
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,300
go over the edge

323
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,300
of that overpass?

324
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,500
The railing

325
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,500
was kinda low,

326
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,500
I guess.

327
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,500
Okay.

328
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,440
But, uh, I mean,

329
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,440
were you fooling

330
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,440
around with your friends?

331
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,040
You lose your balance?

332
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,620
Could...

333
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,620
Could we do this later?

334
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,620
My head really hurts.

335
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,450
Sure.

336
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,690
But I do wanna

337
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,690
make sure that

338
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,690
you're okay

339
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,990
and that something like this

340
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,990
doesn't happen again.

341
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,160
So I'll have another

342
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,160
doctor come in and

343
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,160
see you in a bit, okay?

344
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,530
Maybe you'll feel up

345
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,530
to talking then.

346
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,170
I have to ask.

347
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,070
Do I think he jumped?

348
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,070
Yeah, I do.

349
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,380
We're out looking

350
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,380
for witnesses now,

351
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,380
but if he did jump,

352
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,680
we'll have to arrest him

353
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,680
for vehicular endangerment,

354
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,020
and possibly

355
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,020
manslaughter.

356
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,020
Easy, Rosado.

357
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,750
If Zach attempted suicide,

358
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,750
first thing that happens,

359
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,920
we put him

360
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,920
on a psych hold.

361
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,190
Hey, Trini. Call Dr. Charles.

362
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,190
Tell him we need a consult.

363
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,360
What do we got?

364
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,600
Marcie Burton,

365
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,600
19 weeks pregnant

366
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,500
with mild

367
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,500
vaginal bleeding,

368
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,500
vitals stable.

369
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,040
Okay, thanks.

370
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,040
I called the ambulance

371
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,040
just to be safe.

372
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,770
Good. Hi, Marcie.

373
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,770
I'm Dr. Halstead,

374
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,900
this is student

375
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,900
Dr. Curry.

376
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,380
I'm not losing

377
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,380
the baby, am I?

378
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,880
We're gonna take

379
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,880
a look right now.

380
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,010
When did

381
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,010
the bleeding start?

382
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,180
This morning.

383
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,740
It wasn't much,

384
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,740
but it hasn't stopped.

385
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,020
This will be

386
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,020
a little cold.

387
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,420
Is it moving?

388
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,590
Is it okay?

389
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,720
Well, the fetus is fine,

390
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,560
but you do have

391
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,560
placenta previa.

392
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,690
Is that bad?

393
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,200
Uh, it depends. It could be,

394
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,200
if the bleeding gets worse.

395
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,700
Then you need

396
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,700
to stop it.

397
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,400
Well, we are certainly

398
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,400
gonna do everything

399
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,400
we can.

400
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,770
I have brain cancer.

401
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,370
I'm sorry?

402
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,400
Stage four.

403
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,140
Which means this

404
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,140
is my last chance

405
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,140
to have a family.

406
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,550
How long ago were

407
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,550
you diagnosed?

408
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,640
Eight months.

409
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,090
Though her tumor's

410
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,090
been stable lately,

411
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,590
and the scans

412
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,590
have been good.

413
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,780
Ron.

414
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,130
I don't have time

415
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,130
to start another pregnancy.

416
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,760
And my baby

417
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,760
will be viable in just

418
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,760
a few more weeks.

419
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,960
So, please...

420
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,390
Help me.

421
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,060
Okay.

422
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,390
Let me go over

423
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,390
your chart

424
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,410
and have Obstetrics

425
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,410
come down to take a look.

426
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,940
Then we'll figure out

427
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,940
where to go from there.

428
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,270
Thank you.

429
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,470
Call Dr. Asher.

430
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,570
Dr. Asher? What?

431
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,570
Are you sure?

432
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,850
Yeah. She's the best.

433
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,760
He has a GI bleed

434
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,760
and his liver

435
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,760
is getting worse.

436
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,850
What are you

437
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,850
gonna do?

438
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,800
Send him for

439
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,800
a TIPS procedure.

440
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,100
You think

441
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,100
he needs something

442
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,100
that invasive?

443
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,760
Any more damage

444
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,760
moving forward

445
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,760
will be irreversible.

446
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,600
Sooner we can take

447
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,600
the pressure off his

448
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,600
vasculature, the better.

449
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,870
He was really hoping

450
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,870
to go home with his

451
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,870
new family today.

452
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,540
Well, TIPS has

453
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,540
a pretty quick recovery.

454
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,540
Maybe tomorrow.

455
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,510
Yeah.

456
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,450
I'm gonna

457
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,450
call over to IR.

458
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,450
Okay. Thanks.

459
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,520
Rhythm's not great.

460
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,520
We gotta move.

461
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,820
I'm on it.

462
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,020
I need better

463
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,020
exposure.

464
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,190
Okay, you remember how

465
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,190
I showed you to insert

466
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,190
the larger blade?

467
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,460
Yes, I do.

468
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,510
No, slide it

469
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,510
all the way.

470
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,510
Okay.

471
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,880
Loosen it up,

472
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,880
loosen it up.

473
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,810
Okay. Got it.

474
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,820
Okay, good.

475
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,820
Let's do this.

476
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,980
Nope, I need

477
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,980
a better angle.

478
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,550
Okay.

479
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,530
How do I know...

480
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,530
Okay, hold on.

481
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,530
Switch with me.

482
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,330
She's not gonna

483
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,330
hold out if you can't

484
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,330
get this going soon.

485
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,700
Yeah, I gotcha,

486
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,700
Marty.

487
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,560
Okay, there we go.

488
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,560
Don't let go.

489
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,360
Sorry,

490
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,360
Dr. Marcel.

491
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,770
Don't sweat it.

492
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,770
Just get a 2-0 ready

493
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,770
for the diaphragm.

494
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,950
One, two, three.

495
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,420
Dr. Marcel?

496
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,420
Yeah.

497
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,720
I think you should start

498
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,720
training a new nurse

499
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,720
for the Hybrid Room.

500
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,060
What are you talking about?

501
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,060
I slowed you down today.

502
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,070
No. Hey, it was

503
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,070
a tough case

504
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,070
with new equipment.

505
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,800
No, it was because

506
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,800
of the whole

507
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,800
thing with Ethan.

508
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,740
It got in the way

509
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,740
and there's no

510
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,740
excuse for that.

511
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,140
Look, April,

512
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,140
you're my nurse

513
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,140
and you're the best.

514
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,910
I'm not gonna

515
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,910
train anyone else.

516
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,540
Okay?

517
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,640
Okay.

518
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,790
Dr. Choi,

519
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,790
Zach's parents

520
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,790
are here.

521
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,920
He fell off

522
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,920
the overpass?

523
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,230
How is he?

524
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,230
Is he all right?

525
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,630
Zach has a broken

526
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,630
arm that he's getting

527
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,630
cast right now,

528
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,290
but otherwise,

529
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,290
just some scrapes

530
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,290
and bruises.

531
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,100
Oh, thank God.

532
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,800
Mr. and Mrs. Brand,

533
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,800
I'm Dr. Charles.

534
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,000
I haven't actually

535
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,000
met Zach yet,

536
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,840
but I was looking

537
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,840
forward to saying hello

538
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,840
in a few minutes.

539
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,800
Psychiatry?

540
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,800
I don't understand.

541
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,900
I just wanna ask him

542
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,900
a few questions.

543
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,140
Get a better sense

544
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,140
of what happened.

545
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,140
What does that mean?

546
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,610
Well, just that.

547
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,420
Wait. Don't tell me

548
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,420
you think he jumped.

549
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,190
Based on Dr. Choi's

550
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,190
assessment,

551
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,850
it seems like there

552
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,850
might be a possibility

553
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,850
and so, I just,

554
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,950
I wouldn't be doing

555
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,950
my job if I didn't say

556
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,950
a quick hello.

557
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,190
Oh, my God.

558
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,190
Honey, no, no.

559
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,670
That's ridiculous.

560
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,100
It's those kids

561
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,100
he hangs out with.

562
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,190
They're wild.

563
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,770
They were probably

564
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,770
goofing around

565
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,770
and it went too far.

566
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,030
Very possible.

567
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,130
But it's not so easy

568
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,130
to accidentally fall off

569
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,130
one of those things.

570
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,300
You know what?

571
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,300
I bet he got pushed

572
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,300
by that homeless guy.

573
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,140
Yeah.

574
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,140
Homeless guy?

575
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,450
Yeah. There's this man who

576
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,450
stands on that overpass,

577
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,450
screaming all day.

578
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,010
He's psychotic,

579
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,010
and dangerous.

580
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,180
Huh.

581
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,950
Okay. Well, I'm sure

582
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,950
the police will

583
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,950
look into that,

584
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,050
but in the

585
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,050
meantime,

586
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,960
we just wanna make

587
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,960
sure we're not

588
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,960
missing anything.

589
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,890
Zach could've

590
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,890
died today. Okay?

591
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,560
The last thing he needs

592
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,560
is to be interrogated

593
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,560
by a shrink.

594
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,970
Now, which one's

595
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,970
his room?

596
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,330
Treatment Five.

597
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,370
Are we gonna have

598
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,370
a hard time

599
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,370
with them?

600
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,710
The dad, yeah.

601
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,180
The mom,

602
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,180
not so sure.

603
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,010
Hey, Mom.

604
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,250
Hey.

605
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,420
Okay.

606
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,190
Michael, tell me.

607
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,030
Meet the newest

608
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,030
Clinical Device Specialist

609
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,030
for Kender Bio Systems.

610
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,230
You got the job.

611
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,740
Yeah, joining the Kender

612
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,740
team right here.

613
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,540
Here at Med?

614
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,540
Mmm-hmm.

615
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,700
And given the size

616
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,700
of the contract,

617
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,700
they need more people.

618
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,010
That's wonderful.

619
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,620
Mom, I know you always

620
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,620
wanted me to be a doctor.

621
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,780
Michael, I just

622
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,780
wanted you...

623
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,780
...to be happy.

624
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,190
I know,

625
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,190
but believe me,

626
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,020
Kender's training

627
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,020
is like going

628
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,020
to med school.

629
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,030
I'll know more

630
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,030
about the devices

631
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,030
than the docs

632
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,290
and I'll be in the OR

633
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,290
right alongside them.

634
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,190
I'm so proud of you.

635
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,030
I gotta hook up

636
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,030
with my supervisor.

637
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,570
Take you to lunch?

638
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,570
It's a date.

639
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,760
All right.

640
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,770
Zach, how you doing?

641
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,770
I'm Dr. Charles.

642
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,140
He's a psychiatrist.

643
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,580
Legally, we have to let

644
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,580
him talk to you.

645
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,580
Harris.

646
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,480
I'm really just

647
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,480
here to help,

648
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,480
Zach, and was hoping

649
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,610
to ask you a few

650
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,610
quick questions about

651
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,610
what happened today.

652
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,820
Okay.

653
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,290
Okay. So...

654
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,290
So, this morning

655
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,290
you left your house,

656
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,160
and where were

657
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,160
you headed?

658
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,960
Nowhere. I was just

659
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,960
taking a walk.

660
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,160
Okay.

661
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,000
By yourself.

662
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah.

663
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,800
Okay. Got it.

664
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,740
So you get to this overpass

665
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,740
and what happened then?

666
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,400
Tell him about that

667
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,400
homeless man, Zach.

668
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,400
Like you told us.

669
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,280
Yeah. There was...

670
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,780
There was this guy who was

671
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,780
yelling and acting crazy.

672
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,080
Right.

673
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,820
And, uh, he started

674
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,820
shoving me

675
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,920
and I tried to get out

676
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,920
of the way, but he...

677
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,920
He wouldn't stop,

678
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,960
and before I knew it,

679
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,960
I lost my balance.

680
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,360
All right.

681
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,270
Well, um, you know,

682
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,270
Zach's been through

683
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,270
a lot today.

684
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,640
Has anybody asked him

685
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,640
if he wants anything to eat?

686
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,010
No.

687
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,010
No?

688
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,270
Are you hungry, buddy?

689
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,270
How about a sandwich?

690
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,640
Maybe turkey.

691
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,640
Okay.

692
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,280
Um, why don't

693
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,280
we get going on that

694
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,480
and then when we get back,

695
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,480
maybe we can talk a little

696
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,480
bit more. Okay?

697
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,490
Nice to meet you, Zach.

698
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,490
Thank you.

699
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,890
You know his parents

700
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,890
coached him to say that.

701
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,490
Are they worried

702
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,490
he's gonna get arrested?

703
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,490
Probably.

704
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,970
Look. Even if Zach

705
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,970
won't admit he jumped,

706
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,160
we gotta put him

707
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,160
on a psych hold

708
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,160
for his own good.

709
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,400
A forced hold?

710
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,700
Taking a minor

711
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,700
away from his parents,

712
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,570
a very high bar

713
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,570
to clear, you know?

714
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,300
And more importantly,

715
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,300
it doesn't really

716
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,300
tend to work

717
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,370
unless you get buy-in

718
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,370
from the whole family.

719
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,240
But we can't let

720
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,240
a suicidal kid

721
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,240
walk out of here.

722
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,720
I hear you.

723
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,840
Look, let's see

724
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,840
what a turkey

725
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,840
sandwich gets us. Okay?

726
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,250
Moms love to see

727
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,250
their kids get fed.

728
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,550
Her cervix isn't

729
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,550
handling the weight

730
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,550
of the growing fetus

731
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,690
and is starting

732
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,690
to open up.

733
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,200
She's already dilated

734
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,200
one centimeter.

735
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,030
Then she's going

736
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,030
to lose the pregnancy.

737
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,230
Maybe not.

738
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,230
I'd like to try her

739
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,230
on progesterone,

740
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,000
see if we can stop her

741
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,000
from dilating any farther.

742
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,160
Wait, is that safe?

743
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,930
I mean, given her

744
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,930
increased chance of

745
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,930
infection and bleeding?

746
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,570
This is a unique situation,

747
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,570
due to her limited

748
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,570
time frame.

749
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,580
This pregnancy

750
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,580
is very

751
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,580
important to her.

752
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,750
I'd like to try

753
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,750
and save it.

754
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,940
Okay, then. Thanks.

755
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,450
Dr. Halstead,

756
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,450
I've read the literature

757
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,290
on cervical insufficiency

758
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,290
with bleeding in

759
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,290
high-risk patients

760
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,020
and trying to intervene

761
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,020
is not the standard of care.

762
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,860
Dr. Asher

763
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,860
is the specialist

764
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,860
and I trust her.

765
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,090
She's had

766
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,090
a drug problem.

767
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,070
That is irrelevant.

768
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,070
You are way out

769
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,070
of line, Ms. Curry.

770
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,210
He's cold,

771
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,210
and he's getting

772
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,210
a little short of breath.

773
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
What's taking IR

774
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
so long to get him

775
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
down for his TIPS?

776
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,610
They're always

777
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,610
backed up.

778
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,610
I'll give them a call.

779
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,960
Wait. He's not even

780
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,960
on the schedule.

781
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,090
What?

782
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,930
I put the order

783
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,930
in an hour ago.

784
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,160
Uh-uh. It says

785
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,160
he's been denied. By DCFS.

786
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,940
Can they do that?

787
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,940
I don't know.

788
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,800
Come on.

789
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,010
Madeline!

790
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,590
If this is

791
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,590
about Auggie,

792
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,590
I'm sorry,

793
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,150
but until the Kramers

794
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,150
get final approval,

795
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,850
the state is

796
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,850
still Auggie's

797
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,850
legal guardian.

798
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,950
What?

799
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,950
He's getting worse.

800
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,950
He needs this.

801
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,000
According

802
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,000
to the Illinois health

803
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,000
service protocols,

804
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,260
TIPS is only indicated

805
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,260
if two other previous

806
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,260
treatments fail.

807
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,170
That's just a guideline.

808
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,170
Every patient is different.

809
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,970
Which is why

810
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,970
I've already

811
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,970
escalated this

812
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,530
to a physician mediator

813
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,530
appointed by the state.

814
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,170
That's gonna take days.

815
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,170
He needs this now.

816
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,970
All right, look.

817
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,970
He's at risk

818
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,970
for encephalopathy,

819
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,170
peritonitis...

820
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,310
I understand.

821
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,550
Madeline,

822
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,550
he needs someone

823
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,550
to advocate for him.

824
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,480
And I'm trying my best.

825
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,720
There's nothing

826
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,720
else I can do.

827
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,560
Dr. Lanik.

828
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,800
Do you remember

829
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,800
Auggie Roberts?

830
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,240
Foster kid? Sure.

831
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,360
He's getting worse.

832
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,800
I was wondering,

833
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,800
could you write a note

834
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,470
saying that he'd

835
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,470
do well to receive

836
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,470
a TIPS procedure?

837
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,520
He's upstairs now.

838
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,520
Get his pediatrician

839
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,520
to do it.

840
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,910
She did. But there's

841
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,910
some red tape.

842
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,920
I thought if we had

843
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,920
a double doc

844
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,750
we could convene

845
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,750
an ethics committee

846
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,750
and we could...

847
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,820
Oh, so my "quick note" is

848
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,820
turning into an afternoon

849
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,820
in front of a committee?

850
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,720
Dr. Lanik...

851
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,720
Maggie, I have

852
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,720
patients to see

853
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,520
and you have

854
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,520
a waiting room full

855
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,520
of them to process.

856
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,200
Three centimeters.

857
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,200
You're still progressing.

858
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,670
So what do

859
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,670
we do now?

860
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,400
Well, we can

861
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,400
try increasing

862
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,400
the progesterone.

863
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,370
Give you a little more

864
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,370
time to see if we can

865
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,370
turn this around.

866
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
I agree.

867
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
Are you sure?

868
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,270
The longer we wait,

869
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,870
the greater the chance

870
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,870
of a serious complication.

871
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,780
I don't believe

872
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,780
we're there yet.

873
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,850
What do you think

874
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,850
we should do?

875
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,120
Terminate

876
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,120
the pregnancy.

877
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,120
At this point,

878
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,120
it's the safest option.

879
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,520
What? No.

880
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Ms. Curry

881
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,420
is a medical student,

882
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,420
not a doctor.

883
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,520
I need to have

884
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,520
this baby.

885
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,890
So my husband can

886
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,890
have someone to love

887
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,890
him as much as I do.

888
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,400
And someone

889
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,400
he can love.

890
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,270
If I can have that,

891
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,770
then I'm okay to die.

892
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,640
We'll increase your

893
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,640
meds and check

894
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,640
back in a little bit.

895
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,990
You gonna get your nose

896
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,990
out of that laptop?

897
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,800
I'm sorry, Mom.

898
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,800
I've just got so

899
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,800
much prep to do.

900
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,300
Let me ask you,

901
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,300
Dr. Latham,

902
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,300
CT surgeon,

903
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,640
you know if he's

904
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,640
into anything,

905
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,640
any hobbies?

906
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,410
No, not really.

907
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,410
We don't socialize.

908
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,670
A lot of CT surgeons

909
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,670
are into cars.

910
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,810
You know,

911
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,810
vintage, racing...

912
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,480
Yeah, that doesn't

913
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,480
sound like Dr. Latham.

914
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,120
How about Dr. Abrams?

915
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,460
I hear his wife makes

916
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,460
some kind of power drink.

917
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,500
Is he a gym rat?

918
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,500
Why are you asking this?

919
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,690
Well, I'm gonna be working

920
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,690
with these guys.

921
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,670
It'd be nice

922
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,670
to have something

923
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,670
to talk about.

924
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,760
Well, what about

925
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,760
the medical devices

926
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,760
they'll be using?

927
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,100
Well, that's a given,

928
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,100
but you know how touchy

929
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,100
these surgeons can be.

930
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,200
Since I'm gonna be

931
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,200
coaching them,

932
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,710
I want to establish

933
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,710
a rapport.

934
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,300
Well, our surgeons

935
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,300
are at the top

936
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,300
of their game.

937
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,350
I doubt if they

938
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,350
need any coaching.

939
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,850
Sure. It's just

940
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,850
we have a lot of

941
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,850
exciting new products

942
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,650
I'll be introducing

943
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,650
them to.

944
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,350
And, you know,

945
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,350
business is all

946
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,350
about relationships.

947
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,060
I'm sorry, Dr. Charles,

948
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,060
but the Brands'

949
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,060
lawyer is here,

950
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,640
and apparently

951
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,640
you can't

952
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,640
speak to Zach

953
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,500
until Legal gets it

954
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,500
straightened out.

955
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,900
Mr. and Mrs. Brand,

956
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,900
I just wanna let you know,

957
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,140
the field officers have

958
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,140
completed their

959
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,140
investigation.

960
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,380
Did they find

961
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,380
that homeless man?

962
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,180
No. In fact,

963
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,180
we couldn't find any

964
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,180
eyewitnesses at all.

965
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,190
So, Zach can go?

966
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,590
Hold on.

967
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,090
There's still one

968
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,090
more witness.

969
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,210
The woman who

970
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,210
was driving the car.

971
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,560
Oh, for God's sake,

972
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,560
are you just trying

973
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,560
to get my son arrested?

974
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,420
No, I'm trying to get him

975
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,420
the help he needs.

976
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,390
Mr. and Mrs. Brand,

977
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,390
if it turns out that

978
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,390
Zach did, in fact, jump,

979
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,560
then I would be able,

980
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,560
hopefully with

981
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,560
your blessing,

982
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,330
to put him on a hold

983
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,330
and we can start

984
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,330
to address this.

985
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,060
He would likely

986
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,060
be charged,

987
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,880
but I will personally

988
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,880
advocate for him,

989
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,000
and under

990
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,000
the circumstances,

991
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,240
can practically guarantee

992
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,240
he would not be prosecuted.

993
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,780
My son

994
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,780
is not suicidal.

995
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,680
The driver's

996
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,680
still unconscious.

997
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,350
If she wakes up,

998
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,350
we'll question her then.

999
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,940
But in the meantime,

1000
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,940
I can't keep him

1001
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,940
here any longer.

1002
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,280
I gotta let him go.

1003
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,050
Thank you.

1004
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,520
Rosado.

1005
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,630
Don't let them

1006
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,630
leave just yet.

1007
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,890
I'll be right back.

1008
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,070
Crockett, I need you

1009
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,070
to wake her up.

1010
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,410
What? Why?

1011
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,810
The boy needs our help.

1012
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,410
All right,

1013
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,410
she's our

1014
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,410
only chance.

1015
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,540
If she confirms

1016
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,540
he jumped,

1017
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,250
we can give him

1018
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,250
the help he needs.

1019
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,260
Yeah, I'm sorry,

1020
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,260
but she's not ready.

1021
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,550
Why not, huh?

1022
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,290
She's over-breathing

1023
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,290
the vent,

1024
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,290
her vitals are stable.

1025
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,830
I just rebuilt her diaphragm

1026
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,830
and her belly's open.

1027
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,260
She's not there yet.

1028
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,260
Come on, man.

1029
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,600
You're telling me you

1030
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,600
can't lighten her sedation

1031
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,600
for five minutes?

1032
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,640
If I wake her up now,

1033
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,640
she could still go into

1034
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,640
a metabolic crisis.

1035
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,330
And if you don't,

1036
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,330
there's a severely

1037
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,330
troubled kid

1038
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,840
who can't get

1039
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,840
the help he needs.

1040
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,430
Well, I don't know

1041
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,430
what to tell you, man,

1042
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,340
but I'm gonna do

1043
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,340
what's best for my patient.

1044
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,850
That boy tries

1045
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,850
to kill himself again?

1046
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,320
That's on you.

1047
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,690
His pressure's

1048
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,690
dropping.

1049
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,710
We need more

1050
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,710
suction, blood,

1051
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,710
and drugs to intubate.

1052
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,000
What happened?

1053
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,940
He was coughing

1054
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,940
and then he just started

1055
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,940
throwing up blood.

1056
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,670
Esophageal varices.

1057
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,670
The pressure must've

1058
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,670
opened one up.

1059
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,770
Auggie, I need you

1060
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,770
to calm down, okay?

1061
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,340
We're gonna take

1062
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,340
good care of you.

1063
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,150
Auggie. Auggie,

1064
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,150
listen to me.

1065
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,380
No...

1066
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,380
Auggie...

1067
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,790
Drugs are in.

1068
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,790
I know this is scary,

1069
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,790
but you're so brave.

1070
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,790
I need you to be brave

1071
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,790
just a little bit longer.

1072
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,880
Can you do that for me?

1073
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,320
All right.

1074
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,320
He's out.

1075
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,870
I'm in. Bag him.

1076
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,830
All right,

1077
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,830
let's get him up

1078
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,830
to the IR for a TIPS.

1079
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,030
Let's go.

1080
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,050
It's emergent now.

1081
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,050
No need for consent.

1082
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,390
Yeah, we can do both.

1083
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,390
Dr. Asher! Dr. Halstead!

1084
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,390
Okay.

1085
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,730
She's losing

1086
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,730
the pregnancy.

1087
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,430
Marcie, I'm sorry,

1088
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,430
but we need to get

1089
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,430
the fetus out now.

1090
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,060
No! No!

1091
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,060
Marcie!

1092
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,770
It's okay.

1093
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,250
Dr. Halstead.

1094
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,250
Please don't let

1095
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,250
my baby die.

1096
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,250
Hannah.

1097
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,250
Okay.

1098
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,180
We could try what's

1099
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,180
called a cerclage.

1100
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,840
It's a procedure

1101
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,840
to tie your cervix closed,

1102
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,080
but in your case,

1103
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,080
we would have to go

1104
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,080
in through the abdomen.

1105
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,350
What? With the placement

1106
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,350
of her placenta

1107
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,350
and her bleeding,

1108
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,790
that would be

1109
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,790
extremely risky.

1110
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,020
How risky?

1111
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,960
Well, the chances

1112
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,960
of catastrophic

1113
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,960
bleeding are high.

1114
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,760
Not to mention the

1115
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,760
significant cardiac

1116
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,760
risks of anesthesia.

1117
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,270
It's true. There's no

1118
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,270
guarantee at all that

1119
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,270
you would survive this.

1120
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,270
Honey... That sounds

1121
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,270
like a bad idea.

1122
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,390
Do it.

1123
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,940
Marcie, we can

1124
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,940
always try again.

1125
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,600
No, we can't.

1126
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,600
You know that.

1127
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,200
Do it!

1128
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,940
All right. Let's go.

1129
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,940
Come on.

1130
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,480
Marcie. No!

1131
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,710
I love you.

1132
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,580
That's why

1133
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,580
I have to do this.

1134
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,120
Elsa, call the OR.

1135
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,260
Dr. Halstead,

1136
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,260
this is crazy.

1137
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,630
Odds are that woman

1138
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,630
is gonna die.

1139
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,160
That's a risk she's

1140
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,160
willing to take.

1141
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,460
Well, are you doing

1142
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,460
this because of your

1143
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,460
feelings for Dr. Asher?

1144
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,130
Call the OR, now.

1145
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,610
Please, it is a mistake

1146
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,610
to send Zach home.

1147
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,740
I believe your son

1148
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,740
is depressed.

1149
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,010
Depressed?

1150
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,580
I hate that word.

1151
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,910
It's just an excuse

1152
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,910
for weakness.

1153
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,580
Our son is not weak.

1154
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,150
Dr. Charles.

1155
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,090
I think that we have

1156
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,090
said everything there

1157
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,090
is to say, Dr. Choi.

1158
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,030
Unless, of course,

1159
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,030
there's something

1160
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,830
that either of you

1161
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,830
feel like you

1162
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,830
might've left out.

1163
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,180
Her vitals look good.

1164
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,180
How's her rhythm been?

1165
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,050
Stable. Dr. Marcel

1166
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,050
was talking about

1167
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,050
lightening her sedation.

1168
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,950
Yeah, I'll take

1169
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,950
care of it.

1170
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,540
Don't try to talk.

1171
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,480
You're intubated,

1172
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,480
in the hospital.

1173
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,840
You're safe.

1174
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,240
I just need to know,

1175
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,750
did you see the boy

1176
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,750
who landed on your car?

1177
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,080
Okay.

1178
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,220
Did he get pushed?

1179
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,030
Or did he jump?

1180
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,770
Okay, please.

1181
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,710
Just think.

1182
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,610
You were driving

1183
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,610
toward the bridge.

1184
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,420
He was on it.

1185
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,420
You saw him.

1186
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,590
Did he jump?

1187
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,290
Okay.

1188
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,370
Mr. Brand,

1189
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,540
we forgot to validate

1190
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,540
your parking.

1191
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,540
Come with me.

1192
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,710
I'll be right back.

1193
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,050
Mrs. Brand,

1194
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,050
I think that your

1195
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,050
son needs help.

1196
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,990
Now, I recognize that

1197
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,990
your family situation

1198
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,990
is complicated.

1199
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,300
And I can't imagine how

1200
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,300
challenging that must be

1201
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,300
under the circumstances.

1202
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,170
But, listen,

1203
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,170
here's my card.

1204
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,080
I hope you will

1205
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,080
call me any time

1206
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,080
of the day or night.

1207
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,010
All right?

1208
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,310
The only thing that

1209
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,310
you don't wanna do

1210
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,780
is let your son go

1211
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,780
through this alone.

1212
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,150
Thank you.

1213
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,150
Okay.

1214
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,590
Hey. How's he doing?

1215
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,200
He finally

1216
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,200
got his procedure,

1217
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,200
no thanks to you.

1218
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,300
Maggie, you know

1219
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,300
that under

1220
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,300
the circumstances

1221
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,000
I did everything

1222
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,000
I could.

1223
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,340
Did you? Because it took

1224
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,340
him hemorrhaging

1225
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,340
for him to get this.

1226
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,540
I can

1227
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,540
see the cervix.

1228
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,380
Hold it gently

1229
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,380
so I can get it isolated.

1230
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,380
Mmm-hmm.

1231
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,680
It's bleeding.

1232
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,310
It's too vascular.

1233
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,310
Laps to me.

1234
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,310
Give her a gram of TXA.

1235
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,190
Still bleeding.

1236
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,190
More laps.

1237
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,660
Pressure's dropping.

1238
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,790
We may need

1239
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,790
to terminate

1240
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,790
the procedure.

1241
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,960
Watch her rhythm.

1242
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,960
She's throwing PVC's.

1243
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,230
I think we need to call it.

1244
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,230
Switch to a hysterotomy.

1245
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,740
No.

1246
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,740
Her water's still intact,

1247
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,740
and we've got plenty

1248
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,740
of blood in reserve.

1249
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,740
We can still do this.

1250
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,240
Are you sure?

1251
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,240
Yes.

1252
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,480
Okay. Talk me through it.

1253
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,010
Release the laps

1254
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,010
so I can get

1255
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,010
some celox in there.

1256
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,150
Lap?

1257
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,820
It's working.

1258
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,820
The bleeding's slowed.

1259
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,390
Okay,

1260
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,390
hold it steady

1261
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,390
so I can get it packed.

1262
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,400
We did it.

1263
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,400
How's she look?

1264
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,840
BP is coming back up,

1265
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,840
but I still can't shake

1266
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,840
these irregular beats.

1267
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,930
Then we're not

1268
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,930
out of the woods yet.

1269
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,510
Let's get ready

1270
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,510
to place the stitch.

1271
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,210
Where is he?

1272
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,940
Where is he?

1273
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,610
You got a lot

1274
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,610
of nerve interfering

1275
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,610
with my patient.

1276
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,880
I had to.

1277
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,880
The boy needed help.

1278
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,020
The boy.

1279
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,020
Don't kid yourself.

1280
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,680
This wasn't about him.

1281
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,680
It was about me.

1282
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,780
The hell it was.

1283
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,190
You've been pushing

1284
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,190
against me all day.

1285
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,060
Because you deserved it.

1286
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,060
Oh, come on!

1287
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,230
You know

1288
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,230
what this is about.

1289
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,230
It's about April.

1290
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,360
No, you don't

1291
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,360
wanna go there.

1292
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,430
No. I wanna end this.

1293
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,370
So, what's it gonna take?

1294
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,410
You need to hit me?

1295
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,410
That it?

1296
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,410
Huh, big man? Go on,

1297
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,410
take your best shot.

1298
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,610
There it is.

1299
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,110
There it is.

1300
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,990
Okay. And, snip.

1301
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,820
Okay.

1302
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,820
Cerclage is complete.

1303
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,820
Ready to close.

1304
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,990
Her pressure's dropping

1305
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,990
and she's got ectopy.

1306
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,260
I don't

1307
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,260
see anything.

1308
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,830
It's here.

1309
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,830
She's hemorrhaging.

1310
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,560
The placenta.

1311
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,560
We need to terminate

1312
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,560
the pregnancy.

1313
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,800
Trigger the MTP and convert

1314
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,800
to a hysterotomy. Now.

1315
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,810
What do you need?

1316
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,810
Cut the cerclage.

1317
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,000
She's in v-fib.

1318
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,000
Damn it! Gimme

1319
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,000
a scalpel, start CPR.

1320
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,640
Starting

1321
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,640
compressions.

1322
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,340
Charged.

1323
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,620
Placenta out.

1324
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,620
Charge to 200.

1325
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,420
Get some

1326
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,420
blood in her!

1327
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,290
Charged.

1328
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,160
All right. Clear!

1329
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,360
Still in v-fib.

1330
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,440
No pulse.

1331
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,440
Charge to 200.

1332
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,260
Give her an amp of epi!

1333
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,140
Charged.

1334
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,810
Clear!

1335
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,010
Come on.

1336
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,010
Give another amp of epi

1337
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,010
and charge to 200.

1338
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,450
Hannah...

1339
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,950
What are you waiting for?

1340
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,950
Shock her!

1341
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,520
She bled out.

1342
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,170
Time of death, 18:04.

1343
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,880
Hannah.

1344
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,190
Oh, boy.

1345
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,040
You, uh... You all right?

1346
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,840
Did Zach leave?

1347
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,040
Yeah.

1348
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,380
You know, I was finally able

1349
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,380
to talk to his mom alone.

1350
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,840
Poor thing.

1351
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,180
I don't know.

1352
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,220
She did take my card.

1353
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,720
I don't get it.

1354
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,690
The boy is so deeply troubled,

1355
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,690
but the dad just doesn't

1356
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,690
want to face it.

1357
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,130
Well, you know,

1358
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,130
maybe it's just, uh,

1359
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,570
easier for him to focus

1360
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,570
his anxiety

1361
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,570
and anger elsewhere,

1362
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,370
rather than face the pain

1363
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,370
of looking at the real

1364
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,370
problem, you know?

1365
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,210
Anyway...

1366
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,210
See you tomorrow.

1367
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,460
Now, the Amulet of Krog.

1368
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,460
What do I do with it?

1369
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,660
No, it's Kroog.

1370
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,660
Kroog.

1371
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,330
Okay. I'll be right back

1372
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,330
and I'm gonna beat you.

1373
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,840
Is he going to be okay?

1374
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,140
For now, at least.

1375
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,180
Good. But I'm afraid

1376
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,180
I've got some bad news.

1377
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,750
The, uh, foster family

1378
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,750
backed out.

1379
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,490
They felt he would

1380
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,490
just be too much

1381
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,490
to handle.

1382
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,700
So, he'll have to go

1383
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,700
back on the list?

1384
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,630
I'm afraid so.

1385
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,190
I'm sorry.

1386
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,640
Sharon?

1387
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,640
Yeah?

1388
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,310
We'll do it.

1389
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,810
We'll foster him.

1390
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,190
Maggie, you don't

1391
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,190
have to do...

1392
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,190
No.

1393
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,350
We want to.

1394
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,690
Are you sure?

1395
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,530
Okay. I'll let

1396
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,530
DCFS know.

1397
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,550
Mr. Burton.

1398
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,080
I'm so sorry.

1399
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,830
My wife made it

1400
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,830
very clear what she wanted.

1401
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,260
Thank you for honoring

1402
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,260
her wishes.

1403
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,030
I always knew this day

1404
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,030
would come.

1405
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,030
Still, it's so hard...

1406
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,070
Hey, Hannah, today

1407
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,070
was a tough one.

1408
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,640
But you made

1409
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,640
the right decision.

1410
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,040
Yeah, but...

1411
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,980
Doesn't make it

1412
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,980
any easier.

1413
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,250
I need...

1414
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,760
I need to go

1415
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,760
to an NA meeting.

1416
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,280
Okay.

1417
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,150
I'll drive you.

1418
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,080
Hey, Mom.

1419
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,080
I'll see you tomorrow.

1420
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,420
See you tomorrow.

1421
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,660
Dr. Lanik.

1422
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,660
Hey, Michael.

1423
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,450
Your son,

1424
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,450
he's a good salesman.

1425
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,150
Yeah?

1426
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,960
Yeah, he somehow knew

1427
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,960
I was a scotch drinker.

1428
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,090
Gave me this great

1429
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,090
bottle of single malt.

1430
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,510
Your eye okay?

1431
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,050
Yeah, I'll live.

1432
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,190
So, you sure have

1433
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,190
been making

1434
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,190
a lot of new friends

1435
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,330
since coming over

1436
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,330
to the day shift.

1437
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,300
Yeah. That's what I do.

1438
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,400
Make friends.

1439
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,070
Are you okay,

1440
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,070
Crockett?

1441
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,010
Oh, yeah, that lidocaine

1442
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,010
works fast.

1443
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,140
That's not what I meant.

1444
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,510
I know what you meant.

1445
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,480
Let's just keep it

1446
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,480
at the lidocaine.

1447
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,340
Really? You hit him?

1448
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,180
Yeah.

1449
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,280
The thing is, April,

1450
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,390
it was so easy for me

1451
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,390
to see Crockett

1452
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,390
as the problem.

1453
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,760
Yeah, and I told you

1454
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,190
whatever happened between

1455
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,190
me and him in the past...

1456
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,360
Yeah. I know.

1457
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,360
I get it now.

1458
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,070
Because the real problem

1459
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,070
was always right here.

1460
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,630
Between us.

1461
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,440
April, whatever it is

1462
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,440
you want...

1463
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,280
It isn't me.

1464
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,290
Ethan, that's not true.

1465
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,290
What are...

1466
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,580
Where are you going?

1467
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,580
What are the bags for?

1468
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,750
I'm gonna find a hotel.

1469
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,750
No, Ethan, stop! Listen!

1470
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,060
Take as long as you need

1471
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,060
to find a new place.

1472
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,150
What? Ethan!

1473
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,300
Oh, my God.
