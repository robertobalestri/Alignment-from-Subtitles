1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,860
I don't remember a lot.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,140
There's something

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,140
I wanna ask you.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,700
You've helped me

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,700
through a very difficult time.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,330
Do you love him?

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,970
He slipped the ring

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,970
on your finger

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,970
when you were unconscious.

10
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,310
It doesn't matter,

11
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,310
because it's over.

12
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,250
And, you!

13
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,250
Get out of my life.

14
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,650
Dr. Manning?

15
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,380
Agent Lee told me

16
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,380
what was going on.

17
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,350
Agent Lee told me

18
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,350
what was going on.

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,040
Hi, April.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,840
I've got your test results.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,540
You couldn't tell me

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,540
over the phone?

23
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,090
Well, I just thought

24
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,090
we should discuss this

25
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,090
in person.

26
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,810
Okay.

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,450
Good news.

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,390
Your thyroid

29
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,390
and pituitary tests

30
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,390
were completely normal.

31
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,260
And your HSG X-ray shows that

32
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,260
your fallopian tubes are open.

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
Okay. So, what's

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
the bad news?

35
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,130
Your AMH and antral follicle

36
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,130
count are low.

37
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,540
And your FSH is high.

38
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,610
Even though you're

39
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,610
only in your 30s, that

40
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,610
indicates that there's...

41
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,010
Early onset menopause?

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,240
I like to call it

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,240
exactly what it is.

44
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,480
Low ovarian reserve.

45
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,950
I'm the reason we

46
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,950
haven't gotten pregnant.

47
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,220
Spontaneous pregnancy

48
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,220
isn't impossible.

49
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,230
Dr. Patchefsky,

50
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,230
the miscarriage a few years

51
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,230
ago and now this?

52
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,120
Ethan wants a baby.

53
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,120
I can't...

54
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,070
I can't give him one.

55
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,760
April, this is far

56
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,760
from hopeless.

57
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,560
Ethan should get tested, too.

58
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,230
And then the two of you

59
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,230
might want to discuss IVF.

60
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,870
IVF?

61
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,870
Mmm-hmm.

62
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,970
I'd recommend

63
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,970
starting sooner than later.

64
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,640
With low ovarian reserve,

65
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,640
you may not be responsive.

66
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,280
So, I go home and I tell Ethan

67
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,280
I am going through menopause,

68
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,480
and even with IVF,

69
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,480
I still might not be able

70
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,480
to get pregnant.

71
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,790
Couples work

72
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,790
through this, April.

73
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,340
Was the gym crowded?

74
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,340
What?

75
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,700
You were gone a long time.

76
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Oh... Yeah,

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
it was crowded.

78
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,980
Do you really have to leave?

79
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,010
Yeah.

80
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,780
How can the Navy

81
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,780
make you go for two months?

82
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,690
Six weeks.

83
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,850
I told you, doc

84
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,850
on a carrier had an MI,

85
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,950
sounds pretty serious,

86
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,950
they called up a reservist.

87
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,670
"The Expectant Father?"

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,840
Just looking to the future.

89
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,210
God, Ethan.

90
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,940
What?

91
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,820
I have to get ready for work.

92
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,960
Morning.

93
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,400
Hey.

94
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,070
How'd you sleep?

95
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,400
Great.

96
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,710
How's your pain, honey?

97
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,980
You're not dressed.

98
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,990
Yeah. Thought maybe

99
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,990
I'd stay home today.

100
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,720
Please don't try

101
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,720
and talk me out of it.

102
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,550
Okay, I won't.

103
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,360
Thank you.

104
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,370
You're getting good

105
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,370
at this marriage stuff.

106
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,270
Fourth time's

107
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,270
a charm, I guess.

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,800
Danny...

109
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,410
I want you to remarry.

110
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,710
But I'm happily

111
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,710
married to you.

112
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,980
Danny?

113
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,720
Wait, what are we having

114
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,720
for breakfast, honey?

115
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,720
What do you want?

116
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,920
I know you heard me.

117
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,990
Pancakes it is.

118
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,790
Ben?

119
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,670
Do you mind if

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,670
I share with Maggie

121
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,670
what I'm finding?

122
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,000
Please do.

123
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,810
You are running a fever,

124
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,810
103.2, and you're

125
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,810
tachycardic...

126
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,010
Rapid heart rate.

127
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,950
Of more concern,

128
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,950
your white count

129
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,950
is really low, 2.2.

130
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,250
And your platelets

131
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,250
are at 35, also low.

132
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,890
So, not good.

133
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,990
No.

134
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,030
I'm sorry, Ben.

135
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,200
Not good.

136
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,300
I'm so tired.

137
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,040
Why don't you get some rest?

138
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,910
You let me know

139
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,910
if he has any

140
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,910
trouble breathing,

141
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,210
and we'll increase

142
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,210
his oxygen, okay?

143
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,010
Make him as comfortable

144
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,010
as possible.

145
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,690
Hey.

146
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,160
Dr. Manning, I'm sorry

147
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,160
to bother you.

148
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,160
What's up?

149
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,430
Um, a, uh...

150
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,830
I'm not sure how

151
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,830
you wanna handle this.

152
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,170
A pediatric patient of yours

153
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,170
has just been brought in

154
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,170
for a scheduled surgery.

155
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,230
Okay, I'll go

156
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,230
see the patient.

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,230
What's wrong?

158
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,780
Well, it's, uh...

159
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,780
It's Phillip Davis'

160
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,780
daughter, Sophie.

161
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,070
I mean, I know

162
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,070
that you and he...

163
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,310
Whatever happened

164
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,310
between her father and me,

165
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,310
Sophie is still my patient.

166
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,350
Right.

167
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,920
Sophie has had multiple

168
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,920
procedures to correct

169
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,920
congenital tricuspid atresia.

170
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,190
Why don't you come up

171
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,190
and help me examine her?

172
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,450
Okay, yeah.

173
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,450
Okay.

174
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,760
Dr. Manning?

175
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,070
That night at the accident...

176
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,710
Natalie?

177
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,150
It was just like this.

178
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,140
Do you love him?

179
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,310
It's weird,

180
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,310
some things are starting

181
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,310
to come back to me.

182
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,930
Phillip was there.

183
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,460
And some FBI agent.

184
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,430
And she wanted...

185
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,100
I can't remember.

186
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,960
Dr. Manning?

187
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,140
Yeah?

188
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,140
The family's waiting

189
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,140
to see you.

190
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,400
Uh, okay. Let's go.

191
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,610
Dr. Manning?

192
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,610
Yes.

193
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,350
And this is fourth year

194
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,350
medical student Ms. Curry.

195
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,420
Hi. I'm Cheryl McFarland,

196
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,420
Phillip's sister,

197
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,080
Sophie's aunt. This is

198
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,080
my husband, Jeremy.

199
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,180
Hi.

200
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm sorry,

201
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,500
um, do you live here?

202
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,630
Streeterville. Why?

203
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,270
Phillip said he

204
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,270
didn't have any

205
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,270
family in Chicago.

206
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,170
Phillip says a lot of things.

207
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,170
He's a pathological liar.

208
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,030
Oh, um...

209
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,340
May I ask, where is he?

210
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,640
I don't know.

211
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,180
He asked us to meet him

212
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,180
at the hospital. When we

213
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,180
got here, he was gone.

214
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,210
I don't understand.

215
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,880
He left Sophie.

216
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,050
He... He isn't coming back?

217
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,180
I doubt it.

218
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,020
Well, you know what?

219
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,020
All that matters

220
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,020
right now is Sophie.

221
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,120
So, why don't I take a look?

222
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,120
Aw. Hey, there.

223
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,790
There she is.

224
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,500
Hey, Mike.

225
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,500
We got your labs back.

226
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,630
Hmm?

227
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,170
He's still kinda out of it.

228
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,170
Makes sense.

229
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,570
You're uremic.

230
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,580
My kidneys.

231
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,580
Afraid so.

232
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,410
Dialysis problem.

233
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,740
Your catheter's clotted off.

234
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,540
That why he feels so lousy?

235
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,540
Yeah.

236
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,980
My brother's been

237
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,980
on the transplant list

238
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,980
for over a year.

239
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,480
I... I'd give him my kidney,

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,480
but I'm not a match.

241
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,420
Well, the good news

242
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,420
is that there was

243
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,420
no sign of infection.

244
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,390
So, if a kidney

245
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,390
becomes available,

246
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,390
you can have the surgery.

247
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,390
We're gonna get you

248
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,390
through this, okay?

249
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,230
All right.

250
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,930
So, how are you feeling, Dan?

251
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,670
Okay. Better.

252
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,670
Good.

253
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,770
He had us so worried.

254
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,180
He's never

255
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,180
passed out before.

256
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,510
When you brought Dan

257
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,510
into the ED yesterday,

258
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,510
he was in a diabetic crisis.

259
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,350
Uh, blood sugar 640,

260
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,350
pH 7.23.

261
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,290
The ketoacidosis

262
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,290
is what caused you

263
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,290
to lose consciousness.

264
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,420
But with the insulin drip

265
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,420
and IV fluids, your numbers

266
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,420
are looking better.

267
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,790
Thank God.

268
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,950
What about his kidneys?

269
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,760
I am concerned. I want

270
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,760
a nephrologist to see you.

271
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,190
Excuse me.

272
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,750
Your patient's on the list

273
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,750
for a new kidney, right?

274
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,440
Yeah. He's had a hard time

275
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,440
managing his diabetes.

276
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,570
Wrecked his kidneys.

277
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,090
Well, we might have

278
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,090
one for him.

279
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,090
"Might"?

280
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,210
Direct donor situation,

281
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,210
but it's complicated.

282
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,880
We have a patient downstairs

283
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,880
who also needs a kidney.

284
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,320
His brother's willing

285
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,320
to donate,

286
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,320
but isn't a match.

287
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,790
But turns out,

288
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,790
he is a match

289
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,790
for your guy.

290
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,960
So, if somebody from your

291
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,960
guy's family matches our guy

292
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,960
and is willing to donate,

293
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,000
then our guy's brother

294
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,000
will donate his kidney

295
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,000
to your guy.

296
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,400
Quid pro quo.

297
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,130
Domino transplant.

298
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,130
Bingo.

299
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,180
They both go home

300
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,180
with a kidney.

301
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,180
We just need a match.

302
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,840
I'll present the offer.

303
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,840
Great.

304
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,580
Jordy Collins, 16-year-old

305
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,580
male with Down syndrome,

306
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,580
motor vehicle collision.

307
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,520
Yeah, we're going

308
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,520
to Baghdad. Is it okay

309
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,520
if I take your pulse?

310
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,680
Yeah.

311
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,850
I'm his dad.

312
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,850
We were rear-ended.

313
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,520
We were going to the rink.

314
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,820
I think he got whiplash.

315
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,790
I ice-skate.

316
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,790
That's really cool.

317
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,460
I can't ice skate

318
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,460
to save my life.

319
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,660
Doris.

320
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,000
All right, on my count.

321
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,370
One, two, three.

322
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,210
This is a big hospital.

323
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,210
Sure is.

324
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,870
We're gonna take

325
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,870
good care of you.

326
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,540
Jordy, anything else

327
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,540
bothering you

328
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,540
besides your neck?

329
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,680
Uh-uh.

330
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,850
Good. Chest X-ray.

331
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,950
Dad, anything

332
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,950
in Jordy's history

333
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,950
we should know about?

334
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,510
No. He's a healthy kid.

335
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,720
I like to hear that.

336
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,850
Okay, I'm gonna listen

337
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,850
to your heart.

338
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,020
Yeah, Jordy, your heart

339
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,020
sounds real good.

340
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,330
Squeeze my hand, would you?

341
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,330
Ooh, you're strong.

342
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,200
This is a big camera.

343
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,200
It's gonna take

344
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,200
a picture of you.

345
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,330
Won't hurt a bit.

346
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,330
Okay.

347
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,530
Everybody, clear.

348
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,530
Coming up.

349
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,510
Hey, chest looks good, too.

350
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,910
I'm gonna take

351
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,910
this collar off

352
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,910
and see what's what. Okay?

353
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,240
Okay.

354
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,210
All right.

355
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,250
Ow!

356
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,080
Sorry, buddy.

357
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,080
Now we'll put that

358
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,080
collar back on.

359
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,720
You know, it could

360
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,720
still just be whiplash,

361
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,520
but I wanna make sure

362
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,520
there aren't any

363
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,520
other injuries.

364
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,330
With your permission,

365
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,330
I'd like to send Jordy

366
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,330
for a CT of his head and neck.

367
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,930
Sure.

368
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,930
Great.

369
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,930
Let radiology know, Doris.

370
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,930
Right.

371
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,530
We're gonna fix you up,

372
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,530
get you back on that ice.

373
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,940
Okay.

374
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,200
I'll check on you in a bit.

375
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,840
Hey, Dan.

376
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,400
Martha, Bill.

377
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,400
Hi.

378
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,540
This is Dr. Marcel. He's been

379
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,540
treating the other kidney

380
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,540
patient I told you about.

381
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,670
Am I a match to him?

382
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,880
Is Dan gonna get a kidney?

383
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,880
No, sir,

384
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,880
you are not a match.

385
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,050
But, Mrs. Schiller, you are.

386
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,680
So, I can donate?

387
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,680
Yes.

388
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,780
Wait. Hold on.

389
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,720
Mom, I don't want you

390
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,720
taking the risk.

391
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,950
With your blood pressure...

392
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,550
And that means

393
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,550
that my son

394
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,550
will get a kidney?

395
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,860
Yes. From my

396
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,860
patient's brother.

397
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,590
Wait.

398
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,590
Dan, I am your mother.

399
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,360
It's a kidney. It's nothing.

400
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,870
What if something happens?

401
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,870
Honey, you're my baby.

402
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,470
I can't imagine

403
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,470
life without you.

404
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,410
When you have

405
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,410
children of your own,

406
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,410
you'll understand.

407
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,610
I'll give the

408
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,610
transplant team a call,

409
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,610
get things started.

410
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,990
Hey, did you hear

411
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,990
the good news?

412
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,990
Yeah.

413
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,120
All right. Can we talk?

414
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,120
I'm busy.

415
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,960
But it'll just take a second.

416
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,260
About your reaction

417
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,260
to the book earlier,

418
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,060
I know you're anxious

419
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,060
about not getting pregnant.

420
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,800
Let's just forget it.

421
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,800
No, here's the plan.

422
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,230
I have some time

423
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,230
this afternoon.

424
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,230
I'll go see a urologist.

425
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,330
What? Why?

426
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,270
Get a semen analysis.

427
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,270
Make sure I'm not

428
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,270
shooting blanks.

429
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,810
Oh, my God. Ethan,

430
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,810
why do we have to talk

431
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,810
about this all the time?

432
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,400
Look, I just

433
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,400
wanna make sure

434
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm not the problem.

435
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,950
There is no problem!

436
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,640
Look, I'm not saying

437
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,640
there is,

438
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,640
but just in case.

439
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,120
Oh, my...

440
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,120
I'm so sick of this!

441
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,120
Sick of what?

442
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,480
The pressure!

443
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,120
I don't even know

444
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,120
if I want a baby anymore.

445
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,620
What are you saying?

446
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,790
April!

447
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,210
Hey, there, Jordy,

448
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,210
good news.

449
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,140
CT scan is normal.

450
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,440
Can I go skate now?

451
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,380
Jordy competes.

452
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,380
Special Olympics.

453
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,610
Wow.

454
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,980
Well, maybe you can

455
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,980
go skate. Tell me,

456
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,980
how are you feeling?

457
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,510
Real good.

458
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,890
Hands feel funny.

459
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,310
What?

460
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,450
Tingly.

461
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,180
Really? Both hands?

462
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,320
Uh-huh.

463
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,120
What does that mean?

464
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,890
I'm not sure.

465
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,660
You feel that?

466
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,290
Uh-uh.

467
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,330
Squeeze my hand.

468
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,070
Not so strong now, huh?

469
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,530
No.

470
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,140
Okay, Jordy,

471
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,140
I wanna run one more test

472
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,140
before you go.

473
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,980
It's another type of scan

474
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,980
called an MRI. Dad?

475
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,580
Okay.

476
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,250
Don't worry, Dad.

477
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,250
I'll be okay.

478
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,210
You're a champ.

479
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,920
I'll, uh...

480
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm gonna put that order in.

481
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,050
Okay.

482
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,030
Jeremy and I have

483
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,030
decided we're going to

484
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,030
try to adopt Sophie.

485
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,530
I'm really happy

486
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,530
to hear that.

487
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,200
Maia.

488
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,370
Sophie's hit

489
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,370
all her milestones,

490
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,670
and her saturation

491
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,670
is looking good at 85%.

492
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,340
Uh, this is Dr. Frisch.

493
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,670
She will be doing

494
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,670
Sophie's procedure.

495
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,670
Hello.

496
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,710
Did you know that

497
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,710
the patient's father

498
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,710
has instructed

499
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,840
that if Sophie arrests,

500
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,080
we are not to resuscitate?

501
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,180
What?

502
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,180
A DNR?

503
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,280
You mean, you're just

504
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,280
supposed to let her die?

505
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,920
What, no, I...

506
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,920
I can't believe this.

507
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,690
Are you sure?

508
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,690
It's right here

509
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,690
in the chart.

510
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,890
Why would he do that?

511
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,230
He wouldn't.

512
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,230
I mean, he couldn't...

513
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,350
Yes, he could.

514
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,390
Sophie's not perfect.

515
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,390
That makes her too much work.

516
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,230
But he's been

517
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,230
so devoted to her.

518
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,630
I've seen him

519
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,630
take such wonderful

520
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,630
care of her.

521
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,230
Because he was

522
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,230
getting something

523
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,230
out of it. You.

524
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,940
Now that you're not in

525
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,940
the picture, he doesn't

526
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,940
need Sophie anymore.

527
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,600
What?

528
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,080
Look, can you get him

529
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,080
to change his mind?

530
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,740
I tried to call him.

531
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,740
He's not picking up. I don't

532
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,740
even know where he is.

533
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,950
Well, I'm not comfortable

534
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,950
performing this surgery

535
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,950
on a child with a DNR.

536
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,320
Maia...

537
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,320
I'm sorry.

538
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,480
Oh, my God.

539
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,790
We are gonna fight this.

540
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,830
Your donor's being

541
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,830
prepped for surgery.

542
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,000
We'll take you up

543
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,000
to the OR about an hour

544
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,000
into her procedure.

545
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,670
I can't believe

546
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,670
this is actually happening.

547
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,000
When do I go up?

548
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,580
Your brother's organ transfer

549
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,580
should take about two hours.

550
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,680
And then it's my turn?

551
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,680
Right.

552
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,520
Dr. Marcel,

553
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,520
you have the honor.

554
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,090
Betty, are the antibiotics in?

555
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,090
Yeah.

556
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,530
Two grams Cefazolin.

557
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,690
Vitals stable?

558
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,860
All good.

559
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,170
All right, let's begin.

560
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,770
His fever's up. 103.6.

561
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,510
Maggie.

562
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,510
I'm right here, Ben.

563
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,310
Let me know

564
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,310
if he needs anything.

565
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,540
Okay, thank you.

566
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,680
I had a dream.

567
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,450
I was fishing.

568
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,620
That sounds nice.

569
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,520
No.

570
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,690
I hate fishing.

571
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,360
There you go.

572
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,530
Hmm.

573
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,870
That's better.

574
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,140
Ben...

575
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,820
Is there anyone I should call?

576
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,690
You're the closest thing

577
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,690
I've got to family, Maggie.

578
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,930
Have you made

579
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,930
any arrangements?

580
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,900
I should have...

581
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,890
But I just kept thinking

582
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,890
about getting better.

583
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,430
Not about my funeral.

584
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,580
My folks...

585
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,710
Are in a cemetery

586
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,710
in Florida.

587
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,010
I'd like my ashes

588
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,010
to be with them.

589
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,850
Okay.

590
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,960
This doesn't

591
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,960
make sense. We have to

592
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,960
do something, Ms. Goodwin.

593
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,530
I'm sorry, Dr. Manning.

594
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,130
So, that's it?

595
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,130
There's no way to

596
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,130
overturn this DNR?

597
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,070
The father

598
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,070
abandoned the baby.

599
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,070
We don't know that.

600
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,200
And Mr. Davis left

601
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,200
very clear instructions.

602
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,570
He claimed, and I quote,

603
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,240
"My little girl

604
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,240
has suffered enough

605
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,750
"and if the good Lord

606
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,750
decided to take her,

607
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,750
we should let him."

608
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,550
That's ridiculous!

609
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,550
He's not even religious.

610
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,420
Dr. Manning, both

611
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,420
the Ethics Committee and

612
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,420
Legal said this DNR is valid.

613
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,820
And they won't approve

614
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,820
emergency guardianship.

615
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,220
This about

616
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,220
the Davis baby?

617
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,220
Yes.

618
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,060
Dr. Frisch briefed me.

619
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,790
Can you convince her

620
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,790
to do the operation?

621
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,920
No. And I

622
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,920
understand her refusal.

623
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,660
It's a very risky procedure,

624
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,660
and the baby is

625
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,660
likely to arrest.

626
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,600
Dr. Rhodes performed

627
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,600
the previous procedure.

628
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,800
That's right.

629
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,310
I'm sure if he were here,

630
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,310
he would agree to do this.

631
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,940
I will do the surgery.

632
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,950
Dr. Choi, something's wrong!

633
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,290
Dan?

634
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,290
My chest hurts.

635
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,190
What's happening?

636
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,420
No pulse. V-fib.

637
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,260
Start bagging.

638
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,260
Charge to 200.

639
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,030
Sir, it's better if

640
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,030
you left the room.

641
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,030
I'm not leaving my son!

642
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,430
Come on, Dan.

643
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,100
Come on, buddy,

644
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,100
you're gonna be all right.

645
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,030
Clear.

646
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,340
Charged.

647
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,610
Still v-fib. Charge to 200

648
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,610
again. Milligram of epi.

649
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,110
Still in v-fib.

650
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,060
Come on. Come on.

651
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,890
Dr. Choi...

652
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,890
Charge to 200 again.

653
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,720
Come on.

654
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,720
No.

655
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,620
Clear!

656
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,660
He's asystolic.

657
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,310
I'm so sorry, Bill.

658
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,210
Dan? Dan.

659
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,750
Dan?

660
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,020
Time of death, 12:03.

661
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,570
Okay.

662
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,710
Kidney is good to go.

663
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,350
Hold on.

664
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,620
His son died. Mr. Schiller

665
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,620
has withdrawn consent.

666
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,080
What?

667
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,600
He has medical

668
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,600
power of attorney and

669
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,600
he's stopping the procedure.

670
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,420
He can't do that.

671
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,470
He wants his wife's kidney

672
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,470
re-implanted.

673
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,700
That's insane. No.

674
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,770
You may not transplant

675
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,770
that kidney.

676
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,470
All right,

677
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,470
everybody sit tight.

678
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,820
This is ridiculous.

679
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,820
I have a kidney on ice

680
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,920
in a cooler and a patient

681
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,920
in dire need of it.

682
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,090
The man just lost his son,

683
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,090
the reason for the domino

684
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,090
transplant in the first place.

685
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,600
Mrs. Schiller gave consent.

686
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,600
When her son was alive.

687
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,000
And now, we have no way

688
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,000
to know if she'd still

689
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,000
feel the same way.

690
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,590
And we have no way

691
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,590
to know that she wouldn't.

692
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,230
Doesn't matter.

693
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,230
It's the husband's decision.

694
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,500
Didn't you try

695
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,500
to reason with him?

696
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,300
When he was crying

697
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,300
over his dead

698
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,300
son's body? No.

699
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,070
That is not what I meant

700
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,070
and you know it.

701
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,070
Do I?

702
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,410
All right. All right.

703
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,150
You two, let's cool it.

704
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,090
Peter, do we know

705
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,090
who owns this kidney?

706
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,020
I have no idea.

707
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,020
We've never had

708
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,020
a situation like this.

709
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,460
I need to consult with Ethics

710
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,460
and see if there's

711
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,460
at least a precedent.

712
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,100
You do realize that

713
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,100
we're under

714
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,100
a time crunch here?

715
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,650
I realize.

716
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,100
Well, until we have

717
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,100
a determination,

718
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,100
keep Mrs. Schiller stable

719
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,830
and get Mike Stowe

720
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,830
prepped for surgery.

721
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,030
Yes, ma'am.

722
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,780
Jordy, Russell,

723
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,780
this is Dr. Abrams,

724
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,780
our chief of neurosurgery.

725
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,620
Hi.

726
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,150
Jordy, your MRI revealed

727
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,150
a condition called

728
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,150
atlantoaxial instability.

729
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,030
Big words.

730
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,030
Yeah.

731
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,830
What it means is

732
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,830
that your spine

733
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,830
is built a little differently

734
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,030
and working not

735
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,030
quite the way it should.

736
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,800
Yeah. We see it in

737
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,800
about 25% of DS patients.

738
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,900
I know.

739
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,540
Um, is there a way

740
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,540
to treat it?

741
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,710
Why don't we talk outside?

742
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,520
Hey, Jordy, buddy,

743
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,520
I'll be right back. Okay?

744
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,880
Okay.

745
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,550
So, there're two options.

746
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,520
First, I can surgically

747
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,520
repair the instability.

748
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,860
But it's an invasive,

749
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,860
high-risk surgery.

750
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,260
It could fix the problem

751
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,260
or it could make things worse,

752
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,490
severely limit

753
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,490
Jordy's range of motion.

754
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,530
And the second option?

755
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,770
Stabilize the spine

756
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,770
with a halo vest.

757
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,500
It's a type of brace, and wait

758
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,500
for the whiplash to heal.

759
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,170
It's a much safer route,

760
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,170
and that's what I'd recommend.

761
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,570
Dr. Abrams?

762
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,580
Atlantoaxial instability

763
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,580
is congenital.

764
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,210
So, eventually

765
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,210
Jordy's gonna

766
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,210
need the surgery.

767
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,190
Right. But it is possible

768
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,190
to put it off for years.

769
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,850
Uh...

770
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,030
Okay. Uh, no surgery.

771
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,130
I don't wanna take the risk.

772
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,700
All right.

773
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,700
Thanks, Sam.

774
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,600
I don't know what

775
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,600
I'm gonna tell Jordy.

776
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,900
Special Olympics

777
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,900
won't let him compete

778
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,900
with this condition.

779
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,030
He'd have to

780
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,030
have it repaired.

781
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,310
This is gonna

782
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,310
break his heart.

783
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,480
I feel bad for that family,

784
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,480
but how much time

785
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,480
does Mike have?

786
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,750
He's gonna die

787
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,750
without that kidney.

788
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,090
This could be it.

789
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,390
Let's hope for good news.

790
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,400
So, legal has made

791
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,400
a determination.

792
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,000
Since Mrs. Schiller's kidney

793
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,000
had been removed

794
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,000
from her body,

795
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,340
the hospital is

796
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,340
considered its caretaker.

797
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,270
The Ethics Committee believes

798
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,270
that the kidney should go

799
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,270
to Dr. Marcel's patient,

800
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,840
as originally designated

801
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,840
by the donor.

802
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,980
Mr. Schiller's wishes

803
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,980
will not be honored.

804
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,320
Gonna go scrub.

805
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,290
You know it was

806
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,290
the right thing.

807
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,290
We're saving a life.

808
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,990
It's a little more

809
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,990
nuanced than that.

810
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,630
Ethan, don't walk away.

811
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,330
April, there's a man

812
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,330
who has to tell his wife,

813
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,500
when she wakes up from

814
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,500
surgery, that her kidney is

815
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,500
gone and her son is dead.

816
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,130
You wanna be there for that?

817
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,130
I know.

818
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,200
It's a terrible situation.

819
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,200
You think I don't know that?

820
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,340
This is the best outcome

821
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,340
we could have.

822
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,940
What, you just

823
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,940
want me to feel bad,

824
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,940
is that it?

825
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,710
What about you?

826
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,710
You been at me all day.

827
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,180
Look, I don't know

828
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,180
what's going on between us,

829
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,850
but maybe

830
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,850
it's a good thing

831
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,850
I'm going away.

832
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,150
Daniel?

833
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,960
I thought you were

834
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,960
taking the day off.

835
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,960
I am.

836
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,200
And I'm gonna need

837
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,200
a few more.

838
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,840
I'm gonna take CeCe away

839
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,840
for a couple days.

840
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,810
To Mackinac Island.

841
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,700
Ah, well, that was always

842
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,700
a special place

843
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,700
for the two of you.

844
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,750
Yeah. Anyway,

845
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,750
we're gonna have

846
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,750
a party tonight.

847
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,880
Just for a few

848
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,880
close friends, like you.

849
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,390
Um...

850
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,650
Kind of a, um...

851
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,650
Like a bon voyage party.

852
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,190
Okay.

853
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,500
Hey, none of that.

854
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,500
None of that, okay?

855
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,710
Well, it's just...

856
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,710
It's just a little party.

857
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,940
Okay.

858
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,050
No, no! Fix me!

859
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,050
They have to fix me!

860
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,120
They have to fix me! Fix me.

861
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,120
They have to fix me!

862
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,920
Just keep it down, okay?

863
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,050
No.

864
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,790
Can I help?

865
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,260
I told him what

866
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,260
we were gonna do.

867
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,430
I don't want that!

868
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,430
I want them to fix me!

869
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,700
He wants the operation.

870
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,360
I want to skate!

871
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,360
Show him. Show him me.

872
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,200
Jordy...

873
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,200
Show him me!

874
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,870
Show me...

875
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,870
A video of Jordy skating.

876
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,610
I can fly. You'll see.

877
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,770
Look, I'll forward it to you.

878
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,080
I can fly.

879
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,710
Jordy, okay, there are other

880
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,710
things that you can do.

881
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,580
Okay, we'll find

882
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,580
something else that

883
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,580
you'll love just as much.

884
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,990
No. I want to fly.

885
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,990
I want to be free.

886
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,890
Ben, I'm concerned

887
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,890
about your chest X-ray.

888
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,930
The patchy

889
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,930
white-out indicates

890
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,930
diffuse airspace disease.

891
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,760
He's on a high-flow cannula.

892
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,100
It's not cutting it.

893
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,830
He's oxygenating poorly

894
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,830
and his pCO2 is rising.

895
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,270
He's in acute

896
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,270
respiratory failure.

897
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,830
Ben, I'm gonna

898
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,830
have to intubate you.

899
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,280
Twenty etomidate,

900
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,280
hundred of sux.

901
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,280
Right.

902
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,670
Okay.

903
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,150
Okay, Ben.

904
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,910
Okay.

905
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,790
Meds are in.

906
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,160
I'm in.

907
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,990
Bag him,

908
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,990
and I'll call for a vent.

909
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,350
I don't think

910
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,350
he has long.

911
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,310
Okay.

912
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,280
I'm sorry.

913
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,720
Heart's beating.

914
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,390
Take her off bypass.

915
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,190
And she's off.

916
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,900
Pulmonary artery pressure

917
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,900
is still high.

918
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,710
Unless we're able to lower it,

919
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,710
she won't survive.

920
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,710
Put her back on bypass.

921
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,640
Eleven blade scalpel

922
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,640
and aortic punch.

923
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,920
Placing a five-millimeter

924
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,920
fenestration

925
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,650
so the extra pressure

926
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,650
decompresses into

927
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,650
her left atrium.

928
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,160
Pressure's still not lowering.

929
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,160
Put her on V-A ECMO?

930
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,700
Not an option,

931
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,700
violates the DNR.

932
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,930
Okay. She's in

933
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,930
pulmonary edema

934
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,930
and failing.

935
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,700
Must be a structural issue

936
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,700
we haven't found yet.

937
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,730
Ah, stenosis.

938
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,840
Prepare for angioplasty.

939
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,920
Look at me, I'm flying!

940
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,290
Fastest skate runner.

941
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,690
Wait, one, two... Okay, now

942
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,690
make a face.

943
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,690
Okay. One more.

944
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,130
No!

945
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,520
No!

946
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,390
I can't stand it.

947
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,390
What do I do?

948
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,970
Hey, guys.

949
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,810
Give us a couple minutes.

950
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,040
This is my fault.

951
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,980
I was always compensating

952
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,980
for having a kid with Down's.

953
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,390
I just wanted to have

954
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,390
a regular boy,

955
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,390
so I pushed him into sports.

956
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,820
Maybe you did.

957
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,230
But he loves that sport.

958
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,390
Jordy's the most important

959
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,390
thing in my life,

960
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,630
he's the best thing

961
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,630
in my life.

962
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,100
I can't do anything

963
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,100
that would cause him harm.

964
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,090
I get it.

965
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,470
Now, I'm the one

966
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,470
who told you

967
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,470
this was the safer option.

968
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,810
And I certainly

969
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,810
understand your fears,

970
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,140
but maybe this

971
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,140
isn't about you.

972
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,170
Maybe it's about Jordy,

973
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,170
and what he wants.

974
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,810
Dad?

975
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,980
Dad?

976
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,680
I watched that video.

977
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,090
He said, "I can fly."

978
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,680
I saw that.

979
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,960
And he said,

980
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,960
"I want to be free."

981
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,490
I saw that, too.

982
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,030
Dad?

983
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,600
Daddy?

984
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,610
Hey, buddy.

985
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,220
Twelve minutes.

986
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,220
Gotta finish up

987
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,220
and take her off bypass.

988
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,050
Final knot

989
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,050
on the patch is tied.

990
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,280
Cut the stitch.

991
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,350
Take her off bypass.

992
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,330
How's her pressure, Carl?

993
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,530
PA pressure...

994
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,370
Down to 50, was 80.

995
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,570
Good sign.

996
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,570
Mmm.

997
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,800
And good

998
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,800
ventricular function.

999
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,510
I believe this little girl's

1000
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,510
health issues

1001
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,510
have been resolved.

1002
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,980
Let's close.

1003
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,850
I'm not gonna be coming home

1004
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,850
tonight. I'll leave for my

1005
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,850
deployment from here.

1006
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,050
Why?

1007
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,330
I'm gonna stay

1008
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,330
with Bill Schiller

1009
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,330
till his wife wakes up.

1010
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,430
I wanna be there for him.

1011
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,570
Did you mean what you said?

1012
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,610
About not wanting

1013
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,610
to have a baby?

1014
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,280
I don't know what I want.

1015
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,720
Well, you got six weeks

1016
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,720
to figure it out.

1017
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,060
Maggie.

1018
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,060
Yeah?

1019
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,290
Dr. Lanik wants you.

1020
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,220
Okay.

1021
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,440
His O2 sats are 94%.

1022
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,040
They're improving.

1023
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,550
Look at his latest

1024
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,550
chest X-ray.

1025
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,550
Lungs look a lot better.

1026
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,710
I don't understand.

1027
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,710
He's improving?

1028
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,720
Seems that way.

1029
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,720
Labs are better, too.

1030
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,090
White count up to four,

1031
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,090
platelets up to 75.

1032
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,320
Below normal, but

1033
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,320
a lot better than before.

1034
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,720
How?

1035
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,660
Well, the only thing

1036
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,660
I can think,

1037
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,660
they stopped his chemo,

1038
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,560
that allowed his immune system

1039
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,560
to bounce back,

1040
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,560
fight the infection.

1041
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,430
Keep your fingers crossed.

1042
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,010
So, are you gonna go fix me?

1043
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,440
Yes, I am.

1044
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,580
Yeah. You're gonna

1045
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,580
go to sleep,

1046
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,590
and when you wake up,

1047
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,590
everything's gonna be okay.

1048
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,980
Okay.

1049
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,670
Dr. Manning?

1050
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,440
It was just like this.

1051
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,160
Sophie was recovering

1052
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,160
from her surgery.

1053
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,960
And Agent Lee...

1054
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,830
Will loves you.

1055
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,330
You would be a fool

1056
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,330
not to take him back.

1057
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,800
Oh, my God.

1058
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,300
I have been

1059
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,300
so unfair to Will.

1060
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,510
All this time,

1061
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,510
I have been so unfair to Will.

1062
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,160
Jordy should be

1063
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,160
back on the ice very soon.

1064
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,240
Thank God.

1065
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,900
Let me know

1066
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,900
when he's competing.

1067
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,870
I'd like to come.

1068
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,430
I will.

1069
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,610
Thank you!

1070
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,280
Looks like Jordy

1071
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,280
gets to keep flying.

1072
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,250
If it hadn't been for you...

1073
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,590
Mike got a new kidney.

1074
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,800
Best news

1075
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,800
I've heard all day.

1076
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,630
Glad we finally got there.

1077
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,260
Thanks for your help.

1078
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,870
Thank you.

1079
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,340
Are you sure

1080
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,340
you wanna do this?

1081
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,280
We took Danny

1082
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,280
to Mackinac Island

1083
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,280
when he was a little boy.

1084
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,860
He's loved it ever since.

1085
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,150
They gave us

1086
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,150
a really good hotel

1087
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,150
room rate,

1088
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,990
because we're

1089
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,990
going off-season.

1090
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,030
Gave the honeymoon suite.

1091
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,030
Oh, nice.

1092
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,760
Oh.

1093
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,760
Got the honeymoon suite.

1094
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,860
Isn't that all right?

1095
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,700
Here. Blue ones

1096
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,700
are sugar-free.

1097
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,700
Ooh.

1098
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,030
I'll take your word

1099
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,030
for that.

1100
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,540
You know, I think it's great

1101
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,540
that you guys are gonna

1102
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,540
finally get that honeymoon.

1103
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,170
Yeah.

1104
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,540
Oh. Look who's here!

1105
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,850
Hi, Mom.

1106
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,970
My baby, baby.

1107
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,610
She's here.

1108
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,280
Hi, Grandma.

1109
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,280
Hi, sweetie.

1110
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,610
There's my baby.

1111
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,780
There's my baby.

1112
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,030
Hey, Sharon.

1113
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,030
Hey, Robin.

1114
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,220
Bert.

1115
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,220
Hey.

1116
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,820
Uh, can you guys

1117
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,820
excuse us for

1118
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,820
a sec, please?

1119
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,020
Dad?

1120
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,000
There's my baby.

1121
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,310
Uh, hey, Dad. I wanna

1122
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,310
go with you and Mom.

1123
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,710
Oh, sweetie.

1124
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,070
Of course you do.

1125
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:35,050
It's just that your mom

1126
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:35,050
feels very strongly that

1127
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:35,050
it just be the two of us.

1128
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,180
I'm so sorry.

1129
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,420
I know.

1130
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,420
I will talk to her.

1131
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,860
Honey, honey...

1132
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,860
Dad. Dad. Why not?

1133
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,500
Well, the way she

1134
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,500
explained it to me,

1135
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,190
and trust me,

1136
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,190
we talked about it a lot,

1137
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,100
is that she wants you

1138
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,230
to remember her

1139
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,230
the way she is tonight.

1140
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,430
Happy and beautiful,

1141
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,340
and surrounded

1142
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,340
by her friends and family.

1143
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,850
But, Dad, I'm never

1144
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,850
gonna see her again.

1145
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,850
Sweetie, I know

1146
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,850
how hard it is. I do.

1147
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,350
I just... I'm just

1148
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,350
really trying to

1149
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,350
let her call the shots.

1150
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,030
You know?

1151
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,030
And this is the way

1152
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,030
she wants it. I...

1153
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,360
But to not be

1154
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,360
there and not to

1155
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,360
tell her...

1156
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,860
Honey,

1157
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,360
your mom knows

1158
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,360
that you love her.

1159
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,810
And you know that

1160
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,810
she loves you. And...

1161
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,810
Hey.

1162
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,960
Lighten his sedation.

1163
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,080
Ben, I'm gonna

1164
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,080
remove your tube.

1165
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,120
Okay, okay. Okay.

1166
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,790
Maggie...

1167
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,130
Ben.

1168
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,500
I'm alive.

1169
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,970
Yes, sweetheart, you are.

1170
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,900
Look at me, I'm flying!

1171
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,960
Will.

1172
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,410
I remember that night.

1173
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,550
I was coming

1174
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,550
to tell you that

1175
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,410
I'm sorry for

1176
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,410
the way I treated you.

1177
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,650
That I was wrong.

1178
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,420
It doesn't matter anymore.

1179
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,420
No, it does. Because...

1180
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,720
That's not all.

1181
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,560
No. You don't need

1182
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,560
to do this.

1183
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,690
I do, I do.

1184
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,420
Because

1185
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,930
I came to tell you that

1186
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,500
I love you.

1187
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,510
And I wanna be with you.

1188
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,100
Natalie, stop.

1189
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,010
You told me

1190
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,010
to get out of your life.

1191
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,110
I know, and I am so sorry.

1192
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,080
You don't understand. I did.

1193
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,350
And it's been good for me.

1194
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,350
It really has.

1195
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,420
Will,

1196
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,690
we can... We can figure...

1197
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,690
No. We...

1198
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,860
Aren't good

1199
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,860
for one another.

1200
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,890
All we do

1201
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,890
is hurt each other.

1202
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,600
There was a time

1203
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,600
I couldn't imagine

1204
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,600
a future without you,

1205
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,600
but I can now.

1206
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,270
I feel...

1207
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,600
Free.

1208
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,770
Will?

1209
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,900
I'm sorry, Natalie.
