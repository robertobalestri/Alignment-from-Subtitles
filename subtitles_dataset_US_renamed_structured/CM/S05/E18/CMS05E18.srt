1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,400
The night that you left,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,400
I kissed Crockett.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,400
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,960
April? Really? Huh?

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,960
All this time,

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,960
acting like friends.

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,940
Hey! Hey!

8
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,940
Come on!

9
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,640
I couldn't let you

10
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,640
keep treating patients.

11
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,770
I had to make your

12
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,770
addiction known.

13
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,210
What you did

14
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,210
was a betrayal.

15
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,370
You're an

16
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,370
excellent doctor.

17
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,080
I wasn't about to let you

18
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,080
throw your life away.

19
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,620
You were right.

20
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,620
You gave me

21
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,620
my life back.

22
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,660
It's beautiful, Ben.

23
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,320
You're beautiful.

24
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,960
I pronounce you

25
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,960
husband and wife.

26
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,960
Whoo!

27
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,270
I'll say it

28
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,270
till the day I die,

29
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,530
there's no better pizza

30
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,530
than Chicago deep dish.

31
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,870
It is not even pizza!

32
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,870
It's lasagna.

33
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,700
We're gonna have to

34
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,700
agree to disagree.

35
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,070
I will not agree

36
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,070
to disagree. No.

37
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,070
You are flat wrong.

38
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,550
Flat, the way

39
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,550
the pizza should be.

40
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,250
Lasagna, huh?

41
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,920
That's good.

42
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,920
Smart lady.

43
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,990
No, Dr. Charles.

44
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,990
Not you too.

45
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,750
I didn't know that you

46
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,750
and Dr. Asher were...

47
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,990
Friends.

48
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,990
Yeah. Good,

49
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,990
that's good.

50
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,560
And?

51
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,600
And she needs

52
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,600
a strong support

53
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,600
system right now.

54
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,670
So, I'm glad

55
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,670
that she has you

56
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,670
as a... as a friend.

57
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,570
Look, I get it.

58
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,570
Romantic relationships

59
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,110
are discouraged during

60
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,110
the first year of recovery.

61
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,140
Neurochemically,

62
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,140
very little difference

63
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,310
between the dopamine

64
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,310
rush that we get

65
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,580
from drugs and alcohol,

66
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,580
and the rush that we get

67
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,580
from romance.

68
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,950
I'm sure, as with anything,

69
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,950
there are exceptions

70
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,950
to the rule.

71
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,460
I have never actually

72
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,460
seen that go well.

73
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,320
I mean, at least not

74
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,320
in my, you know,

75
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,620
three decades

76
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,620
of experience

77
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,790
counseling people

78
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,790
in recovery.

79
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,790
Next.

80
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,390
Yeah.

81
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,630
Hey. So, how are things

82
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,630
with Ethan?

83
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,460
Okay, I guess.

84
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,740
I've tried to get him

85
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,740
to talk about it

86
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,740
and he hasn't wanted to.

87
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,300
Hmm. Maybe that's

88
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,300
his way of processing?

89
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,610
Yeah, maybe.

90
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,180
Will, you're up.

91
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,180
Ambo has landed.

92
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,480
You're going

93
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,480
to Trauma Two.

94
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,480
All right.

95
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,450
Evelyn Myers,

96
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,450
49-year-old female

97
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,260
with progressive

98
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,260
early-onset Alzheimer's.

99
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,160
Passed out at home.

100
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,160
Did a 12-lead in the ambo.

101
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,530
She's got peaked T waves.

102
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,120
Hey, did she hit her head

103
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,120
when she passed out?

104
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,800
Her daughter, Molly,

105
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,800
didn't think so. No overt

106
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,800
signs of head trauma.

107
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,060
I'm pretty sure

108
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,060
that she didn't,

109
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,970
but I was in the other room

110
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,970
when it happened.

111
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,770
I shouldn't have

112
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,770
left her alone.

113
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,770
Evelyn,

114
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,770
I'm Dr. Halstead.

115
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,110
All right. On my count.

116
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,110
One, two, three.

117
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,780
Thanks, guys.

118
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,780
Yup.

119
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,480
Rhonchi both sides. Blunted

120
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,480
breath sounds at the base.

121
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,720
Two-plus pitting edema.

122
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,120
Yeah.

123
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,030
Yeah, Molly, is your mom

124
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,030
on any medications

125
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,030
for kidney disease?

126
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,630
Uh, I'm not sure. She takes

127
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,630
something called Capto...

128
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,210
Captopril?

129
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,210
I think so.

130
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,710
Sorry, I'm not with her

131
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,710
every day. I'm just home

132
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,710
for spring break.

133
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,640
Any family history

134
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,640
of kidney problems?

135
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,150
Um. Yeah, yeah,

136
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,150
my grandma, my mom's mom,

137
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,580
she had something wrong

138
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,580
with her kidneys.

139
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,050
My dad will know

140
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,050
what it's called.

141
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,140
CBC, CMP, stat...

142
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,140
What's going on?

143
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,720
Molly, I told you to call me

144
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,720
if anything happened with Mom.

145
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,350
Sorry, Dad.

146
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,350
I just freaked out.

147
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,480
It's okay.

148
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,160
Hi, I'm Dr. Halstead.

149
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,160
Elliot.

150
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,560
Elliot. Well,

151
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,560
we still need labs,

152
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,900
but I, uh, I suspect

153
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,900
Evelyn's in acute

154
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,900
renal failure

155
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,040
in which case, she'll need

156
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,040
emergency dialysis...

157
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,970
No. No dialysis. It's against

158
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,970
Evelyn's advance directive.

159
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,040
Don't listen to him.

160
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,040
He lies.

161
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,710
Evelyn, honey,

162
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,710
you signed an

163
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,710
advance directive.

164
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,680
Advance directive?

165
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,680
What is that, Dad?

166
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,740
No, I didn't sign

167
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,740
anything. No.

168
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,750
You don't want dialysis,

169
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,750
my love.

170
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,190
Yes. I do. I do.

171
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,190
Help me.

172
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,800
Hey, take a look.

173
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,240
Did you get Mrs. Myers'

174
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,240
lab work back?

175
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,940
She's profoundly uremic

176
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,940
and hyperkalemic.

177
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,040
She's not making urine.

178
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,040
If we don't dialyze her,

179
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,040
she'll die.

180
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
Well, I reviewed

181
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
her advance directive.

182
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,080
She prepared it shortly after

183
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,080
her Alzheimer's diagnosis.

184
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,390
And I'll tell you, Mrs. Myers

185
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,390
outlined a number of

186
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,390
interventions she didn't want,

187
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,090
including dialysis.

188
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,930
And she appointed

189
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,930
her husband to be her proxy

190
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,130
when she could

191
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,130
no longer speak for herself.

192
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,400
But she can speak for herself.

193
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,400
And she has changed her mind.

194
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,340
I mean, people can modify

195
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,340
their advance directives

196
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,340
at any time, right?

197
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,640
As long as they still

198
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,640
have decisional capacity.

199
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,010
Well, you do an evaluation.

200
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,010
And then we'll take it

201
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,010
from there.

202
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,500
Great.

203
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,110
Sharon?

204
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,110
Yeah.

205
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,150
Your assistant called.

206
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,150
Michael's plane has landed.

207
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,450
Oh, good.

208
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,010
It's silly, I know,

209
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,010
but he's 32 years old.

210
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,490
Mmm-hmm.

211
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,490
I still get nervous

212
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,490
when he flies.

213
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,520
I guess I just

214
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,520
feel a lot better

215
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,660
when I know he's got

216
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,660
two feet back on the ground.

217
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,460
He's your baby boy.

218
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,800
How long is he in town?

219
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,800
Just 24 hours.

220
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,430
Interviewing for a sales job

221
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,430
at Kender Bio Systems.

222
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,640
Would love to have

223
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,640
at least one of my kids

224
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,640
living in the city.

225
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,240
Okay.

226
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,010
Need some help over here!

227
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,780
This is Nick Elms.

228
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,780
Experiencing

229
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,780
severe abdominal pain.

230
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,320
Haven't finished uploading

231
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,320
his information

232
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,320
into the system.

233
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,450
I can tell you anything

234
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,450
you need to know.

235
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,450
I'm his wife. Alice.

236
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,550
Trini, where are we headed?

237
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,550
Four's open.

238
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,030
Just breathe.

239
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,790
All right, Mr. Elms,

240
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,790
we're gonna take you

241
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,790
right in here.

242
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,460
Ready? One, two three.

243
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,330
There you go.

244
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,330
All right.

245
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,060
When did

246
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,060
the pain start?

247
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,970
Last night.

248
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,970
Nick has a condition

249
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,030
called familial

250
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,030
adenomatous polyposis.

251
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,410
It causes polyps in his...

252
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,040
Colon and rectum.

253
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,040
I'm familiar.

254
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,510
When was he

255
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,510
first diagnosed?

256
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,910
Five years ago.

257
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,920
It had already developed

258
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,920
into colorectal cancer.

259
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,920
He had multiple

260
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,920
rounds of chemo

261
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,650
but it came back

262
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,650
again last year.

263
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,850
Developed congestive

264
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,850
heart failure from the chemo.

265
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,690
Nick, can you tell me

266
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,690
when you had

267
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,690
your last bowel movement?

268
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,590
Yesterday morning.

269
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,670
No, the day before.

270
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,330
All right. Well,

271
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,330
we do need a CT scan,

272
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,230
but I'm worried there's

273
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,230
a colonic obstruction.

274
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,230
Which means

275
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,230
a colostomy, right?

276
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,540
Mmm-hmm.

277
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,170
My doc warned me

278
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,170
that was coming.

279
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,580
Well, it may be

280
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,580
short-term.

281
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,370
In as little as 12 weeks,

282
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,370
they can reverse...

283
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,040
No, that's... that's

284
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,040
long-term for me, Doc.

285
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,240
I got four months left,

286
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,240
at the most.

287
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,090
I really gotta spend it

288
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,090
defecating into a bag?

289
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,560
Hey, Mags. Can you page

290
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,560
general surgery for a consult?

291
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,400
Patient is Nick Elms.

292
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,400
Late stage colorectal

293
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,400
cancer due to FAP.

294
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,100
Suspected colonic obstruction.

295
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,540
Mmm-hmm.

296
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,540
Thank you.

297
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,630
Got it.

298
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,570
Hey, Mags?

299
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,570
Mmm-hmm.

300
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,800
I can do the consult.

301
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,270
You sure?

302
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,270
Thought you were

303
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,270
clocking out.

304
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,410
Yeah, well, I got nowhere

305
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,410
to be till cocktail hour.

306
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,380
Have at it.

307
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,620
Come in.

308
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,050
Bert.

309
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,760
What's up?

310
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,760
Sorry to show up

311
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,760
unannounced.

312
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,790
I, um,

313
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,790
spoke with Michael.

314
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,640
With him in town,

315
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,610
thought it would be a good

316
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,610
opportunity to smooth things

317
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,610
over with him.

318
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,610
Our relationship

319
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,610
hasn't been the best

320
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,610
since the divorce.

321
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,770
That's between

322
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,770
you and Michael.

323
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,150
I just thought

324
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,150
if I told him

325
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,150
about us...

326
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

327
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,780
Uh, told him

328
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,780
what exactly?

329
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,950
Just that we'd been

330
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,950
seeing each other.

331
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,370
I should've checked

332
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,370
with you first.

333
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,670
Yeah, that would

334
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,670
have been nice.

335
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,630
And now we're

336
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,630
seeing each other?

337
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,630
"We're seeing each other"?

338
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,480
We go out

339
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,480
once a week, Sharon.

340
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,480
What would you call it?

341
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,180
Look, Bert,

342
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,180
I don't have time for this.

343
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,050
Okay.

344
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,890
Babe, what are you

345
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,890
doing here?

346
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,730
And who's your sidekick?

347
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,000
This is Auggie,

348
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,000
one of my students.

349
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,470
Auggie, this is my wife,

350
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,470
Ms. Lockwood.

351
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,510
Nonsense.

352
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,510
You call me Maggie.

353
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,140
Hi, Maggie.

354
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,140
What's going on,

355
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,140
little man?

356
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,580
Auggie has cirrhosis

357
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,580
from something they

358
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,580
called chronic autoimmune...

359
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,210
Autoimmune

360
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,210
chronic hepatitis?

361
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,480
Yep, that.

362
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,060
And when he showed up

363
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,060
at school this morning,

364
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,060
he sounded winded.

365
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,250
He was running

366
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,250
a slight fever as well.

367
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,090
All right, little man.

368
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,750
Why don't you

369
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,750
come with me, fellas?

370
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,000
We're going

371
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,000
right here.

372
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,360
Babe, why don't you

373
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,360
help Auggie hop up

374
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,360
and grab a seat?

375
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,500
All right.

376
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,540
Why don't you scoot back,

377
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,540
Auggie? There you go.

378
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,550
And I am gonna grab you

379
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,550
all the fruit snacks

380
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,550
you could want.

381
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,720
I don't have any money.

382
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,520
You're a very

383
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,520
important person, Auggie.

384
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,460
The fruit snacks

385
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,460
are on the house.

386
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,950
Gimme a sec.

387
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,060
Earl, do you mind

388
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,060
keeping my friend, Auggie,

389
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,060
company for a sec?

390
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,900
No. Not at all.

391
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,410
Awesome. Auggie,

392
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,410
this is Earl.

393
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,410
He works here.

394
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,600
Hey, big man.

395
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,080
All right, buddy,

396
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,080
gimme some.

397
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,050
Did you get

398
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,050
ahold of his parents?

399
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,320
Auggie's in foster care.

400
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,890
I haven't been able to

401
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,890
reach his foster mom,

402
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,890
Ruth, just yet.

403
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,720
But I'll keep trying.

404
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,780
All right.

405
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,780
I'll go get a doctor

406
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,780
and some fruit snacks.

407
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,390
Oh! Babe,

408
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,390
did you remember to...

409
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,390
Call the spa at the resort?

410
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,590
We're booked for

411
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,590
a couple's massage

412
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,590
on the beach tomorrow morning.

413
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,940
Joy, you fractured

414
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,940
your distal fibula.

415
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,310
It doesn't require surgery,

416
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,500
but you'll need

417
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,500
to be in a boot

418
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,500
for six to eight weeks.

419
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,270
God, I feel

420
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,270
like I'm cursed.

421
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,940
You know, I started

422
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,940
this diet two months ago,

423
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,140
I can't lose any weight.

424
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,780
That's why I joined the gym.

425
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,780
I thought I had to

426
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,780
exercise more.

427
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,910
Babe, what happened?

428
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,910
You passed out

429
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,910
on the treadmill?

430
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,480
Dr. Choi, Nurse Sexton,

431
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,480
this is Max, my fiancé.

432
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,860
I was telling them

433
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,860
the reason I joined

434
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,860
the gym is...

435
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,350
I was having trouble

436
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,350
losing weight.

437
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,960
You look great.

438
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,960
Max, it's not

439
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,960
about that, right?

440
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,960
Now, I just

441
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,960
wanna get healthier.

442
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,300
Well, Joy, there are certain

443
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,300
conditions that can

444
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,300
make weight loss difficult.

445
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,310
But most of them

446
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,310
are common and treatable.

447
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,980
While you're here,

448
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,980
we can run some tests.

449
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,770
If you don't mind

450
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,770
waiting a bit.

451
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,770
Sounds good.

452
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,940
April, let's get

453
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,940
a CBC, FSH, TSH,

454
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,940
and a cortisol level to start.

455
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,310
Okay.

456
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,310
I'll see you in a bit.

457
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,650
All right. Thanks.

458
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,800
Hey, Ethan,

459
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,800
listen, man. I...

460
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,360
How'd it go?

461
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,210
Evelyn definitely does not

462
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,210
have decisional capacity.

463
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,410
I mean, she didn't understand

464
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,410
the treatment being offered

465
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,640
or even that she had

466
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,640
an issue with her kidneys

467
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,640
in the first place.

468
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,880
Well, did she seem

469
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,880
depressed? Suicidal?

470
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,660
No, I wouldn't say that.

471
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,860
So she still possesses

472
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,860
the will to live.

473
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,900
She just can't

474
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,900
articulate it clearly.

475
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,590
Well, except that

476
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,590
when she was of sound mind,

477
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,360
she made it very clear

478
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,360
in writing and

479
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,360
to her husband that...

480
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,770
Who she seems

481
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,770
highly suspicious of,

482
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,770
by the way.

483
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,930
That's not uncommon.

484
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,740
I mean, it's often

485
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,740
the primary caregivers

486
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,070
that get the brunt

487
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,070
of the paranoia

488
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,070
in situations like this.

489
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,950
Well, I don't know.

490
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,950
Maybe it's worth convening

491
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,950
an ethics committee, then?

492
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,050
An ethics committee?

493
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,450
Yeah. Just get some

494
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,450
other perspectives.

495
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,380
I really don't think

496
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,380
that's necessary.

497
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,850
I gave her

498
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,850
a very thorough evaluation,

499
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,750
I'm confident

500
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,750
in my assessment.

501
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,720
Yeah, but ultimately,

502
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,720
it is subjective.

503
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,720
Your opinion...

504
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,060
That's right. My professional

505
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,060
opinion. Which is based on...

506
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,120
Decades of experience,

507
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,120
I know.

508
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,120
That's right.

509
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,200
Decades of experience.

510
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,960
I'll see you.

511
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,200
Oh.

512
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,940
Why does it

513
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,940
look like that?

514
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,580
Ascites. Fluid accumulates

515
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,580
in the peritoneal cavity.

516
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,990
It can happen in patients

517
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,990
with cirrhosis.

518
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,820
Did you tell Ruth

519
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,820
that your belly was

520
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,820
hurting this morning?

521
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,730
She goes to work

522
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,730
before the school bus comes.

523
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,270
Auggie, I'm gonna need to

524
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,270
do a procedure

525
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,270
called paracentesis.

526
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,060
So, what I'll do

527
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,060
is I'll insert a needle...

528
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,400
A needle into my tummy

529
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,400
to get all the bad stuff out.

530
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,830
It's not so bad, Mr. Campbell.

531
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,830
It just sounds scary.

532
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,120
So, I'll be performing

533
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,120
the abdominal portion

534
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,120
of the surgery robotically,

535
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,910
while Dr. Castaneda works

536
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,910
endoscopically from below.

537
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,750
Dr. Manning,

538
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,750
perfect timing.

539
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,450
Good morning, Dr. Marcel.

540
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,690
Robots and endoscopes?

541
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,690
Doesn't sound

542
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,690
like a colostomy.

543
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,630
Yeah. Well, Nick and Alice

544
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,630
and I were discussing it,

545
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,490
and we're gonna

546
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,490
take a different approach.

547
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,460
Transanal total mesorectal

548
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,460
excision. TaTME.

549
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,030
I'm sorry. Forgive me,

550
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,030
I'm not familiar with it.

551
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,370
I am aware of TME,

552
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,370
which is a major surgery.

553
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,840
Right. Well, this is

554
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,840
a new approach

555
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,500
that allows for

556
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,500
better visualization

557
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,480
and removal of tumors

558
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,480
in the lower rectum.

559
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,110
Well, I'm sure

560
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,110
you've explained

561
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,110
the risks to Nick and Alice.

562
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,310
I sure have, yeah.

563
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,050
We're ready to move

564
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,050
Mr. Elms upstairs.

565
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,050
Great.

566
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,690
All right. So, I'll see you

567
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,690
in a couple hours.

568
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,160
Thanks, Dr. Marcel.

569
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,160
All right. Alice,

570
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,160
I'll see you.

571
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,800
Crockett?

572
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,800
Yeah.

573
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,330
Why would you suggest

574
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,330
a radical surgery

575
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,330
for a terminal patient?

576
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,200
Even if it's successful,

577
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,200
it is highly unlikely

578
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,200
it's gonna save his life.

579
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,030
But it could

580
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,030
buy him more time.

581
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,370
And a better quality of life.

582
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,210
Yeah. If he doesn't

583
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,210
die on the table,

584
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,470
which is a real risk

585
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,470
given his heart problems.

586
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,140
And I didn't sugarcoat

587
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,140
that risk.

588
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,580
He has seen many surgeons

589
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,580
and none of them have

590
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,580
put this option on the table.

591
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,920
Yeah, 'cause

592
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,920
most of them are gutless.

593
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,920
Obsessed with their stats.

594
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,220
Okay. You say gutless,

595
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,220
I'd say pragmatic.

596
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,690
Oof!

597
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,160
I see us edging towards

598
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,160
a semantics debate.

599
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,750
I know when

600
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,750
I'm outta my depth.

601
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,430
Why don't you

602
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,430
just stay with me?

603
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,400
No. Company's putting me up

604
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,400
at the Peninsula.

605
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,600
Oh, fancy!

606
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,600
They must really want you.

607
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,680
Mmm-hmm.

608
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,180
So I gotta ask about this

609
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,180
nonsense Dad was talking.

610
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,250
It's not for real, right?

611
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,090
Wait. You're not seriously

612
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,090
considering taking Dad back?

613
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,250
Michael...

614
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,800
He walked out

615
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,800
after 35 years

616
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,800
of marriage.

617
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,590
Ink was barely dry

618
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,590
on the divorce papers

619
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,890
when he started

620
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,890
seeing someone else...

621
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,100
Your father

622
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,100
and I had a drink.

623
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,940
Maybe he read more into it.

624
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,570
So you're not dating

625
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,570
or anything?

626
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,880
No.

627
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,580
I figured he was full of it.

628
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,720
So, we still on for dinner?

629
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,750
I got us a reservation

630
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,750
at Swift & Sons for 7:00.

631
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,880
No. That's too expensive.

632
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,790
Only the best for my mom.

633
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,090
And the company's

634
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,090
paying for it.

635
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,090
Oh!

636
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,240
Hey, are you busy tonight?

637
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,110
This new Thai place

638
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,110
opened up in my neighborhood.

639
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,310
Wanna give it a whirl?

640
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,080
Let's give it a whirl.

641
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,080
7:00-ish?

642
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,910
Works for me.

643
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,260
Dr. Choi!

644
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,260
Something's wrong.

645
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,790
Push five of Ativan.

646
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,790
Has Joy ever had

647
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,790
a seizure before?

648
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,430
No, never. Joy?

649
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,430
All right.

650
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,200
Babe? Well, I thought

651
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,200
you said all her labs

652
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,200
were normal?

653
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,330
They were.

654
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,330
Meds are in.

655
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,470
Well, so was this, like,

656
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,470
an allergic reaction

657
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,470
to something you gave her?

658
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,450
We only gave her ibuprofen,

659
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,450
and she's had that before.

660
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,690
"TaTME, Innovative Surgery

661
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,690
for Rectal Cancer"

662
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,190
co-authored by

663
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,190
Crockett Marcel, MD.

664
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,890
Oh. You

665
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,890
Internet-stalking me,

666
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,890
Manning?

667
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,330
Don't flatter yourself.

668
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,330
I found it when I was

669
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,330
researching the procedure.

670
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,890
Good for you.

671
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,700
You spent your lab year

672
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,700
studying the technique.

673
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,370
You did your fellowship

674
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,370
in the surgical center

675
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,370
that helped pioneer it.

676
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,970
Which makes me, what?

677
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,970
Highly-qualified to

678
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,970
perform the procedure?

679
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,310
No, it makes you biased

680
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,310
and motivated by

681
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,310
professional advancement.

682
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,910
You see what you wanna see.

683
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,910
Excuse me.

684
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,020
You are potentially

685
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,020
costing Nick the chance

686
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,650
to see the birth of his child.

687
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,360
What, so you can get a shot

688
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,360
at performing

689
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,360
a complex surgery?

690
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,560
I answer to my patients,

691
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,560
not to you.

692
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,600
Sats are down to 85.

693
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,600
Get her on a mask.

694
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,040
What's wrong with her?

695
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,670
She has fluid in her lungs.

696
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,670
Another dose of Lasix.

697
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,380
I gave her 10 milligrams

698
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,380
an hour ago.

699
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,380
It's not working.

700
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,550
Just do it.

701
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,550
Where's your father?

702
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,090
He went to get us coffee.

703
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,620
Sats are still dropping.

704
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,620
You have to do something.

705
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,620
Help her.

706
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,290
So, Molly, I would

707
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,290
need to intubate...

708
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,290
So do that.

709
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,420
I can't. It's against

710
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,420
your mom's advance directive.

711
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,970
Mom, you have to

712
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,970
listen to me, okay?

713
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,900
You want the doctor

714
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,900
to help you, right?

715
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,600
Mom, please.

716
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,600
What was that, Mom?

717
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,980
Molly...

718
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,980
That's right!

719
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,980
It's me, it's Molly.

720
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,990
She hasn't called me

721
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,990
Molly in months.

722
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,460
Evelyn, do you want me

723
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,460
to save your life?

724
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,890
Yeah, I need

725
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,890
a verbal response.

726
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,130
Do I have your permission

727
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,130
to intubate to save your life?

728
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,130
Yes or no?

729
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,920
Yes.

730
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,620
Intubation kit,

731
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,620
70 of ketamine.

732
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,930
Mom, it's gonna be okay.

733
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,680
Okay, I'm in. Bag her.

734
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,190
My God. What the hell

735
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,190
did you just do?

736
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,530
I mean, really.

737
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,530
This is like déjà vu.

738
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,710
Getting sued didn't teach you

739
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,710
why you don't ignore

740
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,710
an advance directive?

741
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,830
Ms. Goodwin, this is

742
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,830
a completely

743
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,830
different situation.

744
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,640
I wasn't ignoring

745
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,640
the patient's wishes,

746
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,640
I was honoring them.

747
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,340
And her daughter

748
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,340
will back me up on that.

749
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,180
Yes.

750
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,010
Peter Kalmick is waiting

751
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,010
for you in the boardroom.

752
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,550
Tell him

753
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,550
I'll be right there.

754
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,620
Excuse me, while I attempt

755
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,620
to clean up your mess.

756
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,630
Dr. Charles,

757
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,630
you weren't there.

758
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,130
Oh, come on, Will.

759
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,690
An Alzheimer's patient

760
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,690
has a fluctuation in cognition

761
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
doesn't mean they've recovered

762
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
their decisional capacity.

763
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,470
I mean, when Evelyn

764
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,470
was making her wishes known,

765
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,470
she certainly understood that.

766
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,410
The most important thing

767
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,410
she understood

768
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,180
is that, eventually,

769
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,180
this disease was gonna

770
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,180
take everything from her.

771
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,380
Signing that piece of paper

772
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,380
was her final act

773
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,380
of self-determination.

774
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,600
Alice?

775
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,600
Dr. Manning.

776
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,530
I was just heading up

777
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,530
to pre-op to meet Nick.

778
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,570
Oh, good.

779
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,570
I'm so glad I caught you.

780
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,000
You know, everything just

781
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,000
moved so quickly this morning.

782
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,240
I wanted to make sure that you

783
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,240
are on board with the surgery.

784
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm not.

785
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,240
Well, did you tell Nick

786
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,240
how you feel?

787
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,270
I begged him not to do it,

788
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,870
especially after Dr. Marcel

789
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,870
warned us about the risks.

790
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,720
But Nick was adamant.

791
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,750
He said he wanted to help

792
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,750
improve the treatment options

793
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,750
for our son.

794
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,550
Even if it meant

795
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,550
he may not live to see him.

796
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,090
Your son. He could

797
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,090
inherit the FAP gene.

798
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,020
There's a 50% chance.

799
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,040
This pregnancy

800
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,040
was a surprise.

801
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,730
When we found out,

802
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,730
all Nick could think

803
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,730
about was our baby's future.

804
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:51,770
And doing everything he could

805
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:51,770
to prevent our son from

806
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:51,770
facing the same fate.

807
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,160
Trini, will you take over

808
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,160
for a minute?

809
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,160
I'll be right back.

810
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,320
A word, outside?

811
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,500
Auggie's primary physician

812
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,500
sent over his medical records.

813
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,940
Turns out he's supposed to

814
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,940
have paracentesis

815
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,940
every two weeks,

816
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
but he hasn't shown up

817
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
to his last couple

818
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
appointments.

819
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,670
No wonder his ascites

820
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,670
got so bad.

821
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,830
Yeah, I'm calling

822
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,830
Child Protective Services.

823
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,100
Whoa, whoa,

824
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,100
hold on a second.

825
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,770
Dr. Lanik, can you please

826
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,770
wait until we speak

827
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,770
to his caregiver?

828
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,320
Maybe there's a reasonable

829
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,320
explanation.

830
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,750
I thought she was MIA.

831
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,520
I'm working on

832
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,520
trying to reach her.

833
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,250
Fine.

834
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,250
You have until 4:00.

835
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,690
But if she is not here,

836
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,690
in the flesh,

837
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,690
I'm making the call.

838
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,430
Maybe you don't wanna

839
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,430
take care of her anymore.

840
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,090
You know that isn't true.

841
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,090
You know I'd do

842
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,090
anything for your mom.

843
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,760
Then you

844
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,760
can't let her die.

845
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,770
Molly, honey...

846
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,770
I won't let you.

847
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,780
Ms. Myers?

848
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,780
My name is Sharon Goodwin.

849
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,850
I'm in charge of patient

850
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,850
services here at the hospital.

851
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,160
Yeah, I saw you

852
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,160
talking to my dad.

853
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,830
What if I don't want

854
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,830
the doctors to take out

855
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,830
my mom's breathing tube?

856
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,060
Would I have to sue my dad?

857
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,030
Well...

858
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,170
Before we get into logistics,

859
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,900
are you sure

860
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,900
you want to do that?

861
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,480
Do you really believe

862
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,480
your father isn't acting

863
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,920
in your mother's

864
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,920
best interest?

865
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,080
I mean, he loves her.

866
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,080
I just...

867
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,650
I don't wanna lose her.

868
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,830
I don't know

869
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,830
what to do.

870
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,190
My mom kept me in the dark

871
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,190
about all of this.

872
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,900
You know, when parents

873
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,900
don't share things

874
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,900
with their children,

875
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,610
it's usually out of a desire

876
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,610
to protect them.

877
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,750
I suspect your mother knew

878
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,750
how painful it would be

879
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,750
for you to know her wishes.

880
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,680
And she didn't want to

881
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,680
place the burden of carrying

882
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,680
them out on your shoulders.

883
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,220
She put a lot

884
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,220
on my dad's shoulders.

885
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,890
Yes. Because she knew

886
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,890
he could handle it.

887
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,470
But, you're right,

888
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,470
it is a lot.

889
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,400
And he's going to need you.

890
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,210
You're going to

891
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,210
need each other.

892
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,270
Hmm?

893
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,270
Mmm.

894
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,750
Dr. Marcel,

895
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,750
you should be seeing me.

896
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,460
Yes,

897
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,460
seeing your sponge now.

898
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,460
Nice to finally meet up.

899
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,570
Okay. Let's bring

900
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,570
the pressure down to 12.

901
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,260
Ready to

902
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,260
take the rectum out?

903
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,600
You bet.

904
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,600
Here we go, Nick.

905
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,240
Joy, your seizure was caused

906
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,240
by high levels of ammonia

907
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,240
in your blood.

908
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,110
Well, how'd she get

909
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,110
ammonia in her blood?

910
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,780
Testing revealed

911
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,780
Joy has a urea cycle disorder.

912
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,290
It's a genetic condition

913
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,290
that causes a deficiency

914
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,190
in one of the six enzymes

915
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,190
responsible for removing

916
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,190
ammonia from the bloodstream.

917
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,190
But if it's genetic,

918
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,190
why was I never

919
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,190
diagnosed as a child?

920
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,200
With milder forms

921
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,200
of the disorder,

922
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,330
it's often undiagnosed

923
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,330
until a trigger unmasks it.

924
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,800
Such as childbirth...

925
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,800
Another possible trigger

926
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,030
can be a dramatic

927
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,030
increase in protein intake.

928
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,340
Could you be taking in more

929
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,340
protein with your new diet?

930
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,670
Not really. I actually cut out

931
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,670
red meat and most dairy.

932
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,780
And what about protein bars

933
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,780
or shakes?

934
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,280
No, I drink green smoothies.

935
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,550
Triggers aside,

936
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,550
how do you treat it?

937
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,990
Well, you're gonna have to be

938
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,990
on an enzyme supplement

939
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,990
for the rest of your life,

940
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,860
and maintain

941
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,860
a very low-protein diet.

942
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,490
We can manage that.

943
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,490
Right, babe?

944
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,490
Yeah.

945
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,560
Joy,

946
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,560
just so you understand,

947
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,160
if you don't regulate your

948
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,160
protein intake, there can be

949
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,160
serious consequences.

950
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,070
Understood.

951
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,070
Not even a few

952
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,070
high-protein meals.

953
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,970
I said I understand,

954
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,970
Dr. Choi.

955
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,700
What, do you think

956
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,700
because I'm fat,

957
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,700
I have no self-control?

958
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,740
No. Not at all. I'm just

959
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,740
suggesting if protein

960
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,740
is the trigger...

961
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,510
Yeah. And I just told you

962
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,510
that it wasn't.

963
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,050
Dr. Choi, may I speak

964
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,050
with you outside, please?

965
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,880
Excuse us.

966
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,160
What?

967
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,160
You're so suspicious of Joy.

968
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,360
I can't help but wonder

969
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,360
if you're projecting.

970
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,920
I'm not projecting anything.

971
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,060
The only trigger that

972
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,060
makes sense is protein.

973
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,760
So she's either lying

974
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,760
about what she's eating

975
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,760
or she's in denial.

976
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,850
I am so sorry

977
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,850
I missed your calls.

978
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,850
My manager doesn't allow us

979
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,850
to check our messages

980
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,850
while we're working.

981
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,110
This should

982
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,110
never have happened.

983
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,090
We know that Auggie

984
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,090
has missed his last two

985
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,090
doctor's appointments.

986
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,960
And I am really

987
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,960
sorry about that.

988
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:11,460
I do my best to get him there,

989
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:11,460
but the clinic's 40 miles

990
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:11,460
from my house.

991
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,760
I don't have a car,

992
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,760
and I can't

993
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,760
always get off of work.

994
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,700
Is there someone else

995
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,700
that could help out?

996
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,740
Maybe a babysitter

997
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,740
that could take him?

998
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,280
Who's gonna pay for that?

999
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,280
Ms. Johnson, we're supposed

1000
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,280
to report this as neglect.

1001
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,640
But if we do that, they might

1002
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,640
remove Auggie from your home.

1003
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,740
Maybe you should.

1004
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,740
What?

1005
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,110
Maybe you should report it.

1006
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,150
I love that little boy.

1007
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,550
I love him.

1008
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,560
But it's too much.

1009
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,560
It's too much.

1010
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,770
And I can't.

1011
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,140
Alice?

1012
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,950
He did well, Alice.

1013
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,950
Real well.

1014
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,450
You can visit him

1015
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,450
in the recovery room shortly.

1016
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,180
Thank God!

1017
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,110
So what happens now?

1018
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,440
Evelyn's family is gonna take

1019
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,440
her home to receive

1020
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,440
hospice care until she dies.

1021
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,790
I wasn't trying to

1022
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,790
prove you wrong today.

1023
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,160
If that's what

1024
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,160
you're thinking.

1025
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,660
Will, I've never thought

1026
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,660
of you as a spiteful person.

1027
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,490
But we all have

1028
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,490
a tendency

1029
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,490
to put blinders on

1030
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,970
when we're confronted

1031
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,970
with things that we

1032
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,970
don't want to hear.

1033
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,150
Okay. What I wanna do

1034
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,150
is prolong this...

1035
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,820
That's why Ruth thought

1036
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,650
it would be better for you to

1037
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,650
go live with another family.

1038
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,330
Since she can't always

1039
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,330
take you to the doctor

1040
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,330
when you need it.

1041
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,700
She doesn't want you

1042
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,700
to get sick again, Auggie.

1043
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,560
I know it's scary going

1044
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,560
to live somewhere new.

1045
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,700
I'm not scared.

1046
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,570
I know why

1047
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,570
she doesn't want me.

1048
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,550
Oh, sweetie, it's not that

1049
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,550
she doesn't want you.

1050
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,780
She just...

1051
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,780
No one wants a sick kid.

1052
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,190
Max, I know

1053
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,190
Joy wants to be discharged.

1054
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,890
But this meal plan she's on,

1055
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,890
is she adhering to it?

1056
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,690
Yeah.

1057
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,930
Because her test results

1058
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,930
and what she's saying,

1059
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,930
they don't add up.

1060
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,240
Max?

1061
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,240
Okay. Um...

1062
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,540
I have an idea

1063
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,540
of what's going on.

1064
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,380
Sometimes, I wake up

1065
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,380
in the middle of the night,

1066
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,250
and I hear Joy

1067
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,250
downstairs in the kitchen.

1068
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,820
And in the morning,

1069
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,820
there's food missing from

1070
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,820
the fridge and the pantry.

1071
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,120
Have you ever talked

1072
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,120
to her about it?

1073
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,790
No. I'm guessing

1074
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,790
she's real self-conscious

1075
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,260
and that's why

1076
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,260
she does it after I'm asleep.

1077
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,790
Yeah. It sounds like she may

1078
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,790
have a binge eating disorder.

1079
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
I'd like to bring in

1080
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
psychiatry to come

1081
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
speak with her.

1082
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,400
No. I know her and an ambush

1083
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,400
will just humiliate her.

1084
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,240
This has to be

1085
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,240
dealt with now.

1086
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,400
If she overloads on protein

1087
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,400
again, it could kill her.

1088
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,150
God...

1089
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,110
Tell you what, I'll let you

1090
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,110
speak with Joy first.

1091
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,510
Come on.

1092
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,660
I can't do this.

1093
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,660
Joy doesn't binge

1094
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,660
in the middle of the night.

1095
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,870
I've been slipping

1096
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,870
protein powder

1097
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,870
in her green smoothies.

1098
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,600
Why?

1099
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,470
I read protein powder

1100
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,470
can make you gain weight

1101
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,100
by increasing your

1102
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,100
overall caloric...

1103
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,340
Why were you trying

1104
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,340
to make Joy gain weight?

1105
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,880
I wasn't trying to

1106
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,880
make her gain weight.

1107
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,040
I was trying to keep her

1108
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,040
from losing weight.

1109
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,210
I know it sounds insane.

1110
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,210
And criminal.

1111
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,720
I wasn't gonna

1112
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,720
do it forever.

1113
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,050
Just long enough for...

1114
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,050
for her to get discouraged

1115
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,050
and stop dieting.

1116
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,790
And I never meant

1117
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,790
to hurt her.

1118
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,020
I was scared that

1119
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,020
if Joy lost weight,

1120
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,020
she'd leave me.

1121
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,630
You need to tell

1122
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,630
Joy the truth or I will.

1123
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,740
So, Alice and I

1124
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,740
were talking, Doc.

1125
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,080
Yeah.

1126
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,080
And while we

1127
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,080
really would like

1128
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,710
to name our son

1129
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,710
in your honor...

1130
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,510
Aw.

1131
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,510
We're just not sure

1132
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,510
about Crockett.

1133
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,150
It is a statement,

1134
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,150
that's for sure.

1135
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,160
I don't suppose

1136
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,160
you have a middle name

1137
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,160
that's a little more...

1138
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,660
Nick? Nick, honey,

1139
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,660
what's wrong?

1140
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,860
Okay. Take slow, deep breaths.

1141
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,860
Nice and easy, okay?

1142
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,910
Nick?

1143
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,910
Nick, bud? Talk to me.

1144
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,670
Let's get a mask on him.

1145
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,680
Let's go. Come on.

1146
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,680
Drop it. Hey, buddy.

1147
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,940
Heartrate's 133. BP's 77.

1148
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,940
Nick?

1149
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,180
Nick, I need you to breathe.

1150
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,180
Hey, Nick? Nick.

1151
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,910
He's in V-Fib.

1152
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,910
Nick, honey, wake up.

1153
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,250
Nick? No pulse.

1154
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,250
All right, let's go.

1155
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,250
Bag him.

1156
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,350
Milligram of epi.

1157
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,350
Let's go, come on.

1158
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,520
Oh, my God!

1159
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,520
Paddles and charge to 200.

1160
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,050
Oh, my God.

1161
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,050
Nick?

1162
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,890
Charged. Clear!

1163
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,300
Let's go. Come on.

1164
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,730
All right.

1165
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,730
Another round of epi.

1166
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,730
Let's go. Charge to 200.

1167
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,240
Charged. Clear!

1168
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,580
Nick? Nick,

1169
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,580
can you hear me?

1170
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,580
I am right here,

1171
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,580
honey... Nick.

1172
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,280
Epi and charge. Let's go.

1173
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,040
Clear!

1174
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,220
You'll be fine.

1175
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,890
He's asystole.

1176
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,570
No. Come on, Nick.

1177
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,600
No.

1178
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,500
No.

1179
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,140
No.

1180
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,320
No. No. No.

1181
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,420
Time of death, 16:54.

1182
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,830
Nick!

1183
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,260
Nick!

1184
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,500
Thank you so much,

1185
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,500
Ms. Gastern. Bye-bye.

1186
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,940
DCFS is gonna start looking

1187
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,140
for a new foster placement

1188
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,140
for Auggie tomorrow.

1189
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,980
Mmm.

1190
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,510
What about tonight?

1191
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,610
Well, I got him a bed

1192
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,610
on the peds floor.

1193
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,060
And since Earl is back

1194
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,060
for the night shift,

1195
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,820
he promised that

1196
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,820
he would try to check in

1197
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,820
on Auggie upstairs.

1198
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,700
That's good. Taxi's here.

1199
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,700
We should, uh...

1200
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,230
Right.

1201
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:44,580
Baby, I just, uh...

1202
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,880
Yeah. Okay.

1203
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,420
I'll call the airline

1204
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,420
and the hotel. Reschedule.

1205
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,490
And we'll spend the night

1206
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,490
with Auggie.

1207
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,220
You know how amazing you are?

1208
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,100
Mmm.

1209
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,260
You're pretty

1210
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,260
amazing yourself,

1211
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,260
Mr. Ben Campbell.

1212
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,440
I'm a lucky man.

1213
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,440
Go ahead.

1214
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,440
And, yes, you are.

1215
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,340
Thank you.

1216
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,050
Joy, you should know

1217
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,050
what Max did

1218
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,050
was a form of assault.

1219
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,080
And I can call CPD and you can

1220
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,080
press charges against him.

1221
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,210
No, no.

1222
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,210
You don't have to call them.

1223
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,210
I'm not pressing charges.

1224
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,620
Joy, he lied to you,

1225
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,620
betrayed your trust.

1226
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,220
You don't have to act

1227
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,220
like nothing happened.

1228
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,290
No, I know what Max did

1229
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,290
was so messed up.

1230
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,100
But we talked it out.

1231
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,570
You know, and he was acting

1232
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,570
from a place of

1233
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,570
fear and insecurity.

1234
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,200
And, you know,

1235
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,200
Max is a good person.

1236
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,300
I know his heart.

1237
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,370
Can we just go?

1238
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,380
Take care.

1239
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,950
Unbelievable.

1240
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,950
If it were me,

1241
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,950
I'd be furious.

1242
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,580
Anyone would.

1243
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,580
Really?

1244
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,760
Of course.

1245
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,760
Then why aren't you?

1246
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,220
What?

1247
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,220
Ethan, I lied to you...

1248
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,160
Oh, God, April.

1249
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,160
I betrayed your trust.

1250
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,740
Look, what do you

1251
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,740
want me to say?

1252
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,070
That I can't believe

1253
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,070
you kissed someone else?

1254
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,070
Someone we work with?

1255
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,160
You know

1256
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,160
how crazy it makes me

1257
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,670
that I have to see that

1258
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,670
son of a bitch every day?

1259
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,500
Is this what

1260
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,500
you wanna hear?

1261
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,500
Yeah. I do.

1262
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,840
I wanna know

1263
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,840
what you're feeling.

1264
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,780
Why? Why couldn't

1265
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,780
you just tell me?

1266
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,110
Why did it take physically

1267
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,110
harming yourself

1268
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,110
to come clean?

1269
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,920
Are you in love with him?

1270
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,010
What? No! Of course not.

1271
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,350
It was just a meaningless

1272
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,350
attraction. I don't...

1273
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,590
Well, if it's so meaningless,

1274
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,590
why are we even

1275
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,590
talking about it?

1276
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,330
Because you deserve

1277
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,330
to know everything.

1278
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,470
Ethan, I love you.

1279
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,470
I made a mistake.

1280
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,130
That day, when I found out

1281
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,130
I couldn't have children...

1282
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,680
You pushed me away

1283
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,680
and ran into

1284
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,680
another man's arms.

1285
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,510
Hey...

1286
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,790
You called it. Played out

1287
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,790
just like you said it would.

1288
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,830
We don't know

1289
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,830
what killed Nick.

1290
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,890
He was tachycardic,

1291
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,890
hypotensive, and desatting.

1292
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,800
Classic trifecta.

1293
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,800
It had to be a PE.

1294
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,570
If that's the case, then

1295
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,570
the clot could have been

1296
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,570
there prior to the surgery.

1297
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,310
I mean, Nick had pretty much

1298
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,310
been bedridden for months.

1299
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,480
Surgery caused it.

1300
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,480
End of story.

1301
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,980
You don't know that.

1302
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,860
You know, if I hadn't

1303
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,860
put that surgery

1304
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,860
on the table,

1305
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,480
chances are

1306
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,480
he'd still be alive.

1307
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,850
Crockett.

1308
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,740
Sometimes in the ED,

1309
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,740
we get tunnel vision.

1310
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,400
All we can see

1311
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,400
is the patient

1312
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,400
in front of us.

1313
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,250
But Nick could see past that.

1314
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,250
Beyond his own benefit.

1315
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,680
And I think you did, too.

1316
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,390
You know, with new surgery,

1317
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,390
the more you do it,

1318
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,390
the better you'll get,

1319
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,950
the more lives you'll save.

1320
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,360
Yeah, maybe

1321
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,360
you couldn't save Nick's,

1322
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,730
but maybe someday,

1323
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,730
you'll save his son's.

1324
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,920
Hey.

1325
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,370
We still on for

1326
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,370
the Green Mill, Crockett?

1327
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,030
The next set

1328
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,030
starts in an hour.

1329
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,580
Yeah, 'course, darling.

1330
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,480
Okay. Good night,

1331
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,480
Dr. Manning.

1332
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,610
Night.

1333
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,290
Hey, Mom. You look nice.

1334
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,420
Hey, thank you.

1335
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,100
What's Dad doing here?

1336
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,610
I invited him.

1337
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,340
It's good to see you, son.

1338
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,580
If he's staying,

1339
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,580
I'm leaving.

1340
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,580
Sit down.

1341
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,420
Now, this cold war

1342
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,420
you've got going with

1343
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,420
your father ends tonight.

1344
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,830
After what he did to you?

1345
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,830
Forget it.

1346
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,370
You don't know

1347
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,370
the full story.

1348
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,970
What are you talking about?

1349
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,610
Look, I thought

1350
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,610
I was protecting

1351
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,610
you and David and Tara

1352
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,520
by not talking to you

1353
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,520
about the divorce.

1354
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,620
But it was painful.

1355
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,350
Yeah, and Dad

1356
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,350
caused that pain.

1357
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,220
Son, the end

1358
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,220
of any relationship,

1359
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:02,170
especially one with

1360
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:02,170
a 35-year history,

1361
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:02,170
is complicated.

1362
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,030
But, the bottom line, Michael,

1363
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,030
is you can spend

1364
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,030
your whole life

1365
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,340
looking back

1366
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,340
and pointing fingers.

1367
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,910
Or you could choose

1368
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,910
to move forward.

1369
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,510
Now, I don't know

1370
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,510
what's to come

1371
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,510
of your father and me.

1372
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,080
But it's time

1373
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,080
for this family

1374
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,080
to start healing.

1375
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,150
You need your father

1376
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,150
and your father needs you.

1377
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,040
Let's start

1378
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,040
by having dinner.

1379
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,210
You wanna come up?

1380
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,210
I mean, I cleared out

1381
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,210
my liquor cabinet,

1382
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,690
but I do have a pretty

1383
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,690
stellar tea collection.

1384
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,470
But you know,

1385
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,470
if tea's not your thing,

1386
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,430
I can make a gin and tonic,

1387
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,560
sans the gin.

1388
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,270
No, it's not...

1389
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,370
I wanna come up, I do.

1390
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,570
I just wonder

1391
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,570
if that's a good idea.

1392
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,050
Okay.

1393
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,050
You may be surprised

1394
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,050
to hear this,

1395
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,210
but there's actually

1396
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,210
very little

1397
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,210
neurochemical difference

1398
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,650
between drug addiction...

1399
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,050
And romance addiction?

1400
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,290
And should something go wrong

1401
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,290
inside the relationship,

1402
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,590
it increases

1403
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,590
the chances of relapse.

1404
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,290
Yeah.

1405
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,290
I've been going

1406
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,290
to the meetings, Will.

1407
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,130
This stuff's been

1408
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,130
drilled into my head.

1409
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,610
So, what do we do?

1410
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,850
Let's go up and discuss it.
