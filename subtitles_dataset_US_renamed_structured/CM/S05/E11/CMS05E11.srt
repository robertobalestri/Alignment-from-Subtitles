1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,000
Tell me, Lynne,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,000
you under the influence

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,000
of drugs right now?

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,160
You all were handing out

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,160
oxys like candy,

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,930
and now I'm left

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,930
to fend for myself.

8
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,300
But I want to help you now.

9
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,640
35-year-old female.

10
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,640
Looks like an OD.

11
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,800
Let's go. Clear.

12
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,640
Come on, Lynne.

13
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,540
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,990
You and I agreed

15
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,990
what happened was a mistake.

16
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,320
I have to tell Ethan.

17
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,420
April Sexton,

18
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,420
will you marry me?

19
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,620
I don't think

20
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,620
I can have kids.

21
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,890
Look, I love you

22
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,890
no matter what.

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,090
Yes.

24
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,370
From the looks of that rock,

25
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,170
I'm guessing

26
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,170
you didn't tell Ethan.

27
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,240
No, I didn't,

28
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,010
and I would

29
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,010
appreciate it if you

30
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,010
didn't mention it again.

31
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,670
Mention what?

32
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,080
Morning, Mags.

33
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,550
Big plans tonight?

34
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,890
I'm actually going

35
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,890
before the board today.

36
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,520
Uh-oh.

37
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,520
What'd you do now?

38
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,190
Funny.

39
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,290
I'm proposing opening

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,830
a safe injection site

41
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,830
at the hospital.

42
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,700
Safe injection of what?

43
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,830
Drugs.

44
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,270
People will be

45
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,270
allowed to use,

46
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,530
but with medical staff on hand

47
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,770
to resuscitate should

48
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,770
anyone overdose.

49
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,900
This because of that patient

50
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,900
you lost last week?

51
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,600
Lynne.

52
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,600
Mmm-hmm.

53
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,570
She should not have died.

54
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,050
She had a kid, Maggie.

55
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,050
Now he's an orphan.

56
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,480
But that's not your fault.

57
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,060
I gave her the pills.

58
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,090
Her addiction

59
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,090
started with me.

60
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,160
How many other people

61
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,160
did I do this to?

62
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,420
I gotta take this.

63
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,920
Listen, everyone,

64
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,060
there was an accident

65
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,060
at O'Hare.

66
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,260
They're routing victims

67
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,260
to us and East Mercy.

68
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,570
Any word on what happened?

69
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,270
An electrical fire

70
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,270
in the cabin.

71
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,240
Our first victim

72
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,240
is coming in now.

73
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,740
Marcel, you're with Dr. Choi.

74
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,610
We're going to Baghdad.

75
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,610
Desmond?

76
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,940
Male, age unknown,

77
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,240
was seated in the front

78
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,240
of the plane

79
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,440
where the fire started.

80
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,140
55% TBSA.

81
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,140
Full-thickness burns.

82
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,810
GCS 3. BP 70 over 45.

83
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,760
Blunt trauma and suspected

84
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,760
C-spine injury.

85
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,760
Couldn't get a line in.

86
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,880
You know his name?

87
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,430
Working on it.

88
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,430
Airline gave us a manifest.

89
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,660
We're identifying victims

90
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,660
based on seat assignments.

91
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,700
Okay, let's transfer him

92
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,700
on my count.

93
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,890
Everybody ready?

94
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,890
One, two, three.

95
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,990
Cross table, C-spine,

96
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,990
chest and pelvic X-ray.

97
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,130
Yes, Doctor.

98
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,310
No place to get an IV

99
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,310
in the arms.

100
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,970
Okay, give me an IO drill.

101
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,440
Breath sounds bilaterally.

102
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,950
Okay, victim's name

103
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,950
is Samuel Abrams.

104
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,280
What?

105
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,810
No, it's just

106
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,680
our head of neurosurgery

107
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,680
is Sam Abrams, but...

108
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,090
There's got to be a dozen

109
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,090
Sam Abrams in Chicago.

110
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
Wait, but I do think

111
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
that Sam was traveling

112
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
somewhere, though.

113
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,220
Do you know where

114
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,220
the plane was coming from?

115
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,320
Uh... Honolulu.

116
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,320
Flight 3376.

117
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,930
Dr. Charles,

118
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,930
do you know where

119
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,930
Sam was traveling to?

120
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,370
Um... Neurosurgery

121
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,370
conference in Honolulu.

122
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,960
Coming back today, I think.

123
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,240
Mags, see if anyone in

124
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,240
neurosurgery knows

125
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,240
what return flight he was on.

126
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,710
Already on it.

127
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,970
Why? What's going on?

128
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,940
X-ray. Clear.

129
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,420
This could be Dr. Abrams.

130
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,420
What?

131
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,050
See if you can

132
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,050
reach him on his cell.

133
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,480
C4 on 5 subluxation.

134
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,180
Could be

135
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,180
a catastrophic injury.

136
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,050
Straight to voicemail.

137
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,500
Sam was on flight 3376.

138
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,920
I'm all out of rooms.

139
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,710
You're gonna have to

140
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,710
double up in Trauma 2.

141
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,080
Need some help outside.

142
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,210
Another victim from O'Hare?

143
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,380
Yep, Layla Bistarkey, 36,

144
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,380
in premature labor.

145
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,550
Heavy vaginal bleeding.

146
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,060
Suspect she abrupted

147
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,060
on impact.

148
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,220
Maggie, call up to

149
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,220
labor and delivery.

150
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,220
Have them open up an OR.

151
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,520
No time.

152
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,520
She's already crowning.

153
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,430
Dr. Sexton, April,

154
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,430
you go and help.

155
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,560
Yup.

156
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,770
She have any burns?

157
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,770
No.

158
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,170
She and her husband were

159
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,170
in the back of the plane,

160
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,170
evacuated first.

161
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,570
Fire never reached them.

162
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,010
I'm here. I'm here.

163
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,010
Patrick...

164
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,540
Just breathe.

165
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,540
Patrick...

166
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,740
Heart tone's 140.

167
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,010
She isn't due for

168
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,010
another four weeks.

169
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,410
This is our last embryo.

170
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,540
So, please don't...

171
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,540
Oh, God.

172
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,640
I can see the baby's head.

173
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,620
Heart rate is dropping.

174
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,620
We gotta do this here.

175
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,910
You're okay.

176
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,910
Layla...

177
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,220
We've got to get

178
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,220
your baby out right now.

179
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,620
I need you to push

180
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,620
with all your might.

181
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,090
Now, Layla.

182
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,460
Layla, bear down. Push.

183
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,820
Yes!

184
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,820
Come on! Push!

185
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,730
That's it.

186
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,730
You're almost there.

187
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,730
Keep going.

188
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,290
A little more.

189
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,290
Breathe him out.

190
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,460
Yes! Yes.

191
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,460
Oh, my God.

192
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,460
It's okay.

193
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,230
Oh!

194
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,780
You did it.

195
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,440
Baby.

196
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,440
Here, all good.

197
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,840
Baby.

198
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,350
Hi, my love.

199
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,680
Oh! Shh.

200
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,660
I know.

201
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,660
Yes, yes. I know.

202
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,430
Just tell them

203
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,430
we'll start in 15 minutes.

204
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,700
Yes.

205
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,170
And move my 3:00.

206
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,170
Move it to 4:30.

207
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,300
Yes...

208
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,800
Look, I gotta go.

209
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,250
Hey. Have you heard?

210
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,380
No. What?

211
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,350
There was a plane crash

212
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,350
at O'Hare.

213
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,980
Oh, no. No, I...

214
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,850
I've been tied up.

215
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,850
How many victims?

216
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,820
Well, I haven't gotten

217
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,820
a headcount yet.

218
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,990
Oh, goodness.

219
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,190
I'll keep you posted.

220
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,300
Oh, wait. This proposal

221
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,300
from Dr. Halstead?

222
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,800
Yeah.

223
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,800
A safe injection site?

224
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,030
Well, there are already

225
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,030
facilities like that overseas

226
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,030
and in Canada.

227
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,470
Yeah, none in the U.S...

228
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,470
Not above-board.

229
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,070
Well, the judge in

230
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,070
Philadelphia just ruled

231
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,510
that a proposed site there

232
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,510
doesn't violate federal law.

233
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,810
Sharon,

234
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,810
the legal battles alone

235
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,080
would cost this hospital

236
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,080
a fortune.

237
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,350
Yeah, but preventing deaths

238
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,350
would save the hospital money

239
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,890
in the long run,

240
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,890
not to mention the PR value

241
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,180
of being

242
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,180
the first hospital...

243
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,160
To allow drug use

244
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,160
on our premises?

245
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,020
"A PR nightmare"

246
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,020
is how I'd put it.

247
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,300
Sharon.

248
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,300
Yes.

249
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,860
Sam Abrams was on that plane

250
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,860
that crashed today.

251
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,570
Oh, no.

252
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,700
He survive?

253
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,340
He did.

254
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,940
But he's severely burned

255
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,940
and in very bad shape.

256
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,570
Okay. Thanks, Daniel.

257
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
We did four

258
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
rounds of IVF.

259
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,320
I can't believe it.

260
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,320
Is she really here?

261
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,620
She's really here.

262
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,430
Gosh, let me see this.

263
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,430
Yeah.

264
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,960
Where in the world

265
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,960
did this red hair come from?

266
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,400
Don't look at me.

267
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,900
Every Bistarkey

268
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,900
since the Stone Age

269
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,900
has been brunette.

270
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,630
As the only ginger

271
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,630
in my family,

272
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,870
I can tell you the redheaded

273
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,870
gene is recessive.

274
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,370
So it's possible

275
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,370
it just hasn't

276
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,370
expressed until now.

277
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,410
Noah.

278
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,910
Do her hands look

279
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,910
a little blue to you?

280
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,050
Layla, I just need to take

281
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,050
a quick look at something.

282
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,090
Okay.

283
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,090
Who's this?

284
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,990
Who's this guy?

285
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,420
Who's that?

286
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,560
Chest is mottled.

287
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,560
Feet are blue.

288
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,420
Why is she

289
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,420
breathing so hard?

290
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,420
Give her to me.

291
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,090
Okay.

292
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,760
She's retracting.

293
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,730
I'm gonna try to clear out

294
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,730
more secretions.

295
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,300
Still struggling.

296
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,300
Blow-by with Ambu bag.

297
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,900
Is she okay?

298
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,900
What's wrong with her?

299
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,140
Transfer her to the NICU.

300
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,940
Wait.

301
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,940
Don't worry.

302
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,570
We're gonna figure out

303
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,570
what's going on.

304
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,620
Where are they

305
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,620
taking my girl?

306
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,820
This...

307
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,190
Can't be my Sam.

308
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,120
Are you sure?

309
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,030
Paramedics used the flight

310
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,030
manifest to identify Sam

311
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,030
by his seat number.

312
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,970
I don't know.

313
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,970
Maybe he switched

314
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,970
seats with someone.

315
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,310
We recovered this

316
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,310
from his pocket.

317
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,470
Honey...

318
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,540
No.

319
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,540
I'm so sorry.

320
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,950
You must be Lucy.

321
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,290
I'm Dr. Choi.

322
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,290
Your father's a friend.

323
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,960
What... No,

324
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,960
I'm not Sam's daughter.

325
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,620
I'm... I'm sorry.

326
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,290
This is Sam's wife, Michelle.

327
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,230
Lucy's backpacking in

328
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,230
South America right now

329
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,170
and I haven't been able

330
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,170
to reach her yet.

331
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,400
My apologies.

332
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,170
They're ready for

333
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,170
Dr. Abrams in CT.

334
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,370
Okay.

335
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,370
Can I go with him?

336
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,380
Of course.

337
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,380
I'll take you up.

338
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,920
Hey, Maggie.

339
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,190
Hey.

340
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,190
How's Dr. Abrams doing?

341
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,590
He went up to CT.

342
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,930
We'll know more after

343
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,930
we see his scans.

344
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,900
I can't believe it.

345
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,400
So...

346
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,100
Couldn't help but notice

347
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,100
your tête-à-tête with

348
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,100
Crockett this morning.

349
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,940
Looked a little tense.

350
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,440
It was nothing.

351
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,370
You sure?

352
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,910
I'm sure.

353
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,910
Good.

354
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,540
Great news about

355
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,540
you and Ethan.

356
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,180
Thanks.

357
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,550
All I want is to marry him

358
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,550
and forget this ever happened.

359
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,420
So Mazie has

360
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,420
a genetic condition.

361
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,360
Surfactant protein

362
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,360
deficiency. SP-B.

363
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,370
It's a kind of

364
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,370
interstitial lung disease.

365
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,600
"Interstitial"?

366
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,230
It means the scarring

367
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,230
of the lungs,

368
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,430
making it difficult

369
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,430
to breathe.

370
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,070
So what do we have to do?

371
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,070
Does she have to go on

372
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,070
medication or...

373
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,080
No. Unfortunately, the only

374
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,080
effective treatment option

375
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,440
is a lung transplant.

376
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,380
Oh, my God.

377
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,380
Now?

378
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,540
But she's so little.

379
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,750
I don't understand.

380
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,750
Her embryo was tested

381
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,750
for genetic disorders

382
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,290
prior to implantation.

383
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,920
It's possible that this was

384
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,920
missed or wasn't even

385
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,920
included in the testing.

386
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,660
It's a very rare condition.

387
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,660
Yeah.

388
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,100
How will she get a lung

389
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,100
that's small enough?

390
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,130
Does another baby have to...

391
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,130
Have to die first?

392
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,500
Well, there's also

393
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,500
a living-donor option.

394
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,100
The lower lobes of a lung from

395
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,100
two donors are transplanted.

396
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,270
If you're matches,

397
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,270
you both can donate.

398
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,980
You should know,

399
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,980
it is a major surgery,

400
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,420
followed by four to six

401
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,420
weeks of recovery.

402
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,650
But of course we'll do it.

403
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,590
Yeah, anything Mazie needs.

404
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,120
Okay, we'll get you both

405
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,120
tested right away.

406
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,830
Oh, God.

407
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,650
Trini, come quick!

408
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,450
What's going on?

409
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,010
There's a baby in

410
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,010
the back of the car.

411
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,380
Is he breathing?

412
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,380
I don't know.

413
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,820
Stand back.

414
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,490
He's breathing shallow

415
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,490
and he's unresponsive.

416
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,400
You're okay.

417
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,030
You're okay. Come here.

418
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,200
Okay. Let's go.

419
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,150
Get warming blankets

420
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,150
and start an IV.

421
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,370
You got it.

422
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,640
Trini, get a core temp.

423
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,080
Wake up, honey. Wake up.

424
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,350
Wake up.

425
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,850
Core temp's 94.

426
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,360
He's hypothermic.

427
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,360
All right, let's bolus

428
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,360
10ccs per kilo of warm...

429
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,830
Shh. You're okay.

430
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,830
You're okay.

431
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,330
I'm working with security

432
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,330
to locate the parents.

433
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,730
Where was the car parked?

434
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,030
Third floor of the parking

435
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,030
structure, south end.

436
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,760
That's administrative parking.

437
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,070
Do either of you remember

438
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,070
the color or make?

439
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,040
Dark gray BMW.

440
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,100
Do you know it?

441
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,280
That's Gwen Garrett's car.

442
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,800
His name is Devon, right?

443
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,960
Yes. Devon.

444
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,100
What is he,

445
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,100
about seven months?

446
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,900
Eight.

447
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:40,280
You know, when my son Michael

448
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:40,280
was about six years old,

449
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,430
I took him school shopping

450
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,430
with his baby sister Tara.

451
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,730
And Tara was throwing

452
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,730
some kind of fit

453
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,330
about these red, sparkly

454
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,330
Mary Janes.

455
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,010
And I turned away from

456
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,010
Michael for a second

457
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,140
and when I looked back,

458
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,310
he was gone.

459
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,420
And I remember how sick

460
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,420
I felt at that moment.

461
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,460
Where was he?

462
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,320
Hiding under a clothes rack.

463
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,000
Anyway...

464
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,090
I know how hard

465
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,090
it can be sometimes

466
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,930
just managing as a mother.

467
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,100
My husband, Mark...

468
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,940
Excuse me...

469
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,940
My soon-to-be

470
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,940
ex-husband,

471
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,150
he usually drops Devon off

472
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,150
at daycare on Wednesdays,

473
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,190
but we switched schedules

474
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,190
this week.

475
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,950
I'm sorry, I didn't know you

476
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,950
were going through a divorce.

477
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,020
Well, it's turning

478
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,020
into a contentious

479
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,020
custody battle,

480
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,190
unfortunately.

481
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,500
Well, you're obviously

482
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,500
juggling a lot.

483
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,370
I totally forgot

484
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,370
that I had him with me.

485
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,030
I should have double-checked

486
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,030
the back seat.

487
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,170
Yes, that's true.

488
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,320
You were very lucky

489
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,320
this time, Gwen.

490
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,350
And I'm sure you won't

491
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,350
make that mistake again.

492
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,860
No, I won't.

493
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,730
Thank you, Sharon.

494
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,440
Oh, my God.

495
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,780
Um...

496
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,580
Wait. You're saying

497
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,580
he'll never walk again?

498
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,890
He'll... He'll never be able

499
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,890
to use his hands again?

500
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,390
I'm very sorry.

501
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,860
But we are optimistic Sam will

502
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,860
wake up once the swelling

503
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,860
in his brain goes down.

504
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,400
And, um...

505
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,140
He'll be able to talk to me?

506
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,710
We're hopeful

507
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,710
he'll be able to communicate.

508
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,640
Scans showed no major

509
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,640
brain injury.

510
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,110
And what about feeding

511
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,740
and dressing himself and...

512
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,750
He'll be dependent

513
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,750
on others for that.

514
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,750
For how long?

515
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,750
The rest of his life.

516
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,060
Sam and I were supposed

517
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,060
to go to Italy next month.

518
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm sorry, I just...

519
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,100
I'll be right back.

520
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,100
I just need a minute.

521
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,510
Oh, man.

522
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,340
A lot to put on

523
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,340
a young woman's shoulders.

524
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,570
Yeah.

525
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,910
Looking sharp, Dr. Halstead.

526
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,910
Yeah.

527
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,680
Okay, so I gotta go

528
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,680
practice this presentation.

529
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,190
You're still cool to handle

530
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,190
the Bistarkey case?

531
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,660
Oh, yeah.

532
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,660
just waiting on Layla

533
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,660
and Patrick's test results.

534
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,460
Just keep me posted.

535
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,460
Will do.

536
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,630
Hey.

537
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,820
How they holding up?

538
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,990
Not so great.

539
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,990
They're worried sick.

540
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,970
The Bistarkeys' labs

541
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,970
just came back.

542
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,100
Oh. Thank you.

543
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,100
Dad isn't a match.

544
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,670
Mmm.

545
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,670
But Mom is.

546
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,110
Well, that's a start.

547
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,940
Hold on, um...

548
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,940
What?

549
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,450
So, the good news is

550
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,450
Layla is a donor match.

551
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,620
I am?

552
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,620
Oh, thank God.

553
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,960
But Patrick,

554
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,960
unfortunately, is not.

555
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,500
It's okay.

556
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,500
Okay, well, still,

557
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,500
we're halfway there, right?

558
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,290
What's next?

559
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,290
What do we need to do?

560
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,700
Does Mazie's second donor

561
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,700
have to be blood-related?

562
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,170
Not necessarily

563
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,170
and we'll definitely

564
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,170
go over the next steps

565
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,210
for getting Mazie onto

566
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,210
the transplant list,

567
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,040
but, um, before we do...

568
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,750
Patrick, there are

569
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,750
a few documents

570
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,910
you still need to sign,

571
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,910
if you wouldn't mind

572
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,910
following me.

573
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,040
Documents? I mean,

574
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,040
can't that wait?

575
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,350
Technically, they should've

576
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,350
already been taken care of...

577
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,760
Whoa. What's up?

578
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,160
Whatever you need

579
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,160
to share with me,

580
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,160
my husband can hear too.

581
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,760
Testing revealed that...

582
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,600
Patrick is not Mazie's

583
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,600
biological father.

584
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,540
What?

585
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,540
Not her father?

586
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,900
Obviously there's been

587
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,900
some kind of mistake

588
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,380
because that's... I mean,

589
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,380
that's just wrong.

590
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,500
Patrick is her father.

591
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,770
How would that

592
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,770
even be possible?

593
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,110
Usually there would be

594
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,110
no reason to even

595
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,110
bring this up.

596
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,080
It's just that Mazie's

597
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,080
best chance at a match

598
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,080
is a blood relative.

599
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,880
And if we can gain contact

600
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,880
with the father...

601
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,250
Oh, my God!

602
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,250
Patrick is the father!

603
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,260
There's obviously something

604
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,260
wrong with your tests.

605
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,920
We'll, um...

606
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,020
We'll run the labs again,

607
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,460
see if we can get

608
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,460
to the bottom of this.

609
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,790
Yeah, you do that.

610
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,400
Devon's father.

611
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,030
Oh, my God!

612
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,030
Is he okay?

613
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,240
Shh, shh.

614
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,240
He's sleeping. He's fine.

615
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,940
What the hell, Gwen?

616
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,940
I must've called you

617
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,940
a dozen times.

618
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,040
Sandy said you never

619
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,040
showed up to daycare.

620
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,140
Um...

621
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,650
Devon woke up

622
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,650
with a runny nose.

623
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,310
And he was

624
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,310
coughing last night,

625
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,550
so I just thought

626
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,550
that I'd bring him in

627
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,490
so he could get checked out.

628
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,750
Better safe than sorry, right?

629
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,050
Uh...

630
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,770
I'm gonna leave you two.

631
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,590
You should have

632
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,590
picked up your cell.

633
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,330
I thought you were

634
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,330
in an accident.

635
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,570
So that's it?

636
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,510
We're just gonna keep

637
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,510
Gwen's husband in the dark?

638
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,100
Well, I think she's afraid

639
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,100
he'll use it as ammunition

640
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,100
to get full custody.

641
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,140
Listen, if anyone

642
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,140
was trying to take

643
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,140
Owen away from me,

644
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,340
I don't know what I would do.

645
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,110
But if something ever

646
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,110
happened to him and

647
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,110
someone kept it from me...

648
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,660
Trust me, I'm right

649
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,660
there with you.

650
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,350
He has every right

651
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,350
to know the truth,

652
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,520
but the truth should

653
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,520
come from Gwen.

654
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,290
I can't lie to

655
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,290
my patient's father.

656
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,130
I'm not asking you

657
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,130
to do that.

658
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,500
Just give me a chance

659
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,500
to speak with her first.

660
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,330
Okay.

661
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,330
All right.

662
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,100
Hey, Michelle.

663
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,700
I know you had some

664
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,700
questions pertaining

665
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,700
to Sam's care earlier.

666
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,280
So I brought you a...

667
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,280
Thank you.

668
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,710
I've decided I want...

669
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,210
Sam taken off life support.

670
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,610
Oh.

671
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,780
Um...

672
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,450
Michelle, do you know

673
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,450
what you're saying?

674
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,860
When I married Sam,

675
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,860
I made a vow.

676
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,530
For better or for worse,

677
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,530
and I meant that.

678
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,620
But this isn't about

679
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,620
what I would want.

680
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,730
It's about what Sam

681
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,730
would want.

682
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,500
That's right. It is.

683
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,400
And there are still plenty

684
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,400
of things we can do

685
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,740
to positively affect

686
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,740
Sam's outcome.

687
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,240
He could still have

688
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,240
a meaningful life.

689
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,500
How?

690
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,310
I mean, not be able

691
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,310
to operate again?

692
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,470
Not be able to feed or...

693
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,470
Or bathe himself?

694
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,880
No.

695
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,580
No, my husband

696
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,580
is a proud man.

697
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,310
He's fiercely independent.

698
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,510
He would resent me forever,

699
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,510
and I just...

700
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,920
I just can't do that to him.

701
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,360
We understand.

702
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,990
Michelle, I just wonder

703
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,990
if this is a decision

704
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,400
you should be taking on alone.

705
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,870
Who else would take it on?

706
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,870
I'm his wife.

707
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,230
You are.

708
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,230
Of a few months.

709
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,930
Dr. Choi.

710
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,930
Excuse me?

711
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,840
I'm sorry.

712
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,840
With all due respect,

713
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,570
his daughter might be

714
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,570
better equipped to make

715
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,570
this decision.

716
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,010
I think what Dr. Choi

717
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,010
means is that

718
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,020
maybe we should wait for Lucy

719
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,020
to come and say her goodbyes.

720
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,380
No, that's not what I mean.

721
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,390
Lucy has known Sam

722
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,390
her whole life.

723
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,420
Dr. Choi...

724
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,420
Don't you think she should

725
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,780
be able to speak for him?

726
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,920
Sam wouldn't want Lucy

727
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,920
to have to make this call

728
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,860
and he wouldn't want her

729
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,860
to see him like this.

730
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,730
He would want her

731
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,730
to remember him at his best.

732
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,360
Okay.

733
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,460
We'll get

734
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,460
the paperwork started.

735
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,310
What's up?

736
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,310
Had HR check Sam's

737
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,310
life insurance policy.

738
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,410
Turns out Michelle's on it.

739
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,410
She stands to gain millions.

740
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,280
Not surprising.

741
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,080
She married him

742
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,080
three months

743
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,080
after meeting him,

744
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,460
and from what his colleagues

745
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,460
tell me, she was the one

746
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,460
who rushed it.

747
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,500
You know what they say.

748
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,570
When you know, you know.

749
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,220
Look, I get it,

750
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,220
your whole shtick.

751
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,220
You don't get invested.

752
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,270
"Shtick"? Ha!

753
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,060
No, I just don't

754
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,060
stick my nose

755
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,060
where it doesn't belong.

756
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,740
You know, like looking

757
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,740
into a patient's

758
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,740
life insurance policy.

759
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,950
Which med school class

760
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,950
they teach that in?

761
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,570
First rule of medicine...

762
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,240
is "do no harm."

763
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,480
I'm not gonna ignore

764
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,480
the red flags just because

765
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,480
you can't be bothered.

766
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,490
Look, bottom line, Michelle

767
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,490
is Sam's next of kin.

768
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,750
If she wants

769
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,750
to take him off the vent,

770
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,750
we're taking him off.

771
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,090
Yeah, we'll see about that.

772
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,490
I'm convening an

773
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,490
emergency ethics committee.

774
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,930
You know, this is

775
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,930
probably my fault.

776
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,270
The other night, on my

777
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,270
way to my mom's house...

778
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,710
And I was in a rush...

779
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,710
I ran out without

780
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,710
even putting a coat on him.

781
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,440
And I know better.

782
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,440
I just...

783
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,540
We all make mistakes.

784
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,810
Right, Dr. Manning?

785
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,210
The good news is, Devon's

786
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,210
temperature is back to normal

787
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,720
and he is alert

788
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,720
and engaged.

789
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,610
Isn't that right, buddy?

790
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,690
You should be able to

791
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,690
discharge him soon.

792
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,790
It's my mom.

793
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,790
I'm just gonna give

794
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,790
her a quick update.

795
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,390
Right.

796
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,990
Gwen.

797
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,970
Please leave me out of this.

798
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,970
I do not feel comfortable.

799
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,410
You have no idea

800
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,410
what I'm dealing with here.

801
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,370
Just don't say anything.

802
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,840
I'm begging you.

803
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,040
All good?

804
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,040
Yup.

805
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,080
She's gonna bring over

806
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,080
her chicken soup tonight.

807
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,740
Ah.

808
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,920
Ms. Garrett,

809
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,920
the board meeting is in 15.

810
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,990
We should reschedule.

811
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,990
My son is still...

812
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,990
Go. I got this.

813
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,250
Okay?

814
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,160
Drug overdose in the U.S.

815
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,100
is the leading cause of

816
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,100
death in people under 50.

817
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,030
More than 68,000 Americans

818
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,030
died last year...

819
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,270
Dr. Halstead, we're all aware

820
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,710
of the devastating effects

821
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,710
of the opioid crisis.

822
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,270
What I don't understand is why

823
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,270
you want to make it easier

824
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,870
for addicts to use drugs.

825
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,350
And having

826
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,350
the site here.

827
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,510
It looks like we're

828
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,510
condoning drug use.

829
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,080
No, no.

830
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,080
We're not condoning it.

831
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,710
We're trying to save lives

832
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,020
while also offering

833
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,020
counseling...

834
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,460
Do you have any evidence

835
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,030
that these facilities

836
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,030
achieve that end?

837
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,580
I do.

838
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,050
Uh...

839
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,970
A review of 75 studies shows

840
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,970
that safe injection sites

841
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,440
reduce overdose deaths

842
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,040
and the transmission

843
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,040
of infectious diseases,

844
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,700
while increasing the number

845
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,700
of people starting treatment.

846
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,650
Okay, but what happens

847
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,650
after these people

848
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,650
finish shooting up?

849
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,110
We will provide a space

850
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,080
where they can rest until

851
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,080
their high subsides...

852
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,620
And what if they

853
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,620
won't comply?

854
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,550
Mmm.

855
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,550
Exactly.

856
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,290
Why don't we all just

857
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,290
take a little recess,

858
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,380
stretch our legs,

859
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,380
get some coffee.

860
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,500
I'm not getting through.

861
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,430
I have an idea.

862
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,840
So did you sort things out?

863
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,640
I apologize for the wait.

864
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,610
But, yes, we were able to

865
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,610
figure out what happened.

866
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,980
At least in part.

867
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,110
But we ran the labs again

868
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,350
and Patrick is not Mazie's

869
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,350
biological father.

870
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,620
What? This is ridiculous.

871
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,990
Whoa. Hang on. There's more.

872
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,590
Layla, we went ahead and

873
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,590
karyotyped your blood sample

874
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,590
and found that you are not

875
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,590
Mazie's biological mother.

876
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,000
Wait, what?

877
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,540
I don't understand.

878
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,540
How is this possible?

879
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,930
Sats are dropping!

880
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,260
Take her off the vent

881
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,260
and bag her.

882
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,360
Hold on a second.

883
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,500
If Mazie's not ours,

884
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,500
then who are her parents?

885
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,100
We don't know. We believe

886
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,100
there must've been a mix-up

887
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,100
at the fertility clinic.

888
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,480
You were implanted with

889
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,480
another couple's embryo.

890
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,450
She's bradying down.

891
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,450
Two mils of atropine.

892
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,850
Is she gonna be okay?

893
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,790
Heart rate's coming back up.

894
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,450
Sats are improving.

895
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,390
Call PED surgery.

896
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,390
She needs to go on ECMO.

897
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,690
April, get in touch

898
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,690
with the fertility clinic.

899
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,130
We need to track down Mazie's

900
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,130
biological parents right away.

901
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,530
What if we can't find them?

902
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,800
One step at a time.

903
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,740
We can just hope for the best.

904
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,860
All right. Let's move.

905
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,740
I've been asked to come

906
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,740
and share some thoughts

907
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,740
with you

908
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,380
about safe injection sites.

909
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,650
My younger brother Tommy,

910
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,650
he played baseball.

911
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,890
His talent was such that

912
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,890
he was being scouted

913
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,050
by big Division I schools

914
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,490
when he was

915
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,490
just a freshman

916
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,490
in high school.

917
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,030
But then,

918
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,030
when he was around 15,

919
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,040
he started to

920
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,040
gravitate towards,

921
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,100
you know, not-so-great kids.

922
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,870
He started to experiment

923
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,870
with drugs and alcohol

924
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,380
and he was hooked on heroin

925
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,380
by the time he was 17.

926
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,210
There was a good stretch there

927
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,340
where Tommy

928
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,340
got himself healthy.

929
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,510
You know, he got married,

930
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,510
had a kid.

931
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,690
His arm was shot by then,

932
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,890
but he loved teaching

933
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,890
his son the game.

934
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,420
And he was actually

935
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,420
getting him ready

936
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,420
for Little League tryouts

937
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,230
when he died

938
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,200
on the floor of his bathroom

939
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,260
from a heroin overdose.

940
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,610
My little brother was alone.

941
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,810
I know this because

942
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,810
I'm the one who found him.

943
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,450
And I was minutes...

944
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,450
Just minutes too late.

945
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,450
The time that it took

946
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,450
for Tommy to die

947
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,220
from lack of oxygen

948
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,220
to his brain

949
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,380
are why sites

950
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,830
like Dr. Halstead

951
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,830
is proposing today

952
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,060
are so important.

953
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,960
Because if he hadn't

954
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,960
been alone,

955
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,500
if there had been somebody

956
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,500
there who had the tools

957
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
and training to revive him...

958
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,440
Tommy could very well

959
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,440
still be alive today.

960
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,180
Thank you for your time.

961
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,080
I think I speak for all of us

962
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,320
when I say that Dr. Charles,

963
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,320
Dr. Halstead,

964
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,950
you've made a very

965
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,950
compelling case.

966
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,470
And while the official vote

967
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,470
won't happen

968
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,470
until we've reviewed

969
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,470
the funding proposals

970
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,470
for the quarter,

971
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,370
I have a good feeling.

972
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,040
Once we disconnect your

973
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,040
husband from life support,

974
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,550
may be another few minutes

975
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,550
before his heart stops.

976
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,210
If you're sure...

977
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,880
I would do anything to

978
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,880
have Sam back, but he wouldn't

979
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,880
want to live like this.

980
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,290
Of course.

981
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,520
I understand.

982
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
You would just need to

983
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
fill out a few documents

984
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,730
and then we can proceed.

985
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,140
Can I just have a minute

986
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,140
to read this?

987
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,230
Please.

988
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,410
What did the ethics

989
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,410
committee say?

990
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,870
They ruled in

991
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,870
Michelle's favor.

992
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,510
Oh, come on.

993
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,510
There's got to be

994
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,510
some other recourse.

995
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,020
There isn't.

996
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,090
They're letting her

997
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,090
pull the plug.

998
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,240
Sam?

999
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,540
All right, so I tan

1000
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,540
like an Irishman.

1001
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,720
How are you... I...

1002
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,780
You were on the 6:00 a.m.

1003
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,780
flight from Honolulu.

1004
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,290
Yeah, I was supposed to be,

1005
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,860
but I gave up my seat

1006
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,860
for a later flight.

1007
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,690
You know, figured a few

1008
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,690
extra hours in paradise

1009
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,020
never killed anyone, right?

1010
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,300
Oh, no.

1011
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,370
Ethan?

1012
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,800
Dr. Choi!

1013
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,730
How long has he

1014
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,730
been asystolic?

1015
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,300
Just under a minute.

1016
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,300
All right, start bagging him.

1017
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,570
What are you doing?

1018
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,140
Dr. Choi, stop!

1019
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,580
I told you

1020
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,580
he doesn't want this!

1021
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,050
Give him a milligram of epi!

1022
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,050
Dr. Choi!

1023
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,590
You don't understand!

1024
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,590
Understand what?

1025
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,160
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

1026
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,650
Dr. Abrams?

1027
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,630
All right, I feel a pulse.

1028
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,630
He's back.

1029
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,100
Wow.

1030
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,910
Hey, Gwen?

1031
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,480
Listen, I wanted to

1032
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,480
thank you for your support.

1033
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,420
Oh, no need.

1034
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,420
Consider it a favor returned.

1035
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,090
Uh...

1036
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,460
Clearly there's been

1037
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,460
a misunderstanding.

1038
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,150
My silence this morning

1039
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,150
was not a bargaining chip.

1040
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,960
Sharon, I understand

1041
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,960
how the world works.

1042
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,790
No, no, I wanted you

1043
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,790
to have the space

1044
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,970
so you could

1045
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,970
tell your husband

1046
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,970
the truth on your own.

1047
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,970
I can't do that.

1048
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,100
Gwen, I know you're

1049
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,100
in a tough spot...

1050
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,210
I can't lose my son.

1051
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,520
That's our baby girl?

1052
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,120
I can't believe it.

1053
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,650
Patrick, Layla,

1054
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,560
this is Denise

1055
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,560
and Steve Bistarkey.

1056
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,630
Same last name as us.

1057
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,500
I've never met

1058
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,500
another Bistarkey.

1059
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,730
Us either.

1060
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,470
The clinic believes

1061
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,470
that's what may have

1062
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,470
caused the mix-up.

1063
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,070
Are you kidding me?

1064
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,910
How could they have

1065
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,910
let this happen?

1066
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,910
Wait...

1067
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,080
So does that mean...

1068
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,980
We don't know yet.

1069
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,050
We still have to determine

1070
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,050
if Denise was implanted

1071
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,050
with your embryo.

1072
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,810
We'll also run labs to see

1073
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,220
if either of you are a

1074
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,220
match to donate to Mazie.

1075
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,350
Mazie?

1076
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,390
That's what we named her.

1077
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,830
I have an exam room ready.

1078
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,830
I'll take you.

1079
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,360
I don't want to leave her.

1080
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,330
We'll stay with her

1081
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,330
till you get back.

1082
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,530
Thank you so much.

1083
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,730
Okay.

1084
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,610
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

1085
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,240
Come on. It's okay.

1086
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:35,190
I am so, so sorry

1087
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:35,190
I didn't call, honey.

1088
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,250
My cell phone died

1089
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,250
and I left my charger

1090
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,250
at the hotel.

1091
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,190
You know, they do sell

1092
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,190
chargers at the airport.

1093
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,360
I am not gonna

1094
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,360
shell out 30 bucks

1095
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,360
for a piece of plastic.

1096
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,100
Love you.

1097
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,440
They tracked down

1098
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,440
John Doe's family.

1099
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,470
Turns out he's

1100
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,470
a medical sales rep.

1101
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,070
That's why he had a pass

1102
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,070
to the conference.

1103
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,640
You're not thinking about...

1104
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,940
I'm gonna tell Sam the truth.

1105
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,110
I think you should

1106
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,110
just leave it alone.

1107
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,250
He deserves to know

1108
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,250
who he married.

1109
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,810
Ethan.

1110
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,890
You got a sec?

1111
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,930
Seeing as how I just

1112
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,930
narrowly escaped death,

1113
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,050
yeah.

1114
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,390
I'd say I have a lifetime.

1115
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,460
Okay, Sam, uh...

1116
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,560
Michelle told us

1117
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,560
to unplug you.

1118
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,960
And?

1119
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,750
And she wouldn't even wait for

1120
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,750
your daughter to get here.

1121
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,680
Well, thank God.

1122
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,680
I'd hate for Lucy

1123
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,680
to remember me like that.

1124
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,410
I'm sorry, but...

1125
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,650
I didn't get the sense

1126
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,650
that Michelle had your

1127
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,650
best interest at heart.

1128
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,020
Uh-huh.

1129
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,820
And what would

1130
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,820
make you think that?

1131
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,280
Ah.

1132
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,790
I get it.

1133
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,520
Maybe you're thinking

1134
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,520
the only reason

1135
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,520
a woman like her

1136
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,600
would be with a guy

1137
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,600
like me is money.

1138
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,640
No, no, no. I didn't

1139
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,640
mean that at all.

1140
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,190
For your information,

1141
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,210
I'm the eye candy

1142
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,210
in this relationship.

1143
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,380
You ever hear of

1144
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,380
Max Amino Pro?

1145
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,810
The protein shake?

1146
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,840
Yeah, I drink it every day.

1147
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,480
Right, so does

1148
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,480
every fitness freak

1149
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,480
in the country.

1150
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,780
My wife invented the formula.

1151
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,310
Yeah.

1152
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,220
Cha-ching.

1153
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,550
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1154
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,170
You lying bitch.

1155
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,170
Mark.

1156
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,010
You will never be alone

1157
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,010
with our child again.

1158
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,380
Please, please. Let me...

1159
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,380
No.

1160
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,670
Let me explain.

1161
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,670
You'll be hearing

1162
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,670
from my lawyer. No.

1163
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,010
He was asking questions

1164
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,010
and blaming himself.

1165
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,250
I had to tell him the truth.

1166
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,150
You had no right

1167
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,150
to insert yourself.

1168
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,850
I am your baby's doctor.

1169
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,850
Do you see what you've done?

1170
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,650
If I lose my son...

1171
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,650
Listen, Gwen...

1172
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,390
Sharon, this does not

1173
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,390
concern you.

1174
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,760
Actually, it does.

1175
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,760
I instructed Dr. Manning

1176
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,330
to be honest

1177
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,330
with your husband.

1178
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,420
Ms. Goodwin, you don't...

1179
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,560
I confided in you.

1180
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,760
Lying to a minor's guardian?

1181
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,760
Come on, Gwen!

1182
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,170
It's too big of a liability.

1183
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,070
You wanna talk about

1184
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,070
liabilities?

1185
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,400
You can forget about

1186
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,400
your little pet project.

1187
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,870
Consider the safe

1188
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,870
injection site dead.

1189
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,350
Really?

1190
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,120
You know, I actually

1191
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,120
thought that you and I

1192
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,120
made some strides today.

1193
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,720
Me too.

1194
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,590
Ms. Goodwin, I'm sorry.

1195
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,590
I couldn't...

1196
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,290
There is no need

1197
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,290
for you to apologize.

1198
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,710
Hey.

1199
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,710
I just heard

1200
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,710
that the board passed.

1201
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,710
I'm sorry.

1202
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,450
It was a valiant effort.

1203
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,250
I don't know

1204
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,250
what the hell happened.

1205
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
They spouted some

1206
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
legalistic garbage

1207
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
in the rejection email.

1208
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,590
They're just, you know...

1209
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,590
They're afraid.

1210
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,160
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.

1211
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,160
There's another way.

1212
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,670
What do you mean?

1213
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,900
Look, I wanted to do this

1214
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,900
on the up-and-up,

1215
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,670
but if they're not

1216
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,670
gonna let me spearhead it

1217
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,670
at the hospital,

1218
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,950
I got a friend who's got

1219
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,950
something already

1220
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,950
in the works.

1221
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,910
You mean an

1222
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,910
unsanctioned site?

1223
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,090
You said it yourself.

1224
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,140
A site like this could've

1225
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,140
saved your brother's life.

1226
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,450
I know how badly

1227
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,450
you wanna help,

1228
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,790
but, buddy, they're illegal.

1229
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,790
I mean, you could

1230
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,790
lose your license.

1231
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,590
Yeah. You're right.

1232
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,330
Thank you for your help today.

1233
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,030
Well, of course.

1234
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,830
And Dr. Charles...

1235
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,840
I'm sorry

1236
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,840
about your brother.

1237
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,350
After testing and

1238
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,350
speaking with the clinic,

1239
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,520
we can confirm they

1240
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,520
made a terrible mistake

1241
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,120
and swapped your embryos.

1242
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,790
Denise is carrying

1243
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,790
your baby.

1244
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,390
Oh, thank God.

1245
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,190
Uh... What about Mazie?

1246
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,060
Steve is a donor match.

1247
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,190
But I wasn't?

1248
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,560
Unfortunately, no.

1249
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,400
Don't worry.

1250
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,410
There are other options

1251
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,410
to find a second donor.

1252
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,200
We're getting her on

1253
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,200
the transplant list.

1254
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,500
Wait, you said

1255
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,500
I'm a match, right?

1256
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,840
You are, yes.

1257
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,810
Yeah.

1258
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,370
I'll do it.

1259
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,370
I'll donate.

1260
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,150
We can't ask that of you.

1261
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,090
No, no, you have done more

1262
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,090
for us than you know.

1263
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,690
Besides, me and Mazie,

1264
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,690
we've been through a lot.

1265
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,820
And I know she isn't mine...

1266
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,000
But I still love her

1267
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,000
like she is.

1268
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,910
Wow, what a crazy ride.

1269
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,540
Like an IVF nightmare.

1270
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,610
Look at them.

1271
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,410
I'm guessing

1272
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,410
they'd do it all again.

1273
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,290
Listen, Crockett.

1274
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,740
Yeah.

1275
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,910
You might've noticed I can

1276
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,910
be a little quick to judge.

1277
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,450
I get it, man.

1278
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,450
You were trying

1279
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,450
to do right by Sam.

1280
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,740
It's all good.

1281
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,740
Not just with that.

1282
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,750
With you, too.

1283
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,450
Oh.

1284
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,480
Well...

1285
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,480
Look, man.

1286
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,120
I made some assumptions

1287
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,120
about you. The truth is,

1288
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,120
I really don't know you.

1289
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,260
Appreciate the sentiment,

1290
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,260
but you don't...

1291
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,970
You don't have to worry

1292
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,970
about it, man.

1293
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,300
It's all good.

1294
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,300
Yeah, I do.

1295
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,680
Fresh start?

1296
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,440
Sure.

1297
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,610
What's going on?

1298
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,610
Hey.

1299
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,250
Nothing, just

1300
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,250
saying good night.

1301
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,580
Oh.

1302
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,680
Well, good night,

1303
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,680
Dr. Marcel.

1304
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,490
Good night.

1305
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,320
Hi.

1306
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,830
Ethan?

1307
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,830
Yeah?

1308
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,340
I want us to try to

1309
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,340
get pregnant again.

1310
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,000
Really?

1311
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,140
What if we give IVF a shot?

1312
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,850
I thought

1313
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,850
you didn't want to

1314
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,850
go down that road.

1315
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,940
I know, I just...

1316
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,770
I was afraid.

1317
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,820
And IVF isn't a sure thing

1318
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,820
and given my condition,

1319
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,320
it's possible it may

1320
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,320
not even work,

1321
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,450
but there's a chance

1322
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,450
that it could.

1323
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,130
It seems like it's

1324
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,130
worth the risk.

1325
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,800
Right?

1326
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,800
Yeah.

1327
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,320
Nice, Matty.

1328
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,320
Don't pinch your shoulders.

1329
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,880
It could cause elbow problems

1330
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,880
down the road.

1331
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,180
Just ignore him.

1332
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,710
When Uncle Dan was

1333
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,710
your age, he was picking

1334
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,710
dandelions in the outfield.

1335
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,860
Why the mirrors?

1336
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,400
It makes it easier

1337
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,400
for the users to find a vein

1338
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,700
and helps us keep an eye

1339
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,700
on everybody.

1340
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,740
Where are you getting

1341
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,740
the naloxone kits?

1342
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,470
I got a guy who's

1343
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,470
hooking us up.

1344
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,640
There's a clinic that's

1345
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,640
closing on the South Side,

1346
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,770
so we're getting them

1347
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,770
on the cheap.

1348
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,450
Anyway, uh,

1349
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,450
what do you think?

1350
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,120
You in?

1351
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,090
Yeah. I'm in.
