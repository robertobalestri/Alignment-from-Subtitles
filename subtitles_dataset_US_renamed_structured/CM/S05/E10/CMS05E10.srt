1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,070
I like to call it

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,070
exactly what it is.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,660
Low ovarian reserve.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,400
I'm the reason we haven't

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,400
gotten pregnant.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,870
Look, I just

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,870
wanna make sure

8
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,870
I'm not the problem.

9
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,840
I don't even know

10
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,840
if I want

11
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,840
a baby anymore.

12
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,240
Look, I don't know

13
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,240
what's going

14
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,240
on between us,

15
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,370
but maybe

16
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,370
it's a good thing

17
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,370
I'm going away.

18
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,350
You told me to get

19
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,350
out of your life.

20
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,480
We can figure...

21
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,950
We aren't good

22
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,950
for one another.

23
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,650
I'm sorry, Natalie.

24
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,190
Hey.

25
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,190
I'm alive.

26
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,820
Yes, sweetheart.

27
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,520
I want you to remarry.

28
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,630
She wants you

29
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,630
to remember her

30
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,630
the way she is tonight.

31
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,400
But, Dad, I'm never

32
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,400
gonna see her again.

33
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,610
Do you want

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,610
me to come with you?

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,120
Nah, it's just

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,120
a blood draw.

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,890
So, big day, huh?

38
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,930
First day of radiation.

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,930
Yeah.

40
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,290
3:00, in the basement.

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,960
So, I'll stick

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,960
around, then.

43
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,160
You don't have to.

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,160
Why?

45
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,670
You don't have to.

46
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,670
Uh-huh.

47
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,970
You don't have to.

48
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,970
Mmm-hmm.

49
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,100
Hey.

50
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,310
Hey.

51
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,510
You going to Lainey's

52
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,510
thing tonight?

53
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,820
I haven't decided yet.

54
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,690
I mean, you were always

55
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,690
closer to her than I was.

56
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,520
You don't have to

57
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,520
tiptoe around me.

58
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,760
I mean, if you want

59
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,760
to go to the party,

60
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,460
you should go

61
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,460
to the party.

62
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,300
Sure, of course.

63
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,130
Look, I'll see

64
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,130
you there.

65
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,470
Okay.

66
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,670
Actually, Will?

67
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,910
I'd like us

68
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,910
to be friends again,

69
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,140
if that's something

70
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,140
you want, too, of course.

71
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,120
Yeah.

72
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,380
Yeah, I would.

73
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,220
I really hate

74
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,220
to break this up,

75
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,160
but I got a peds burn

76
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,160
in Treatment Four.

77
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,220
Got it.

78
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,220
You, too, Will.

79
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,300
Mom's a little agitated.

80
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,300
Trini thinks

81
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,300
she's on something.

82
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,400
I don't seem to have

83
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,400
my insurance card

84
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,100
with me here right now.

85
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,000
I know I'm in the system,

86
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,000
though. You can look it up.

87
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,570
That's okay.

88
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,570
We can deal

89
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,570
with it later.

90
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,510
Hi, Ms. Driscoll?

91
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,510
I'm Dr. Manning,

92
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,510
and this is Dr...

93
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,340
Dr. Halstead, yes.

94
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,880
I told you

95
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,880
I was here before.

96
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,470
He's the one

97
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,470
that saw me.

98
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,510
Of course, I remember.

99
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,510
Yeah.

100
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,250
So, I understand

101
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,250
Jesse here

102
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,250
had an accident.

103
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,380
Yeah, um,

104
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,390
he was nuking some

105
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,390
water in the microwave

106
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,520
to make some oatmeal,

107
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,250
and I told him that

108
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,250
he shouldn't do that

109
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,730
if I wasn't

110
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,730
there with him.

111
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,960
Sorry.

112
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,660
I'm sorry, Mommy.

113
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,700
You know, I just turned

114
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,700
around for a second.

115
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,060
I swear.

116
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,060
It's okay.

117
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,500
You are very

118
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,500
brave, Jesse.

119
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,370
I can't believe

120
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,370
you're only six.

121
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,500
How about we give

122
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,500
Dr. Manning some...

123
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,980
I'm sorry. Just give

124
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,980
her a little space

125
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,980
to examine...

126
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,210
No, I need to be

127
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,210
here with him.

128
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,010
I'm so sorry,

129
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,010
I'll get...

130
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,710
That's okay. No problem.

131
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,050
Thanks.

132
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,410
Your finger's injured.

133
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,050
How'd that happen?

134
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,450
I must have done it

135
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,450
when I was trying

136
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,450
to get in my car.

137
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,090
How about we go next door?

138
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,090
I'll take a look at it.

139
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,290
I... I want to be

140
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,290
here with him.

141
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,990
We'll be right in there.

142
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,470
You can keep

143
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,470
your eye on him

144
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,470
through the window.

145
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,040
How's that sound?

146
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,040
Uh...

147
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay.

148
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,170
Okay.

149
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,180
Baby, I'm gonna

150
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,180
be right here.

151
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
All right, you're doing

152
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
so well, Jesse.

153
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,050
There you go.

154
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,050
Yeah.

155
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,750
All right, you can have

156
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,750
a seat on the bed there.

157
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,790
Let's take a look

158
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,790
at that finger.

159
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,960
I know.

160
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,820
Yeah,

161
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,820
it's dislocated.

162
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,400
I had to get us

163
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,400
to the hospital.

164
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,740
My keys were

165
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,740
locked in the car

166
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,000
and I thought

167
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,000
I'd smash the window.

168
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,230
I finally realized

169
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,230
I have a spare in

170
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,230
the kitchen drawer.

171
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,010
Tell me, Lynne,

172
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,010
you under the influence

173
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,010
of drugs right now?

174
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,640
What? No.

175
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,750
No.

176
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,990
There are a number

177
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,990
of treatment programs

178
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,990
I can recommend

179
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,320
if you're struggling

180
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,320
with addiction.

181
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,450
"Addiction"?

182
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,360
You didn't really

183
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,360
recognize me

184
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,360
in there, did you?

185
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,360
Five milligrams of Oxy,

186
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,360
eight times a day.

187
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,370
You said,

188
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,370
"Should be fine.

189
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,370
No problem."

190
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,700
That was four years ago.

191
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,170
You want to point

192
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,170
the finger at someone?

193
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,870
Try looking in the mirror.

194
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,690
3% to 4% superficial

195
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,690
partial thickness

196
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,860
on the shin,

197
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,860
ankle, and foot.

198
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,060
All right, let's prep

199
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,060
to wash and debride.

200
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,530
Is it bad?

201
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,040
It is not as bad

202
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,040
as it looks, all right?

203
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,130
And if we take really

204
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,130
good care of it,

205
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,130
it'll be better in no time.

206
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,170
So, when the accident

207
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,170
happened with the microwave,

208
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,300
where was your mommy?

209
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,710
Was she sleeping?

210
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,750
My mom works really hard.

211
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,750
It makes her tired.

212
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,290
I didn't want

213
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,290
to wake her up.

214
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,550
It's all right, Jesse.

215
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,290
Well, you're right.

216
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,290
I saw you a little

217
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,290
over four years ago.

218
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,230
You were complaining of

219
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,230
post-surgical complications

220
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,230
with your left knee,

221
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,430
and you stated

222
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,430
then your pain

223
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,430
level was a nine

224
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,730
on a one-to-10 scale.

225
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,170
I wasn't lying.

226
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
No, I'm not

227
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
saying you were.

228
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,300
If you didn't believe me,

229
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,300
you shouldn't have

230
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,300
written a prescription.

231
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,370
You all were handing

232
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,370
these things

233
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,370
out like candy,

234
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,410
and now that

235
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,410
you've decided

236
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,410
there's a problem,

237
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,570
I'm left to fend

238
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,570
for myself.

239
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,410
You think I like

240
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,410
having to score drugs

241
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,410
out on the street?

242
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,220
It shouldn't

243
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,220
have happened.

244
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,520
Maybe I should have

245
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,520
been more careful.

246
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,620
But I want to help you now,

247
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,620
and I'm sorry I didn't

248
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,620
recognize you.

249
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,860
I got high this morning

250
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,460
instead of getting

251
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,460
my boy ready for school.

252
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,970
How can anything be more

253
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,970
important to me than him?

254
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,230
I'm...

255
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,230
I'm just so ashamed.

256
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,480
It's all right.

257
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,940
We need to talk.

258
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,490
Shoot, Sexton.

259
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,490
I'm all ears.

260
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,320
Crockett.

261
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,320
Yeah?

262
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,290
What's with

263
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,290
the cloak and dagger?

264
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,130
Ethan is coming home

265
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,130
from deployment tomorrow.

266
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,140
Uh-huh. I take it

267
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,140
you two haven't spoken.

268
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,800
Yeah, well, he's been

269
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,800
incommunicado.

270
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,800
It's Navy protocol.

271
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,900
Look, I have been

272
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,900
agonizing over this

273
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,900
for six weeks.

274
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know

275
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,000
what I'm gonna say.

276
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,340
How about, "Ethan,

277
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,340
so glad to see you"?

278
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,820
I mean, you and I agreed

279
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,820
what happened

280
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,820
was a mistake, right?

281
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,010
Crockett, I kissed you.

282
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,010
Yeah, for like

283
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,010
three seconds.

284
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,180
Because you stopped me.

285
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,180
I don't even know what

286
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,180
would have happened if...

287
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,320
Don't make yourself

288
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,320
crazy over this.

289
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,190
Okay, I have

290
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,190
to tell Ethan.

291
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,520
Dr. Marcel.

292
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,520
Yeah?

293
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,830
Incoming. You're going

294
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,830
to Baghdad.

295
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,700
Copy. Duty calls.

296
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,460
Come on.

297
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,970
You good, Dr. Sexton?

298
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,970
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

299
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,940
Okay, with me.

300
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,940
33-year-old male.

301
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,840
Side impact, high-speed

302
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,840
motor vehicle collision.

303
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,380
GCS 15.

304
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,380
Can you

305
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,380
tell me your name?

306
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,970
Alex.

307
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,970
Okay, Alex,

308
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,970
I'm Dr. Marcel.

309
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,710
This is Dr. Sexton

310
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,710
and Nurse April.

311
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,550
We're gonna get you

312
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,550
patched up, okay?

313
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,550
Nice and easy, folks.

314
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,280
We go on my count.

315
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,190
One, two, three.

316
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,960
Nice and easy.

317
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,290
Go.

318
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,490
All right, got a deformity

319
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,490
of the left arm.

320
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,030
Good pulses. X-ray!

321
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,040
BP 104 over 62.

322
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,040
Heart rate 100.

323
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,400
Hurts to breathe.

324
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,730
Poor breath sounds

325
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,730
on the left side.

326
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,000
Probable pneumothorax.

327
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,000
Chest, Mike.

328
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,540
April, April,

329
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,540
help.

330
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,980
Hey, Alex, you gotta

331
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,980
lay down for us, okay?

332
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,240
Good call, Dr. Sexton.

333
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,240
It's your show.

334
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,410
Chest tube tray.

335
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,910
Wait, what are you doing?

336
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,360
One of your lungs

337
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,360
has collapsed.

338
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,360
I need to insert

339
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,360
a tube to reinflate it.

340
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,900
Oh, my God,

341
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,900
you're gonna put me under?

342
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,260
Just numb you up.

343
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,260
Give you something

344
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,260
for the pain.

345
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,890
100 of fentanyl,

346
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,890
10 CCs lidocaine.

347
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,890
Ultrasound to me.

348
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,250
I'm in.

349
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,550
Okay, I'm seeing

350
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,550
some free fluid.

351
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,920
Hang a unit of blood

352
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,920
and plasma and draw

353
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,920
trauma labs.

354
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,620
Call upstairs

355
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,620
for a pan scan.

356
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,620
What's happening?

357
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,360
We're sending you

358
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,360
upstairs to get a clearer

359
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,360
picture of what's going on.

360
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,630
Once we get that sorted,

361
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,630
we're gonna have Ortho set

362
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,630
that arm of yours, all right?

363
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,100
Alex, you're in

364
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,100
good hands here.

365
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,470
Just sit tight, bud, okay?

366
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,800
Excuse me, Lynne?

367
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,770
I just wanted

368
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,770
to give you an update

369
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,770
on your son.

370
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,470
The debriding went well,

371
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,310
and Jesse's wounds

372
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,310
don't appear to be infected.

373
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,280
Will there be scarring?

374
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,650
Well, every

375
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,650
patient's different,

376
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,950
but with proper care

377
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,950
and follow-through,

378
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,620
it should be

379
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,620
greatly minimized.

380
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,250
Mmm-hmm.

381
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,820
How are you feeling?

382
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,960
I'm fine.

383
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,490
Uh...

384
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,930
So, what about scarring?

385
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,330
You just asked me that.

386
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,270
So, uh, tell me

387
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,270
what I need to do.

388
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,310
I want to write it all down.

389
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,310
Sure. Um...

390
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,940
You know, I'm gonna

391
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,940
go compare notes with

392
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,940
Dr. Halstead real quick,

393
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,350
and then

394
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,350
I'll be right back.

395
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,480
Mmm.

396
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,490
Will.

397
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,490
Yeah?

398
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,320
In about an hour,

399
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,320
my patient will be

400
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,320
ready to be discharged,

401
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,450
but I have to say,

402
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,450
I have some

403
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,450
serious concerns

404
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,160
about his after-care.

405
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,160
Mmm-hmm.

406
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,760
Jesse's wounds

407
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,760
will need constant

408
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,760
maintenance.

409
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,700
He might even

410
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,700
need pain meds,

411
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,140
and I just really

412
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,140
don't feel comfortable

413
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,140
releasing him...

414
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,470
Into an addict's care.

415
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,470
Yeah.

416
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,670
I'm gonna go call

417
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,670
Child Protective

418
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,670
Services and...

419
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,210
Hold on. Instead

420
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,210
of discharging Jesse,

421
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,300
how about we admit

422
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,300
him to the PICU?

423
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,510
The hospital can

424
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,510
act as his guardian,

425
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,380
and I can help Lynne

426
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,380
get ready to take

427
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,380
care of him.

428
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,320
But he doesn't need

429
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,320
intensive care.

430
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,320
That's against protocol.

431
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,650
If you recommend

432
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,650
in-patient care,

433
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,190
no one's gonna

434
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,190
second-guess

435
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,190
your judgment.

436
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,860
I'm sorry, Will, but no.

437
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,860
I can't do that.

438
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,020
That kid is all

439
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,020
she has, Natalie.

440
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,400
I gotta do whatever

441
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,400
I can to keep her

442
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,400
from losing him.

443
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,520
Please.

444
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,240
Forty-eight hours.

445
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,000
That is the longest I can

446
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,000
justify keeping him here.

447
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,130
Thank you.

448
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
But you're just kicking

449
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
the can, Will.

450
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,080
There is no way

451
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,080
she's gonna be

452
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,080
completely clean by then.

453
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,530
Dr. Charles?

454
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
I'm sorry, you weren't

455
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
answering my pages,

456
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,430
and I've got a patient

457
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,430
who needs a consult.

458
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,840
Isn't Dr. Kwon on call?

459
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,700
Yeah, but he's busy

460
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,700
on the floor.

461
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,500
I brought the chart.

462
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,500
Maybe you could

463
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,500
review it here.

464
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,380
Um, her EKG

465
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,380
and her blood work

466
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,380
came back normal.

467
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,380
No indications

468
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,380
of cardiac syncope.

469
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,280
She's been diagnosed

470
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,280
with panic disorder?

471
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,680
Mmm-hmm. She was

472
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,680
prescribed fluoxetine.

473
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,020
Been on it

474
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,020
for about two weeks.

475
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,460
So she had another

476
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,460
panic attack.

477
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,720
But how do we know if

478
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,720
her regimen is effective?

479
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,590
I guess I thought

480
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,590
that maybe you could

481
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,590
speak with her.

482
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,860
Ms. Curry, antidepressants

483
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,860
often take several weeks

484
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,860
to kick in, right?

485
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,800
So I would tell Ms. Patel

486
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,800
that you understand

487
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,800
her frustration,

488
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,270
to be patient,

489
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,270
and stick with

490
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,270
the prescription.

491
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,740
Is there anything else?

492
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,740
Yes. Panic attacks

493
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,740
have triggers, right?

494
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,720
Negative words

495
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,720
or thoughts.

496
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,880
Yep.

497
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,320
Well, there's this theory

498
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,320
that by repeatedly vocalizing

499
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,950
those triggers,

500
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,950
you can decouple them

501
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,950
from their power.

502
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,280
Like cognitive defusion.

503
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,330
There's an app.

504
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,330
Basically, you record

505
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,330
your anxieties,

506
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,900
and the app then

507
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,900
turns them into songs.

508
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,730
I think it's admirable

509
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,400
that you want to do

510
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,400
everything you can

511
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,400
to help your patients,

512
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,570
but offering up gimmicks

513
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,570
in an emergency setting,

514
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,010
I really don't

515
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,010
see the benefit.

516
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,570
You know, the best care

517
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,570
for Ms. Patel is with her

518
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,570
regular psychiatrist.

519
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,740
So I suggest that

520
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,740
you discharge her,

521
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,780
and that she follow up

522
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,780
with whoever that might be.

523
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,750
Okay? Okay.

524
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,160
How's he doing?

525
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,930
Yeah, well,

526
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,930
no solid organ injury,

527
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,800
but I'm not liking

528
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,800
this free fluid

529
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,800
in his abdomen.

530
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,430
Well, his blood

531
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,430
pressure's steady.

532
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,970
Doesn't seem like

533
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,970
he's actively bleeding.

534
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,510
Could be nothing,

535
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,440
or it could be a bleed

536
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,440
we can't see on CAT scan.

537
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,170
Let's get Mr. Minguez

538
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,170
in for a diagnostic

539
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,170
laparoscopy.

540
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,180
See if we can find

541
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,180
out what's bleeding

542
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,180
and how badly.

543
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,380
Well, couldn't

544
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,380
we just watch and wait?

545
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,650
And risk

546
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,650
an open procedure

547
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,650
if he goes downhill?

548
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,210
I don't think so.

549
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,210
Surgery's the only play.

550
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,380
Wait, so you're not gonna

551
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,380
lay out his options?

552
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,790
He might not need surgery.

553
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,950
Well, you saw

554
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,950
how he acted earlier.

555
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,690
He's afraid of going under.

556
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,690
We give him an out

557
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,690
and he'll take it.

558
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,460
No, he needs this.

559
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,560
We don't know

560
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,560
what he needs.

561
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,500
It's a surgery to see

562
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,500
if he needs surgery.

563
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,200
As much as I value your

564
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,200
input, Nurse Sexton,

565
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,170
I am the surgeon

566
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,170
and this is the plan.

567
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,340
All right,

568
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,340
if you'll excuse me.

569
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,980
Wait, you want to keep

570
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,980
my kid here?

571
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,250
No, no, no.

572
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,250
She said that I could

573
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,250
take him home.

574
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,320
So that's what I'm gonna do.

575
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,320
I'm doing that.

576
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,690
Whoa, whoa.

577
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,860
Here's the story. Uh...

578
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,030
If you insist on

579
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,030
discharging your son,

580
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,000
we're gonna be left

581
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,000
with no other option

582
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,060
than to call Child

583
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,060
Protective Services.

584
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,660
Child Services? Why?

585
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,540
You're not currently

586
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,540
capable of taking

587
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,540
care of your child.

588
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,940
I told you, this was

589
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,940
the only time that this

590
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,940
has ever happened.

591
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,510
Lynne, you know I'm right.

592
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,080
Is there anyone else

593
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,080
we can call?

594
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,210
Jesse's father?

595
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,210
An aunt or uncle?

596
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,510
No!

597
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,510
Okay.

598
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,610
It's just us.

599
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,190
Well...

600
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,190
Oh, my God.

601
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,890
My baby's gonna be

602
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,890
taken away from me.

603
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,590
Not if we get you

604
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,590
in a better place.

605
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,690
You said you've attempted

606
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,690
to get clean before.

607
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,790
What treatments

608
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,790
have you tried?

609
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,370
Methadone and NA,

610
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,960
and cold turkey.

611
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,600
Nothing works.

612
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,600
Ever tried

613
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,600
a detox protocol?

614
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,800
That's a month

615
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,800
in a facility.

616
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,640
Who's gonna take

617
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,640
care of my kid?

618
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,810
What if we sped

619
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,810
things up?

620
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,480
It's called

621
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,480
rapid detox.

622
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,650
Yeah, now, I normally

623
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,650
wouldn't suggest it,

624
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,650
but we don't have much time.

625
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,920
We push you

626
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,920
through withdrawal

627
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,920
under sedation

628
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,300
to manage the symptoms,

629
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,300
and in 24 to 48 hours,

630
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,090
you'll be down the road

631
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,090
to treating your addiction.

632
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,570
Withdrawal.

633
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,500
The last time

634
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,500
I went through that,

635
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,500
it almost killed me.

636
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,570
It is not without risk,

637
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,970
but I don't know

638
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,970
what I can do

639
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,970
to keep you together.

640
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,610
Can I say goodbye

641
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,610
to my son?

642
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,610
Of course.

643
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,450
Hold up.

644
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,860
Hey.

645
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,590
Looks like we're

646
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,590
gonna stay here

647
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,590
for a couple days.

648
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,790
What? No!

649
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,130
It'll be fun.

650
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,130
Remember, like,

651
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,500
when we had that leak

652
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,500
in the bathroom?

653
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,040
We had to go stay

654
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,040
in that hotel.

655
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,810
What was that secret

656
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,810
handshake we made up?

657
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,390
That's it. Okay.

658
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,820
Well, you be good

659
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,820
for the doctors, okay?

660
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,150
Okay?

661
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,360
So they're really gonna

662
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,360
stick a camera inside me?

663
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,370
It's a lot less dramatic

664
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,370
than it sounds.

665
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,500
That's what

666
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,500
they told my dad

667
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,570
when he needed

668
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,570
a new heart valve.

669
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,910
He had a stroke

670
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,910
under anesthesia.

671
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,910
Never woke up.

672
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,310
Alex, I am so sorry.

673
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,990
You know,

674
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,990
this procedure

675
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,990
is minimally invasive,

676
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,490
very safe,

677
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,490
and Dr. Marcel

678
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,490
is a great surgeon.

679
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,090
I'm sure he is,

680
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,090
but it's just hard

681
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,090
not to think about.

682
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,990
If you have any questions,

683
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,990
I can track him down.

684
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,260
I just... Is this really

685
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,260
my only option?

686
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,710
How's she doing?

687
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,270
Okay for now.

688
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,850
Got the dexmedetomidine

689
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,850
flowing.

690
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,850
Ativan at the ready.

691
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,850
She still rousable?

692
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,880
Hi, Lynne. I need you

693
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,880
to swallow this pill.

694
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,020
What is it?

695
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,560
Naltrexone, to prevent

696
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,560
you from relapsing.

697
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,870
Will, what are you doing?

698
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,230
Starting her on

699
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,230
a rapid detox protocol.

700
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,570
Has this been authorized?

701
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,200
You said we were

702
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,200
all kosher here.

703
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,610
Asha, don't worry.

704
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,610
We are.

705
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,410
Really, Will?

706
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,410
Rapid detox?

707
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,880
Plenty of clinics

708
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,880
are doing this, Nat.

709
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,970
We're not off

710
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,970
the reservation here.

711
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,110
Does she understand

712
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,110
the risks?

713
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,280
She does.

714
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,280
Even if she gets

715
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,280
through this,

716
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,080
even if the procedure's

717
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,080
a success,

718
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,990
addiction is not something

719
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,990
that can be cured rapidly.

720
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,960
There are a host of triggers

721
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,960
that Lynne's gonna have

722
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,960
to overcome.

723
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,960
Of course,

724
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,960
and this will

725
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,960
be a head start.

726
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,830
Get her past

727
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,830
the cravings,

728
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,830
the withdrawals...

729
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,630
I don't know.

730
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,630
I can't be the reason

731
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,630
she loses her kid.

732
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,760
I gotta make this right.

733
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,070
The hell'd you do?

734
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,240
My patient just backed out

735
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,240
of his laparoscopy.

736
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,840
Alex was concerned

737
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,840
about the procedure.

738
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,110
I just answered

739
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,110
his questions.

740
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,440
But he already consented.

741
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,920
Because you made

742
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,920
him believe he didn't

743
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,920
have a choice.

744
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,920
And you may be okay

745
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,920
keeping people in the dark,

746
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,450
but you can't just

747
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,450
assume that I am.

748
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,490
"In the dark"?

749
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,490
What are we talking

750
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,490
about here?

751
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,080
Our patient or Ethan?

752
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,080
Ethan? What?

753
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,960
I just want to make sure

754
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,960
Alex knows his options.

755
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,160
He has no options, April.

756
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,430
This procedure gets riskier

757
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,430
every minute we wait.

758
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,270
When we're rushing this man

759
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,270
to the OR in shock,

760
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,800
it's on you.

761
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,940
So...

762
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,880
You wanna tell me

763
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,880
what's going on with

764
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,880
you and Dr. Marcel?

765
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,450
There's nothing going on.

766
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,290
Hey, I can't have

767
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,290
my sister and my mentor

768
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,290
slugging it out every day.

769
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,060
Noah...

770
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,060
Spill it. Give it up.

771
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,390
Dr. Sexton?

772
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,390
Hmm?

773
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,660
If you're looking

774
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,660
for something to do,

775
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,200
Dr. Lanik has

776
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,200
a forearm laceration

777
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,460
that needs stitching.

778
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,570
Thank you.

779
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,570
Yeah.

780
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,370
Maybe something

781
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,370
you wanna talk about

782
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,370
with a girlfriend?

783
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,150
I kissed Crockett.

784
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,260
Okay.

785
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,930
It was a mistake.

786
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,400
I had just found out

787
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,400
some really bad news.

788
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,940
I was feeling

789
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,940
worthless. I...

790
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,200
What news?

791
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,410
Ethan and I have been

792
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,380
trying for a baby,

793
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,050
and I found out

794
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,210
that I may not be able

795
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,210
to have any.

796
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,780
Oh...

797
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,380
April.

798
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,620
Come here.

799
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,790
I'm sorry,

800
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,790
Ms. Patel.

801
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,730
So that's it?

802
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,730
You're sending me home?

803
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,730
Medically speaking,

804
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,740
there is no reason

805
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,740
to keep you

806
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,740
in the hospital.

807
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,240
You're telling me

808
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,240
there's nothing

809
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,240
you can do?

810
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,770
Um...

811
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,650
No, no, there is

812
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,650
one thing we can try.

813
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,050
It's not a proven therapy,

814
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,050
but it's been working for me.

815
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,550
All right, whatever

816
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,550
gives you anxiety,

817
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,250
you speak it

818
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,250
into this app,

819
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,720
and it turns those

820
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,720
words into a song.

821
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,960
The theory is that

822
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,960
when you sing it back,

823
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,330
you uncouple the words

824
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,330
from the influence

825
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,330
that they had over you.

826
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,160
Disrupt the cycle

827
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,160
of negative thinking.

828
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,330
What do I say?

829
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,770
Oh, I don't know, anything.

830
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,770
Anything that

831
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,770
stresses you out.

832
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,170
Am I good at my job?

833
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,010
I think I am,

834
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,010
but it's hard to know.

835
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,070
Good, okay.

836
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,750
Great, now

837
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,750
sing it back.

838
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,910
Um...

839
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,180
Am I good at my job?

840
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,260
I think I am

841
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,480
No, I can't do this.

842
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,180
I feel stupid.

843
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,180
No, that was good.

844
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,280
Just try it.

845
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,280
No, I don't want to.

846
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,950
Okay.

847
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,950
Oh, God.

848
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,620
All right, yeah, no.

849
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,620
We can try that later.

850
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,460
You know what,

851
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,460
if taking my antidepressants

852
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,630
is all I really need to do,

853
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,630
then I'm just gonna do that.

854
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,140
No, no, I wouldn't take

855
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,140
your meds off-schedule.

856
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,470
Okay.

857
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,470
God, I just want

858
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,470
to get out of here.

859
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,830
Okay.

860
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,880
Look at you.

861
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,880
Come on, give it to me.

862
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,380
Give it to me, huh?

863
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,720
Working that gown.

864
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,050
They let you wear

865
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,050
whatever you want

866
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,050
during chemo.

867
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,650
Well, the good news,

868
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,700
radiation goes

869
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,700
by a lot quicker.

870
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,290
The bad, they don't got

871
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,290
those plush La-Z-Boys.

872
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,000
And...

873
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,230
We can't go in together.

874
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,900
Heard you were

875
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,900
down here.

876
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,880
Hey, Dr. Singh.

877
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,740
I didn't know you sat in

878
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,740
during these things.

879
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm here

880
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,980
to see Ben, actually.

881
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,540
I wanted to do this

882
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,540
in person.

883
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,820
Is it okay that

884
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,820
Maggie's here?

885
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,250
Uh-huh.

886
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,860
I reviewed your blood work,

887
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,860
and it seems

888
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,860
that whatever jumpstarted

889
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,860
your immune system

890
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,560
to fight off the measles

891
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,560
had the added benefit

892
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,030
of putting your

893
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,030
cancer in remission.

894
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,060
What?

895
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,040
You're kidding, right?

896
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,330
No, I'm not.

897
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,870
Congratulations, Ben.

898
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,430
Oh, my God.

899
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,610
Oh, my God, Ben.

900
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,610
I'm so happy

901
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,610
for you, Ben.

902
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,450
Yes! Thank you!

903
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,450
Yes! Come on!

904
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,450
Let's go!

905
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,930
This is

906
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,930
the best day ever.

907
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,520
Thank you, Dr. Singh.

908
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,970
Okay, I'm really sorry

909
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,970
that I couldn't

910
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,970
do more for you.

911
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,440
I'll manage.

912
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,980
Hey, Priya,

913
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,980
are you okay?

914
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,640
My throat...

915
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,220
What?

916
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,220
I can't...

917
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,880
I can't...

918
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,080
I need the response

919
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,080
team out here!

920
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,950
Hey, Priya,

921
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,950
can you hear me?

922
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,160
Dr. Lanik's on his way.

923
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,130
Okay, I need epi.

924
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,470
It's okay.

925
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,470
You're gonna be okay.

926
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,730
What the hell happened?

927
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,680
I... I don't know.

928
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,020
Dr. Halstead!

929
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,020
Lynne's seizing.

930
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,650
She's going

931
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,650
through withdrawal.

932
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,990
Push another

933
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,990
five of Ativan.

934
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,990
I already did.

935
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,690
Seizure's not breaking.

936
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,690
BP's spiking, 180 over 100.

937
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,320
She needs a propofol

938
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,320
bolus, Will.

939
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,370
We gotta snow her.

940
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,370
All right, do it.

941
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,300
Gotta protect her airway.

942
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,600
Mommy?

943
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,180
Jesse, what are you

944
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,180
doing here?

945
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,520
Why is she shaking like that?

946
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,290
Put him on a mask.

947
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,860
Belly's distended

948
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,860
and tender.

949
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,860
Mmm-hmm.

950
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,490
Heart rate's up to 120.

951
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,400
BP's 91 over 76.

952
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,400
What happened?

953
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,400
He's in hemorrhagic shock.

954
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,990
Two units on

955
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,990
the rapid transfuser.

956
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,040
Can we still

957
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,040
scope him?

958
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,040
No, too unstable.

959
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,400
We have to open him up.

960
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,400
Open up the Hybrid Room!

961
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,340
Let's move.

962
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,350
How's your patient?

963
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,750
Oh. Uh...

964
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,520
She had another

965
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,520
panic attack,

966
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,520
but she's stable.

967
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,530
Dr. Lanik just

968
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,530
ordered repeat labs.

969
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,530
She had another one?

970
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,850
Any ideas on the trigger?

971
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,390
Dr. Charles,

972
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,390
I'm really sorry.

973
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,990
I couldn't send her

974
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,990
home with nothing.

975
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,090
So, I had her

976
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,090
try the singing.

977
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,030
And you think that

978
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,030
that's why she had

979
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,030
another episode?

980
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,510
Yeah, well, she got really

981
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,510
anxious, and then she took

982
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,510
another anti-depressant,

983
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,840
and I don't know.

984
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,840
I think this is my fault.

985
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,930
Wait, wait, wait.

986
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,280
She took a second dose

987
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,280
on top of her

988
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,280
regular prescription?

989
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,250
Yes.

990
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,250
When exactly

991
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,250
did she do that?

992
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,250
Maybe 20 minutes

993
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,250
before she collapsed.

994
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,910
But panic attacks

995
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,910
are typically

996
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,910
an immediate response

997
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,610
to a stressor,

998
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,610
not time-delayed.

999
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,390
And an extra antidepressant

1000
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,390
wouldn't provoke

1001
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,390
a toxic response anyway.

1002
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,920
Look, why don't we add

1003
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,920
an FBC and tryptase

1004
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,920
to her blood work?

1005
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,730
More tests?

1006
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,730
What are you thinking?

1007
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,930
I don't know yet,

1008
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,930
but I'm not positive

1009
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,370
we're looking

1010
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,370
at panic attacks here.

1011
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,970
Okay.

1012
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,570
Your mom told me

1013
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,570
that you kept some of your

1014
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,570
favorite books in here.

1015
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,570
Why don't you pick

1016
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,570
one out for us to read?

1017
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,210
Why was that doctor

1018
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,210
sticking something down

1019
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,210
my mommy's throat?

1020
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,550
To help her breathe.

1021
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,550
It's 'cause of that

1022
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,550
stuff she takes, isn't it?

1023
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,260
Have you ever heard

1024
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,260
of a bad habit?

1025
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,800
So, I used to bite

1026
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,800
my nails all the time,

1027
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,270
and that's a bad habit.

1028
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,670
And sometimes it's really

1029
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,670
hard to stop when you're

1030
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,670
so used to doing it.

1031
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,240
My mom has a bad habit,

1032
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,240
doesn't she?

1033
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,440
And it's making

1034
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,440
her sick.

1035
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,610
Is that why I have

1036
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,610
to stay here tonight?

1037
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,340
Well, it's a little

1038
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,340
more complicated

1039
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,340
than that, Jesse.

1040
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,850
'Cause I can take

1041
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,850
care of her.

1042
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,780
I know what to do. Look.

1043
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,020
You have Narcan

1044
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,020
in your backpack?

1045
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,590
My mommy gave it to me.

1046
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,830
And you know

1047
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,830
how to use it?

1048
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,460
If I find my mom

1049
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,460
and I can't wake her up,

1050
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,130
I tilt her head back

1051
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,130
and squirt one of these

1052
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,130
in her nose.

1053
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,670
I've done it before.

1054
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,280
You have?

1055
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,280
A couple times.

1056
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,040
You don't need to worry

1057
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,040
about my mom,

1058
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,050
'cause I can take

1059
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,050
care of her.

1060
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,840
Please don't take her

1061
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,840
away from me.

1062
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,560
Lot of blood.

1063
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,500
What's that

1064
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,500
grey patch?

1065
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,500
Ischemic bowel.

1066
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,630
Can we

1067
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,630
salvage that?

1068
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,530
If we got in here

1069
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,530
three hours ago.

1070
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,570
All right,

1071
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,570
let's get control

1072
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,570
of this bleeding.

1073
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,830
April, hemostat

1074
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,830
times two.

1075
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,340
Dr. Sexton,

1076
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,340
clamp under me.

1077
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,000
Marty,

1078
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,000
how we looking?

1079
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,140
A little tachycardic,

1080
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,140
but pressure's holding.

1081
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,020
It feels oozy.

1082
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,680
Hang another unit

1083
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,680
of blood and plasma.

1084
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,880
Got it.

1085
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,550
Mesentery's

1086
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,550
clamped off.

1087
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,490
You ever resect

1088
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,490
a bowel before?

1089
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,090
No.

1090
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,090
Lucky you.

1091
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,350
GIA 80 to Dr. Sexton.

1092
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,430
Let's get to work.

1093
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,540
How do you feel?

1094
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,410
Like a rotisserie chicken.

1095
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,680
Listen, Maggie...

1096
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I wanna apologize

1097
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
for earlier.

1098
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,220
When I got the news

1099
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,220
about my cancer,

1100
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,220
I just...

1101
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,920
I went a little wild.

1102
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,520
For good reason.

1103
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,390
But still,

1104
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,390
it was selfish,

1105
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,800
given where you are

1106
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,800
in your fight.

1107
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,960
I don't want to

1108
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,960
go out and celebrate.

1109
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,230
Not until we both

1110
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,230
can declare victory.

1111
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,210
How lucky am I

1112
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,210
to have found you?

1113
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,750
You give me hope, Ben.

1114
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,660
How do you feel?

1115
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,810
My throat is sore.

1116
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,940
But overall...

1117
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm sorry, I'm so hoarse.

1118
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,180
Could I have some

1119
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,180
water, please?

1120
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,340
Of course.

1121
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,250
Thank you.

1122
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,100
Whoa.

1123
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,490
You see that?

1124
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,460
Hand's pretty darn steady.

1125
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,200
Is there a chance

1126
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,200
this detox might work?

1127
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,340
Excuse me, Ms. Driscoll.

1128
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,340
I'm Sharon Goodwin,

1129
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,010
Executive Director

1130
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,010
of Patient

1131
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,010
Services here,

1132
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,020
and this is

1133
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,020
Madeline Gastern

1134
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,020
from Child

1135
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,020
Protective Services.

1136
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,960
What's going on?

1137
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,960
I regret

1138
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,960
to inform you, Lynne,

1139
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,220
that the department

1140
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,220
will be taking medical

1141
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,220
custody of your child

1142
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,700
until we can determine

1143
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,700
your fitness as a parent.

1144
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,730
No.

1145
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,730
I don't

1146
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,730
understand.

1147
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,070
You promised not to do this

1148
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,070
if I went through the detox.

1149
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,840
Lynne, I didn't do this.

1150
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,570
You lied to me.

1151
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,570
Why did you lie to me?

1152
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,750
Hey.

1153
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,720
You called in

1154
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,720
Protective Services.

1155
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,730
We had a deal.

1156
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,730
The terms changed.

1157
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,020
When did that happen?

1158
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,020
When Jesse told me that

1159
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,530
his neglect was not just

1160
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,530
a one-time occurrence.

1161
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,760
That kid's

1162
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,760
living situation

1163
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,530
is far more dire

1164
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,530
than your patient

1165
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,530
led you to believe.

1166
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,000
Dr. Halstead.

1167
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,000
What?

1168
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,770
Charge nurse asked me

1169
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,770
to tell you

1170
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,100
your patient,

1171
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,100
Lynne Driscoll,

1172
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,100
just left AMA.

1173
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,680
So how is he?

1174
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,690
We'll keep him

1175
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,690
under observation

1176
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,690
for about a week,

1177
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,780
but he should be fine.

1178
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,220
Good.

1179
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,090
Oh, yeah, so I am gonna go

1180
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,090
check on some paperwork

1181
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,460
down in the ED.

1182
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,430
Yeah. Excuse me.

1183
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,930
Look, Crockett,

1184
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,930
about today, I am sorry.

1185
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,940
Come on.

1186
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,940
I shouldn't have

1187
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,940
pushed so hard.

1188
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,880
You were just trying

1189
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,880
to do the best thing

1190
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,880
for your patient.

1191
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,950
I've been thinking

1192
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,950
about it, and, um...

1193
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,710
I think maybe

1194
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,710
you were right.

1195
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,320
Sometimes people

1196
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,320
don't need

1197
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,320
to know everything.

1198
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,450
I don't think

1199
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,450
I should tell him.

1200
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,990
Okay.

1201
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,130
Systemic what?

1202
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,130
Mastocytosis.

1203
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,470
It's a genetic condition.

1204
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,470
Completely manageable.

1205
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,240
Okay, but what about

1206
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,240
my panic attacks?

1207
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,800
Shortness of breath,

1208
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,800
elevated heart rate,

1209
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,800
loss of consciousness,

1210
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,410
all symptoms

1211
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,410
of panic attacks

1212
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,410
and mastocytosis.

1213
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,950
Except mastocytosis

1214
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,580
can actually be made worse

1215
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,580
by taking antidepressants.

1216
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,150
So the fluoxetine was not

1217
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,150
only not treating anything,

1218
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,450
but that extra

1219
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,450
dose you took?

1220
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Probably what made you

1221
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
pass out in our waiting room.

1222
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,320
But my stress is real.

1223
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,260
Probably just

1224
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,260
good old-fashioned

1225
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,260
job-related stress.

1226
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,160
Look, we're going to check

1227
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,160
in with your psychiatrist,

1228
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,500
but in the meantime,

1229
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,500
what we want to do

1230
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,830
is swap out

1231
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,830
your antidepressants

1232
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,960
for antihistamines.

1233
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,700
Okay?

1234
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,700
Okay.

1235
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,940
Thank you.

1236
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,710
Really.

1237
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,710
You bet.

1238
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,180
What are you doing?

1239
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,180
Deleting this app.

1240
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,690
It doesn't work.

1241
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,550
Mastocytosis should have

1242
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,550
been on my differential

1243
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,550
from the start,

1244
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,030
but I got so focused

1245
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,030
on this app that I...

1246
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,190
I totally missed it.

1247
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,890
Don't be so hard

1248
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,890
on yourself.

1249
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,230
Look, you came up

1250
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,230
with a creative idea

1251
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,230
to solve a tricky problem.

1252
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,240
It didn't happen

1253
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,240
to work, but... I mean,

1254
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,240
look at it this way.

1255
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,330
If you hadn't of tried it,

1256
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,330
Priya would have gone home

1257
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,900
thinking she still

1258
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,900
had a panic disorder.

1259
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,380
Because she rejected

1260
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,380
my bad idea.

1261
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,680
Like you said,

1262
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,680
it's just a gimmick.

1263
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,410
You can't sing away

1264
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,410
your problems.

1265
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,860
Ethan.

1266
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,900
Hi!

1267
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,400
I thought you were

1268
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,400
coming home tomorrow!

1269
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,530
I shipped out early.

1270
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,010
I wanted

1271
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,010
to surprise you.

1272
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,910
What?

1273
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,280
Mission accomplished.

1274
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,440
Baby, I...

1275
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,180
Look, I didn't like

1276
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,180
how we left things.

1277
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,380
I've been thinking

1278
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,380
about it a lot over

1279
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,380
the last six weeks.

1280
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,510
Me, too.

1281
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,120
Sit. Um...

1282
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,220
You and I, we've been

1283
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,220
working so hard

1284
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,220
and trying to start a family,

1285
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,200
and I think I got

1286
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,200
caught up in planning

1287
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,360
that I forgot

1288
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,360
what the objective

1289
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,360
of the mission really was.

1290
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,970
I'm sorry, I didn't

1291
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,900
want to make it

1292
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,900
sound like a briefing.

1293
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,210
It's okay.

1294
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,240
But you...

1295
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,420
But you need to know

1296
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,250
that I...

1297
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,490
I love you,

1298
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,090
and I love your passion

1299
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,290
and your loyalty.

1300
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,840
And I don't want to go

1301
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,640
another six weeks

1302
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,640
without you in my life.

1303
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,440
So...

1304
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,680
April Sexton...

1305
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,520
Will you marry me?

1306
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,140
This a good silence?

1307
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,540
Before I answer that, um...

1308
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,680
I need to tell you something.

1309
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,280
It might change

1310
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,280
your mind.

1311
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,050
Okay.

1312
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,850
I...

1313
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,360
I got tested,

1314
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,060
and I don't think

1315
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,060
I can have kids.

1316
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,960
I'm sorry.

1317
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,960
Baby, no.

1318
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,160
No, I'm sorry.

1319
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,830
But, hey, that's okay.

1320
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,500
Look, I love you

1321
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,500
no matter what, okay?

1322
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,570
We'll figure this

1323
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,570
out together.

1324
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,540
I love you so much.

1325
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,810
So much.

1326
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,820
So is that a yes?

1327
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,250
Yes.

1328
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,580
Yes!

1329
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,850
Whoo!

1330
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,670
I'm glad you came

1331
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,670
out tonight.

1332
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,710
You know, I figured

1333
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,710
CeCe probably would

1334
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,710
have approved.

1335
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,610
Oh, yeah.

1336
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,610
Sure she would've.

1337
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,610
All right,

1338
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,610
thank you all

1339
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,610
for coming tonight.

1340
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,950
I'm gonna miss you

1341
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,950
all so much.

1342
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,920
We'll miss you

1343
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,920
too, Lainey!

1344
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,250
All right, all right.

1345
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,790
Up next, Dr. C!

1346
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,280
Let's make some noise!

1347
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,720
Seriously?

1348
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,860
Seriously,

1349
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,860
you're gonna sing?

1350
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,290
He's gonna sing?

1351
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,910
A friend of mine told me

1352
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,040
that you can't sing

1353
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,040
away your troubles.

1354
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,780
Well, I guess

1355
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,780
we're about to find out.

1356
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,660
There you go and, baby

1357
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,490
Here am I

1358
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,290
Well, you left me here

1359
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,330
So I could

1360
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,730
Sit and cry

1361
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:03,440
Golly gee

1362
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:03,440
What have you done to me?

1363
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,740
Well, I guess it doesn't

1364
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,740
matter anymore

1365
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,680
Do you remember, baby

1366
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,990
Last September, how you

1367
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,680
Held me tight

1368
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,350
Each and every night

1369
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,860
And, oh, baby, how you

1370
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,370
Drove me crazy

1371
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:33,270
Well, I guess it doesn't

1372
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:33,270
matter anymore

1373
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,330
A little help?

1374
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,240
Baghdad.

1375
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,240
Dr. Halstead?

1376
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,870
35-year-old female.

1377
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,870
Found down, unresponsive.

1378
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,170
Looks like an OD.

1379
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,170
No response to Narcan.

1380
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,040
She's been shocked

1381
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,040
and epi'd once already.

1382
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,890
On my count.

1383
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,890
One, two, three.

1384
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,420
Will.

1385
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,490
Continue CPR.

1386
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,230
Crash cart!

1387
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,230
She's in v-fib,

1388
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,230
no pulse.

1389
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,230
Charge to 200.

1390
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,570
Lift up. All right,

1391
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,570
let's go.

1392
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,010
We are not

1393
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,010
losing her. Clear.

1394
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,880
Pulse.

1395
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,510
No pulse.

1396
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,510
Continue CPR.

1397
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,350
Another round

1398
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,350
of epi. Charge.

1399
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,080
Let's go.

1400
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,580
Clear.

1401
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,620
Come on, Lynne.

1402
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,550
Pulse?

1403
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,200
It's been 11 minutes now

1404
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,200
without one.

1405
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,400
Eleven minutes?

1406
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,900
Halstead,

1407
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,410
pronounce her.

1408
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,720
Time of death, 20:43.

1409
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,900
I'm sorry.
