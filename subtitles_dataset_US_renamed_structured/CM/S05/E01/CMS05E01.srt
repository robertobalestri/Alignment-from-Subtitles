1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,500
We're a lot alike,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,500
you know.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,070
You'd do anything to

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,070
get what you want.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,470
What did she tell you?

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,030
I can't wait to hear.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,470
Your father,

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,470
he's telling people

9
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,470
I slept with him.

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,710
I should never

11
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,710
have made you come.

12
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,050
Your father died

13
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,050
from an overdose of insulin.

14
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,550
Someone in the hospital

15
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,550
gave it to him.

16
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,480
Now there's nothing

17
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,480
keeping us apart.

18
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,150
You and I are way past that.

19
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,150
Look, we're not...

20
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,150
We'll just...

21
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,380
We'll put

22
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,380
everything behind...

23
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,380
Ava, stop!

24
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,220
You ungrateful prick.

25
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,560
When was the last time

26
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,560
you had a mammogram?

27
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,490
You are saying that

28
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,490
I have breast cancer?

29
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,800
I have something

30
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,800
to tell you.

31
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,800
My lymphoma is back.

32
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,160
I want to marry you again.

33
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,260
Anyone else would have

34
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,260
bailed on this whole mess

35
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,260
a long time ago.

36
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,270
But you're still here.

37
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,210
Because

38
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,210
it's you, Ethan.

39
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,740
I'm late.

40
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,870
Late?

41
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,870
My period.

42
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,510
Tim Burke's

43
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,510
out of prison.

44
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,710
You were responsible

45
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,710
for his father and his

46
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,710
brother being incarcerated.

47
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,840
You've known Natalie

48
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,840
for a while.

49
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,650
What do you think,

50
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,650
will she like it?

51
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,220
Agent Lee told me

52
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,220
what was going on.

53
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,990
Will loves you.

54
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,830
You would be a fool

55
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,830
not to take him back.

56
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,300
I am so sorry.

57
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,560
Whoa.

58
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,040
Natalie! No!

59
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,900
Natalie!

60
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,010
Natalie!

61
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,020
Dr. Halstead?

62
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,650
I got her. Get to

63
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,650
the Doctors' Lot.

64
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,780
Yes, Doctor.

65
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,750
What am I looking at?

66
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,420
Dr. Manning was thrown

67
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,420
from the vehicle.

68
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,090
Blunt head trauma,

69
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,090
loss of consciousness.

70
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,430
Elsa?

71
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,430
Yeah?

72
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,100
Put a collar on her.

73
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,100
Start an IV and

74
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,100
get her on the monitors.

75
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,640
Yes, Doctor.

76
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,640
And a nasal airway.

77
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,860
I got it.

78
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,860
And a chest X-ray.

79
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,630
Yes, Doctor.

80
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,630
Take our boy here

81
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,630
to Trauma 2.

82
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,330
Elsa will give you a look-see.

83
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,330
Nah, I'm staying with Natalie.

84
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,270
You're a mess, Will. Come on.

85
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,270
I'm staying.

86
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,070
Halstead, you're

87
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,070
her boyfriend or whatnot,

88
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,070
impairs judgment. Go.

89
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,410
I just...

90
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,410
Please, Dr. Halstead.

91
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,570
Whoa! Hey,

92
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,570
hey, hey, hey!

93
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,880
It's all right, man.

94
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,880
I got her.

95
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,880
Go on. Dr. Manning.

96
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,580
Come on. Come on,

97
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,580
come on, come on.

98
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,580
She's gonna be okay.

99
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,280
Natalie.

100
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,990
Talk to me.

101
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,500
She's not protecting

102
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,500
her airway.

103
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,500
She's clamping down.

104
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,100
20 etomidate and 100 sux.

105
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,100
Right away.

106
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,300
And that's ready.

107
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,380
I'm in.

108
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,970
You should be in a gown.

109
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,970
Okay, please let me

110
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,970
examine you properly.

111
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,710
Elsa, I'm fine.

112
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,710
I just need to

113
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,710
catch my breath...

114
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,840
No. You're covered

115
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,840
in blood.

116
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,110
Did you lose

117
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,110
consciousness

118
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,110
at any point?

119
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,380
No. I'm good.

120
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,950
Okay.

121
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,190
You need stitches.

122
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,190
I need to call

123
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,190
the plastics resident.

124
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,490
No. You just do it.

125
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,620
No, I'm only a student.

126
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,620
The resident will do

127
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,620
a much better job.

128
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,500
I don't care.

129
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,500
I just wanna get

130
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,500
back to Natalie.

131
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,730
Okay. Um...

132
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,930
Suture kit, please.

133
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,930
Okay.

134
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,840
Sorry.

135
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,970
Excuse me? Excuse me.

136
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,970
I... I heard Dr. Manning

137
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,970
was in an accident.

138
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,170
Dr. Marcel from Trauma

139
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,170
is taking care of her.

140
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,840
Natalie!

141
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,840
Sir!

142
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,710
Natalie...

143
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,710
I'm sorry,

144
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,710
Dr. Marcel.

145
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,840
Who are you?

146
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm her fiancé.

147
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,310
Her fiancé?

148
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,410
Yeah! As in

149
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,410
we're engaged.

150
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,960
I guess the night shift

151
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,960
didn't get the memo.

152
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,380
Is she okay?

153
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,380
Chest X-ray and

154
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,380
FAST exam are negative.

155
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,130
Vitals are stable.

156
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,130
But we don't know yet

157
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,130
how bad her head injury is.

158
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,220
Tell CT we're

159
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,220
bringing her up

160
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,220
for a STAT pan scan.

161
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,390
Right.

162
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,030
Excuse me. Can I...

163
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,140
Can I go up with her?

164
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Just don't

165
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
get in the way.

166
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,050
Sorry.

167
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,520
Let's roll.

168
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,120
Why didn't you

169
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,120
call me right away?

170
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,250
Well, it... It was

171
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,250
your wedding night.

172
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,090
Ms. Goodwin, we just heard.

173
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,460
Sharon, how are they?

174
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,760
Well, Dr. Halstead

175
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,760
has some displaced

176
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,760
rib fractures.

177
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,770
He's being held

178
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,770
for observation.

179
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,270
Dr. Manning suffered

180
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,270
a head trauma.

181
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,260
She's stable,

182
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,260
her vitals are good,

183
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,900
but she's unresponsive

184
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,900
and intubated.

185
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,410
We're getting

186
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,410
CTs now.

187
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,910
I'm gonna

188
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,910
look in on Will.

189
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,850
Ethan, April,

190
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,850
I need you now.

191
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,810
Elderly slip-and-fall

192
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,810
in three. I'll take that.

193
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,220
Thanks.

194
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,220
Got it.

195
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,510
Status on Tim Burke?

196
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,920
Stable.

197
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,430
You could take

198
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,430
him to County.

199
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,520
On our way.

200
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,620
Hey. He dies en route,

201
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,620
wouldn't break my heart.

202
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,760
Let's go.

203
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,380
Heads up, everybody.

204
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,380
Patient's landing.

205
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,540
Possible drug-induced

206
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,540
psychosis.

207
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,810
Doris, I need you.

208
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,820
Sharon?

209
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,820
I'm short-staffed.

210
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,820
Yeah.

211
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,120
Dr. Marcel.

212
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,120
Ma'am?

213
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,490
I need you to stay.

214
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,450
Say no more.

215
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,450
Happy to oblige.

216
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,950
Courtney?

217
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,400
Maggie?

218
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,400
Eighteen-year-old male.

219
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,520
Cameron Geddes.

220
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,520
Stop it.

221
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,690
Delusional. Found

222
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,690
wandering naked.

223
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,630
Too agitated

224
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,630
to get vitals

225
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,630
in the field.

226
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,070
This is his grandmother,

227
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,070
Nancy Geddes.

228
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,040
There's nobody there!

229
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,040
Stop it! What are we doing?

230
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,040
What are we doing?

231
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,140
Okay, here, Dr. Marcel,

232
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,140
go to Treatment 5.

233
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,800
Need a psych consult.

234
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,800
Yeah.

235
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,410
Cameron!

236
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,170
I'll get a psych.

237
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,040
Then maybe you

238
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,040
and I can talk?

239
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,680
Yeah.

240
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,680
Okay.

241
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,750
So, I guess

242
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,750
we'll be going.

243
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,410
I'm going.

244
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,410
You're staying.

245
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,890
What?

246
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,890
You heard me.

247
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,020
CeCe, we just got married.

248
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,020
We're on our honeymoon.

249
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,360
Danny, I know you.

250
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,900
You wanna be

251
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,900
there for Will. Stay.

252
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,660
I could really

253
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,660
use your help

254
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,760
for a couple of hours.

255
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,700
So am I calling upstairs?

256
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,700
No.

257
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,030
I'll be back at the hotel

258
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,030
by lunch. I promise.

259
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm getting a massage

260
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,500
and a facial.

261
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,600
Take your time.

262
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,200
Bye, Sharon.

263
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,400
Thank you, CeCe.

264
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,010
Your mammogram?

265
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,680
They found a mass.

266
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,680
I need a biopsy.

267
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,680
Don't feed the sharks.

268
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,680
It's not good for them.

269
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,780
Lock him in.

270
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,780
How could you

271
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,780
take drugs?

272
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,190
How could you do that?

273
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,520
Calm down, calm down!

274
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,430
Ma'am, can we give

275
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,430
the doctors some room.

276
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,430
Let them do their job?

277
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,690
I'm sorry,

278
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,690
who are you?

279
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,860
Dr. Charles,

280
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,860
head of psychiatry.

281
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,870
Other than abrasions,

282
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,870
I'm not seeing any injuries.

283
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,600
Five of Haldol IM.

284
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,270
What is that? What...

285
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,270
What are you doing?

286
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,640
Is that drugs?

287
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,640
Are you giving

288
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,640
him more drugs?

289
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,610
Well, in order to help

290
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,610
your grandson, we do need

291
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,610
to calm him down a bit.

292
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,880
Let me get a CBC, BMP, EKG,

293
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,880
and tox screen.

294
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,650
Make it an extended tox

295
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,650
screen, cover all the bases.

296
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,220
So, Elsa says that you

297
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,220
refused the gown and

298
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,220
the CT head and chest.

299
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,660
Typical doctor,

300
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,660
terrible patient.

301
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,760
You know, I could

302
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,760
plate your ribs.

303
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,760
It won't hurt as much.

304
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,670
Why am I not surprised?

305
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,670
Connor...

306
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,110
Natalie was coming to tell me

307
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,110
something last night.

308
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,840
She got in the car,

309
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,840
said, "I'm sorry,"

310
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,110
and then we were hit.

311
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,110
She... She didn't

312
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,110
get to finish.

313
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,780
Will, you okay?

314
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,910
Yeah.

315
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,180
Connor, Officer Atwater

316
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,180
is here.

317
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,660
Says he wants to talk to you.

318
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,660
Okay.

319
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,520
What's he want?

320
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,160
It's gotta be

321
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,160
about my father. Um...

322
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,830
His death was labeled

323
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,830
"suspicious."

324
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,960
I'll be back

325
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,960
to check on you.

326
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,770
Thank you.

327
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,770
Okay.

328
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,480
Appreciate you, Doc.

329
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,480
Yeah, man.

330
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,710
First thing I want to

331
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,020
tell you is that

332
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,020
I'm sorry for your loss.

333
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,460
Appreciate that.

334
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,390
Take a seat,

335
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,390
won't be too long.

336
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,860
No problem.

337
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,130
Um...

338
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,700
Your father

339
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,700
was given insulin.

340
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,730
He was not a diabetic,

341
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,730
none of the doctors

342
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,730
ordered it in,

343
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,030
and there's no record of it

344
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,030
on his chart, so...

345
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, you're saying that

346
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,000
it was intentional.

347
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,170
'Cause normally,

348
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,170
you wouldn't test for

349
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,170
insulin in a heart patient

350
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,040
going through

351
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,040
cardiac arrest.

352
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,040
Right.

353
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,580
Luckily, the pathologist

354
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,580
went the extra mile.

355
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,910
Even so,

356
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,910
can't trace insulin.

357
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,980
So, I would suggest

358
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,980
that they knew exactly

359
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,980
what they were doing.

360
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,490
Is there anybody

361
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,490
around here, Doc,

362
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,690
that you think would

363
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,690
wanna hurt your father?

364
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,700
The fact is my dad

365
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,700
was the type of guy

366
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,700
who could make enemies.

367
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,930
It's common knowledge

368
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,930
you two didn't get

369
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,930
along so well. Right?

370
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,170
Yeah. The relationship

371
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,170
was complicated,

372
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,040
but it was improving.

373
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,730
You blamed him

374
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,730
for your mother's suicide.

375
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,110
Accused him of sleeping

376
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,110
with your girlfriend.

377
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,940
You punched him out

378
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,940
at a party.

379
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,010
Can you tell me where

380
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,010
you were before your father

381
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,010
went into cardiac arrest?

382
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,250
I was at his house.

383
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,080
Kevin, what is this?

384
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,080
Do I need to get a lawyer?

385
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,620
That's up to you.

386
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,620
You want me to stop?

387
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,850
You gotta be kidding me.

388
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,850
I was looking

389
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,850
for old photographs.

390
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,530
Anybody vouch for that?

391
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,430
Our housekeeper, Carlotta.

392
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,360
Now, we done here?

393
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,560
For now.

394
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,230
Connor...

395
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,240
I respect you.

396
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,930
You save a lot

397
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,930
of lives around here.

398
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,300
I just gotta make sure

399
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,300
you didn't take one.

400
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,160
What did

401
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,160
Dr. Manning's scan show?

402
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,720
Well,

403
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,720
you can see here

404
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,720
a grade two liver laceration.

405
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,900
Small amount of blood

406
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,900
in the abdomen.

407
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,400
You need to operate?

408
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,100
Well, we surgeons

409
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,100
love to cut,

410
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,100
but it's a solid

411
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,100
organ injury.

412
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,100
No blush on the CT.

413
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,000
Not operative.

414
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,270
It's still wait and see.

415
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,680
You all go back to work.

416
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,680
I'll let you know

417
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,680
if anything changes.

418
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,590
Okay.

419
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,260
We need to

420
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,260
go to the pharmacy.

421
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,360
Yeah. Right.

422
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,860
You told the police

423
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,860
about my father and me.

424
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,500
He asked.

425
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,500
I told him

426
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,500
the truth.

427
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,160
Last night you said

428
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,160
that I was ungrateful.

429
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,160
Ungrateful for what, Ava?

430
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,140
Oh, my God, I got

431
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,140
you your hybrid room.

432
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,680
I defended you in front

433
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,680
of the Oversight Committee...

434
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,180
You said, "He's gone.

435
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,180
You're free. We can

436
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,180
be together now."

437
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,040
Well, that was my mistake,

438
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,040
wasn't it?

439
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,780
Thinking you could

440
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,780
get past yourself.

441
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,780
And we could start over.

442
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,020
So you did it

443
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,020
so we can be together.

444
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,640
What?

445
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,640
But I wasn't interested.

446
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,050
And so, now you're...

447
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,050
You're getting even?

448
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,320
You're not

449
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,320
making any sense.

450
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,990
I think

451
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,990
you killed my father.

452
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,130
You're as delusional

453
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,130
as your mother was.

454
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,460
Tell us, Connor,

455
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,700
with your father dead,

456
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,700
how much do you inherit?

457
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,730
Twenty million?

458
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,340
A hundred?

459
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,070
Good morning,

460
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,070
Dr. Latham.

461
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,650
It's negative.

462
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,650
I'm not pregnant.

463
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,920
Oh. Okay.

464
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,260
It's weird.

465
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,260
I'm never late.

466
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,530
But it's good

467
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,530
though, right?

468
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah.

469
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,940
We could still go

470
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,940
to Cabo for Christmas.

471
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,100
I can have Margaritas.

472
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,250
We should get back.

473
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,250
Okay.

474
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,080
So after this,

475
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,080
we'll get some

476
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,080
ice cream, all right?

477
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,590
All right.

478
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,590
What kind are you getting?

479
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,550
Vanilla.

480
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,550
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan.

481
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,350
Hi, I'm Dr. Choi.

482
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,350
This is April Sexton.

483
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,450
Hey.

484
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,450
Hello.

485
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,960
Hey, Thomas,

486
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,960
I understand you're

487
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,960
not feeling well.

488
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,960
My head hurts.

489
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,960
And he's been

490
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,960
really tired lately.

491
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,730
And if you're

492
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,730
standing to his side,

493
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,730
he can't see you.

494
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,470
Has Thomas suffered

495
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,470
any injuries lately?

496
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,230
A fall? Concussion?

497
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,230
No.

498
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,900
Can you follow my finger?

499
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,740
He has some loss

500
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,740
of peripheral vision.

501
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,370
Let's get a CBC,

502
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,370
CMP, blood and

503
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,370
urine cultures to start.

504
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,470
Right.

505
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,640
We're gonna find out

506
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,640
what's going on, okay?

507
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,240
Excuse us.

508
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,960
What did he take?

509
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,960
He didn't.

510
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,260
His tox screen

511
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,260
was negative.

512
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,230
Well, then what's making

513
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,230
him act like this?

514
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,170
We don't know yet, which is

515
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,170
why we'd like to have him

516
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,170
admitted to the psych ward.

517
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,740
Psych ward.

518
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,740
What are you

519
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,740
talking about?

520
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,830
Well, the psych

521
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,830
ward is where

522
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,170
Cameron can get

523
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,170
the thorough evaluation

524
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,170
that he needs.

525
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,580
No, no. My grandson

526
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,580
is an A student.

527
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,270
He's going to college.

528
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,270
He's not crazy.

529
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,410
I'm not saying

530
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,410
that he is.

531
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,610
This could be the result

532
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,610
of something entirely

533
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,610
physical, Mrs. Geddes.

534
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,350
Of course

535
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,350
it's something physical!

536
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,320
You're not gonna take him

537
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,320
to the psych ward.

538
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,180
Ms. Geddes, it's in your

539
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,180
grandson's best interest...

540
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,450
No. You're not

541
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,450
taking him.

542
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,690
I'm not gonna

543
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,690
let you take him.

544
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,860
Okay, okay.

545
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,790
Well, how about this...

546
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,270
How about I have

547
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,270
him admitted to one

548
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,270
of our medical floors

549
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,670
with a sitter

550
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,670
and we'll have him

551
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,670
evaluated there.

552
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,100
How about that?

553
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,100
Okay.

554
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,840
Okay. I'll write

555
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,840
the order.

556
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,940
Every kid needs

557
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,940
a grandma like you.

558
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,350
Had one myself.

559
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,190
Isn't he age-appropriate

560
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,190
for schizophrenia?

561
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,820
Yeah, he is.

562
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,560
And I got a strong hunch

563
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,560
that that's what

564
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,560
we're dealing with here.

565
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,370
Then why the charade,

566
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,370
sending him up

567
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,370
to a medical floor?

568
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,500
Well, because

569
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm treating

570
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,500
two people here.

571
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,410
I mean, a diagnosis

572
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,410
of schizophrenia?

573
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,880
It's gonna be

574
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,880
devastating to her.

575
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,640
The more we can ease her

576
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,640
into the reality

577
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,640
of that possibility,

578
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,650
the less overwhelmed

579
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,650
she'll be.

580
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,890
Dr. Rhodes.

581
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,990
I have to inform you

582
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,760
that Dr. Bekker has filed

583
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,760
a complaint against

584
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,760
you with HR.

585
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,530
You put your hands on her,

586
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,530
and I witnessed it.

587
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,530
Mmm-hmm.

588
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,830
I also heard you

589
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,830
accuse her of murder.

590
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,900
I don't understand.

591
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,910
Dr. Bekker is a first-rate

592
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,910
surgeon, one of the best.

593
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,200
Why would you

594
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,200
say something like that?

595
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,870
Dr. Latham, you can be

596
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,870
a fine surgeon and still...

597
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,880
Have issues?

598
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,220
No, look, Dr. Latham,

599
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,220
I didn't mean to make

600
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,220
any comparisons.

601
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,190
I find it inconceivable

602
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,190
that Dr. Bekker could

603
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,190
have done such a thing,

604
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,790
but if you feel so strongly

605
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,790
about it, why haven't you

606
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,790
gone to the police?

607
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,460
Because I don't

608
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,460
know for sure,

609
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,970
and I can't prove it

610
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,970
one way or the other.

611
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,430
This is untenable.

612
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,410
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan,

613
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,880
we got Thomas's

614
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,880
labs back.

615
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,880
They were all normal.

616
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,780
Well, that's

617
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,780
good news,

618
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,780
isn't it?

619
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,240
Well, whatever's

620
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,240
going on is not

621
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,240
infectious.

622
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,720
But we still don't know

623
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,720
what's causing his symptoms.

624
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,230
And given his

625
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,230
headaches and lack

626
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,230
of peripheral vision,

627
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,390
we'd like him

628
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,390
to have a CT

629
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,390
scan of his head.

630
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,320
His head?

631
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,320
Yeah.

632
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,730
Uh, Thomas, honey,

633
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,730
give Daddy and me a minute

634
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,730
to talk to the doctor.

635
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,310
We'll be

636
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,310
just outside, okay?

637
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,400
Mommy?

638
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,180
You can see us,

639
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,180
and we'll be back.

640
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,740
Hey, why don't

641
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,740
I stay with you,

642
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,340
keep you company,

643
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,340
is that cool?

644
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,680
Thank you.

645
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,680
Okay.

646
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,150
Hey.

647
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,480
You think this is

648
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,480
something really serious.

649
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,360
Making a diagnosis

650
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,360
is about ruling

651
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,360
out possibilities.

652
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,950
This scan will allow us

653
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,950
to do that.

654
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,520
He's a healthy kid,

655
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,520
hardly ever

656
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,520
catches a cold.

657
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,650
Mmm.

658
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,460
Whatever's bothering

659
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,460
Thomas, this will

660
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,460
help us find out.

661
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,550
I'm so sorry, Natalie.

662
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,720
What are you doing here?

663
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,860
Haven't you

664
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,860
done enough, huh?

665
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,400
Look at her,

666
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,400
for God's sake.

667
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,790
I... I didn't know

668
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,790
she was gonna

669
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,790
get in my car. So...

670
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,730
How do you even

671
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,730
sleep at night, huh?

672
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,330
You realize

673
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,330
you've done nothing

674
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,330
but ruin her life.

675
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,460
Get out of my face.

676
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,560
I don't want you

677
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,560
coming around here again.

678
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,800
I don't care

679
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,800
what you want.

680
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,900
She's not

681
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,900
your responsibility,

682
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,900
man. She's mine.

683
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,200
How? How do you

684
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,200
figure that?

685
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,200
Hey!

686
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,340
Everything okay

687
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,340
with you boys?

688
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,520
Yeah. Natalie and I

689
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,520
are engaged.

690
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,150
What?

691
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,750
See for yourself.

692
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,420
We're getting married.

693
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,570
You on the square,

694
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,570
Fiancé?

695
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,680
I'm sorry. What is

696
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,680
that supposed to mean?

697
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,220
Well, I didn't see

698
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,220
that ring on her finger

699
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,220
when she came in.

700
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,220
'Cause we certainly

701
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,220
would have removed it.

702
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,380
Is this really

703
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,380
any of your business?

704
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,780
As her doctor,

705
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,780
yeah, it is.

706
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,640
Hey.

707
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,970
How's Natalie?

708
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,610
She's still out.

709
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,650
I now know what

710
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,650
she was gonna tell me.

711
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,880
She got engaged.

712
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,580
To Phillip?

713
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,810
You knew?

714
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,810
No.

715
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,290
He... He showed me

716
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,290
the ring,

717
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,150
said he was gonna ask her,

718
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,150
and to be honest,

719
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,150
it was weird.

720
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,490
Weird how?

721
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,960
It was right when

722
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,960
his daughter was being

723
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,960
prepped for surgery.

724
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,960
You'd think

725
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,960
he would've been

726
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,960
focused on that.

727
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,770
Yeah, I never liked

728
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,770
the guy, but, you know,

729
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,770
I'm not exactly unbiased.

730
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,470
Will, you're splinting.

731
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,840
No, I'm just a little

732
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,840
short of breath.

733
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,410
No, you're more than

734
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,410
just a little short of breath.

735
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,070
Let's get you back

736
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,070
down to the ED.

737
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,670
Gonna get you a chest X-ray.

738
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,670
It could be a pneumothorax.

739
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,080
I'm not going...

740
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,140
Will, Will, Will, now.

741
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,270
Yeah.

742
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,790
You may feel

743
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,790
a little pressure,

744
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,600
but nothing more

745
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,600
after that.

746
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,940
You okay?

747
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,040
He says he can hardly

748
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,040
see at all now.

749
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,550
Here,

750
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,550
I'll take a look.

751
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,650
This is Dr. Abrams,

752
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,650
our chief of neurosurgery.

753
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,560
Neurosurgery?

754
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,560
Thomas, do me a favor.

755
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,020
Uh, look

756
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,020
straight ahead.

757
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,190
Raise your hand

758
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,190
when you see my finger.

759
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,530
Thomas, don't you see

760
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,530
the doctor's finger?

761
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,160
That's it,

762
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,160
just keep looking

763
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,000
straight ahead.

764
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,000
Don't move your head.

765
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,640
Could we step outside?

766
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,710
So your son's CT

767
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,710
scan and MRI

768
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,350
indicate a mass around

769
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,350
the pituitary, most likely

770
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,350
a craniopharyngioma.

771
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,520
A what?

772
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,650
A tumor.

773
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,520
A benign tumor.

774
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,520
Oh, benign.

775
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,060
But unfortunately,

776
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,060
he needs surgery.

777
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,890
Right, the deterioration

778
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,890
in his vision

779
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,370
indicate that the tumor's

780
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,370
pressing against

781
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,370
his optic chiasm,

782
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,330
so we need to operate

783
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,330
as soon as possible.

784
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,200
I believe

785
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,200
we'll have

786
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,200
a good outcome.

787
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,740
I know this is hard.

788
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,740
I am so sorry.

789
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,770
He's so little.

790
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,750
My baby.

791
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,450
Thomas was a surprise.

792
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,710
The doctor said

793
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,710
Livie'd never be

794
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,710
able to get pregnant.

795
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,090
And then...

796
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,090
Then when

797
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,090
she told me the news,

798
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,120
God, I wasn't sure

799
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,120
I even wanted a kid.

800
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,930
Now I can't imagine

801
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,930
life without him.

802
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,120
He's our whole world.

803
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,600
I just hate

804
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,600
the thought...

805
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,140
This little kid

806
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,140
having brain surgery?

807
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,380
Yeah, me too.

808
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,150
I'll catch up with you

809
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,150
in a little bit.

810
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,760
Clear.

811
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,630
Yeah,

812
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,630
a pneumothorax.

813
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,630
If Dr. Halstead

814
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,630
had let me

815
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,430
give him a proper

816
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,430
examination,

817
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,430
this never would...

818
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,730
It's not your fault.

819
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,430
Will, I need to

820
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,430
admit you and put

821
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,430
in a chest tube.

822
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,560
No.

823
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,970
You're at risk for

824
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,970
a tension pneumothorax.

825
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,470
You could die.

826
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,470
She's right.

827
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,510
Aspirate and put in

828
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,510
a one-way valve tube.

829
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,240
That is not protocol.

830
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,340
Elsa, please...

831
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,470
It'll temporize me,

832
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,470
and I won't need

833
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,470
to be admitted.

834
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,680
Come on, Connor,

835
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,680
I don't want... I don't

836
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,680
wanna be here anymore.

837
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,850
I hear you.

838
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,030
Ms. Curry, get me

839
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,030
a small chest tube

840
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,030
with a Heimlich valve.

841
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,190
Okay.

842
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,200
What's going on?

843
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,870
Charge nurse refused

844
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,870
our patient.

845
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,870
What?

846
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,840
Darya, come on.

847
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,840
No, no, Dan, we can't

848
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,840
turf him here.

849
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,040
He just needs a workup.

850
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,040
In the psych ward.

851
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,510
My nurses aren't equipped.

852
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,510
Dr. Charles,

853
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,510
where are we going?

854
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,050
To the psych ward.

855
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,050
No, we talked about this.

856
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,050
He's not crazy.

857
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,640
Ms. Geddes, I'm sorry,

858
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,640
I have nowhere else

859
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,640
to put him.

860
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,150
I'm not gonna let you.

861
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,150
Ma'am, please.

862
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,780
No, no, I'm gonna

863
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,780
take him home.

864
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,020
I just can't let you do that.

865
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,020
Well, you can't stop me.

866
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,360
Yes, ma'am, he can.

867
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,520
He's my grandson!

868
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,520
Cameron is 18.

869
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,960
He's an adult who, right now,

870
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,960
is a danger to himself

871
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,960
and potentially to others.

872
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,700
No, no, we...

873
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,700
We need to go home.

874
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,890
I'm gonna

875
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,890
take him home.

876
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,200
Believe me...

877
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,200
He'll be better at home.

878
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,360
This is what your grandson

879
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,360
needs right now.

880
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,130
No, he needs to go home.

881
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,130
Mrs. Geddes.

882
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,800
Please, let me...

883
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,800
Please don't make

884
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,800
me call security.

885
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,640
Please.

886
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,640
Security?

887
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,870
Mrs. Geddes,

888
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,870
please.

889
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,920
Honey, we're gonna have

890
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,920
to wait in here.

891
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,250
No.

892
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,250
You're going to be fine.

893
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,410
You're gonna take a nap,

894
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,410
and when you wake up,

895
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,430
we'll be with you.

896
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,430
Just like at home.

897
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,250
Everything's gonna be

898
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,250
all right, sweetheart.

899
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,190
The doctors are gonna

900
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,190
make you feel all better.

901
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,820
We love you.

902
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,820
April?

903
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,760
Have you seen Dr. Abrams?

904
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,830
He should be

905
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,830
headed up any minute. Why?

906
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,600
I've been going over

907
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,600
Thomas's history.

908
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,170
I'm just not sure

909
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,170
we're doing

910
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,170
the right thing.

911
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,110
Sam? Sam, I think

912
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,110
we're rushing this,

913
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,380
and I know

914
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,380
what you're gonna say.

915
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,620
Whoa, whoa. Don't assume

916
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,620
you know what I'm

917
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,620
gonna say. What is it?

918
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,780
When Thomas came in,

919
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,780
his pulse was a little slow.

920
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,950
His reaction time too.

921
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,950
Mom said he'd been

922
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,950
tired lately.

923
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,960
All consistent with

924
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,960
craniopharyngioma.

925
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,420
But the kid's really small

926
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,420
for his age, right?

927
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,400
What, you're suggesting

928
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,400
this is an endocrine problem?

929
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,460
Possible, isn't it?

930
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,460
Unlikely.

931
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,400
Very unlikely.

932
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,310
All right,

933
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,310
do the blood work.

934
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,040
Hey, just so you know,

935
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,620
if we delay surgery

936
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,620
and you're wrong,

937
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,540
this kid could go blind

938
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,310
or he could

939
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,310
wind up comatose.

940
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,630
Dr. Bekker, thank you.

941
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,160
I have information which

942
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,160
I think will be of

943
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,160
welcome news to you both.

944
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,840
I pressed the lab to

945
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,840
analyze the insulin

946
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,840
which killed Mr. Rhodes...

947
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,310
What's the point?

948
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,310
It's untraceable.

949
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,430
Normally, yes,

950
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,810
but I thought

951
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,810
no stone should be

952
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,810
left unturned.

953
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,980
Well, it appears that

954
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,980
this particular batch

955
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,310
was ever so slightly

956
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,310
contaminated with chromium,

957
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,440
which is

958
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,440
indeed traceable,

959
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,820
and we will find,

960
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,820
in no time,

961
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,820
who had access to it.

962
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,760
That's great news.

963
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,760
Yes.

964
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,260
The police seem confident

965
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,260
that they should

966
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,260
wrap this up quickly,

967
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,660
which means that

968
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,660
you two can stop

969
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,660
accusing one another

970
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,170
and my department

971
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,170
can get back to normal.

972
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,100
Ava?

973
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,340
Ava.

974
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,610
Ava.

975
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,360
Give me an hour

976
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,360
to get to O'Hare.

977
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,390
One hour. You'll never

978
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,390
see me again.

979
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,850
No.

980
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,990
I did it for you.

981
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,660
Ava, come on.

982
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,970
We could have been so happy.

983
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,300
You ruined it all.

984
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,720
You really are

985
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,720
an ungrateful prick.

986
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,890
No! No, no, no, no!

987
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,890
No, no, no, no!

988
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,580
Help! I need help

989
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,580
in here! Come!

990
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,220
Help!

991
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,390
Dr. Latham!

992
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,560
She slashed her carotid.

993
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,560
Do we have a prepped OR?

994
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,990
I'll bump my case.

995
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,990
Right.

996
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,590
Pressure on the artery.

997
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,590
One, two, three, go!

998
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,760
Let's go!

999
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,760
Come on.

1000
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,330
I got fingers

1001
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,330
on the carotid,

1002
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,330
but I'm losing her pulse.

1003
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,070
She's arresting.

1004
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,040
We're gonna open

1005
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,040
up the chest. Knife?

1006
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,110
Marty, she needs

1007
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,110
blood, epi.

1008
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,880
I'm working

1009
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,880
as fast as I can.

1010
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,910
Rib spreader.

1011
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,260
Dr. Rhodes?

1012
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,190
She tried

1013
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,190
to kill herself.

1014
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,360
Dr. Manning,

1015
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,360
can you hear me?

1016
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,040
Lighten her sedation.

1017
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,290
All right, she's breathing

1018
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,290
on her own.

1019
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,080
Dr. Manning, I'm gonna

1020
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,080
pull your tube.

1021
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,080
Sorry for any discomfort.

1022
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,310
Do you know

1023
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,310
where you are?

1024
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,470
Uh...

1025
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,940
Hospital?

1026
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,310
Do you recognize me?

1027
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,450
Sam.

1028
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,450
All right,

1029
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,450
squeeze my hand.

1030
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,520
Good.

1031
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,200
All right,

1032
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,200
follow the light

1033
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,200
with your eyes.

1034
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,260
Good.

1035
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,670
Do you know why

1036
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,670
you're in the hospital?

1037
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,470
You don't remember

1038
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,470
what happened?

1039
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,440
Mmm-mmm.

1040
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,540
No.

1041
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,710
Nothing.

1042
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,320
You were hit by a car.

1043
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,290
No fractures,

1044
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,290
but you do have a TBI.

1045
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,220
Memory loss

1046
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,220
is consistent.

1047
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,890
It'll likely resolve.

1048
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,160
Your initial neuro exam

1049
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,160
is heartening.

1050
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,060
You... You try to rest.

1051
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,060
I'll be back tomorrow,

1052
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,060
and we can discuss

1053
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,060
your treatment going forward.

1054
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,630
I'm...

1055
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,500
I'm happy that,

1056
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,500
all things considered,

1057
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,500
you're doing well.

1058
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,710
I'll tell your fiancé

1059
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,710
he can come in and see you.

1060
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,310
Fiancé?

1061
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,180
Yeah, keep it brief.

1062
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,030
Carotid

1063
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,030
clamps are on.

1064
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,330
Marty, how much blood

1065
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,330
has she got?

1066
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,600
Ten units

1067
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,600
and ten of plasma.

1068
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,110
All right,

1069
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,110
it's now or never.

1070
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,840
Intracardiac epi?

1071
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,190
Fibrillating,

1072
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,190
another round of epi.

1073
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,290
Paddles. Charge to 20.

1074
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,030
Charging.

1075
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,030
Clear.

1076
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,300
Come on. Come on.

1077
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,770
Dr. Rhodes.

1078
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,770
Come on.

1079
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,410
Dr. Rhodes,

1080
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,410
she's gone.

1081
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,820
Time of death,

1082
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,820
16:22.

1083
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,740
Until we sort

1084
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,740
through this,

1085
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,940
it does not become

1086
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,940
public knowledge.

1087
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,090
Hey, man. Internist

1088
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,090
is on her way.

1089
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,700
Okay, good.

1090
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,700
Kid's getting

1091
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,700
a slew of tests.

1092
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,170
I heard you got married

1093
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,170
last night.

1094
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,640
Congratulations.

1095
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,640
Yeah, thanks.

1096
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,970
You know,

1097
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,970
I really should not

1098
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,970
still be here.

1099
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,450
You know, I was doing

1100
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,450
my surgical oncology

1101
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,450
rotation last month,

1102
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,780
met your wife.

1103
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,950
Not an easy road.

1104
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,950
No.

1105
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,710
Just a sec.

1106
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,060
My grandson

1107
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,060
doesn't belong here.

1108
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,290
Maybe not.

1109
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,560
But what I do want

1110
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,560
to tell you is that

1111
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:49,240
Cameron is at an age

1112
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:49,240
when schizophrenia

1113
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:49,240
tends to present itself,

1114
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,870
especially

1115
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,870
in young men.

1116
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,740
Now, if that's what

1117
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,740
we're dealing with,

1118
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,380
could be a...

1119
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,380
A onetime episode,

1120
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,310
or it could be

1121
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,310
the start of

1122
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,310
a longer illness.

1123
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,550
No.

1124
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,210
No, no.

1125
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,210
Ms. Geddes.

1126
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,820
It... It's an illness

1127
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,820
that can be managed,

1128
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,820
you know?

1129
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,260
People can live long,

1130
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,260
very full lives.

1131
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,690
I've taken care of Cameron

1132
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,690
since he was a baby.

1133
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,730
I've tried to protect him

1134
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,730
against his mama,

1135
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,000
who was a drug addict,

1136
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,710
and against gangs,

1137
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,770
from getting arrested...

1138
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,540
Cameron survived.

1139
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,910
Cameron made it out.

1140
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,080
He has

1141
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,080
a full scholarship.

1142
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,080
This...

1143
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,950
This can't be

1144
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,950
happening to him.

1145
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,550
Listen, I mean,

1146
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,960
all kinds of things

1147
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,960
happen to us

1148
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,430
that we can't anticipate,

1149
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,430
we can't imagine,

1150
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,060
and what I've learned,

1151
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,970
from my own

1152
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,970
experience, anyway,

1153
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,930
is that until we learn

1154
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,910
to accept the...

1155
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,910
The unacceptable,

1156
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,080
we're... We're just

1157
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,080
of no use to anyone.

1158
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,940
Not to our loved ones,

1159
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,240
not to ourselves.

1160
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,990
You know,

1161
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,990
Cameron needs you,

1162
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,620
and the person

1163
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,620
he is right now

1164
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,120
needs you more

1165
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,120
than ever.

1166
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,660
You two have

1167
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,660
faced a lot together,

1168
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,000
and there's just...

1169
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,730
There's just no

1170
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,730
doubt in my mind

1171
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,560
that you can

1172
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,560
face this too.

1173
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,160
Mmm.

1174
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,500
Well, I can

1175
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,500
go home early.

1176
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,300
Wow.

1177
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,570
That's it?

1178
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,910
He feels bad.

1179
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,910
That's his way

1180
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,910
of showing it.

1181
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,180
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan?

1182
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,780
Good news.

1183
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,960
Thomas doesn't

1184
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,960
need surgery.

1185
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,080
Really?

1186
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,430
His latest tests

1187
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,430
show that he is

1188
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,430
severely hypothyroid.

1189
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,430
That would account for

1190
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,430
his headaches, fatigue,

1191
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,430
even his vision problems.

1192
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,930
But... But the scans

1193
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,930
showed a tumor

1194
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,930
on the pituitary.

1195
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
What they showed

1196
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
was a mass

1197
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
called hyperplasia,

1198
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,210
an enlargement

1199
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,210
of the organ due

1200
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,210
to his hypothyroidism,

1201
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,710
but it's not a tumor,

1202
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,540
and it will shrink

1203
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,540
with medication.

1204
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,440
Thomas, honey,

1205
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,680
you're going

1206
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,680
to be just fine.

1207
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,610
So I don't have to take a nap?

1208
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,610
No, you don't need to.

1209
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,690
Hey, they, um...

1210
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,690
They had this

1211
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,690
in the lost and found.

1212
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,160
Don't know

1213
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,160
how clean it is.

1214
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,030
You really

1215
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,030
should be admitted.

1216
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,720
That's what you'd

1217
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,720
tell any patient in

1218
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,720
your condition.

1219
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,230
Elsa, stop.

1220
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,370
I'm leaving.

1221
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,240
Okay, but you're

1222
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,240
not gonna "leave"

1223
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,240
leave, are you?

1224
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,540
Why would you ask that?

1225
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,670
You... You've been

1226
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,670
through a lot.

1227
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,750
No, I'll be back.

1228
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,550
Good.

1229
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,030
Did you get your results?

1230
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,280
Metastatic

1231
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,280
adenocarcinoma.

1232
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,740
Yeah, I'll need to get

1233
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,740
a PET scan to determine

1234
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,740
where it's spread,

1235
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:25,720
and then either lumpectomy

1236
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:25,720
followed by radiation

1237
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:25,720
and chemo

1238
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,090
or a mastectomy.

1239
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,300
Sharon, I don't want

1240
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,300
anyone to know.

1241
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,860
Mag, you're looking at

1242
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,860
a long course of treatment,

1243
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,860
likely debilitating.

1244
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,960
I don't care,

1245
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,960
I'll manage.

1246
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,910
If you're having

1247
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,910
the treatment here,

1248
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,770
people are bound

1249
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,770
to find out.

1250
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,710
No, I'll go

1251
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,710
to East Mercy.

1252
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,710
Mag...

1253
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,980
I don't wanna be

1254
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,980
the sick person.

1255
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,120
I don't wanna

1256
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,120
be pitied.

1257
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,620
I intend to keep

1258
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,620
on working.

1259
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,750
Okay.

1260
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,120
Okay?

1261
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,320
Okay.

1262
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,110
I was just so worried

1263
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,110
because you were

1264
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,110
unconscious, and...

1265
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,340
And no one was

1266
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,340
actually sure if you

1267
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,340
would wake up, but...

1268
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,750
But, hey, you did.

1269
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,750
You made it.

1270
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,420
You're gonna be okay.

1271
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,150
I can't remember

1272
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,150
what happened.

1273
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,810
I know, I know, and...

1274
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,810
And that's okay.

1275
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,810
The doctors said that

1276
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,350
the memory loss,

1277
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,350
that's...

1278
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,350
That's normal.

1279
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,330
Oh, Phillip...

1280
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,330
Yeah?

1281
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,700
I don't...

1282
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,130
I don't remember you

1283
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,130
asking me to marry you.

1284
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,540
That's okay.

1285
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,880
You will, I promise.

1286
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,640
Okay.

1287
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,560
Eyesight's better.

1288
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,560
He's already responding

1289
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,560
to the levothyroxine.

1290
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,000
Good.

1291
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,490
What?

1292
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,970
April, would it really

1293
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,970
have been so bad

1294
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,970
if you'd been pregnant?

1295
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,810
You can ask me

1296
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,810
about having a kid

1297
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,210
after what we saw

1298
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,210
those parents

1299
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,210
go through today?

1300
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,370
That's why I'm asking.

1301
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,910
I... It's a lot of pain,

1302
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,910
I know...

1303
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,180
But it's a lot

1304
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,180
of love too.

1305
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,050
Yeah.

1306
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,360
Makes me think

1307
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,360
maybe we're missing

1308
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,360
out on something.

1309
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,730
Maybe we are.

1310
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,560
Someday.

1311
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,730
Yeah. Someday.

1312
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,400
Rough day, huh?

1313
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,030
You have no idea.

1314
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,750
Why are you still here?

1315
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,440
I'm just leaving.

1316
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,340
Whatever you said,

1317
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,340
Grandma's on board.

1318
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,510
Huh.

1319
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,920
So how do you want me

1320
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,920
to manage

1321
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,920
the kid tonight?

1322
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,930
Ativan, 2 milligram,

1323
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,930
IVPRN.

1324
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,120
One Haldol if he needs

1325
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,120
something stronger.

1326
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,360
Copy that.

1327
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,020
Danny.

1328
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,060
There you are.

1329
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,060
I was just coming

1330
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,060
to you. I'm so sorry.

1331
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,060
I made a reservation

1332
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,060
for us at Gibson's.

1333
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,370
I think you know

1334
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,370
Dr. Marcel.

1335
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,530
Hey,

1336
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,700
I think I met you the day

1337
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,700
I got some really

1338
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,700
challenging news, right?

1339
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,400
Good evening, ma'am.

1340
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,400
How are you?

1341
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,640
You know,

1342
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,640
I've never

1343
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,640
been better.

1344
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,980
Glad to hear.

1345
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,980
Thank you.

1346
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,410
Good night.

1347
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,320
"Never better," huh?

1348
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,320
Never better, huh?

1349
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,720
Not gonna let

1350
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,720
a little thing like

1351
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,720
cancer get in your way?

1352
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,410
We gonna press on.

1353
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,080
It's just like

1354
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,080
you taught me.

1355
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,920
You know what? I think

1356
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,920
I might have passed

1357
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,920
that along today.

1358
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,760
Yeah?

1359
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,760
Tried to, anyway.

1360
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,900
You're good looking.

1361
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,160
Dr. Latham, I just want

1362
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,160
to say thank you.

1363
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,300
I couldn't imagine

1364
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,300
having had

1365
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,300
a better teacher.

1366
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,930
You're welcome,

1367
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,280
but I don't understand.

1368
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,470
I'm leaving Med.

1369
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,580
Leaving?

1370
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,760
But we did everything

1371
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,760
we could to save her.

1372
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,460
And your father's death,

1373
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,460
you've been exonerated.

1374
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,820
It doesn't matter.

1375
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,030
I'm never gonna

1376
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,030
be able to get past

1377
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,030
what happened here

1378
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,260
and nobody's ever gonna

1379
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,260
be able to forget.

1380
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,140
I need a fresh start.

1381
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,670
And I just I need

1382
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,670
to go somewhere

1383
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,300
where all I will be

1384
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,300
is just another doctor.

1385
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,210
Oh.

1386
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,850
I don't want you to go.

1387
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,720
That's very kind of you,

1388
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,720
but you will find

1389
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,720
another surgeon.

1390
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,160
No, that's not

1391
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,160
what I mean.

1392
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,050
I'm not talking about

1393
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,050
a surgeon.

1394
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,960
I don't want

1395
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,960
my friend to go.

1396
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,210
I got a call

1397
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,210
from Dr. Latham.

1398
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,540
Please don't try to

1399
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,540
talk me out of it.

1400
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,850
You know, I've been known

1401
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,850
to be very persuasive...

1402
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,190
But I won't.

1403
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,630
You've been

1404
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,630
really good to me,

1405
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,630
Ms. Goodwin.

1406
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,430
I hope I'm not

1407
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,430
disappointing you.

1408
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,760
No, you have not.

1409
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,470
You will be missed,

1410
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,470
Connor Rhodes.

1411
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,540
Would you mind

1412
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,540
saying good-bye

1413
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,540
to everybody for me?

1414
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,920
I just think

1415
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,920
it might be

1416
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,920
a little hard.

1417
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,380
Of course.

1418
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,280
Good luck, my friend.

1419
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,160
Thank you.
