1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,300
Dad, are they gonna

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,300
separate you from me?

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,300
Why do you ask that?

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,700
Because you haven't been

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,700
a very good dad.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,400
I promise,

7
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,400
I'm gonna do better.

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,470
It was so easy

9
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,470
for me to see Crockett

10
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,470
as the problem.

11
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,370
Whatever

12
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,370
happened between

13
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,370
me and him in the past...

14
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,940
I get it now.

15
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,940
Because the real problem

16
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,940
was always right here.

17
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,050
Whatever it is you want,

18
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,050
it isn't me.

19
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,820
It's been a really

20
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,820
good couple of weeks.

21
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,820
Yeah, it has.

22
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,480
And not just us. Rehab.

23
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,030
You've been knocking it

24
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,030
out of the park.

25
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,550
I'm really proud of you.

26
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,630
Hey

27
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,630
Hey. Sorry, I was

28
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,630
trying not to wake you.

29
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,900
Where you headed so early?

30
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,070
To a meeting.

31
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,410
Feel like

32
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,410
I could use one.

33
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,340
Wait a second,

34
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,340
I'll get dressed

35
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,340
and drive you.

36
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,410
No. No, no, no.

37
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,410
Stay in bed.

38
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,710
I'll see you at work.

39
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,210
Bye.

40
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,060
Hannah, you forgot

41
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,060
your phone.

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,940
Dr. Moody said you

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,940
were the one to see.

44
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,570
That you'd take

45
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,570
good care of us.

46
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,620
Yeah, Moody and I

47
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,620
go way back.

48
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,010
Medical school.

49
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,450
We used to ride

50
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,450
motorcycles together.

51
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,740
Doctor Moody

52
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,740
rode a motorcycle?

53
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,880
Yeah, but he had

54
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,880
to give it up

55
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,920
when he became

56
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,920
a pediatrician.

57
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,290
The stethoscope

58
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,290
kept flying off his neck

59
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,290
on the way to work.

60
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,050
Please don't give

61
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,050
Billy any ideas.

62
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,790
I have enough worries

63
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,790
with him on his bike.

64
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,920
Uh-oh.

65
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,590
You like riding

66
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,590
your bike, Billy?

67
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,590
Yeah.

68
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,640
But my mom won't let me

69
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,640
ride at night.

70
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,860
That's probably

71
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,860
a good thing, bud.

72
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,960
X-ray's ready.

73
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,230
Step back, please.

74
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,230
Mmm-hmm.

75
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,900
Can you hold your

76
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,900
breath for me, Billy?

77
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,770
Ready?

78
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,870
Got a couple of

79
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,870
non-displaced cracked ribs.

80
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,420
The issue is this hemothorax

81
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,420
here, in Billy's chest.

82
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,250
Hemothorax?

83
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,250
That sounds bad.

84
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,480
No, it's just

85
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,480
a buildup of blood

86
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,920
between the lung

87
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,920
and chest wall.

88
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,150
It explains why he's been

89
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,150
having difficulty breathing.

90
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,660
But we can fix that.

91
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,660
We just have

92
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,660
to drain the blood.

93
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,820
Does that mean surgery?

94
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,060
Oh, hopefully not.

95
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,460
We're gonna try

96
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,460
a chest tube first.

97
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,830
Set me up for

98
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,830
a 28 French Tube.

99
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,060
Yes, doctor.

100
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,260
Okay, Billy,

101
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,260
I'm gonna bring you back.

102
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,170
Now, can you lift

103
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,170
that left arm for me?

104
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,070
Maybe.

105
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,370
Oh, yeah,

106
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,370
I know it's sore.

107
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,110
All right. This next part's

108
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,110
gonna hurt a little bit.

109
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,200
Think you can handle it?

110
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,980
I'll be okay.

111
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,640
That's what

112
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,640
I like to hear.

113
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,720
Billy was born with

114
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,720
a diaphragmatic hernia,

115
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,520
so, unfortunately,

116
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,520
he's no stranger to hospitals.

117
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,020
Well, you are very brave,

118
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,020
Billy. And you're doing great.

119
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,190
Speaking of, Billy,

120
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,560
how come

121
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,560
I ain't never seen

122
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,690
you and Spider-Man

123
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,290
in the same place

124
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,290
at the same time?

125
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,460
Almost done.

126
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,840
Must be torture to watch

127
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,840
your kid suffer like that.

128
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,130
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

129
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,670
You ever think

130
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,670
about having kids?

131
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,680
Oh, no. Kids are

132
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,680
not my speed.

133
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,800
And why is that?

134
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,670
Dr. Marcel.

135
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,470
Detective Poulson,

136
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,470
Chicago PD.

137
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,570
Doc.

138
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,580
And Detectives

139
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,580
Bridges and Hayes

140
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,550
from the New Orleans

141
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,550
Police department.

142
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,050
Oh. My old

143
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,050
stomping grounds.

144
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,180
Oh, yeah?

145
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,850
Yeah. What can I do

146
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,850
for you gentlemen?

147
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,750
I'm just an escort today.

148
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,850
Okay.

149
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,190
Uh, Detective Hayes and I,

150
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,190
we're following up a detail

151
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,530
from this cold case

152
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,530
that popped

153
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,530
back up recently.

154
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,720
Uh-huh.

155
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,160
You mind if we talk

156
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,160
in private?

157
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,010
Uh, the consultation room

158
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,010
is free.

159
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,140
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

160
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,140
Follow me.

161
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,370
All right.

162
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,500
Gentlemen?

163
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,570
Cold case?

164
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,840
Yeah, from a homicide

165
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,840
from their town.

166
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,980
And they came all the way

167
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,980
up here to talk to Crockett?

168
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,680
What's going on?

169
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,680
I don't know.

170
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,380
They weren't

171
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,380
willing to share.

172
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,610
Hey.

173
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,450
Hey.

174
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,060
I haven't seen you around

175
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,060
the last few days.

176
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,420
I've been doing ride-alongs

177
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,420
with the medics.

178
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,500
Nice of you

179
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,500
to help them out.

180
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,930
Um...

181
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,300
I got the last of my stuff

182
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,300
out of your apartment,

183
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,610
so, here.

184
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,920
I know you'll be happy

185
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,920
to move back in.

186
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,150
Thanks.

187
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,290
I should go.

188
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,010
Sexton,

189
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,010
I need a nurse.

190
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,290
Trent Sutton,

191
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,290
25 year old male,

192
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,290
GCS 12, vitals stable.

193
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,260
Semi-rousable

194
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,260
on four liters O2.

195
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,160
Found collapsed

196
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,160
in the DePaul library.

197
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,530
Looks like he suffered

198
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,530
a penetrating injury

199
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,530
to the chest.

200
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,620
Okay. On my count.

201
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,620
One, two, three.

202
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,370
Is that a needle?

203
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,370
Let's get an X-ray.

204
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,370
AP and lateral.

205
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
Hey, Trent, I'm Dr. Lanik.

206
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
You're okay.

207
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,630
I'm gonna remove

208
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,630
this needle, Trent,

209
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,730
but I gotta take

210
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,730
a picture first

211
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,970
to make sure

212
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,970
we're not flying blind.

213
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,540
No, no! Don't take it out!

214
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,670
Restraints.

215
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,670
Get off of me!

216
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,220
Get that X-ray already!

217
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,220
He pushed it deeper.

218
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,840
I can't take it

219
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,840
if he won't stay still.

220
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,480
Get off of me!

221
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,480
Push two Versed.

222
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,590
In.

223
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,670
Look who it is.

224
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,670
Anna Charles.

225
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,770
Hi, Maggie.

226
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,440
Hmm. Dad dragged you

227
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,440
into work today?

228
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,780
I did no such thing.

229
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,750
Oh, no. I... I like

230
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,750
spending time with my dad.

231
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,870
I wanted to come.

232
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,920
Uh, wants to volunteer,

233
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,920
actually.

234
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,420
Oh, really?

235
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,850
No school today?

236
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,850
Not really.

237
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,390
My class went on a field trip

238
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,390
to a science museum.

239
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,860
But I figured

240
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,860
I'd learn more

241
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,860
about science here.

242
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,020
I don't know

243
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,020
about all that.

244
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,120
But maybe

245
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,260
Deandra over in Pediatrics

246
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,260
can use some help.

247
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,630
Just so you know,

248
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,630
this one right here?

249
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,330
Her middle name?

250
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,330
Pop quiz.

251
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,430
Mmm-hmm.

252
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,130
Maggie "Pop Quiz" Lockwood.

253
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,130
I'm just saying.

254
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,270
That's me.

255
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,270
Okay.

256
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,640
Come on.

257
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,640
Let's get you a vest.

258
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,550
Hey, Dan?

259
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,550
You got a sec?

260
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,640
What you got?

261
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,790
Our friend

262
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,790
here's insides.

263
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,720
Those are sewing needles.

264
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,330
Four in all, which he seems

265
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,330
to have put there himself.

266
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,950
I was able

267
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,950
to remove this one,

268
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,430
which was only

269
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,430
partially submerged.

270
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,930
But that one there,

271
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,060
it managed to get all

272
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,060
the way into his heart.

273
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,790
I'm gonna do

274
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,790
a cardio workup,

275
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,300
but after that,

276
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,300
he's all yours.

277
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,630
Does it hurt

278
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,630
when I touch it?

279
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,010
Ah, more than

280
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,010
I'd like to admit.

281
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,140
Sorry, man.

282
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,250
When did you first

283
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,250
notice the rash?

284
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,010
Uh, about a week ago.

285
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,450
I was hoping

286
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,450
it would go away.

287
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,250
It's good

288
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,250
you're here now.

289
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,150
You have cellulitis,

290
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,150
bacterial infection.

291
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,780
I want to get you started

292
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,780
on an antibiotic.

293
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,450
Roger, are you

294
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,450
allergic to penicillin?

295
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,290
Uh, not that I know of.

296
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,790
Looks like

297
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,790
Mr. Larusso was here

298
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,920
about three years back.

299
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,020
And you were

300
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,020
his attending.

301
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,530
I, uh...

302
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,430
I thought

303
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,430
he looked familiar.

304
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,300
I apologize for

305
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,300
not recognizing you.

306
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,840
It's all right.

307
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sure you see

308
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,000
a lot of patients.

309
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,130
Yeah.

310
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,670
Okay, so, I see here,

311
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,670
you had a prior infection?

312
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,340
Uh-huh.

313
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,280
And we treated it

314
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,280
with cefazolin last time?

315
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,520
Uh, I don't remember.

316
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,680
My mind's a sieve.

317
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,690
That's all right.

318
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,220
I'm worried this rash

319
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,220
is the same bacteria.

320
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,520
I wanna make sure

321
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,520
we stay ahead of it.

322
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,790
Doris, start him

323
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,790
on an IV?

324
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,660
Mmm-hmm.

325
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,660
And at least we know

326
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,890
we had success with

327
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,890
that drug already.

328
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,460
Uh, What...

329
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,460
What's that for?

330
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,130
It's just to

331
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,130
monitor the rash.

332
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,000
I want to make sure

333
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,000
it shrinks down some

334
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,000
before I discharge you.

335
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,340
Okay, now, your

336
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,340
emergency contact

337
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,340
has your wife listed.

338
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,570
You want us to call her

339
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,410
and tell her

340
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,410
we'll be keeping you here

341
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,410
for a few more hours?

342
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,070
Uh, no.

343
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,070
Don't worry about that.

344
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,200
I'll... I'll give her a call.

345
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,080
All right, then.

346
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,420
Is something wrong?

347
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,420
What's going on?

348
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,220
The chest tube

349
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,220
should've drained

350
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,220
more blood.

351
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,260
Yeah, it's been a few days

352
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,260
since he's been hurt,

353
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,690
there's a chance

354
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,690
the hemothorax

355
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,690
is mostly clot.

356
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
Let's get him up

357
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
for a non-contrast

358
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
chest CT.

359
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,860
I should've taken him in

360
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,860
to see Dr. Moody earlier.

361
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,160
No, you didn't do

362
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,160
anything wrong.

363
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,860
Billy, you mind

364
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,860
if we speak with

365
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,860
your mom outside?

366
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,560
Okay, thanks, bud.

367
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,560
I'll be back.

368
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,180
So, if the CT shows me

369
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,180
what I think it is,

370
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,870
I'm recommending

371
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,870
surgery.

372
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, God.

373
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,210
No, I know

374
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,210
that sounds scary,

375
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,770
but the procedure,

376
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,770
a video-assisted

377
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,770
thoracoscopy

378
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,180
is minimally invasive.

379
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,720
We use a scope

380
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,720
to clean out

381
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,720
his chest.

382
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,180
When Billy was a baby,

383
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,180
he had to go on ECMO.

384
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,620
After all

385
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,620
the transfusions,

386
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,520
he developed

387
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,520
antibodies in his blood.

388
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,360
I guess to help

389
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,360
his immune system.

390
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,520
Yeah, Moody told me.

391
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,530
But I think we should be able

392
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,530
to find compatible blood.

393
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,430
Yeah, I'll have the blood

394
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,430
bank start sourcing

395
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,430
antibody-matched blood.

396
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,400
Billy's gonna get

397
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,400
the best care possible.

398
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,040
And nothing

399
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,040
to eat or drink.

400
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,040
Okay.

401
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,540
All right.

402
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,540
Thank you.

403
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,970
Schedule him in,

404
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,970
in a bit.

405
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,970
Sure.

406
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,110
Hey, Crockett.

407
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,110
Yeah.

408
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,240
What's all that

409
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,240
with the detectives?

410
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,280
They're investigating

411
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,280
a murder from

412
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,280
seven years back.

413
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,710
Well, what'd they

414
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,710
want with you?

415
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,210
I get the impression

416
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,210
they think I'm a suspect.

417
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,720
Why would

418
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,720
they think that?

419
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,620
'Cause they claim

420
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,620
to have gotten

421
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,620
my DNA at the scene.

422
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,100
So, um, let's talk about

423
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,100
these needles.

424
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,770
Can you tell me

425
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,770
about the first time

426
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,770
this happened?

427
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,010
I'm really embarrassed.

428
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,240
Trent, don't be.

429
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,250
If you knew

430
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,250
how many instances

431
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,080
of self-harm

432
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,080
I saw in this hospital...

433
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,480
Self-harm?

434
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,480
No, I wasn't trying

435
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,480
to hurt myself.

436
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,180
I was trying to

437
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,180
make myself feel better.

438
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,520
Okay.

439
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,920
Yeah, I'm under

440
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,920
a ton of pressure

441
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,920
right now.

442
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,590
I have to defend

443
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,590
my dissertation next month,

444
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,600
and it's been

445
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,600
messing me up.

446
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,630
My heart races,

447
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,630
I get nervous.

448
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,630
There's this press...

449
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,270
There's this pressure

450
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,270
in my chest that

451
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,270
I can't get rid of.

452
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,200
And the needles,

453
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,200
they alleviate that pressure?

454
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,830
Yeah, I know

455
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,830
it sounds insane,

456
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,810
but it's the only thing

457
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,810
that helps.

458
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,610
I'm telling you,

459
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,310
there's something

460
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,310
wrong with my heart.

461
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,180
Look, I absolutely believe

462
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,180
that it feels that way to you,

463
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,210
but the EKG

464
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,210
says otherwise.

465
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,990
Trent is a PhD candidate

466
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,990
at DePaul.

467
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,330
And recently, his anxiety

468
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,330
is kicking up this pretty

469
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,330
bizarre compulsion.

470
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,840
Like OCD?

471
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,840
Well, I mean,

472
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,840
kind of,

473
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,530
but instead of washing

474
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,530
his hands incessantly,

475
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,040
he's sticking needles

476
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,040
in his chest.

477
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,170
You get a look

478
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,170
at his scans?

479
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,170
Yes.

480
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,870
This needle appears

481
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,870
to be floating free

482
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,870
in his right ventricle.

483
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,540
At the moment,

484
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,540
it's not doing

485
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,540
any damage.

486
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,670
But if it were to move...

487
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,220
It's gonna get

488
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,220
spit out into his lungs.

489
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,340
Could become

490
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,340
a huge mess.

491
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,420
Most likely

492
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,420
a pulmonary embolism.

493
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,920
So, gonna

494
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,920
schedule him today?

495
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,820
I have reservations.

496
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,490
Is the patient suicidal?

497
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,360
Hmm. I mean,

498
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,360
not consciously.

499
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,020
But I can't argue

500
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,020
that the behavior

501
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,020
isn't life-threatening.

502
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,590
So then

503
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,590
he may be inclined

504
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,530
to reinsert the needles

505
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,530
even if we do pull them out.

506
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,040
How long will it take

507
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,040
for you to assess

508
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,040
his compulsion?

509
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,740
Getting to the root

510
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,740
of his anxiety,

511
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,210
remapping

512
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,210
his coping skills,

513
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,400
I mean,

514
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,400
that's gonna take

515
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,400
some time.

516
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,110
But we'll get

517
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,110
right into it post-op.

518
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,380
Hmm, fair enough.

519
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,570
I will proceed with

520
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,570
removing the needles.

521
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,120
But you'll have to

522
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,120
get his consent.

523
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,450
I'll work on that.

524
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,290
Hey, sweetie.

525
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,380
I got kicked off

526
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,380
the peds floor.

527
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,920
What?

528
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,620
Deandra said that

529
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,620
she wouldn't

530
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,620
get off her phone.

531
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,790
I thought you wanted

532
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,790
to be here.

533
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,920
I do.

534
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,200
I just didn't think

535
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,200
everyone would be

536
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,200
so uptight.

537
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,570
Do I need to

538
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,570
confiscate that thing?

539
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,870
What? No.

540
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,740
Put it in your pocket

541
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,740
and keep it there.

542
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,870
You know what,

543
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,540
Leah in the waiting room

544
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,540
needs some help.

545
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,480
Ideally, something

546
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,480
that requires

547
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,480
two thumbs?

548
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,450
Mmm-hmm.

549
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,450
She'll keep her busy.

550
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,420
Okay.

551
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,390
Hi, I'm Dr. Halstead.

552
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,290
Can you tell me

553
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,290
your name?

554
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,060
Yes, I can.

555
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,500
Oh. This is a test.

556
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,230
Right then,

557
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,230
my name is Christian.

558
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,940
Pleased to make

559
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,940
your acquaintance.

560
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,740
Pretty nasty infection

561
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,740
there, Christian.

562
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,150
Is that why

563
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,150
you came in today?

564
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,650
Christian, hey?

565
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,650
You with me?

566
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,650
Mmm-hmm.

567
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,650
All the way.

568
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,790
Your vein's rock-hard.

569
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,790
When did you last shoot up?

570
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,980
Ah... Oh...

571
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,760
What day is today?

572
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,030
Okay. Let's consent him

573
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,030
for an I&D.

574
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,660
Sorry

575
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,660
that took so long.

576
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,500
They made me park out

577
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,500
in the satellite lot.

578
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,630
That's all right.

579
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,490
I'll just be

580
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,490
a few minutes.

581
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,600
There you are, love.

582
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,600
I was afraid

583
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,600
you'd abandoned me.

584
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,840
You two know each other?

585
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,220
Uh, Christian's

586
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,220
an old friend.

587
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,720
Old friends,

588
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,720
two of us.

589
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,620
Okay, not here.

590
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,620
Okay.

591
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,720
Will, can we talk?

592
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,660
I'll get those

593
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,660
off you later.

594
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,670
I know that

595
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,670
this looks strange.

596
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,300
Well...

597
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,470
We used to date

598
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,470
about a year ago.

599
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,240
Another part of my past

600
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,240
I'm trying to put behind me.

601
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,080
I thought you were

602
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,080
going to the meeting.

603
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,200
Yeah, I was. I did.

604
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,540
And things were

605
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,540
just winding up

606
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,980
when I got this call

607
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,980
from Christian.

608
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,750
When I saw how

609
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,750
bad his arm was,

610
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,190
I brought him in

611
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,190
straight away.

612
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,480
You... You went

613
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,480
to his house?

614
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,980
You see the state he's in?

615
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,820
He's in no condition

616
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,820
to drive.

617
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,750
Hmm.

618
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,900
I guess I might feel

619
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,900
a little guilty

620
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,900
for getting clean.

621
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,900
I understand.

622
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,730
Are we good?

623
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,030
Absolutely.

624
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,870
Okay.

625
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,870
Hmm.

626
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,540
Oh, hey, you forgot this

627
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,540
this morning.

628
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,580
Oh. Thank you.

629
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,510
I'll see you later.

630
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,110
Yeah.

631
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,420
Do you have any updates

632
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,420
for Ms. Harris?

633
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,590
Yeah.

634
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,730
Tell her that

635
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,730
Billy did great

636
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,730
with the anesthesia,

637
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,060
and that

638
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,060
we're progressing.

639
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,730
Great.

640
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,740
The timing may be poor,

641
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,740
Ms. Goodwin, but this is

642
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,740
a police matter.

643
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,440
Dr. Marcel will

644
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,440
not be disturbed

645
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,310
while he's in

646
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,310
the operating room.

647
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,940
Judge just gave us

648
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,940
a warrant for his arrest.

649
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,620
Detective,

650
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,620
I am not interrupting

651
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,250
a surgery on

652
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,250
an 11-year-old child

653
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,250
for any reason.

654
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,790
You can take up

655
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,790
your concerns

656
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,730
with Dr. Marcel

657
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,730
when the operation is over.

658
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,430
Well, we got

659
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,430
no place to be.

660
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,930
Make yourself at home.

661
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,850
Stay here and

662
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,850
notify me immediately

663
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,080
if anything comes up.

664
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,450
Yes, Ms. Goodwin.

665
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,950
You don't think

666
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,950
Crockett's actually

667
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,950
guilty, do you?

668
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes. Come on.

669
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,800
Ethan? Ethan?

670
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,970
Hey. You there?

671
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,160
Yeah, what's up?

672
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,660
Do you think Courtney

673
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,660
should dye her hair?

674
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,110
If you want to.

675
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,600
Ambulance 95,

676
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,700
we have a shooting

677
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,700
with injuries

678
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,700
at 2112 North Damen.

679
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,470
95 to main.

680
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,470
Message received.

681
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,470
We're on our way.

682
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,520
Stay low.

683
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,520
Keep your heads down.

684
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,860
What happened?

685
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,230
I got shot.

686
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,630
I was just about

687
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,630
to put on

688
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,630
a tourniquet.

689
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,070
All right.

690
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,070
Doesn't seem

691
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,070
like too much blood.

692
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,140
I'm gonna put a pressure

693
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,140
dressing on it.

694
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,140
Right.

695
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,900
Where's the shooter?

696
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,900
Inside.

697
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,570
Our guys on-viewed

698
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,570
a carjacking.

699
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,840
Gave chase, and the bad guy

700
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,840
came to a crash stop here.

701
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,140
Went inside with a gun.

702
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,310
Store owner

703
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,310
here thought

704
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,040
he was being robbed.

705
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,040
Exchanged gunfire.

706
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,980
Son of a bitch is lucky

707
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,980
I ran out of bullets.

708
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,380
He's holed up

709
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,380
inside now.

710
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,710
Let's go.

711
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,060
Hold your fire!

712
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,490
Wait, hold your fire!

713
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,490
Hold your fire!

714
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,660
All right,

715
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,660
come on, I got you.

716
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,530
Are you hurt?

717
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,530
No.

718
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,230
But a boy, inside,

719
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,230
my... my neighbor,

720
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,230
he got shot.

721
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,360
All right.

722
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,360
Where was he shot?

723
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,740
I think

724
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,740
in the stomach.

725
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,440
Please, he's only nine.

726
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,000
2112 Squad, notify CFD,

727
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,000
we need a couple

728
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,000
ambulances standing by.

729
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,550
There's an injured

730
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,550
kid inside, we have

731
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,550
to get in there.

732
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,410
SWAT's en route.

733
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,410
The girl said

734
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,410
the boy's been shot.

735
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,110
I hear you, but I got

736
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,110
orders to stand down

737
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,110
and hold the perimeter.

738
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,250
Don't shoot,

739
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,250
medic, don't shoot!

740
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,760
Hold your fire.

741
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,290
Medic! Don't shoot.

742
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,590
Don't shoot!

743
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,590
Hey, I'm unarmed!

744
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,220
I'm a doctor!

745
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,220
I'm coming in!

746
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

747
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,130
I'm a doctor.

748
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,710
Okay, I'm here to help.

749
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,410
Is anyone injured?

750
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,150
Hey, don't move!

751
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Take it easy.

752
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,120
I just wanna

753
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,120
help the boy.

754
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,820
Hey, turn around, man.

755
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,820
Turn around.

756
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,090
Slowly, or I will

757
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,090
shoot you.

758
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,060
Get on your knees.

759
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,290
Come on.

760
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,830
Just take it easy.

761
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,830
Get down.

762
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,690
Let's go.

763
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,260
Damn it!

764
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,660
Units on the citywide,

765
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,660
we have a hostage situation.

766
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,940
Hey, give me that!

767
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,940
Give me that! Come on!

768
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,270
Your phone, too,

769
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,270
I know you got it.

770
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,040
Get up!

771
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,880
Come on! Come on!

772
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,480
And move the fridge.

773
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,020
Move! In front

774
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,020
of the door.

775
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,480
Okay, that's good.

776
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,620
Get back down

777
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,620
on the ground.

778
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,130
Can I take a look at him?

779
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,130
I said, get down!

780
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,360
Come on, man,

781
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,360
he's a kid.

782
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,640
Okay. This helps you, too,

783
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,640
because if he dies...

784
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,070
Fine. But if you

785
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,070
try anything...

786
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,330
I won't.

787
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,920
Look, all I did

788
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,920
was steal a car.

789
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,240
What about this kid?

790
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,980
Hey, I didn't shoot him, man.

791
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,320
It was that idiot

792
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,320
behind the counter.

793
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,220
Look, hey.

794
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,050
He needs to go

795
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,050
to the hospital.

796
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,350
I'm begging you

797
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,350
to release him.

798
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,900
You can still

799
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,900
keep me as a hostage.

800
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,490
I'll let him go

801
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,590
when I'm ready.

802
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,870
Ed Green, 50,

803
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,870
GSW to the thigh,

804
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,870
GCS 15, BP 133/87.

805
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,070
Heart rate, 97

806
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,070
and sats 100%.

807
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,410
Hey, I thought Ethan was

808
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,410
on your ambo. Where is he?

809
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,880
Hey. Where is he?

810
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,890
What happened?

811
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,690
Come on, Kevin,

812
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,690
what've you heard?

813
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,190
I really shouldn't be

814
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,190
telling you this.

815
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,280
But...

816
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,950
The detectives

817
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,950
in New Orleans

818
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,190
had been sitting

819
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,190
on DNA evidence

820
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,190
for a long time.

821
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,530
Why'd they wait until now

822
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,530
to come get Crockett?

823
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,300
Forensics pulled samples

824
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,300
from you and Crockett,

825
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,300
when you two got kidnapped.

826
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,930
Right, to cross-match it

827
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,930
with the fugitives' DNA.

828
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,940
Those samples got put

829
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,940
into a national database.

830
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,440
Crockett is a positive match

831
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,570
for a cold case murder

832
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,570
in Louisiana.

833
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,080
There's no way.

834
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,380
Listen, I'm just

835
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,380
telling you what I heard.

836
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,110
And DNA

837
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,110
is hard to refute.

838
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,620
I'll let you know

839
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,620
if I hear anything else.

840
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,750
Thank you.

841
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,600
So, here's

842
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,600
where we're at.

843
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,990
We gotta get

844
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,990
these needles

845
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,990
out of your chest,

846
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,660
especially the one

847
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,660
that's hanging around

848
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,660
in your right ventricle,

849
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,140
and we're gonna

850
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,140
do that tonight.

851
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,330
Surgery, tonight?

852
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,330
Yeah.

853
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,670
And then when

854
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,670
you're recovering,

855
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,240
I think it'd be a really

856
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,240
good idea if we would

857
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,240
start to address...

858
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,740
How long

859
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,740
will I be here?

860
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,310
In the hospital?

861
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,310
I'd say probably

862
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,310
at least three days,

863
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,680
and then...

864
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,680
That doesn't work.

865
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,350
I only have

866
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,350
a couple of weeks

867
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,480
until I defend

868
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,480
my dissertation.

869
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,650
And if I fail,

870
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,280
the last five years

871
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,280
will have been

872
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,280
a complete waste of my life.

873
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,520
I need to get out of here!

874
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,150
Okay, but you understand

875
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,150
we can't let you

876
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,860
just walk out of here

877
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,860
with a needle in your heart.

878
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,330
Whoa, wait.

879
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,330
Okay, buddy. Here.

880
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,100
Trent, look at me.

881
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,100
Look at me. Look at me.

882
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,000
Trent, Trent, Trent.

883
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,000
Look at me.

884
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,040
Take a deep breath.

885
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,040
In through the nose...

886
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,300
No. You don't understand.

887
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,300
You're ruining my life!

888
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,600
Slow down.

889
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,600
Slow your breathing down.

890
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,640
It's racing. It feels

891
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,640
like it's beating

892
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,640
out of my chest!

893
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,370
I'm holding your hand.

894
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,370
Can you feel my hand?

895
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,710
Can you feel my hand?

896
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,180
Code Blue!

897
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,180
A respiratory arrest.

898
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,790
Drop his head and bag him.

899
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,790
Yes, Doctor.

900
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,960
What happened?

901
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,960
Oh, Dr. Manning,

902
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,960
there you are.

903
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,970
I'm Dr. Julian Moody,

904
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,970
Billy Harris' pediatrician.

905
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,170
Of course. Billy's

906
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,170
in surgery right now.

907
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,170
I know.

908
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,870
His mother called me.

909
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,870
She's concerned

910
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,870
about his operation.

911
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,810
She said Dr. Marcel

912
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,810
is in some sort of trouble?

913
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,050
Please.

914
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,680
It can't be true.

915
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,680
Crockett would

916
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,680
never hurt anyone.

917
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,150
I know.

918
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,490
If the murder took place

919
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,490
seven years ago,

920
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,930
then that means

921
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,930
that you and Crockett

922
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,720
would've been

923
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,720
at medical school

924
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,720
at that time.

925
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,560
Did you know him well?

926
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,560
Yeah.

927
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,760
And Crockett was going

928
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,760
through a lot back then,

929
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,430
but no way

930
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,430
was he killing people.

931
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,560
What do you mean?

932
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,270
I shouldn't

933
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,270
have said anything.

934
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,100
It's not my story to tell.

935
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,240
Please.

936
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,510
I just wanna help him.

937
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,610
His baby,

938
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,680
Harper,

939
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,020
she died from leukemia,

940
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,720
not long after

941
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,720
her first birthday.

942
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,760
Dr. Halstead.

943
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,040
He has rashes all over

944
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,040
and parts are sloughing.

945
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,370
What the hell

946
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,370
is going on?

947
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,270
Stop the cefazolin now.

948
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,070
A 125 mg Solu-Medrol

949
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,070
and bolus a liter of saline.

950
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,210
Doris, call his wife.

951
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,540
Why is this happening?

952
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,780
Seems like you're having

953
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,780
an allergic reaction

954
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,780
to the medication.

955
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,440
My skin's burning.

956
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,920
Okay. Two milligrams

957
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,920
of Morphine.

958
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,990
Tell the burn center

959
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,990
we're coming up.

960
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,990
Okay.

961
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,220
I have Roger's wife

962
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,220
on the phone.

963
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,220
Okay. Is she coming in?

964
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,730
She says she's with

965
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,730
her husband, Roger,

966
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,730
right now. At home.

967
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,790
So, who's this?

968
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,790
Excuse me.

969
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,790
Excuse me, please.

970
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,730
This is the nurse

971
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,730
who knows Dr. Choi.

972
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,640
April Sexton.

973
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,640
Is Ethan okay?

974
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,570
No idea. We can't

975
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,570
get eyes on him.

976
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,080
And the offender won't answer

977
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,080
the phone inside the store.

978
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,940
You have Choi's cell?

979
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,940
Yeah.

980
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,180
Okay, good.

981
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,750
You know, for a guy

982
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,750
who's supposedly taken

983
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,750
his TEMS training,

984
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,020
Choi violated about

985
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,020
100 different protocols

986
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,020
when he ran in there.

987
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,960
I heard there was

988
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,960
a kid in there

989
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,960
with a gunshot wound.

990
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,960
We're trying to hack

991
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,960
into the security camera now.

992
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,120
And once we get eyes

993
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,120
in there, we're going.

994
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,500
Hey.

995
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,630
That's probably SWAT outside.

996
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,630
You should talk to them.

997
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,770
It's the only way

998
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,770
you're getting out...

999
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,210
Just shut up. Uh...

1000
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,210
I need... I need a plan.

1001
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,710
Hey, how long does it take

1002
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,710
to drive to the border?

1003
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,480
Canada?

1004
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,480
Four or five hours.

1005
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,890
But listen, man,

1006
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,890
I need to help this kid

1007
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,650
and it can't wait...

1008
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,650
Look, just shut up!

1009
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,490
Hello?

1010
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,530
Yeah, who is this?

1011
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,860
Shut up and listen

1012
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,860
to me, okay?

1013
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,860
It's my turn to talk.

1014
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,360
I'm gonna make

1015
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,360
the demands. Okay?

1016
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,740
Okay, look. I've got...

1017
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,740
You're trying to kill me!

1018
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,640
Wait, wait, wait.

1019
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,640
It's for the kid!

1020
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,140
Drop it!

1021
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,140
I can't.

1022
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,140
He can barely breathe.

1023
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,510
He's got a collapsed lung.

1024
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,740
I need to make

1025
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,740
a hole in his chest

1026
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,480
to release the air

1027
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,480
that's trapped inside.

1028
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,410
Keep the gun

1029
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,410
pointed at me.

1030
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,820
I'm gonna take this knife

1031
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,820
over to the boy now,

1032
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,820
all right?

1033
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,930
I'm gonna make a small

1034
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,930
incision in his chest.

1035
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,710
I'm gonna throw

1036
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,710
the knife away,

1037
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,710
where I can't reach it.

1038
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,180
Wow.

1039
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,400
Why is Trent Sutton

1040
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,400
still down here?

1041
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,630
I thought you were

1042
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,630
sending him up to the OR.

1043
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,300
I want to, but he won't

1044
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,300
consent to surgery.

1045
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,200
You know

1046
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,200
what's bizarre?

1047
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,940
He claims to get this pain

1048
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,940
in his chest, right there.

1049
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,770
I was pretty

1050
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,770
much convinced

1051
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,770
it was psychosomatic.

1052
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,410
But then, after this

1053
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,410
last episode, he fainted.

1054
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,810
Leads me

1055
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,810
to believe that,

1056
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,390
I don't know, maybe

1057
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,390
there is some kind of

1058
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,480
underlying physical

1059
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,480
condition there.

1060
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,820
Well, let me know

1061
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,820
how it progresses.

1062
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,120
Because I got

1063
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,120
a waiting room

1064
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,120
full of patients and...

1065
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,730
And now, I got

1066
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,730
ambos coming in.

1067
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,890
I'd like to

1068
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,890
free up the room.

1069
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,060
Give that to me, now.

1070
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,500
What? Why?

1071
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,510
Why? Because clearly

1072
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,510
it's interfering with your

1073
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,510
ability to do your work.

1074
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,840
I'm just texting my friends.

1075
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,840
Well, if that's

1076
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,840
so important to you,

1077
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,910
let's get you over

1078
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,910
to the science museum

1079
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,910
so you can do it in person.

1080
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,640
No, I... I can't.

1081
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,910
Why not?

1082
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,070
Because.

1083
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,070
Because, why?

1084
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,980
Dad, if you make me go

1085
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,980
on that field trip, I'll die.

1086
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,580
Honey. What's going on?

1087
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,420
He laughed at me.

1088
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,870
Who? Who laughed at you?

1089
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,300
Pete Slater.

1090
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,770
When I asked him

1091
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,770
if he'd like to meet me

1092
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,770
at the mall sometime.

1093
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,370
And everyone saw.

1094
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,600
And they laughed, too.

1095
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,510
And now, Jen says

1096
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,510
that Lisa Carruthers

1097
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,140
is holding hands

1098
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,140
with him on the bus.

1099
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,700
And now, they're, like,

1100
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,700
officially going out.

1101
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,220
And my life

1102
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,220
is ruined!

1103
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,320
Is she all right?

1104
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,060
Looks like some guy

1105
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,060
she's sweet on,

1106
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,290
decided he was sweet

1107
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,290
on somebody else.

1108
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,660
Oh.

1109
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,830
Ouch.

1110
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,830
Yeah.

1111
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,300
But, damn, Mags,

1112
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,300
all the texting?

1113
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,300
Mmm-hmm.

1114
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,840
I mean, doesn't it just

1115
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,840
amplify everything?

1116
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,870
Thirteen-year-old girls,

1117
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,870
their hearts are just

1118
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,870
wired differently.

1119
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,510
Wired differently, indeed.

1120
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,020
Hey, do me a favor.

1121
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,020
Page Dr. Latham for me.

1122
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,180
On it.

1123
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,160
Dr. Halstead?

1124
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,860
Dr. Halstead,

1125
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,500
this is Roger Larusso

1126
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,500
and his wife, Yvette.

1127
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,410
Your nurse called me

1128
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,410
on the phone.

1129
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,070
Yeah, I apologize,

1130
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,070
there's been

1131
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,070
a misunderstanding.

1132
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,740
We had a case

1133
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,740
of mistaken identity,

1134
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,870
but you didn't need

1135
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,870
to come in.

1136
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,080
We came to see Brian.

1137
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,080
He's a friend of mine.

1138
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,920
I'm sorry, but, um,

1139
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,920
Brian must've stolen

1140
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,920
your insurance card.

1141
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,520
He presented it

1142
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,520
when he came in.

1143
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,950
No, I gave it

1144
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,950
to him.

1145
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,950
Roger?

1146
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,260
His insurance lapsed

1147
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,260
and he needed

1148
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,260
to see a doctor.

1149
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,030
Because I was going off

1150
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,030
of your chart,

1151
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,070
I treated his skin infection

1152
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,070
with a cephalosporin,

1153
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,400
which you're

1154
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,400
not allergic to.

1155
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,470
Brian is?

1156
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,470
Extremely.

1157
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,040
Is he gonna be okay?

1158
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,710
The burn surgeons are hopeful

1159
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,710
we caught it in time

1160
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,470
but there's gonna

1161
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,470
be permanent scarring.

1162
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,410
Oh, my God.

1163
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,920
Do you know

1164
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,920
how reckless this was?

1165
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,310
I'm sorry.

1166
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,150
I didn't know

1167
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,150
what else to do.

1168
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,450
He needed my help.

1169
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,390
Well, your help

1170
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,390
could've killed him today.

1171
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,220
You can't just

1172
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,220
keep me here.

1173
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,420
I don't understand

1174
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,420
why we are

1175
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,420
doing this again.

1176
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,490
Versed wouldn't have had

1177
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,490
an effect on his EKG.

1178
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,570
No. But it would

1179
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,570
affect his anxiety.

1180
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,630
I mean, look at his

1181
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,630
U wave without it.

1182
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,900
He's tachycardic.

1183
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,900
What is that?

1184
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,410
It means your

1185
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,410
heart rate's elevated,

1186
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,500
because you're anxious.

1187
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,840
And it also appears

1188
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,840
there's an extra

1189
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,840
electrical pathway.

1190
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,850
Most likely

1191
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,850
Wolff-Parkinson-White

1192
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,850
syndrome.

1193
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,970
Wait. What is that?

1194
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
It's actually

1195
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
a congenital defect,

1196
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,440
that usually becomes

1197
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,440
symptomatic around your age.

1198
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,580
And it can be

1199
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,580
intermittent.

1200
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,450
Sometimes

1201
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,450
only appearing

1202
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,450
during exercise.

1203
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,320
Or periods of stress

1204
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,320
and anxiety.

1205
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,330
I can correct this

1206
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,330
when I remove

1207
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,330
the needles.

1208
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,490
You... You can make

1209
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,490
this all go away?

1210
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,870
Yeah. What are we

1211
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,870
waiting for?

1212
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,830
I'll assemble

1213
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,830
my team.

1214
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,370
So, I'm out

1215
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,370
of here when?

1216
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,500
We will have plenty

1217
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,500
of time to talk about that.

1218
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,550
Yeah, but you just

1219
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,550
said that everything

1220
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,550
was gonna be fixed.

1221
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,340
Look,

1222
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,540
what we've done

1223
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,540
is we've figured out

1224
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,170
where that terrible

1225
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,170
pressure is coming from.

1226
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,610
Now, we have to address

1227
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,120
why you were

1228
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,120
responding to it

1229
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,120
the way you were.

1230
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,710
I was just relieving

1231
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,710
the pressure

1232
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,710
in my chest. I mean...

1233
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,720
Trent, sticking

1234
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,720
needles in your chest,

1235
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,630
physiologically,

1236
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,630
had absolutely

1237
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,630
nothing to do

1238
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,290
with relieving

1239
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,290
that pain.

1240
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,960
You're a human being, okay?

1241
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,370
You're gonna have

1242
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,370
stressors in your life.

1243
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,660
We just gotta

1244
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,660
figure out a way

1245
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,200
for you to deal

1246
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,200
with that anxiety

1247
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,800
in a way that's

1248
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,800
less self-destructive.

1249
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,200
Gonna take

1250
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,200
a little time.

1251
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,010
"DNA evidence can lead

1252
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,010
to wrongful convictions"?

1253
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,240
Is this about Crockett?

1254
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,840
What do you need, Doris?

1255
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,250
Blood bank rep

1256
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,250
just delivered

1257
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,650
a new batch

1258
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,650
for your patient,

1259
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,650
Billy Harris.

1260
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,920
He's in surgery now.

1261
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,220
I'll run it upstairs.

1262
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,220
Thank you.

1263
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,850
It's a good thing you

1264
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,850
got the right blood.

1265
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,760
Will had a patient today

1266
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,760
who got the wrong medicine.

1267
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,860
Oof, was that a mess.

1268
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,230
Doris, wait!

1269
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,340
It's hard to match

1270
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,340
bone marrow, too.

1271
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,270
You know what?

1272
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,270
I'll take the blood up myself.

1273
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,280
Get this to Dr. Marcel.

1274
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,280
Right away.

1275
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,410
Thank you.

1276
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,120
Dr. Marcel?

1277
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,120
Yeah.

1278
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,350
I know this is gonna

1279
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,350
sound crazy,

1280
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,890
but did you donate

1281
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,890
bone marrow in the past?

1282
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,860
Uh, can we talk

1283
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,860
when I'm done?

1284
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,360
No, we can't.

1285
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,790
Yeah, I did.

1286
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,790
A long time ago.

1287
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,120
I suppose it's

1288
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,120
in my medical records

1289
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,120
somewhere.

1290
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,530
Okay, thanks.

1291
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,780
No. No, no, no, no.

1292
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,780
I... I need a car now!

1293
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,050
And forget it.

1294
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,050
I'm done talking.

1295
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,910
I knew, I knew

1296
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,910
they were gonna

1297
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,910
mess with me.

1298
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,650
You need

1299
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,650
to call them back.

1300
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,650
Keep negotiating.

1301
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,320
Three hours to get a car?

1302
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,320
They're playing games.

1303
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,290
Hey.

1304
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,660
I know how these guys think.

1305
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,250
You say you're

1306
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,250
done talking?

1307
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,820
That's when they

1308
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,820
force their way in.

1309
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,140
Man, I've screwed up

1310
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,140
so many times in my life.

1311
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,470
It's like...

1312
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,840
It's like I never do

1313
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,840
the right thing.

1314
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,350
I know how that feels.

1315
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,610
What do you mean?

1316
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,950
I blew it with someone

1317
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,950
I care about.

1318
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,460
Made some big mistakes.

1319
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,460
Wish I could do it over.

1320
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,790
Yeah.

1321
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,800
Me, too.

1322
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,130
You give yourself up now,

1323
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,800
we both get a chance

1324
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,800
to do the right thing.

1325
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,500
How is he?

1326
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,710
He needs more

1327
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,710
medical attention

1328
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,710
than I can give him.

1329
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,280
So, call them back.

1330
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,840
Okay.

1331
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,150
I'll turn myself in.

1332
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,190
SWAT OFFICER 1:

1333
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,190
Fire in the hole!

1334
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,520
Go! Get down!

1335
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,730
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1336
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,730
He's not resisting!

1337
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,500
SWAT OFFICER 2:

1338
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,500
Come on, come on.

1339
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,540
I need paramedics

1340
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,540
in here now!

1341
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,980
Ethan.

1342
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,910
April.

1343
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,330
When I saw SWAT

1344
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,330
go into that building, I...

1345
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,860
I've never been

1346
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,860
more scared.

1347
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,330
I, um...

1348
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,100
Dr. Choi,

1349
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,570
we're gonna need

1350
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,570
a formal statement

1351
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,730
about what took place

1352
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,730
inside the store.

1353
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,370
Come with me,

1354
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,370
please.

1355
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,130
You done?

1356
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,130
What's going on,

1357
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,130
fellas?

1358
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,250
Crockett Marcel,

1359
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,250
you are under arrest

1360
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,730
for the murder

1361
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,730
of Georgine Burrows.

1362
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,200
What, are you serious?

1363
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,200
Poulson.

1364
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,430
Wait. You're making

1365
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,430
a mistake.

1366
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,630
You've got

1367
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,630
the wrong guy.

1368
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,230
Ma'am, it's

1369
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,230
police business.

1370
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,360
Just a minute

1371
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,360
of your time.

1372
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,430
You said you found

1373
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,430
Dr. Marcel's DNA

1374
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,270
at a murder scene

1375
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,270
seven years ago.

1376
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,940
His medical records

1377
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,940
show that he donated

1378
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,940
bone marrow,

1379
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,540
and he donated it

1380
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,540
before the murder occurred.

1381
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,740
So?

1382
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,880
Sometimes, recipients

1383
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,880
of bone marrow transplants

1384
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,880
inherit their donor's DNA.

1385
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:58,150
Their blood cells become

1386
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:58,150
genetically identical

1387
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:58,150
to their donor's.

1388
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,750
It's rare,

1389
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,750
but it's real.

1390
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,320
And we're not disputing

1391
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,320
your evidence, Detectives.

1392
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,160
We're only

1393
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,160
asking you to consider

1394
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,460
looking at the recipient

1395
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,460
of Dr. Marcel's bone marrow.

1396
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,070
And if his recipient

1397
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,070
does have his DNA,

1398
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,000
then your murderer

1399
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,000
is still out there.

1400
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,100
Excuse me.

1401
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,350
How you doing, hon?

1402
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,790
Do you care?

1403
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,590
Actually, I think I might be

1404
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,590
coming down with something.

1405
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,130
Think maybe you should,

1406
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,130
uh, stay home from school.

1407
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,930
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

1408
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,670
You know, when I was

1409
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,670
in eighth grade,

1410
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,180
I faked a note

1411
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,180
to get out of gym class.

1412
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,510
And said

1413
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,510
I had drop foot.

1414
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,020
I was just embarrassed

1415
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,020
'cause I was just slow.

1416
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,180
I wasn't athletic.

1417
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,990
Ended up having to fake a limp

1418
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,990
for the entire year.

1419
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,120
Yeah?

1420
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,120
Yeah.

1421
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,830
I mean, look at me.

1422
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,490
A guy like me probably

1423
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,490
should've gone

1424
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,490
to gym class, right?

1425
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,810
Yeah, we all have

1426
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,810
our ways of dealing

1427
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,810
with things.

1428
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,240
And some work,

1429
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,580
others, like running away,

1430
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,090
I mean, they just...

1431
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,090
they just don't.

1432
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,580
You're saying I need

1433
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,580
to go back to school.

1434
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,660
It just hurts.

1435
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,900
You know, like,

1436
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,900
when does it stop?

1437
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:57,670
You mean,

1438
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:57,670
when does life stop hurting?

1439
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,570
Yeah, I guess.

1440
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,710
Life's always gonna have

1441
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,710
its ups and downs, you know?

1442
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,080
But in my experience,

1443
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,080
we do get better

1444
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,080
at dealing with 'em.

1445
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,890
You will, too, honey.

1446
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,770
Oh, Will.

1447
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,740
Your insurance fraud patient

1448
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,740
used a fake ID when

1449
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,740
he checked in today.

1450
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,880
I looked at the copy

1451
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,880
that Leah made,

1452
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,080
and she should've

1453
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,080
caught that.

1454
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,780
I had a feeling

1455
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,780
something was up.

1456
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,290
You know when

1457
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,290
you get the sense

1458
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,290
you're being lied to?

1459
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,330
I should've said something

1460
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,330
right then and there.

1461
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,160
It's okay to give someone

1462
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,160
the benefit of the doubt.

1463
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,330
Even if I'm wrong?

1464
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,060
You believe in people.

1465
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,060
That's a good thing.

1466
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,510
And you know

1467
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,510
you need to quit.

1468
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,510
Yeah, yeah.

1469
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,110
Mmm-hmm.

1470
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,110
Ah.

1471
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,310
Seems I've been

1472
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,310
released back

1473
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,310
into the wild.

1474
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,510
Thank you, doctor.

1475
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,490
Again, if you want

1476
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,490
some help,

1477
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,360
we can set you up

1478
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,360
with addiction

1479
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,360
specialists.

1480
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,090
This one's already been

1481
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,090
in my ear about that.

1482
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,870
Ash, I really appreciate

1483
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,870
you coming over today.

1484
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,040
Cheers, mate.

1485
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,040
Yeah.

1486
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,880
Well...

1487
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,780
This all must have seemed

1488
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,780
pretty suspicious.

1489
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,150
Especially with

1490
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,150
the whole phone thing.

1491
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,150
Hannah.

1492
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,520
Look, I did go to

1493
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,520
that meeting today.

1494
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,520
And when I said

1495
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,520
that Christian called me,

1496
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,120
I meant that he called

1497
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,120
our mutual friend, Laura,

1498
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,220
who was there with me.

1499
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,060
And so when you gave me

1500
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,060
back the phone,

1501
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,060
it felt like may...

1502
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,190
Hey.

1503
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,960
I believe you.

1504
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,960
Really?

1505
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,400
Because if I heard

1506
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,400
you ended up at your

1507
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,400
ex-girlfriend's place...

1508
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,500
If you're telling me

1509
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,500
that's what happened,

1510
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,980
then that's what happened.

1511
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,080
Let's get

1512
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,080
out of here.

1513
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,850
Mmm-hmm.

1514
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,660
The good news is,

1515
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,660
you'll be back

1516
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,660
on your bike soon.

1517
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,200
Don't go

1518
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,200
too fast now.

1519
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,930
Told you, Dr. Marcel

1520
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,930
was the guy for this.

1521
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,060
Thank you,

1522
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,060
Dr. Marcel.

1523
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,770
Thank you, both.

1524
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,770
Of course.

1525
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,240
Hey, Nat.

1526
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,240
Mmm-hmm?

1527
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,700
Appreciate

1528
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,700
all your help.

1529
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,700
Yeah.

1530
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,410
The thing I can't

1531
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,410
figure out...

1532
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,340
What gave you the idea

1533
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,340
I donated bone marrow?

1534
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,720
I always knew

1535
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,720
you were a good guy.

1536
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,020
Dr. Moody told me

1537
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,020
about what happened.

1538
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,760
With your baby.

1539
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,290
I see.

1540
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,430
Do me a favor,

1541
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,430
keep that to yourself?

1542
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,630
People hear

1543
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,630
that sort of thing,

1544
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,910
they tend to look

1545
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,910
at you different.

1546
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,570
Of course.

1547
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,110
Yeah.

1548
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,950
Good night,

1549
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,950
Dr. Manning.

1550
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,250
Night.
