1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,500
That cancer's

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,500
a heavy lift,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,200
but there's strength

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,200
in community.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,130
Once I let 'em in,

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,600
that was a real comfort.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,870
The truth is,

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,870
she chose Phillip.

9
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,170
Right, that night in my car,

10
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,170
she was coming

11
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,170
to show me her ring.

12
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,340
I don't know

13
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,340
what she was

14
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,340
gonna say to you,

15
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,080
but I do know

16
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,080
she wasn't gonna

17
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,080
show you any ring.

18
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,190
He slipped the ring

19
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,190
on your finger when

20
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,190
you were unconscious.

21
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,310
He's lying to you.

22
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,820
It doesn't matter,

23
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,820
because it's over.

24
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,880
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,880
I should've done

26
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,880
something.

27
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,020
No!

28
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,020
Said something.

29
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,650
Get out of my life.

30
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,990
I know we said

31
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,990
someday, but...

32
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,730
You'd make

33
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,730
the best mom ever.

34
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,730
Mmm. Smells so good.

35
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,400
Frittata with

36
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,400
chicken sausage,

37
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,210
Swiss chard,

38
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,210
and Gruyere.

39
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,980
Too bad

40
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,980
I have to go...

41
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,980
Early shift.

42
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,880
I know, I remembered.

43
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,880
I'm prepping yours to go.

44
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,410
You are too good to me.

45
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,210
Protein, iron, vitamin B

46
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,210
from the dark leafy greens.

47
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,520
Mediterranean

48
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,520
diet breakfast.

49
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,520
Shown to...

50
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,820
Help ovarian health?

51
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,820
Exactly.

52
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,030
Is this what

53
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,030
I think it is?

54
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,300
Uh, fertility chart.

55
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,700
Tracking your

56
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,700
ovulation schedule,

57
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,710
like we talked about.

58
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,210
And good news,

59
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,380
we are in

60
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,380
your fertile window.

61
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,910
Oh, my God, Ethan...

62
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,780
I just...

63
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,780
I thought we'd take

64
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,880
a little more of

65
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,880
a laissez-faire approach.

66
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,220
If our goal

67
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,220
is having a baby,

68
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,630
then we should definitely

69
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,630
be having sex.

70
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,590
Especially when

71
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,590
you're ovulating.

72
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,860
Thank you

73
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,860
for breakfast.

74
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,570
I also put some

75
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,570
folic acid in there,

76
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,570
you know, to prevent...

77
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,870
Birth defects? I know.

78
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,810
Yeah. I know you know.

79
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,570
Are you

80
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,570
ever gonna tell me

81
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,040
where we're going

82
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,040
to dinner tonight?

83
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,140
I'm not telling.

84
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,410
Come on, spill

85
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,410
the beans, please.

86
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,610
I'm not telling you.

87
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,610
Oh, come on.

88
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,610
I like this.

89
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,780
I got us a reservation

90
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,780
at Alinea.

91
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,350
Alinea?

92
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,350
Alinea.

93
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,820
It takes three months

94
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,820
to get a table there.

95
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,820
How'd you swing that?

96
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,590
I might've told them

97
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,590
that I'm dying.

98
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,200
Are you serious?

99
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,200
No, come on,

100
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,200
I didn't do that.

101
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,320
Jesus.

102
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,990
Come on, you know

103
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,990
your wife's

104
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,990
a rock star.

105
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,930
That, I knew already.

106
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,440
Matter of fact, I have

107
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,440
all your albums.

108
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,440
You do.

109
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,940
Alinea.

110
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
Hey, you going

111
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
to Crockett's crawfish

112
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
boil tonight?

113
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,320
Maybe, I don't know.

114
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,020
Well, you should.

115
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,820
You know, with Crockett,

116
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,820
the food and booze

117
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,820
will be great.

118
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,090
Heads up.

119
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,690
Treatment 3.

120
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,860
Tom Lyons, 25,

121
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,960
collapsed in

122
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,960
the stairwell

123
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,960
of his building.

124
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,530
GCS 15, BP's low

125
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,530
at 88 over 55 even

126
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,530
after a liter of NS.

127
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,800
Heart rate's 97

128
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,800
and sats 100%.

129
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,540
Hi, Tom,

130
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,540
I'm Dr. Halstead.

131
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,670
What's going on?

132
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,980
I fell.

133
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,980
Oh, yeah?

134
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,710
Isn't this

135
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,710
all a bit much?

136
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,980
We're just gonna

137
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,980
check you out,

138
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,980
make sure you're okay.

139
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,140
On three.

140
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,140
One, two, three.

141
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,310
Thanks, guys.

142
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,850
Lungs are clear.

143
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,850
CBC, CMP, trops,

144
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,850
and an EKG.

145
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,730
Also, a chest X-ray

146
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,730
and stick him for glucose.

147
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,830
On it.

148
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,830
Really, I'm good.

149
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,840
Not sure why

150
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,840
his pressure is so soft.

151
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,840
Let's fast his belly.

152
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,970
Okay.

153
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,670
Yeah.

154
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,670
It's okay.

155
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,670
Get it out.

156
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,340
Tom, you with me?

157
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,210
Get it out.

158
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,200
Give him two units

159
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,200
of blood now, and get

160
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,200
GI down here to scope him.

161
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,540
What's up with his fangs?

162
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,540
Can't be natural, can they?

163
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,880
I don't think so.

164
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,880
It's odd.

165
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,810
Let me know as soon

166
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,810
as his labs

167
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,810
and EKG come back.

168
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,250
Yeah.

169
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,570
Hey.

170
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,060
Takes a while to

171
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,060
mend a broken heart.

172
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,290
Yes, I'm familiar.

173
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,420
Hmm.

174
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,830
Okay, Maggie.

175
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,120
Hundred pounds

176
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,120
of crawfish

177
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,500
delivered to my place.

178
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,500
I'm fixin' to boil.

179
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,970
Tell me you're still good

180
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,970
for the jambalaya.

181
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,010
Crockett, I've set aside

182
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,010
this afternoon to cook,

183
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,010
cleared my schedule.

184
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,630
You're gonna get

185
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,630
your jambalaya.

186
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,800
Okay, how are we

187
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,800
on the guest list?

188
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,110
Everybody, huddle up.

189
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,110
Get over here.

190
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,150
As you know,

191
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,150
Dr. Marcel and I

192
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,310
are hosting a crawfish

193
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,310
boil tonight,

194
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,410
and you're all coming,

195
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,410
no excuses.

196
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,350
Uh, some of us have

197
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,350
shelf exams coming up.

198
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,220
Attendance

199
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,220
is mandatory, Elsa.

200
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,420
Mandatory party?

201
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,420
MAGGIE AND MARCEL:

202
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,420
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,790
I'm sorry, you guys,

204
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,790
I'm not gonna be

205
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,790
able to make it.

206
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,700
The move back into

207
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,700
my house has been

208
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,700
really hard on Owen

209
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,270
and I'm still

210
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,270
unpacking.

211
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,670
Okay.

212
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,670
Okay, you

213
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,670
get a pass.

214
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,830
But everybody else,

215
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,830
you're coming.

216
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,830
No excuses.

217
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,880
If I can swing it after

218
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,880
a day of chemo,

219
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,380
you can, too.

220
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,280
True that.

221
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,980
Natalie, I have

222
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,980
an MVC coming in.

223
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,980
You're going to Trauma 1.

224
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,780
All right.

225
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,780
Elsa, with me.

226
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,880
Desmond,

227
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,880
what do we got?

228
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,650
Kayla Patten,

229
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,650
seven-year-old

230
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,650
unrestrained passenger,

231
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,460
head injury

232
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,460
with scalp lacs,

233
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,460
GCS 13.

234
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,730
Mom's in the

235
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,730
ambo behind.

236
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,630
All right, let's transfer

237
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,630
on my count. Ready?

238
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,630
One, two, three.

239
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,040
Airways cleared.

240
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,010
Breath sounds bilaterally.

241
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,010
All right, let's get

242
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,010
a chest and pelvis X-ray.

243
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,380
Sats 92%.

244
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,380
BP, 100 over 65.

245
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,490
Pupils are equal, round,

246
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,490
and reactive to light.

247
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,890
All right,

248
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,890
let's take down

249
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,890
that dressing

250
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,550
and see where

251
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,550
all that blood's

252
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,550
coming from.

253
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,530
I'm not seeing any other

254
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,530
major external traumas.

255
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,890
Not sure if there's active

256
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,890
bleeding or not.

257
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,530
Well, grab some saline

258
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,530
and flush it out.

259
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,090
What size syringe

260
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,090
should I use?

261
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,330
Forget that,

262
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,330
give it to me.

263
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,770
Squeeze hard.

264
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,220
Okay, I can visualize

265
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,220
the full wound.

266
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,220
It's a deep lac.

267
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,510
Galea muscle's intact.

268
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,510
Still a little bit of bleeding

269
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,510
from the skin edge.

270
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,060
All right, put some

271
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,060
pressure back on it

272
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,390
and let's get her X-ray

273
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,390
and then send her up to CT

274
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,390
for a pan scan.

275
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,520
We'll stitch

276
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,520
her up later.

277
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,520
Let's move.

278
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,220
Isn't it a bad sign

279
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,220
that she's so groggy?

280
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,600
Hopefully, it's just

281
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,600
a concussion.

282
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,200
Mom is here.

283
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,200
June Patten.

284
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,200
Stable, Baghdad.

285
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,770
All right.

286
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,140
Hi, June,

287
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,140
I'm Dr. Manning.

288
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,140
This is Ms. Curry.

289
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,270
She's a fourth year

290
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,270
medical student.

291
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,080
Where's Kayla?

292
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,080
She's stable.

293
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,710
She's up getting some X-rays

294
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,710
to make sure there's

295
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,710
no internal injuries.

296
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,550
I swear her

297
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,550
seatbelt was on

298
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,550
when I started the car.

299
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,560
Can I look at her arm?

300
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,560
Yeah, go ahead.

301
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,930
There's a deformity

302
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,930
at the elbow,

303
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,930
but neurovascular intact.

304
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,320
Let's get some X-rays.

305
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,990
I would've pulled over

306
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,990
if I'd known

307
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,990
she'd taken it off.

308
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,290
I need to see Kayla.

309
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,290
No. June, please.

310
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,100
We need to get

311
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,100
these X-rays,

312
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,100
okay?

313
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,660
You can see Kayla as soon

314
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,660
as she's back from

315
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,660
radiology. All right?

316
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,580
Thank you.

317
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,580
Step back.

318
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,610
Shooting.

319
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,980
Looks like a simple posterior

320
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,980
elbow dislocation.

321
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,960
We need to reduce it

322
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,960
to preserve blood supply.

323
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,600
50 mics of fentanyl,

324
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,600
one of versed.

325
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,160
All right, Elsa?

326
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,600
Supinate while

327
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,600
applying traction.

328
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,370
All right,

329
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,370
you almost got it.

330
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,370
A little further.

331
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,170
Okay,

332
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,170
I felt it go in.

333
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,680
All right, let's do

334
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,680
a repeat X-ray to confirm

335
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,680
and get her an immobilizer.

336
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,190
You'll be able to see Kayla

337
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,190
as soon as she's back.

338
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,620
It still hurts.

339
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,150
Some soreness is

340
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,150
to be expected,

341
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,280
but if you

342
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,280
need anything,

343
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,790
you let them know

344
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,790
and they'll page

345
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,790
me directly.

346
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,390
Hey, CeCe.

347
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,390
Hey, Maggie.

348
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,400
Come here.

349
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,130
There you go.

350
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,130
How you doing, girl?

351
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,000
Ready to get

352
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,000
off my feet

353
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,000
for a few hours.

354
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,170
Come on. Pull up

355
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,170
a chair and stay a while.

356
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,410
Morning.

357
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,410
Piper's got you.

358
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,590
I'll never get

359
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,590
used to this.

360
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,070
Kind of feels like you

361
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,070
volunteered to get your ass

362
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,070
kicked, doesn't it?

363
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,070
Sounds about right.

364
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,070
It gets better.

365
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,570
Mmm.

366
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,710
They juice yours up

367
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,710
with steroids yet?

368
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,100
Mmm-mmm.

369
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,080
Today's my first day.

370
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,910
You're gonna love it.

371
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,750
Yeah?

372
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,910
It's like getting a jolt

373
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,910
of rocket fuel

374
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,910
right when you need it.

375
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,250
Oh!

376
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,120
I could use that.

377
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,520
You look pretty

378
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,520
good to me.

379
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,390
I'm sorry.

380
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,390
I'm Ben.

381
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,430
Maggie... Lockwood.

382
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,130
Nice to meet

383
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,130
you, Maggie.

384
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,870
And I'll be right here

385
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,870
in case you need

386
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,870
any more silver linings.

387
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,140
Glad I know

388
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,140
where to find you, Ben.

389
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,880
Gina Todd?

390
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,080
Hi, I'm Dr. Choi.

391
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,810
I recognize

392
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,810
that jacket.

393
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,810
Army, huh?

394
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,260
That's right.

395
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,260
He's in the Navy.

396
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,390
It's kind

397
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,390
of his thing.

398
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,290
I get it. Wear it

399
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,290
loud and proud.

400
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,630
So, what's

401
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,630
going on, Gina?

402
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,160
I have this infection

403
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,160
in my arm

404
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,670
where my prosthesis

405
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,670
is connected.

406
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm getting treatment

407
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,600
at Walter Reed,

408
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,600
but this is killing me.

409
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,740
I've never seen

410
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,740
a prosthetic

411
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,740
device like this.

412
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,970
Most move

413
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,970
at just one joint,

414
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,740
but this looks

415
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,740
so much

416
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,740
more complex.

417
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,680
One-of-a-kind,

418
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,680
I think.

419
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,740
Tons of R&D went

420
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,740
into this thing.

421
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,650
Looks like something

422
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,650
from the future.

423
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,280
Yeah, check this out.

424
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,030
How are you

425
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,030
able to do that?

426
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,130
Three years of interfacing

427
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,130
the arm with my nerves.

428
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,330
So, it's wired

429
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,330
to your

430
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,330
nervous system?

431
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,210
You're controlling that

432
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,210
with your brain?

433
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,510
Let's take a look

434
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,510
at this infection,

435
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,510
all right?

436
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm feeling

437
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,160
much better.

438
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,190
Good.

439
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,190
I think I'm ready

440
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,190
to go home.

441
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,520
Is this necessary?

442
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,970
We haven't met.

443
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,970
I'm Dr. Halstead.

444
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,970
Kirsten.

445
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,660
And you are...

446
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,660
She's my girlfriend.

447
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,230
I see.

448
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,170
So, Tom...

449
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,810
Unfortunately, your test

450
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,810
results show you're in

451
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,810
acute liver failure,

452
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
which is causing

453
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
bleeding

454
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
in your stomach.

455
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,240
Can we go now?

456
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,410
No, Tom needs

457
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,410
to be treated.

458
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,820
If not, he could

459
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,820
wind up in

460
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,820
end-stage liver failure.

461
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,720
End-stage?

462
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,720
Be quiet.

463
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,820
Treated? What exactly

464
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,820
does that entail?

465
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,160
For starters, I need

466
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,160
to run some more tests

467
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,220
to find out

468
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,220
what's causing

469
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,220
the liver failure.

470
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,500
No, unhook him

471
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,500
from all of this.

472
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,500
We're going.

473
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,360
Whoa...

474
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,910
Wait a minute.

475
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,910
Tom, what

476
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,910
do you want?

477
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,070
Get up. We'll go.

478
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,580
I wanna leave.

479
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,780
I strongly

480
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,780
advise you not to.

481
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,020
Let's go, Tom. Get up.

482
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,890
Hold on,

483
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,890
before you can leave,

484
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,720
you have to sign

485
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,720
an AMA form.

486
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,920
Then get it.

487
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,940
It took me three months

488
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,940
just to tap my finger.

489
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,970
It's a frustrating

490
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,970
process.

491
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,210
For a while there,

492
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,210
it felt like

493
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,210
I'd signed up

494
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,150
for a billion-dollar

495
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,150
backscratcher.

496
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,280
You seem pretty

497
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,280
well-acclimated now.

498
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,320
Yeah, now.

499
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,380
Sucks getting trapped

500
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,380
under an exploded Humvee,

501
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,290
but it's pretty cool

502
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,290
I get to be

503
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,290
the Bionic Woman.

504
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,160
Let's start Gina

505
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,160
on IV clindamycin,

506
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,160
600 milligrams.

507
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,460
My doc had me

508
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,460
on Augmentin.

509
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,170
Let's try something

510
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,170
a little different.

511
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,600
Let's get

512
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,600
a CT scan, too,

513
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,930
see if the infection

514
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,930
has spread into any

515
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,930
deep spaces.

516
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,100
Okay.

517
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,100
What if it has?

518
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Could require

519
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
surgery to clean it out.

520
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,670
Who's your doctor

521
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,670
at Walter Reed?

522
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,800
I need to loop them in.

523
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,270
It's Dr. Flanagan.

524
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,910
Um...

525
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,420
But the thing is,

526
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,420
I flew in this weekend

527
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,420
for my sister's wedding.

528
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,810
I wasn't really

529
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,810
supposed to travel.

530
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,450
The Army doesn't

531
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,450
like their toys

532
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,450
taken out of the box.

533
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,590
So, they don't even

534
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,590
know you're here.

535
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,690
You're AWOL.

536
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,630
I know how it sounds,

537
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,630
but it's my little

538
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,630
sister's wedding

539
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,800
and I'm her

540
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,800
maid of honor.

541
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,100
I'll be back in Bethesda

542
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,100
first thing Monday.

543
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,010
I'd really appreciate if we

544
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,010
could keep the military

545
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,010
out of this if possible.

546
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,640
We'll respect

547
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,640
your privacy.

548
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,840
It's like I tell all

549
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,840
my students at the start

550
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,840
of each year.

551
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,120
"It won't always be easy,

552
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,120
but it will be worth it

553
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,120
in the end."

554
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,360
And does that

555
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,360
work on them?

556
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,060
Not really. Ten-year-olds

557
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,060
have a hard time

558
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,060
seeing past recess.

559
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,490
But I say it anyway,

560
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,830
just to remind myself

561
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,830
as the school

562
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,830
year rolls on.

563
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,240
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

564
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,240
Can I get either

565
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,240
of you anything?

566
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,840
No, thanks.

567
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,840
I'm good, CeCe.

568
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,670
Okay, we have some

569
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,670
really good cookies.

570
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,410
We have chocolate chip,

571
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,410
we have macadamia...

572
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,000
I think I'll take

573
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,000
one of those.

574
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay, right over there.

575
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,550
Yeah, maybe

576
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,550
I'll stretch my legs.

577
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,980
All right.

578
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
I cannot believe

579
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
you're not breaking

580
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
a sweat.

581
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,090
Why?

582
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,930
I'm having a hot flash

583
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,930
just watching y'all two.

584
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,930
Oh, CeCe...

585
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,930
Did you ask him out yet?

586
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,200
I'm not gonna hit on

587
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,200
some guy getting

588
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,200
chemotherapy next to me.

589
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,100
Technically, you've been

590
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,100
hitting on him

591
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,100
the entire time.

592
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,070
CeCe, this is

593
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,070
not the place

594
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,070
to meet somebody.

595
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,410
Okay, so, if you met him

596
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,410
in a Starbucks, would you

597
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,410
ask him out then?

598
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,370
CeCe, please.

599
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,780
Look, I'm not telling you

600
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,780
your business,

601
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,410
but that man

602
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,410
is fine as hell.

603
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,280
Ask him out.

604
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,280
What are you

605
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,280
waiting for?

606
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,020
I couldn't decide on

607
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,020
which one to get,

608
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,020
so, I thought maybe,

609
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,120
if you'd be willing

610
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,120
to share, we could

611
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,120
both live like kings.

612
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,090
What do you say?

613
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,120
Mmm.

614
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,400
Thank you.

615
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,910
You know, I should

616
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,910
probably eat an

617
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,910
actual lunch after this.

618
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,570
But

619
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,710
problem is...

620
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,320
What's the problem?

621
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,250
I don't like to eat alone.

622
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,120
What are you up to?

623
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,590
Stop...

624
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,400
Something's wrong! Help!

625
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,670
Someone,

626
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,670
please get in here!

627
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,400
Sats are

628
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,400
down to 84.

629
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,400
Kayla?

630
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,840
Kayla? Her GCS is worse.

631
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,410
She's not protecting

632
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,410
her airway.

633
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,350
All right, bag her

634
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,350
while I get

635
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,350
an intubation kit.

636
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,580
What does that mean?

637
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,580
What's happening?

638
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,740
She's not breathing

639
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,740
on her own

640
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,740
and she needs help.

641
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,190
Ms. Patten, why don't

642
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,190
you come with me?

643
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,310
I'm not

644
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,310
leaving her.

645
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,290
Please, let's

646
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,290
give the doctors

647
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,290
some room.

648
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,480
Hyperventilate her.

649
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,920
Sats are going back up.

650
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,590
All right, good.

651
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,590
Why don't you intubate?

652
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,930
Etomidate and sux.

653
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,030
Are you ready?

654
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,030
Yep.

655
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,440
Pressing and lifting.

656
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,710
Okay, you see

657
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,710
the cords?

658
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,150
No...

659
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,650
Get the tube.

660
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,650
I'll hold down.

661
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,190
All right, go nice and slow,

662
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,190
okay? We've got time.

663
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,190
Don't worry.

664
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,030
Push a little.

665
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,030
Over there, yeah.

666
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,350
Okay, I'm in.

667
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,350
All right.

668
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,630
Bag her.

669
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,560
Why are her sats dropping?

670
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,900
Probably in the stomach.

671
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,900
I'll do it.

672
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,300
All right.

673
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,300
Take off the bag.

674
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,980
Yep, I'm in. Bag.

675
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,010
Eighty-eight,

676
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,010
92, we're good.

677
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,640
All right, get her on a vent

678
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,640
and get Mom back in here.

679
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,550
Look, it was your first time

680
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,550
intubating a child.

681
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,390
It happens.

682
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,390
Don't beat yourself up.

683
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,690
I'm not.

684
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,690
I am a medical student.

685
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,250
This is supposed to be

686
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,250
a learning experience.

687
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,170
Doc, could I curbside

688
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,170
you for a minute?

689
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,170
What's up?

690
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,750
So, I've got this guy

691
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,750
with liver failure

692
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,750
and hematemesis.

693
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,870
Then his girlfriend

694
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,870
shows up

695
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,180
and insists he leave

696
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,180
without getting

697
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,180
treatment.

698
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,180
That's his choice,

699
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,180
not hers, right?

700
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,420
But he's going

701
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,420
along with it.

702
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,960
She's very

703
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,960
"controlling",

704
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,960
is, I think,

705
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,960
the word you'd use.

706
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,590
Okay, well, I mean,

707
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,590
if he wants to leave,

708
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,860
there's not really

709
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,860
a whole lot we can

710
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,860
do about it, right?

711
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,960
No, you're right,

712
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,400
but there's something

713
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,400
odd going on

714
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,400
with these two.

715
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,030
They have

716
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,030
these pointy teeth,

717
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,030
like really sharp.

718
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,100
Implants

719
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,100
or something.

720
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,240
Okay, well,

721
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,240
now I'm interested.

722
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,740
Gina's CT scans.

723
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,580
It's an abscess

724
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,580
where the tissue

725
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,580
meets the prosthetic.

726
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,620
It'll require

727
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,620
surgical drainage.

728
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,750
Yeah, but let's hold off

729
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,750
before scheduling anything.

730
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,880
Why?

731
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,620
I called her doctor

732
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,620
at Walter Reed. He's coming

733
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,620
out to take a look.

734
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,390
Ethan, what?

735
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,390
She asked us to keep

736
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,390
the military out of this.

737
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,800
It's not about that.

738
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,800
She's AWOL.

739
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,340
Look, April,

740
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,340
I didn't wanna make

741
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,340
the call.

742
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,830
But Gina's health

743
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,830
has to take priority.

744
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,910
Her prosthetic is such

745
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,910
a specialized piece,

746
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,840
I need her doctor's input

747
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,840
before having it operated on.

748
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,570
But you violated

749
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,570
her HIPAA rights.

750
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,170
Actually, HIPAA makes an

751
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,170
allowance for situations

752
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,170
just like this.

753
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,120
We would contact the

754
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,120
manufacturer of a prosthetic

755
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,120
in any other scenario.

756
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,780
But in this case, the

757
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,780
manufacturer just so

758
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,780
happens to be the military.

759
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,920
What's that

760
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,920
supposed to mean?

761
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,660
Maybe you can get a little

762
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,660
overzealous when it comes

763
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,660
to the military.

764
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,620
I'm just trying to keep

765
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,620
Gina from losing

766
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,620
her arm a second time.

767
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,160
What's the worst

768
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,160
that could happen?

769
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,160
I die?

770
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,360
If you leave,

771
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,360
it's a very

772
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,360
real possibility.

773
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,670
Look, shut up, Tom.

774
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,670
Get up, we're going.

775
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,670
Whoa, hey.

776
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,210
Tom!

777
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,450
If your liver fails,

778
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,450
your brain

779
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,450
will deteriorate.

780
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,650
Your entire body

781
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,650
will swell up

782
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,650
and you will most likely

783
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,150
bleed into your

784
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,150
stomach again.

785
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,210
And that will kill you.

786
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,210
But I'm already dead.

787
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,550
Tom, don't.

788
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,390
I'm a vampire!

789
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,390
Okay, hold on.

790
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,620
Get out of our way!

791
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,620
I can't do that.

792
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,990
I gotta keep you

793
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,990
at the hospital.

794
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,190
I'm putting you

795
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,190
on an involuntary

796
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,190
psychiatric...

797
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,320
Hey!

798
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,490
Let me see it.

799
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,490
Go get them.

800
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,040
Security, stop them!

801
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,140
Hey, hey,

802
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,140
come back here!

803
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,980
Whoa, stay right there!

804
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,720
Whoa. Get him

805
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,720
out of the sun!

806
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,370
I'd treat it

807
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,370
with Silvadene.

808
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,370
Yeah.

809
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,870
This is why I wear a hood.

810
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,870
Vampires can't be

811
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,870
out in the sun.

812
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,570
Tom, there are

813
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,570
medical explanations

814
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,740
for why this is

815
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,740
happening to you

816
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,740
and I can figure this out,

817
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,750
if you just let me take

818
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,750
another blood sample.

819
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,750
So you can

820
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,750
experiment on me?

821
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,890
This is exactly

822
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,890
what Kirsten

823
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,890
said you'd do.

824
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,580
What did she

825
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,580
tell you, Tom?

826
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,020
That you'd parade me

827
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,020
out in the news,

828
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,220
claiming to be the doctors

829
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,220
who discovered

830
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,220
and cured a vampire.

831
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,260
No, we're not gonna

832
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,260
do that. We just

833
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,260
want you to get better.

834
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,960
As a vampire,

835
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,960
I get to live

836
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,960
like a god.

837
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,890
Long after you

838
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,890
become worm food,

839
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,560
Kirsten and I will

840
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,560
just be starting

841
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,560
our next chapter together.

842
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,470
Look, Tom...

843
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,470
Will, could I get

844
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,470
a minute?

845
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,470
What is with this kid?

846
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,110
Look, he's submissive.

847
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,110
He's impressionable.

848
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,580
She's essentially

849
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,580
brainwashed him.

850
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,240
As far as he's concerned,

851
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,240
he's a vampire.

852
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,650
Trying to reason with him,

853
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,650
it's a waste of time.

854
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,820
Could even be

855
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,820
counterproductive.

856
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,890
Fine, but he's

857
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,890
on a psych hold.

858
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,890
Can't you medicate him?

859
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,720
Not unless he becomes

860
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,720
acutely dangerous,

861
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,720
or we got a court order.

862
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,990
He vomited

863
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,990
a pint of blood

864
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,990
this morning.

865
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,470
He's going to bleed again

866
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,470
and it will kill him.

867
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,170
I never thought

868
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,170
I would ever eat

869
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,170
at the Rainforest Cafe.

870
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,940
Since I got

871
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,940
diagnosed,

872
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,310
I've been trying

873
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,310
to live more

874
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,310
like my fourth graders.

875
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,140
Not a care

876
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,140
in the world.

877
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,310
All they wanna do

878
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,310
is have fun.

879
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,310
Yeah.

880
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,750
But I should quit

881
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,750
taking restaurant

882
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,750
tips from them.

883
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,860
Maybe.

884
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,520
Well, this is me.

885
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,430
I had a lot of fun

886
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,430
today, Maggie.

887
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,260
Yeah.

888
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,490
Me, too.

889
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,140
Listen, um, I'm throwing

890
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,140
a party with a friend

891
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,140
from the hospital tonight.

892
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,180
A crawfish boil.

893
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,810
You should come.

894
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,810
If you're feeling

895
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,810
up to it.

896
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,890
Are you kidding me?

897
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,890
With this rocket

898
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,890
fuel in my veins.

899
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,980
It does feel pretty good.

900
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,660
You know,

901
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,660
I appreciate

902
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,660
the offer, Maggie,

903
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,460
but I really don't

904
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,460
wanna impose.

905
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,360
No, please.

906
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,670
I want you to come.

907
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,670
Okay.

908
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,970
I'd like that.

909
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,970
Okay.

910
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,580
Actually, I'm supposed

911
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,580
to make some jambalaya

912
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,580
for the party.

913
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,180
I could use

914
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,180
an extra set of hands.

915
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,720
I got hands.

916
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,020
Okay, then.

917
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,020
Come on in.

918
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,560
I'm Dr. Choi.

919
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,560
I called about

920
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,560
Sergeant Gina Todd.

921
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,900
Dr. Choi,

922
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,900
I'm Captain Sims.

923
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,600
This is Officer Miller

924
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,600
and Officer Campo,

925
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,600
Military Police.

926
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,900
Military Police?

927
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,910
I thought you said

928
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,910
you called a doctor.

929
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,440
I was expecting

930
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,440
Dr. Flanagan.

931
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,940
I don't know

932
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,940
anything about that.

933
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,740
We just came straight

934
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,740
from Fort McCoy.

935
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,370
Our orders are to

936
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,370
transport Sergeant Todd

937
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,370
back to Walter Reed.

938
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,750
As Gina's doctor,

939
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,750
I need to know the

940
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,750
plan for her treatment.

941
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,120
Any decisions pertaining to

942
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,120
Todd's care are classified.

943
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,710
Dr. Choi,

944
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,710
Treatment 5

945
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,710
needs you.

946
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,850
Excuse us.

947
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,860
She's hypotensive.

948
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,460
And her fever is spiking.

949
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,460
She's in septic shock.

950
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,460
Bolus a liter of saline.

951
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,030
Not getting a good flow.

952
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,030
Her IV's blown.

953
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,130
Do you want

954
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,130
to put a central line in?

955
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,730
No, I'm gonna drill

956
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,730
an IO in her leg.

957
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,780
It'll be faster.

958
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,780
Okay.

959
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,780
Okay, open up the fluids.

960
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,160
Mmm-hmm.

961
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,160
Okay, much better.

962
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,660
All right, she's stable,

963
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,660
but she's septic.

964
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,590
Give her a second liter

965
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,590
and hang Levophed.

966
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,660
I'm transferring Gina

967
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,660
up to one of our

968
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,660
operating rooms.

969
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,430
Her abscess needs

970
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,430
to be drained

971
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,430
immediately.

972
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,630
Sorry, Dr. Choi,

973
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,630
but Sergeant Todd is headed

974
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,630
back to Walter Reed with us.

975
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,900
Helicopter's already

976
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,900
on the way.

977
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,100
And how long will it take

978
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,100
to get there? Three hours?

979
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,100
It's too risky.

980
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,410
Gina has an infection

981
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,410
in her blood.

982
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,410
She needs surgery now.

983
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,310
We'll let the doctors

984
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,310
at Walter Reed decide that.

985
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,350
I assure you,

986
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,350
they would agree.

987
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,080
This patient

988
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,080
is not going anywhere.

989
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,590
I have orders.

990
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,590
I intend to follow them.

991
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,320
I'm getting Ms. Goodwin.

992
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,580
So,

993
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,580
after hitting the front

994
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,580
and back of her head,

995
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,180
she has what

996
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,180
we call a coup

997
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,180
contrecoup injury.

998
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,690
The foci are small,

999
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,690
but they're cumulative.

1000
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,460
I don't understand.

1001
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,300
Kayla has multiple

1002
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,300
small bruises

1003
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,300
in her brain,

1004
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,700
but none of them

1005
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,700
are big enough for me

1006
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,700
to drill and evacuate.

1007
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,630
So, what can be done?

1008
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,800
Nothing.

1009
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,440
Hopefully, with time,

1010
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,440
they'll resolve

1011
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,440
on their own.

1012
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,500
I'm sorry

1013
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,500
I don't have anything

1014
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,500
else to offer.

1015
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,350
You know,

1016
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,350
there are some things

1017
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,350
we can try

1018
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,360
to stop the bleeding

1019
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,360
from causing problems.

1020
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,680
We can raise the head

1021
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,680
of Kayla's bed

1022
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,990
and give her mannitol

1023
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,990
to decrease

1024
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,990
intracranial pressure.

1025
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,390
Do you think

1026
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,390
it will work?

1027
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,800
Statistically, it has

1028
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,800
maybe a 25% chance

1029
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,800
of changing her outcome.

1030
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,890
Oh, God.

1031
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,700
Hey, I have seen

1032
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,700
this treatment work before.

1033
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,900
Ms. Curry?

1034
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,210
Why would you

1035
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,210
say that to her?

1036
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,550
Because it's the truth.

1037
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,550
She asked.

1038
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,820
No, what she was

1039
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,820
asking for is hope,

1040
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,820
not grim statistics.

1041
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,910
How do you know that?

1042
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,020
Trust me,

1043
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,020
that's what she

1044
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,020
was asking for.

1045
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,700
Our job is to look out

1046
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,700
for the best interests

1047
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,700
of our patients.

1048
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,040
I'm sorry

1049
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,040
you had to come

1050
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,040
all the way down here.

1051
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,330
You shouldn't

1052
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,330
even be here.

1053
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,280
Look, Sergeant Todd

1054
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,280
isn't just another one

1055
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,280
of your hospital patients.

1056
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,350
She's part of

1057
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,350
a special DARPA project.

1058
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,710
They've invested

1059
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,710
a lot of time

1060
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,220
and taxpayer dollars

1061
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,220
into Gina and her arm.

1062
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,120
Unfortunately,

1063
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,120
Captain, this isn't

1064
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,120
a military base.

1065
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,020
You don't have

1066
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,020
jurisdiction here.

1067
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,950
And if you want

1068
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,950
to move this patient,

1069
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,460
you'll need a judge's

1070
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,460
court order and the

1071
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,460
local police to do it.

1072
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,260
We'll have all our ducks

1073
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,260
in a row by the time

1074
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,260
our chopper arrives.

1075
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,890
Until then,

1076
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,890
out of consideration

1077
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,890
of our other patients,

1078
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,900
do you mind stepping

1079
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,900
into the waiting room?

1080
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,900
Thank you.

1081
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,930
Ms. Goodwin, we cannot

1082
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,930
let them take her.

1083
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,930
She's septic.

1084
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,700
Well, what can be

1085
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,700
done right now?

1086
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,470
If we can drain her abscess,

1087
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,470
we can remove the source

1088
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,470
of her infection.

1089
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,880
But I will need

1090
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,880
a surgeon to do it.

1091
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,780
I can take her up

1092
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,780
to the surgical floor

1093
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,780
in the meantime.

1094
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,080
Well, move fast,

1095
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,080
because if they get

1096
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,080
that court order,

1097
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,950
there's nothing

1098
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,950
that any of us

1099
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,950
can do to stop them.

1100
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,900
Hey, I'm worried about this.

1101
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,900
I'm gonna be fine.

1102
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,960
Took a bunch of

1103
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,960
antibiotics, you know,

1104
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,960
a fistful of ibuprofen.

1105
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,100
I can't feel a thing.

1106
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,970
I get the feeling

1107
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,970
it's gonna be

1108
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,970
a late night.

1109
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,510
Maybe we should

1110
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,510
cancel our reservation.

1111
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,980
No way. Alinea,

1112
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,980
are you kidding me?

1113
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
We could get another

1114
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
dinner reservation,

1115
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,840
but who knows when

1116
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,840
you're gonna get another

1117
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,840
vampire in the ED?

1118
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,150
If only I could figure out

1119
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,150
how to talk to this guy,

1120
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,150
how to get through to him.

1121
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,580
You can talk to anybody.

1122
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,520
That's why I love you

1123
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,520
so much. Even vampires.

1124
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,660
What?

1125
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,660
Keep the reservation.

1126
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,130
First of all, Tom,

1127
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,130
I would like to apologize.

1128
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,870
Clearly,

1129
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,870
you are a vampire.

1130
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,200
It's just that

1131
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,200
we've never

1132
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,200
treated one before,

1133
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,710
and so, it's our mistake.

1134
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,440
And I'm sorry.

1135
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,440
You must be

1136
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,440
getting hungry.

1137
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,880
Would you like me

1138
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,880
to contact

1139
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,880
the blood bank or...

1140
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,950
You're messing with me.

1141
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,720
It's just

1142
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,720
like Kirsten said.

1143
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,650
Doctors can't

1144
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,650
be trusted.

1145
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,690
Yeah, Kirsten.

1146
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,690
Where's Kirsten?

1147
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,230
Is she out in

1148
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,230
the waiting room?

1149
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,960
No.

1150
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,960
She left.

1151
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,990
Tom, do you mind me

1152
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,990
asking how long have

1153
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,990
you two been together?

1154
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,130
Eight, nine months.

1155
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,540
I'm just curious

1156
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,540
because, well,

1157
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,730
I mean,

1158
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,730
if you'll forgive me,

1159
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,830
it seems like she

1160
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,830
kind of abandoned you.

1161
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,140
She had to.

1162
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,870
But to the very

1163
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,870
people who she said

1164
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,870
were so dangerous?

1165
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,040
You chased her away!

1166
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,650
She'll come back for me.

1167
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,840
Tonight.

1168
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,020
Well, hopefully,

1169
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,390
but I mean,

1170
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,390
even if she does,

1171
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,220
doesn't it bother

1172
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,220
you a bit that,

1173
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,420
I don't know,

1174
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,420
that she put

1175
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,420
herself first?

1176
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,090
I think you

1177
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,090
deserve someone

1178
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,090
who puts you first.

1179
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,700
You know? I mean,

1180
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,700
someone who loves you.

1181
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,840
Because if Kirsten did...

1182
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,040
I mean, I don't know.

1183
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,040
Why isn't she here?

1184
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,580
Give us a chance

1185
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,580
to help you.

1186
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,580
Let me run some tests.

1187
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,030
I just pulled

1188
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,030
a 14-hour shift.

1189
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,390
Can't someone

1190
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,390
from ortho do it?

1191
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,520
Already tried,

1192
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
but they say

1193
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
it's a soft tissue

1194
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
general surgery case.

1195
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,700
Crockett, please.

1196
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,530
We are one court order away

1197
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,530
from losing this patient

1198
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,530
to the Military Police.

1199
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,040
We have minutes,

1200
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,040
not hours.

1201
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,740
Us versus them, huh?

1202
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,540
Will you assist?

1203
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,710
All right, then.

1204
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,710
Let's go.

1205
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,240
Game on.

1206
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,280
Now, what's

1207
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,280
happening?

1208
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,950
Blood pressure's

1209
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,950
200 over 70,

1210
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,950
heart rate's 40s.

1211
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,290
She's going to arrest.

1212
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,290
Call a code.

1213
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,220
Code Blue!

1214
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,220
Please, do something.

1215
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,390
Help her!

1216
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,390
Ms. Patten...

1217
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,660
No, I won't go!

1218
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,060
It's okay.

1219
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,060
She's bradying.

1220
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,230
Swelling must be

1221
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,230
causing increased

1222
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,230
intracranial pressure.

1223
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,600
Take her off the vent

1224
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,600
and bag her.

1225
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,730
Cushing reflex?

1226
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,730
Yep.

1227
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,930
Do something!

1228
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,930
We're doing

1229
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,930
everything we can.

1230
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,100
I can't find a pulse.

1231
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,230
She's asystole on the monitor.

1232
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,230
I'm starting compressions.

1233
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,470
Milligram of epi.

1234
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,340
I can't believe

1235
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,340
this is happening!

1236
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,320
Please, Kayla,

1237
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,320
please.

1238
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,850
Hold compressions.

1239
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,020
Come on, baby.

1240
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,020
Still no pulse.

1241
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,610
Continue compressions.

1242
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,610
Another milligram of epi.

1243
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,450
Baby, please.

1244
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,450
Come on...

1245
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,030
Kayla, please, please.

1246
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,030
No... Please...

1247
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,790
Pupils are blown.

1248
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,790
Stop compressions.

1249
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,130
What?

1250
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,100
Don't stop!

1251
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,100
Why are you stopping?

1252
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,600
She's still asystole.

1253
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,300
Her brain has herniated.

1254
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,300
I am so sorry, June.

1255
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,940
No!

1256
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,850
Time of death, 16:08.

1257
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,950
No! No!

1258
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,350
I'm so sorry.

1259
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,350
No!

1260
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,850
No, no, no!

1261
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,340
I've received word

1262
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,340
Captain Sims

1263
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,340
got her court order.

1264
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,810
A military helicopter

1265
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,810
is touching down

1266
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,810
on the helipad now.

1267
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,470
Thanks for the heads up.

1268
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,470
All right.

1269
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,840
Hey.

1270
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,840
Yeah?

1271
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,210
MPs are moments away

1272
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,210
from pulling the plug.

1273
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,480
How far off are you?

1274
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,310
I gotta finish scrubbing,

1275
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,310
gown, and glove up.

1276
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,310
I'd say five minutes.

1277
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,220
I'll try to

1278
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,220
buy you some time.

1279
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,860
Captain!

1280
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,060
Here's a court

1281
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,060
order, Dr. Choi.

1282
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,190
Sorry, you and your

1283
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,190
crew have to wait.

1284
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,570
Sergeant Todd

1285
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,570
is already in surgery.

1286
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,700
Then we'll get

1287
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,700
her out.

1288
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,830
The procedure

1289
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,830
won't take long.

1290
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,600
You'll be on your

1291
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,600
way in a little over

1292
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,600
an hour, tops.

1293
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,040
Your role in this

1294
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,040
is over. Step aside.

1295
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,710
You interrupt that surgery

1296
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,710
and you'll be putting

1297
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,710
Gina's life at risk.

1298
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,610
I have my orders to

1299
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,610
bring her back ASAP.

1300
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,240
Are your orders

1301
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,240
to bring her

1302
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,240
back dead?

1303
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,680
Because that's exactly

1304
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,680
what you'll be doing.

1305
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,220
We'll see what

1306
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,220
DOD says.

1307
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,630
Thank you for

1308
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,630
sticking around

1309
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,630
to do this.

1310
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,070
I can refuse

1311
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,070
you nothing,

1312
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,070
Nurse Sexton.

1313
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,710
Irrigation.

1314
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,130
You're not really

1315
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,130
here because of me.

1316
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,610
Well... I do love

1317
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,610
a good race.

1318
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,410
You ever had

1319
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,410
a Sazerac, Sexton?

1320
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,410
What is that?

1321
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,320
My favorite cocktail.

1322
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,320
New Orleans special.

1323
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,790
I'll make you

1324
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,790
one tonight.

1325
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,890
Hey, Tom?

1326
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,330
What can I do for you?

1327
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,930
I'm not feeling good.

1328
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,930
I'm sick.

1329
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,470
Yes, you are.

1330
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,970
And I can help,

1331
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,970
but only if

1332
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,970
you'll let me.

1333
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,310
I've been texting Kirsten.

1334
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,240
She's not answering.

1335
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,680
When I call, it goes

1336
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,680
straight to voicemail.

1337
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,940
I think she blocked me.

1338
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,860
She's not coming

1339
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,860
back, is she?

1340
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,830
I'm sorry.

1341
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,100
I never felt more alive

1342
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,470
than when I was with her.

1343
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,340
Imagine the most exciting

1344
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,340
woman you ever met

1345
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,340
choosing you

1346
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,480
to go with her on an

1347
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,480
extraordinary trip

1348
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,380
that lasts forever.

1349
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,350
Must have felt

1350
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,350
pretty special.

1351
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,490
She could've

1352
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,490
picked anyone,

1353
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,490
but she picked me.

1354
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,670
And now...

1355
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,460
This is probably hard

1356
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,460
for you to understand.

1357
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,370
Actually, Tom,

1358
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,370
I know exactly where

1359
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,370
you're coming from.

1360
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,470
Was it all a lie?

1361
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,410
I feel so stupid.

1362
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,390
How about we focus

1363
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,390
on getting you

1364
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,390
feeling better?

1365
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,220
Okay.

1366
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,330
Okay.

1367
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,400
So, the abscess

1368
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,400
was drained. No damage

1369
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,400
to the prosthetic,

1370
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,940
and hopefully not

1371
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,940
the patient's

1372
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,940
implanted nerve endings.

1373
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,440
Thank you, Dr. Marcel.

1374
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,440
Captain Sims and her team

1375
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,440
will be transporting

1376
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,710
Sergeant Todd to

1377
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,710
Walter Reed via

1378
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,710
helicopter immediately.

1379
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,440
Okay, just make sure

1380
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,440
the patient receives

1381
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,080
the proper post-op fluids

1382
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,080
and meds in transit, okay?

1383
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,080
All right.

1384
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,120
That poor woman.

1385
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,030
She's gonna pull through.

1386
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,270
Yeah, but we have

1387
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,270
no idea what the

1388
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,270
Army will do to her.

1389
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,030
It didn't have

1390
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,030
to go down

1391
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,030
like this, Ethan.

1392
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,810
If you had

1393
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,810
just listened.

1394
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,210
Elsa?

1395
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,920
You okay?

1396
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,460
People make assumptions

1397
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,460
about me.

1398
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,590
Okay, but they're wrong.

1399
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,590
I mean, I'm not

1400
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,590
some kind of a robot.

1401
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,720
I have feelings.

1402
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,400
Okay, well,

1403
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,400
that's a good thing.

1404
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,560
No, you don't understand.

1405
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,770
They're so powerful,

1406
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,330
I feel like if I didn't

1407
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,330
hold them all in,

1408
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,780
I have no idea what

1409
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,780
would happen.

1410
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,610
You're afraid of

1411
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,610
being overwhelmed?

1412
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,810
Yes, yes. I couldn't stand

1413
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,810
watching that mother

1414
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,810
lose her daughter today.

1415
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,020
I do understand, Elsa.

1416
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,850
But those feelings

1417
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,850
that seem so frightening,

1418
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,120
ultimately,

1419
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,120
they will become

1420
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,420
one of your

1421
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,420
greatest assets

1422
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,420
as a doctor.

1423
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,790
I don't know.

1424
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,530
What have you

1425
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,530
got going on tonight?

1426
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,540
CeCe got reservations

1427
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,540
at Alinea. I think I might

1428
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,540
just make it, too.

1429
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,110
Any luck?

1430
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,110
Tom has hepatitis C.

1431
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,870
You got him

1432
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,870
to take the test?

1433
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,380
He needed a little

1434
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,380
more time to think

1435
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,380
about what you said.

1436
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,540
Huh.

1437
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,780
Is this your vampire?

1438
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,010
Does that explain

1439
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,010
why he blistered

1440
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,010
in the sun?

1441
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,980
Yes. Liver

1442
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,980
failure combined

1443
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,220
with hepatitis can

1444
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,220
cause porphyria

1445
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,220
cutanea tarda.

1446
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,560
Makes it so

1447
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,560
sun exposure causes

1448
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,560
painful skin lesions.

1449
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,150
And since hepatitis

1450
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,150
is transmitted

1451
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,150
through bodily fluids,

1452
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,620
probably got it

1453
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,620
from having sex

1454
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,620
with his girlfriend.

1455
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,830
Or from sucking

1456
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,830
her blood. Yikes.

1457
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,800
Wait, didn't that

1458
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,800
woman bite you?

1459
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,670
Yeah, Dr. Charles,

1460
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,670
you need to get tested.

1461
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,800
First thing

1462
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,800
in the morning.

1463
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,970
Given the risk

1464
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,970
of transmission,

1465
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,510
you should have your

1466
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,510
blood drawn ASAP.

1467
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,310
You mean

1468
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,310
like right now?

1469
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,310
Now.

1470
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,510
You're kidding me.

1471
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,860
Dr. Halstead,

1472
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,860
anything else?

1473
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,220
No, I'm gonna get

1474
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,220
Tom started

1475
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,220
on antivirals.

1476
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,690
Come and get 'em!

1477
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,830
Don't be afraid to get

1478
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,830
your hands dirty now!

1479
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,910
So sorry. Yeah.

1480
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,440
Oh!

1481
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,680
April, this is Ben,

1482
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,680
my date.

1483
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,080
Hello, Ben.

1484
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,080
Nice to meet you.

1485
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,180
Oh! Maggie,

1486
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,180
where's the

1487
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,180
jambalaya?

1488
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,280
Sorry,

1489
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,280
there isn't any,

1490
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,520
but I brought

1491
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,520
rotisserie chicken

1492
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,520
already cooked.

1493
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,180
You realize that

1494
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,180
supermarket chicken

1495
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,060
is not generally served

1496
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,060
at a crawfish boil?

1497
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,290
All right, well,

1498
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,290
glad I made extra

1499
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,290
red beans and rice.

1500
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,230
Put 'em in

1501
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,230
the kitchen.

1502
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,230
Let's go.

1503
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,100
I got them.

1504
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,100
Thank you.

1505
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,370
After all the grief

1506
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,370
you gave us this morning,

1507
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,370
you show up late?

1508
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,910
Got a little busy

1509
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,910
this afternoon.

1510
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,200
Oh!

1511
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,810
Not that busy.

1512
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,480
Maybe that busy.

1513
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,650
Hi, Elsa.

1514
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,920
Dr. Halstead.

1515
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,060
Oh, come on.

1516
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,160
I think you can

1517
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,160
call me Will.

1518
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,230
Okay.

1519
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,400
So, how you doing?

1520
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,270
You don't have to

1521
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,270
be nice to me.

1522
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,500
I know.

1523
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,410
So, I've never been

1524
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,410
to a crawfish

1525
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,410
boil before.

1526
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,910
I'm a little

1527
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,910
out of my element.

1528
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,070
Um...

1529
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,840
I can show you

1530
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,840
how to do it.

1531
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:16,520
Okay, so, as far

1532
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:16,520
as I understand it,

1533
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:16,520
you pull off the head

1534
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,090
and then you

1535
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,090
squeeze the tail

1536
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,090
to get the meat out.

1537
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,690
Wow...

1538
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,360
I take it you've

1539
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,360
been to a few of these.

1540
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,960
It's all on YouTube.

1541
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Good to know.

1542
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,270
I knew crawfish was spicy,

1543
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,270
but my mouth is on fire.

1544
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,100
A little bit of Sazerac

1545
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,100
should help.

1546
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,720
Absinthe rinse,

1547
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,720
rye, bitters, sugar.

1548
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,710
Ain't nothing to it.

1549
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,460
So, how is it?

1550
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,460
It's good.

1551
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,390
It doesn't taste strong.

1552
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,660
I assure you, it is.

1553
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,990
Mmm.

1554
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,460
Okay, my lips

1555
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,460
are still tingling.

1556
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,600
Ethan.

1557
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,560
Hey.

1558
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,900
Can I talk to you?

1559
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,690
April, I'm sorry

1560
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,690
about today.

1561
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,800
You know I can be kind

1562
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,800
of a hardass sometimes.

1563
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,300
And when I think I know

1564
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,300
what should be done,

1565
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,300
I have trouble

1566
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,300
stepping back.

1567
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,270
Okay.

1568
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,210
What I'm saying is...

1569
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,380
I love you.

1570
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,110
And I need to

1571
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,110
respect your wishes.

1572
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,290
So, no more

1573
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,290
ovulation chart

1574
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,290
or schedules.

1575
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,620
Let's just see

1576
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,620
what happens.

1577
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,060
Forgive me?

1578
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,660
Yes.
