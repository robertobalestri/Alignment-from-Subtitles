1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,060
I think

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,060
you killed my father.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,970
Give me an hour to get

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,970
to O'Hare. You'll never

5
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,970
see me again.

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,030
No.

7
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,030
We could've been so happy.

8
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,540
No! No, no, no,

9
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,540
no, no, no, no.

10
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,870
I need help in here!

11
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,840
I'm leaving Med. I...

12
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,840
I'm never gonna be able to

13
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,840
get past what happened here.

14
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,510
I need a fresh start.

15
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,010
I heard Dr. Manning

16
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,010
was in an accident?

17
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,550
Dr. Marcel.

18
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,550
Who are you?

19
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,150
I'm her fiancÃ©.

20
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,520
I'm so sorry, Natalie.

21
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,960
What are you doing here?

22
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,420
I don't want you coming

23
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,420
around here again.

24
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,490
We're getting married.

25
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,490
What?

26
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,720
I don't remember you

27
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,720
asking me to marry you.

28
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,220
You will.

29
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,730
They found a mass.

30
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,730
Metastatic adenocarcinoma.

31
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,270
I don't want anyone to know.

32
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,440
I don't wanna be

33
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,440
the sick person.

34
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,740
God, when is it

35
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,740
gonna stop?

36
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,820
Hey, um, I'm sorry.

37
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,820
I think it's empty.

38
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,980
Oh. Hold on, I need

39
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,980
to get you unhooked.

40
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,350
I just don't wanna

41
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,350
be late for work.

42
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,420
Work? You just got

43
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,420
a bag of chemo.

44
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,260
You need to go home

45
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,260
and get some rest.

46
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,260
Uh-uh. It's my friend's first

47
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,260
day back after an injury.

48
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,060
And besides I have

49
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,060
an ED to run.

50
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,830
At Med?

51
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,830
Yeah.

52
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,600
They have a huge

53
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,600
infusion center.

54
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,540
You don't have to come

55
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,540
all the way over here.

56
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,580
I like to keep things

57
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,580
separate. And besides,

58
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,010
I love what you're

59
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,010
doing with the donuts.

60
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,780
Careful if you're driving.

61
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,780
Roads are a mess.

62
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,250
Yeah, thanks!

63
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,860
The third year

64
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,860
of med school will not only be

65
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,290
the most difficult

66
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,290
of your lives,

67
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,220
but also the most important.

68
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,960
Anyone know how many patients

69
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,960
come through our ED

70
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,960
in a single year?

71
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,800
105,000. It's 18,000 acute,

72
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,800
and 4,600 active traumas.

73
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,460
That's right.

74
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,800
You thinking about

75
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,800
going into ED med?

76
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,270
Is there anything else?

77
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,630
Anyway, for each of you,

78
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,640
the ED will be

79
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,640
both a challenge

80
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,640
and an opportunity

81
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,180
to sharpen your skills.

82
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,520
He loves giving this

83
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,520
lecture, doesn't he?

84
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,280
He's the only one

85
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,280
who volunteers.

86
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,280
Every single year.

87
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,620
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought

88
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,620
I had a patient.

89
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,920
Hmm?

90
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,250
Are you okay?

91
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,760
Yeah, just got shanghaied

92
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,760
onto the day shift.

93
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,770
Late nights, a little

94
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,770
pick-me-up.

95
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,460
Crockett Marcel,

96
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,460
fourth year, surgery.

97
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,460
Oh.

98
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,430
Noah Sexton.

99
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,770
Nice to meet you,

100
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,770
Noah Sexton. You mind?

101
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,700
Sure.

102
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,070
Teamwork.

103
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,180
So, future ED doctor,

104
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,180
I presume?

105
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,310
No. I mean, yes. But...

106
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,550
Well, my real plan

107
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,550
is to open some Urgent Cares

108
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,550
after residency

109
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,180
and try to build a brand.

110
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,180
Maybe take it public.

111
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,330
Sounds ambitious.

112
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,990
Then again...

113
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,360
I don't even know how

114
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,360
you folks manage to start

115
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,360
so soon after last call.

116
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,000
Hmm. Well,

117
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,000
see you around.

118
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,970
Oh-ho-ho!

119
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,970
First day of school.

120
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,050
Dang, how long we

121
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,050
been doing this for?

122
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,170
Long enough, you should know

123
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,170
to get a better umbrella.

124
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,190
Are you aware that in some

125
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,190
cultures, a downpour

126
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,490
is considered

127
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,490
very good luck?

128
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,490
Really?

129
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,050
Yeah.

130
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,050
Which cultures?

131
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,150
I don't know.

132
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,150
Dry places? Yemen?

133
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,590
Oh!

134
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,430
Relax.

135
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,430
The power must've gone out.

136
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,430
The back-up generator's

137
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,430
kicking in.

138
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,370
I better go

139
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,370
talk engineering.

140
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,370
I'll see you later.

141
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,570
See ya.

142
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,570
We must not be moving

143
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,570
patients fast enough if they

144
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,570
had time to deliver these.

145
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,510
Nice.

146
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,380
Actually,

147
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,380
they're for Natalie.

148
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,680
They're from Phillip.

149
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,910
It's her first day

150
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,910
back and all.

151
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,790
Oh.

152
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,160
Well, I'm sure

153
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,160
they'll look great

154
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,160
on her kitchen table.

155
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,250
Yeah.

156
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,940
Usually, we would...

157
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,940
Dr. Choi!

158
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,300
An ambulance skidded out

159
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,300
a couple blocks away.

160
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,300
They need help.

161
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,870
I'm on it.

162
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,870
Me too.

163
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,640
You in?

164
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,640
Yeah.

165
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,930
Hey, Capp!

166
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,930
Anybody hurt?

167
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,410
Driver here is okay.

168
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,410
That the ambo?

169
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,110
Patient's stable, older guy

170
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,110
with chest pain.

171
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,110
But the paramedic got it bad.

172
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,620
He still in there?

173
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,620
We're getting him out now.

174
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,900
Help!

175
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,910
Hang on!

176
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,900
Please!

177
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,410
All right.

178
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,410
Nice and easy.

179
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,510
Is anyone injured?

180
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,620
Ready? One, two, three.

181
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,590
Got him.

182
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,420
Darren?

183
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,090
Darren, what happened?

184
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,960
I smashed my hip.

185
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,100
One to ten, how's the pain?

186
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,100
Oh, man, it's a ten.

187
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,230
He's tachycardic

188
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,230
and his pulse is thready.

189
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,230
You think it's broken?

190
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,040
God!

191
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,540
We gotta go.

192
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,540
Let's go, let's go!

193
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,340
Hang in there, Darren.

194
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,340
We're getting you to Med.

195
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,610
Darren. Darren?

196
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,610
What's happening?

197
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,670
He's bleeding out

198
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,670
into his pelvis.

199
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,670
We gotta go! Easy, easy.

200
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,380
This is Mister Lentz.

201
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,480
Mr. Lentz. What's going on?

202
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,020
Pain in my chest.

203
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,490
It's all right. We got you.

204
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,660
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

205
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,120
Come on. Come on,

206
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,120
come on, come on.

207
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,120
Yeah.

208
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,660
Let's go!

209
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,870
Baghdad.

210
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,310
Pressure in two units O

211
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,310
positive, get a pelvic binder,

212
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,310
then activate the MTP.

213
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,510
Tachycardic and hypotensive.

214
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,510
Steve, what's your plan?

215
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,180
Bind his pelvis,

216
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,180
we need X-rays

217
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,180
and CT to confirm,

218
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,050
then interventional radiology

219
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,050
to embolize the bleeders.

220
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,150
Good. Let's transfer

221
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,150
on my count.

222
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,290
Everybody ready?

223
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,290
Yeah.

224
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,900
One, two, three.

225
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,760
Trauma labs, ABG,

226
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,760
chest and pelvic X-ray.

227
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,390
Pelvic binder.

228
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,390
Blood's on the way.

229
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,760
Okay, let's get ready to roll.

230
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,760
Yeah.

231
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,890
Roll.

232
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,700
Tell me as soon as you get

233
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,700
the scans. I'll let IR know

234
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,700
we're coming up.

235
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,930
Okay.

236
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,440
Back.

237
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,910
Okay, he's good. Bolus a liter

238
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,910
of saline. I think we're gonna

239
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,910
be in good shape.

240
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,420
Hold on. Let me get you guys

241
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,420
some dry scrubs.

242
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,050
No, no, no. I'm fine.

243
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,910
Oh, look who decided

244
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,910
to show up!

245
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,910
Hey!

246
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,620
Must be good to be back.

247
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,280
Much better than

248
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,280
sitting around at home.

249
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,280
I bet.

250
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,450
How's Phillip?

251
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,080
Phillip's great.

252
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,120
He's been really

253
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,120
helping out with Owen,

254
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,560
giving me time

255
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,560
to heal and rest.

256
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,560
But?

257
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,750
But what?

258
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,920
Nat...

259
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,500
Well, Dr. Abrams said that

260
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,500
I would have memory loss.

261
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,270
And that the loss might

262
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,270
include some feelings.

263
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,110
I don't know, I guess I'm just

264
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,110
excited for them to come back.

265
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,770
Yeah.

266
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,080
Anyway, how are you?

267
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,080
How was your vacation?

268
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,850
Oh, it was just fine.

269
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,850
You know, just a little

270
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,850
me time to recharge.

271
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,780
Natalie!

272
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,780
Yeah.

273
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,850
It's good to see you well.

274
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,850
Thanks, Jim.

275
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,480
Four weeks, though

276
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,480
seems a little soon

277
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,430
to come back from

278
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,430
a traumatic brain injury.

279
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,790
Well, Dr. Abrams

280
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,790
did clear me.

281
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,500
Well, Sam likes to get

282
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,500
patients off his service.

283
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,500
Let's do a half-shift today.

284
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,330
H and P's only.

285
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,330
Probably best

286
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,330
just to ease back in.

287
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,840
No, I don't think

288
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,840
that's necessary.

289
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,940
Doesn't look too bad,

290
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,940
70% stenosis

291
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,940
in two vessels.

292
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,500
He's stable from the nitro,

293
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,500
so I think we can

294
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,500
treat conservatively.

295
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,380
Spoken like a true

296
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,380
future urgent care mogul.

297
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,380
See? I listen.

298
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,320
Mr. Lentz, no injuries

299
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,320
from the ambo crash, I hear.

300
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,860
Gone over your CAT. I'd like

301
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,860
to schedule you for coronary

302
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,860
artery bypass surgery.

303
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,360
Preferably today.

304
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,360
But Dr. Marcel,

305
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,360
the medicine worked.

306
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,130
I... I feel fine.

307
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,730
I understand.

308
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,730
But you did suffer

309
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,730
a heart attack this morning.

310
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,670
I'd like to prevent you

311
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,670
from having another.

312
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,900
There must be other ways.

313
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,670
We could talk about other

314
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,670
medical options. Or possibly

315
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,670
revisit a stent down the road.

316
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,550
None of which, in my opinion,

317
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,550
will solve the problem.

318
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,740
Now, I know this is not

319
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,740
what you were expecting...

320
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,980
Dr. Marcel...

321
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,150
But I do ask you

322
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,150
that you trust me

323
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,150
when I say that

324
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,490
you might be one cheeseburger

325
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,490
away from a far worse event

326
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,690
than the one you experienced

327
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,690
this morning.

328
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,190
You really think so?

329
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,430
Yes, I do.

330
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,100
Well, if...

331
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,100
If you say so.

332
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,170
Okay.

333
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,740
Good. I'll talk

334
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,740
to Dr. Latham,

335
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,740
Chief of CT Surgery,

336
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,580
and I'll get back to you

337
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,580
with those details.

338
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,260
Dr. Sexton?

339
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,360
Yeah, you kinda gave him

340
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,360
a hard sell on a surgery.

341
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,960
We should really give him

342
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,960
all his options.

343
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,130
Hold on.

344
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,530
70% stenosis on a cath

345
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,530
means a 95% blockage

346
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,530
in three dimensions.

347
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,440
Coupled with a decreased LVF,

348
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,440
I'd say his only other option

349
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,440
right now is dying.

350
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,250
Why don't you

351
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,250
come up and observe?

352
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,320
Might be illuminating.

353
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,210
Yeah, Dr. Latham?

354
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,330
Hi, Lacey, I'm Dr. Halstead,

355
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,330
this is student Dr. Curry.

356
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,330
Hi.

357
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,160
I hear you had a seizure

358
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,160
at school today?

359
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,830
Yeah. In the

360
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,830
middle of calculus.

361
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,060
Has that ever

362
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,060
happened before?

363
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,060
No.

364
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,470
Any idea what caused it?

365
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,940
Maybe the giant

366
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,940
gas leak in our school.

367
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,340
We've been smelling

368
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,340
it for weeks.

369
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,340
And no one's fixed it?

370
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,010
No. And I've

371
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,010
been getting dizzy,

372
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,110
and nauseous, and now

373
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,110
I can't stop doing this.

374
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,280
And the soccer state

375
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,280
finals are tomorrow.

376
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,910
Yeah. Is she gonna be okay?

377
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,190
The arm motions,

378
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,190
when did those start?

379
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,180
Today. After the seizure.

380
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,660
Hmm. Okay.

381
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,290
Have either of you

382
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,290
had any symptoms?

383
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,290
Nothing.

384
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,660
Do you have any history

385
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,660
of head injuries or trauma?

386
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,260
No. It's a gas leak.

387
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,260
Can't you just test the air,

388
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,260
or my blood, or something?

389
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,360
That's exactly what

390
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,360
we're gonna do.

391
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,470
Let me run some tests

392
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,470
and talk to your school

393
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,670
while Miss Curry does

394
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,670
a quick neuro exam.

395
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,710
I need to get better.

396
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,710
Understood.

397
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,280
We're gonna take

398
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,280
good care of you.

399
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,720
Hey, we didn't have

400
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,720
a nurse in there.

401
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,480
Can you get someone to

402
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,480
drop a CVC, CMP, and

403
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,480
start on IV influence.

404
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,720
I got it.

405
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,030
Hey.

406
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,960
Hey.

407
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,960
Welcome back.

408
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,230
Thanks.

409
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,870
You go away for a few weeks,

410
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,870
and everything's different.

411
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,350
Connor's left. And Ava?

412
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,350
Oh, my God...

413
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,570
Yeah. That was

414
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,570
a horrible shock.

415
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,710
Ugh.

416
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,210
You look good.

417
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,650
I mean, you know,

418
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,650
you healed up well.

419
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,980
Yeah.

420
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,660
And the concussion?

421
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,220
Yeah, I'm taking it slowly.

422
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,220
You sure?

423
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,660
Glad to have you back.

424
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
Hey. Hey, Will?

425
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,530
Yeah?

426
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,870
I'm sorry

427
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,870
you had to find out

428
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,870
the way you did.

429
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,080
About me and Phillip

430
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,080
getting engaged.

431
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,450
But I guess that's what

432
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,450
I was coming to your car

433
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,450
to tell you.

434
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,510
Right.

435
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,420
I mean, I don't remember

436
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,420
a lot from that day, but...

437
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,390
It makes sense.

438
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,800
I got a kid with

439
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,800
a gunshot wound.

440
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,800
T1. Dr. Lanik.

441
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,860
Taylor Holmes, 16, shot once

442
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,860
through the right forearm

443
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,810
and into the flank.

444
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,810
BP 130 over 60.

445
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,810
Heart rate 95.

446
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,540
They shot me.

447
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,540
Somebody shot me.

448
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,440
All right.

449
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,440
Let's move him.

450
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,440
One, two, three.

451
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,250
So what happened out there?

452
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,410
I don't know.

453
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,410
I was just waiting for

454
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,410
the bus. Am I in trouble?

455
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,250
There's no law

456
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,250
against getting shot.

457
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,320
Active bleeding

458
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,320
from his flank.

459
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,220
Let's get some

460
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,220
four-by-four dressings.

461
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,450
It's okay. I got this.

462
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,920
Does it hurt

463
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,920
anywhere else?

464
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,060
Uh-uh.

465
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,960
Can somebody call my mom?

466
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,090
Don't worry. We will.

467
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,830
Okay. Got the brachial.

468
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,830
Hemostat times two.

469
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,670
I'll apply pressure.

470
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,670
Get me some suction.

471
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,300
We're fine. Doris?

472
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,800
Hemostat.

473
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,640
See? Easy-peasy.

474
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,920
Your artery's clamped,

475
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,920
but your flank wound

476
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,920
is still bleeding.

477
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,350
So we gotta get you

478
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,350
up to surgery.

479
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,350
I need an operation?

480
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,920
Yes, you do.

481
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,920
It'll fix you up.

482
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,860
Dr. Manning will take you

483
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,860
right up in a minute.

484
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,450
You want me to

485
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,450
transfer him? Wait...

486
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,450
And write the note. Thanks.

487
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,330
All right, let's move.

488
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,340
I'll take it from here.

489
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,600
Hey, where you going?

490
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,140
Lanik's having me do transpo.

491
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,710
Are you serious?

492
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,880
Anything to keep me

493
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,880
from practicing medicine.

494
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,180
Huh. Well, welcome back,

495
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,180
Dr. Manning.

496
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,020
Thanks.

497
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,960
Any word on

498
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,960
when Dr. Latham's

499
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,960
coming back in?

500
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,890
He's still stuck in OR 12.

501
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,560
Can I get

502
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,560
some suction, please?

503
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,670
All right, then.

504
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,670
Let's suture.

505
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,400
My first day,

506
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,750
I'm taking this woman's

507
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,750
history out in the chairs,

508
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,750
when I feel this

509
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,870
warm liquid

510
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,870
all over my leg.

511
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,870
And I'm like,

512
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,480
did she just pee on me?

513
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,480
But I keep going,

514
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,480
until she says,

515
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,660
when are you gonna ask

516
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,660
about my baby?

517
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,220
And I realize that

518
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,220
her water just broke.

519
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,760
But before

520
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,760
I can say anything,

521
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,160
she passes out cold,

522
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,160
because now she's in

523
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,160
a total eclamptic crisis.

524
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,530
What... What happened?

525
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,770
Whoa.

526
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,770
Everybody, freeze.

527
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,600
Power must've gone out.

528
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,600
Those are the

529
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,600
emergency lights.

530
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,700
But the backup generator

531
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,700
should kick in any second.

532
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,350
Where are we at?

533
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,350
I got nothing.

534
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,670
Suction's out.

535
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,270
Bypass is on battery,

536
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,270
not sure how long we got.

537
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,420
Okay. I'm sure

538
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,420
somebody's working on this.

539
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,390
Be ready to

540
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,390
hand-crank the bypass.

541
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,850
You're keeping him under.

542
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,590
Can somebody get us

543
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,590
some lights?

544
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,750
We're stopped.

545
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,750
How come we're stopped?

546
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,890
I don't know.

547
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,400
Hello?

548
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,770
Is anyone out there?

549
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,040
Hello!

550
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,410
The whole hospital is gone.

551
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,410
Lights, computers,

552
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,410
imaging, Pyxis.

553
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,910
What happened to

554
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,910
the backup generator?

555
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,580
Totally flooded.

556
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,580
It's gonna take a few

557
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,580
hours to get back on.

558
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,990
All right.

559
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,990
Automatic locks'll be shut,

560
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,990
elevators jammed.

561
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,060
We'll do a sweep

562
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,060
to see if we can

563
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,060
find anyone in trouble.

564
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,280
Thank you.

565
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,380
Mags, where are we going?

566
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,380
All bets are off.

567
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,890
Take the Hybrid OR.

568
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,460
Here. You take this one.

569
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,930
Okay,

570
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,930
let's get ready to transfer.

571
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,300
Everybody ready?

572
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,300
Yeah.

573
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,170
One, two, three.

574
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,940
Mo, change to a pressure bag

575
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,940
and then send for

576
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,940
four more units.

577
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,450
You think he's

578
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,450
still losing blood?

579
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,640
Gonna find out now. You ever

580
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,640
checked abdominal pressure

581
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,640
with a Foley?

582
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,910
I've read about it.

583
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,810
It's old school.

584
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,810
Just put a catheter

585
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,810
on the bag,

586
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,650
then add a transducer

587
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,650
with a three-way tap.

588
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,120
Okay.

589
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,120
Dr. Choi,

590
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,590
April, they need you in three.

591
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,030
Okay. Hook it up

592
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,030
to the A-line transducer,

593
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,030
then watch the waveform.

594
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,620
If it gets above 30,

595
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,620
come and get me.

596
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,620
Okay.

597
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,160
Let me help you with that.

598
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,160
April.

599
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,330
I think they need all the help

600
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,330
they can get out here.

601
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,930
Steve, you good?

602
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,200
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

603
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,510
Now, see the water's coming

604
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,510
in here from the edge.

605
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,110
So, the backup generator is

606
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,110
located below a storm drain.

607
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,160
Are you serious?

608
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,160
Don't ask me.

609
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,820
Don't ask you?

610
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,820
Look, you've gotta get

611
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,820
this thing up and running.

612
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,360
Get as many men as you need.

613
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,950
Yeah, it's still gonna

614
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,950
take all day.

615
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,030
Northern Illinois Power

616
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,030
will get a spare

617
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,030
out to us before then.

618
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, this is ridiculous.

619
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,000
What is their ETA?

620
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,000
Two hours?

621
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,000
We'll have to send our

622
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,000
critical care patients out.

623
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,170
We can't.

624
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,170
Lakeshore Memorial's

625
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,170
already on bypass,

626
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,640
East Mercy's taking

627
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,640
all the overflow.

628
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,410
So we have to keep

629
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,410
a thousand sick

630
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,410
and dying patients alive

631
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,980
with no lights,

632
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,980
no medicine, no nothing?

633
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,850
Well, we'll do

634
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,850
the best we can.

635
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,910
And, Maggie, pace yourself.

636
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,910
Today's gonna be a marathon.

637
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,760
Stop cardioplegia, and

638
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,760
prepare to come off bypass.

639
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,830
Okay, removing cross clamp.

640
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,510
He's not getting enough flow

641
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,510
to his left anterior wall.

642
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,070
Can you up his output?

643
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,070
Not enough to matter.

644
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,610
Then we have to

645
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,610
continue surgery.

646
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,690
We can't arrest him again.

647
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,690
He'll never come

648
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,690
off the bypass.

649
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,250
Fine. Then we'll

650
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,250
do it off-pump.

651
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,360
But you can't sew a vessel

652
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,360
into a beating heart.

653
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,060
That's almost impossible,

654
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,060
even with electricity.

655
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,530
Graft is down.

656
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,530
We don't have a choice.

657
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,910
But, a bad anastomosis

658
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,910
and he'll clot off.

659
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,080
It'll kill him.

660
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,710
Well then, we'll just

661
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,710
have to do a good one.

662
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,120
Speaking of which,

663
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,120
do me a favor and scrub in.

664
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,110
I could use

665
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,110
the extra hands.

666
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,660
Man, I know it's hot in here,

667
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,660
but I'm kinda freezing.

668
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,330
Here.

669
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,730
Hey,

670
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,730
anybody down there?

671
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,770
Yes! Hello! I've got

672
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,770
a patient in here!

673
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,000
Here. Hang on.

674
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,000
Someone's coming, okay?

675
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,020
Natalie, what do we got?

676
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,310
He's losing blood.

677
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,310
We need to get him to surgery.

678
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,580
All right. Sit him up,

679
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,590
I'll get a sked down

680
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,590
to bring him out.

681
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,030
That...

682
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,030
That doesn't feel so good...

683
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,820
What's wrong?

684
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,460
He can't maintain

685
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,460
pressure sitting up.

686
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,520
Can he stay up long enough

687
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,520
to pull him out?

688
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,000
Taylor? Taylor. No.

689
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,000
It's not gonna happen.

690
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Get me four units

691
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
of uncrossmatched blood.

692
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,940
I need to

693
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,940
stabilize him before I...

694
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,110
Hey, you okay?

695
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,640
Yeah, Matt, I'm fine.

696
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,650
What... What happened?

697
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,650
You blacked out for a minute.

698
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,520
But we're gonna get you

699
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,520
some blood, okay?

700
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,620
All right. I'm gonna get that

701
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,620
blood to you as soon as I can.

702
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,490
Thank you.

703
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,490
Just hang in there, okay?

704
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,310
Why is this happening?

705
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,310
Finally, a doctor.

706
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,040
Have you figured out

707
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,040
what's going on?

708
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,310
No. The lab went down before

709
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,310
they could run Lacey's blood.

710
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,650
What kind of

711
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,650
a hospital is this?

712
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,650
Mom...

713
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,710
I apologize for the

714
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,710
circumstances. We're

715
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,710
trying to remedy it.

716
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,650
So, what do we do next?

717
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,650
Unfortunately,

718
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,650
we can't do much.

719
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,060
I've called Neurology,

720
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,060
but it is gonna

721
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,060
be a long wait.

722
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,890
But it's just a gas leak.

723
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,890
Please. Just give me some

724
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,890
medicine or something.

725
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,660
Treatment for inhalation

726
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,660
is supportive.

727
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,830
The symptoms,

728
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,830
they have to

729
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,830
wear off over time.

730
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,390
She doesn't have time.

731
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,390
She needs to get

732
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,390
to soccer practice.

733
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,170
Yeah. The finals

734
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,170
are tomorrow.

735
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,840
Yeah, I gotta be honest,

736
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,840
given what I'm seeing,

737
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm not optimistic

738
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,000
about you playing

739
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,000
in that game.

740
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,100
What?

741
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,110
You can't do that!

742
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,110
It's the state finals!

743
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,410
Dr. Halstead,

744
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,410
I have to play.

745
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,210
Everyone's counting on me,

746
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,210
and I have been

747
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,210
working so hard.

748
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,260
I can't let them

749
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,260
down now. I can't.

750
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,120
You need to

751
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,120
figure this out.

752
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,390
I hear ya.

753
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,390
And we are doing our best.

754
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,790
Just try to take it easy,

755
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,790
relax, and let us

756
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,790
take care of you.

757
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,430
I'm gonna find out what's

758
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,430
going on with the power,

759
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,400
and hopefully we'll have

760
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,400
some answers soon.

761
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,210
We're low on fluids.

762
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,210
Only if they need them.

763
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,210
Mags? Any word

764
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,210
on the new genny?

765
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,040
Still uptown.

766
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,040
Not even on the truck yet.

767
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,640
Be nice to get

768
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,640
the air back up, huh?

769
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,550
Yeah. I'm frying

770
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,550
like an egg.

771
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,720
Dr. Choi! It's Darren.

772
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,290
The waveform broke 30.

773
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,600
Airway pressure's too high.

774
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,600
Get me a scalpel.

775
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,730
And what's this for?

776
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,560
Abdominal compartment

777
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,560
syndrome.

778
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,670
Wait you think

779
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,670
that's all blood in there?

780
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,440
Pelvic hematoma

781
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,440
must've ruptured.

782
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,410
The pressure's so high,

783
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,410
he's not getting any blood

784
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,410
back to his heart.

785
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,510
But if we can't get him

786
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,510
upstairs to the OR how are

787
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,510
we gonna take care of him?

788
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,180
Oh, my God.

789
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,750
All right.

790
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,850
Let's bag him.

791
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,270
Hey. Hey, Steve.

792
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,270
Look at me.

793
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,100
Two more minutes, he would've

794
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,100
died. You saved his life.

795
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,160
Okay.

796
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,160
Come on.

797
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,100
Let's pack him up and build

798
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,100
a bag for those intestines.

799
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,180
Okay. Okay.

800
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,350
All right, thanks.

801
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,220
Will.

802
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,220
Yeah.

803
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,480
Your patient,

804
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,480
with the tics...

805
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,480
Yeah.

806
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,820
What are you thinking?

807
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,390
Good question. The fire

808
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,390
department just told me

809
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,390
the school is clean. So...

810
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,900
That rules out gas leak.

811
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,470
She seems pretty anxious.

812
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,470
You mind if I pop in

813
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,470
and say hi?

814
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,560
Yeah, sure.

815
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,640
I don't know if we're

816
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,640
gonna get any real answers

817
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,640
till Neuro gets here. But...

818
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,510
Dr. Halstead!

819
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,310
She's seizing.

820
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,680
It's okay, it's okay.

821
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,310
Two milligrams of Ativan IM.

822
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,750
You got it.

823
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,520
Stand aside.

824
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,720
Okay, okay, okay.

825
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,100
So, you weren't experiencing

826
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,100
any symptoms at all?

827
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,100
No warning?

828
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,440
It just came up

829
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,440
out of nowhere?

830
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,440
Yeah.

831
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,730
Huh.

832
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,550
Calculus, wow. I'm very

833
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,550
impressed that you can

834
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,550
concentrate on that right now.

835
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,710
AP test is in a week.

836
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,710
I don't have a choice.

837
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,050
I'm sure that we can arrange

838
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,050
for a medical extension,

839
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,050
under the circumstances.

840
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,020
People with medical extensions

841
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,020
don't get into Princeton.

842
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,090
I gotta...

843
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,090
I think I'm gonna puke.

844
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,630
Okay. Wait a second,

845
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,630
let me get you something.

846
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,630
Here you go.

847
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,060
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

848
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,060
You're fine.

849
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,890
I'll check back.

850
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,800
Yeah. There you go.

851
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,440
I'll be right back, okay?

852
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,280
I mean, we don't have

853
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,280
a choice, we need to

854
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,280
put them in isolation.

855
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,220
Yeah. But you don't know

856
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,220
what it is. Could be

857
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,220
environmental, or drugs...

858
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,780
Her symptoms came on

859
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,780
awfully quickly,

860
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,780
didn't they?

861
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,120
As of right now,

862
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,120
infection's top of the list.

863
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,090
All right then.

864
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,090
Start the isolation protocol.

865
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,290
Okay.

866
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,920
Maggie, I want you to put

867
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,920
another nurse on this case.

868
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,900
Sharon, everyone's

869
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,900
got too much

870
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,900
on their plate. I'm fine.

871
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,600
You had a lumpectomy for

872
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,600
breast cancer two weeks ago,

873
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,970
and now you're on chemo.

874
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,480
You're immunocompromised,

875
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,480
and we don't know

876
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,480
what these girls have.

877
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,910
I'm going to be careful.

878
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,910
Don't worry.

879
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,960
Pressure's tanking again.

880
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,430
Release the heart.

881
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,970
All right. We need an

882
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,970
intra-aortic balloon pump.

883
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,160
It's the only way

884
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,160
to hold his pressure

885
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,160
while we sew on the graft.

886
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,260
But we can't

887
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,260
X-ray to see if it's

888
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,260
in the right place...

889
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,640
So I'm gonna need you

890
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,640
to put your hand in there

891
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,540
to let me know when I'm in.

892
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,010
Don't be afraid to squeeze.

893
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,880
You feel it?

894
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,290
Nah... I don't know.

895
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,290
I think so.

896
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,890
Yeah? Okay. Turn on the pump.

897
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,530
Heart rate's down

898
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,530
to 63... 54...

899
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,730
It went up too far.

900
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,730
How high is it?

901
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,200
I don't know.

902
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,200
45.

903
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,300
We're cutting off blood to his

904
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,300
brain. I need to know.

905
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,070
Yeah, five centimeters.

906
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,070
Okay.

907
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,550
Stop the pump.

908
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,320
Okay. Turn on the pump.

909
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,180
Marty?

910
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,930
Rate and pressure are good.

911
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,090
Oh.

912
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,400
Is he gonna be okay?

913
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,770
Did he have a stroke?

914
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,530
We'll find out

915
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,530
when he wakes up.

916
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,730
Okay. Needle driver

917
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,730
back to me.

918
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,740
No, then you go back

919
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,740
and you look harder, Roger.

920
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,120
Sorry.

921
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,120
Hey, where's your stash?

922
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,850
My snacks?

923
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,850
Yeah.

924
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,950
Are you feeling okay?

925
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,550
Yeah. It's for that

926
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,550
med student, Steve.

927
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,290
He hasn't stopped for a minute

928
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,290
all day. I'm just a little

929
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,290
worried about him.

930
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,920
Here.

931
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,920
Thanks.

932
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,970
How's he doing?

933
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,410
I'm trying to warm

934
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,410
the blood up for him,

935
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,410
but his temp's down to 96,

936
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,880
and if he gets any more

937
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,880
hypothermic it's just gonna

938
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,880
make him bleed even more.

939
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,040
So I, you know,

940
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,040
I've really...

941
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,210
Well, he's stable

942
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,210
right now.

943
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,150
So why don't you take

944
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,150
a quick break, okay?

945
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,880
Aw, thanks.

946
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,080
Mmm-hmm.

947
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,580
I'm fine.

948
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,090
Just life in the ED, right?

949
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,300
Dr. Choi told you

950
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,300
his first-day pregnant

951
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,300
lady story, didn't he?

952
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,420
Yeah.

953
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,090
Yeah, it's not

954
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,090
always like that.

955
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,330
He doesn't tell stories

956
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,330
about all the earaches

957
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,330
and runny noses.

958
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,910
April, they need you

959
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,910
back in three.

960
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,570
Okay. But first,

961
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,570
get something in you.

962
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,840
No time. Vents are starting

963
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,840
to fail, and we're

964
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,840
running out of hands.

965
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,610
Where do you need me?

966
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,340
Eat, change your scrubs.

967
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,340
Then I'll find where

968
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,340
you can help out.

969
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,580
April...

970
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,280
Fine. But you're

971
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,280
going to three.

972
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,820
This is the third one.

973
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,820
We need to evacuate the ED.

974
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,600
Patient care is already

975
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,600
stretched to the limit.

976
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,600
We don't have the manpower.

977
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,300
I know what I'm asking for.

978
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,300
But are we willing to risk

979
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,300
a massive outbreak?

980
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,870
I mean, this could be

981
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,870
a superbug,

982
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,870
bacterial meningitis...

983
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,470
Yeah, but then again,

984
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,470
these young women are under

985
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,470
a phenomenal amount of stress,

986
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,010
aren't they?

987
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,010
Stress?

988
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,770
We're not

989
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,770
talking headaches

990
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,770
and fatigue here.

991
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,340
These girls are

992
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,340
having seizures...

993
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,980
Elsa?

994
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,610
Dr. Halstead?

995
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,150
Oh, no.

996
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,020
Come on, come on.

997
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,830
What happened?

998
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,830
It's okay. I'm fine. I'm fine.

999
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,730
No, you are burning up.

1000
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,730
Miss Goodwin,

1001
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,730
we need to evacuate.

1002
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,020
Okay. Do it.

1003
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,020
Wait. Wait.

1004
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,960
Thirty minutes.

1005
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,960
I need 30 minutes,

1006
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,200
and all three of them

1007
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,200
in one room.

1008
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,740
I'm sorry.

1009
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,740
Are you crazy?

1010
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,540
Look. If it's an infection,

1011
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,540
they've already all got it.

1012
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,540
Thirty minutes.

1013
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,800
Thirty minutes,

1014
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,800
Daniel. No more.

1015
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,340
Come on, Maggie.

1016
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,470
You good?

1017
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,470
Yeah.

1018
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,720
Let's go.

1019
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,830
Dr. Manning,

1020
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,830
I'm really scared.

1021
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,370
Did he get the blood?

1022
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,370
No.

1023
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,410
He said there's

1024
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,410
nothing left.

1025
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,410
Whole hospital's out.

1026
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,100
Taylor.

1027
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,840
His sats are dropping.

1028
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,840
I need to intubate now.

1029
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,780
Here you go.

1030
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,890
You want me to do it?

1031
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,890
No, I got it.

1032
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,890
Okay.

1033
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,760
Oh! Come on, Taylor. Come on.

1034
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,900
Come on.

1035
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,270
Damn it.

1036
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,970
Let me do it.

1037
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,630
No. He's just

1038
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,630
irritated and swollen.

1039
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,870
Natalie.

1040
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,550
All right. Make sure

1041
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,550
you can see the chords,

1042
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,550
okay?

1043
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,580
I got it.

1044
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,050
Go nice and slow.

1045
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,050
Don't force it.

1046
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,140
Yeah.

1047
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,620
There. I'm in.

1048
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,270
His sats are coming up.

1049
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,670
Tell me what else you need?

1050
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,500
Get Dr. Lanik.

1051
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,330
Hi, I'm Dr. Charles.

1052
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,260
What's going on?

1053
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,260
Did you get our

1054
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,260
test results back?

1055
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,460
Not yet.

1056
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,130
You know what's

1057
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,130
happening to us?

1058
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,830
I think I do.

1059
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,830
And this medicine should

1060
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,830
address your symptoms.

1061
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,800
Is it another antibiotic?

1062
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,680
Well actually, it's not.

1063
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,980
But Dr. Halstead

1064
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,980
said this was an infection.

1065
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,640
And it must be affecting

1066
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,640
our nervous systems.

1067
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,350
And that very well could be.

1068
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,350
Listen, this might make

1069
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,350
you a little groggy.

1070
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,450
Even relax you a little.

1071
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,560
I don't care,

1072
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,560
as long as it works.

1073
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,980
Finally, a generator.

1074
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,070
We just need to fuel her up.

1075
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,580
You got your connections

1076
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,580
pre-installed or do we need to

1077
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,580
lay down cable from here?

1078
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,350
No, we're all set.

1079
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,350
Come on. Let's go.

1080
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,350
Let's go.

1081
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,310
Hey. How long till

1082
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,310
the power's back?

1083
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,320
Five, ten minutes at most.

1084
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,980
April?

1085
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,980
It's Darren.

1086
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,600
His pressure and sats

1087
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,600
are tanking.

1088
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,930
He's gonna code.

1089
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,930
We need an ER REBOA.

1090
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,330
Inflating a balloon

1091
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,330
above the pelvis to stop

1092
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,660
the bleeding till we

1093
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,660
get the power back.

1094
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,100
But he won't make it

1095
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,100
all the way back to IR.

1096
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,830
No. We're gonna do it here.

1097
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,340
Call trauma. If we can

1098
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,340
stop the bleed, they need

1099
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,340
to ligate his iliacs stat.

1100
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,880
You don't think this is

1101
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,880
gonna work, do you?

1102
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,380
V Fib. Grab the paddles.

1103
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,060
No. No, you.

1104
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,860
Charge to 200.

1105
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,460
You're charged. Do it.

1106
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,060
Do it!

1107
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,430
Okay, clear.

1108
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,970
Did you find Dr. Lanik?

1109
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,370
He's stuck in the ED.

1110
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,110
Well, we're running

1111
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,110
out of time.

1112
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,110
I think he's gonna arrest.

1113
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,540
What do we do?

1114
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,140
Get me a thoracotomy tray.

1115
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,620
We need to divert

1116
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,620
whatever blood he has left

1117
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,620
to his heart and his brain.

1118
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,320
How do we do that?

1119
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,980
We're gonna clamp his aorta.

1120
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,080
You're gonna open

1121
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,080
his chest? Here?

1122
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,290
Yep.

1123
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,160
And what if

1124
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,160
we can't find it?

1125
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,620
I don't know. I've never

1126
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,620
done it before.

1127
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,350
Pressure's dropping.

1128
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,620
I'm working on it...

1129
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,650
Okay. Let's open him up.

1130
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,480
Easy.

1131
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,300
Clip's off.

1132
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,300
Left anterior wall

1133
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,300
still isn't moving.

1134
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,770
There it goes.

1135
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,500
Yes, sir!

1136
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,010
Sorry.

1137
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,850
Well, look at that.

1138
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,320
Can you feel it?

1139
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,660
No. Not yet.

1140
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,300
Wait. I almost got it.

1141
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,310
Still in V Fib.

1142
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,310
Do it.

1143
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,000
Okay, clear.

1144
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,000
Clear.

1145
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,340
Sinus rhythm.

1146
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,340
Get me a chest X-ray.

1147
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,880
Everybody clear.

1148
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
He's still bleeding?

1149
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Where's the balloon?

1150
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,820
There. Right above

1151
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,820
the diaphragm.

1152
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,020
Vitals are holding.

1153
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,930
Bleeding's stopped. He's good.

1154
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,830
Phew.

1155
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,680
I got it.

1156
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,040
Wow.

1157
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,360
Let's go, let's go!

1158
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,370
Doris, get those vents up

1159
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,370
and running. Dr. Lanik,

1160
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,310
triage surgical patients

1161
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,310
and get them up to the OR.

1162
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,780
Angel, you're with me.

1163
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,810
Everybody, let's move.

1164
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,050
Get me the charge

1165
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,050
nurse in the ICU.

1166
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,320
Dr. Choi, Trauma's here.

1167
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,390
Hey.

1168
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,300
We did it.

1169
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,110
Heard you did the

1170
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,110
sloppiest thoracotomy

1171
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,110
Trauma's ever seen.

1172
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,450
Nice job today.

1173
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,450
Thanks.

1174
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,650
Doesn't mean I'm not still

1175
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,650
keeping an eye on you.

1176
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,190
Everything came

1177
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,190
back normal

1178
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,190
on all three girls.

1179
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,860
All right,

1180
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,860
this makes no sense.

1181
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,960
It's been 30 minutes.

1182
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,960
Why aren't we evacuating?

1183
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,300
I have no idea.

1184
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,130
They stopped twitching.

1185
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,040
What did you do?

1186
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,970
Um... Tic Tacs.

1187
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,600
You gave them a placebo?

1188
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,280
Orange ones have been

1189
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,280
my go-to of late.

1190
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,310
I mean, don't get me wrong,

1191
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,310
they're gonna need

1192
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,550
some therapy, figure out

1193
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,550
that the weight of the world

1194
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,550
isn't on their shoulders.

1195
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,550
Maybe a little family work.

1196
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,850
What do you mean?

1197
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,990
You ever heard of

1198
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,990
mass psychogenic illness?

1199
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,520
Yeah, like mass

1200
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,520
hysteria, right?

1201
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,860
Very easy to misdiagnose.

1202
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,870
I mean, in Salem,

1203
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,870
they called it witchcraft.

1204
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,170
So... The seizures and the

1205
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,170
tremors, you're telling me

1206
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,170
really were from...

1207
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,030
Stress and anxiety manifested

1208
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,030
as physical symptoms.

1209
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,630
Spread through social groups

1210
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,630
by unconscious imitation.

1211
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,340
Happens a lot more

1212
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,340
than you'd think.

1213
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,410
Remarkable how far

1214
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,410
our brains will go

1215
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,180
to avoid dealing

1216
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,180
with emotions

1217
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,180
we don't wanna confront.

1218
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,360
Hey, either way, Dr. Halstead,

1219
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,360
you did the right thing today.

1220
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,060
Wait. How... How's Maggie?

1221
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,430
She says she's fine. Thinks it

1222
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,430
must have just been the heat.

1223
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,510
Good. All right.

1224
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,510
Let's get her

1225
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,510
out of isolation.

1226
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,670
Okay.

1227
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,950
Natalie?

1228
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,950
Yeah.

1229
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:15,620
That night, it didn't feel

1230
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:15,620
like you were coming to

1231
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:15,620
tell me you were engaged.

1232
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,090
What?

1233
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,930
In my car. I think

1234
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,930
you were coming to

1235
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,930
tell me something else.

1236
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,040
I'm sorry, Will, I'm just...

1237
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,040
I've had a really long day.

1238
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,370
Cool. Of course. I'm sorry.

1239
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,600
Goodnight.

1240
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,710
Wait.

1241
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,810
I just have to ask.

1242
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,620
Do you love him?

1243
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,820
Phillip. Are you sure?

1244
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,400
Am I sure that I love him?

1245
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,420
Just tell me.

1246
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,290
Do you?

1247
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,890
You know what?

1248
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,890
My relationship with Phillip

1249
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,340
is the only thing in my life

1250
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,340
that's working right now.

1251
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,980
Hey, guys. Hey, you!

1252
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,500
Dr. Marcel.

1253
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,500
Yeah.

1254
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,200
I am really sorry

1255
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,200
about screwing up the pump.

1256
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,000
I could've killed him.

1257
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,670
Are you kidding?

1258
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,940
We were doing surgery

1259
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,940
on a beating heart

1260
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,940
with no electricity.

1261
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,180
As far as I can tell,

1262
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,180
you got a great set of hands.

1263
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,480
I'm sure they'll come of use

1264
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,480
in your urgent cares.

1265
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,120
The right specialty,

1266
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,490
a surgeon can still make

1267
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,490
good money, right?

1268
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,830
Yeah. Ortho, CT, Neuro...

1269
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,200
And with the right team...

1270
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,720
Oof!

1271
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,740
Hey, good day today.

1272
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,740
I'll see you tomorrow.

1273
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,320
No, I'm not coming back.

1274
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,680
What do you mean?

1275
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,160
I love medicine.

1276
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,160
But what we did today,

1277
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,590
I can't do that every day

1278
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,590
for the rest of my life.

1279
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,190
Hey, come on.

1280
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,190
It was a crazy day...

1281
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,700
I know, I just...

1282
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,430
I just can't.

1283
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,940
Was I too hard on him?

1284
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,110
No, not too hard on him.

1285
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,620
Just focused on getting our

1286
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,620
patients what they needed.

1287
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,690
So I missed seeing

1288
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,690
what he needed.

1289
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,050
Babe, you are

1290
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,050
such a good doctor.

1291
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,090
Sometimes we get so caught up

1292
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,090
taking care of everyone else,

1293
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,200
we forget to take care

1294
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,200
of each other.

1295
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,230
No.

1296
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,800
You don't.

1297
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,570
You don't forget.

1298
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,540
You're always so mindful

1299
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,540
of everyone. So...

1300
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,470
Aware, so caring.

1301
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,420
I know we said someday, but...

1302
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,050
You'd make the best mom ever.

1303
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,460
I love you.

1304
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,820
I love you.
