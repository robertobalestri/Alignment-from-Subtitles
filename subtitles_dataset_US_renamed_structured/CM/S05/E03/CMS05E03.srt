1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,860
Oh, no. Maggie,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,860
you are burning up.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,870
And now you're on chemo

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,870
for breast cancer.

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,800
I'm going to be careful.

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,500
I thought I had a patient.

8
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,130
Crockett Marcel,

9
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,130
fourth year, surgery.

10
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,770
Welcome back.

11
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,770
And the concussion?

12
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,370
Yeah, I'm taking it slowly.

13
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,470
I just have to ask.

14
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,470
Do you love him?

15
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,010
My relationship with Phillip

16
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,010
is the only thing in my life

17
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,010
that's working right now.

18
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,960
My lymphoma is progressing

19
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,960
and there's nothing

20
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,960
more they can do.

21
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,550
I want to be there.

22
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,550
For all of it.

23
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,200
Egg whites...

24
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,360
Whoa.

25
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,870
What's all this?

26
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,870
It's a meringue.

27
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,900
For breakfast?

28
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,900
No, it's for Robin's birthday.

29
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,560
It's for a Baked Alaska.

30
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,870
The meringue goes over

31
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,440
the ice cream and the cake.

32
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,740
But Robin's birthday

33
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,870
isn't for a couple of

34
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,870
weeks though, right?

35
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,670
Yeah. This is a test run.

36
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,450
Oh.

37
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,580
What's the fire

38
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,580
extinguisher for?

39
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,180
I'm gonna set it on fire.

40
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,750
Hey, how do you keep

41
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,750
the ice cream from melting?

42
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,350
That's what

43
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,350
the test run's for.

44
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,120
Ah.

45
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,120
Wait a minute.

46
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,720
Maybe I should

47
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,720
play hooky today.

48
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,090
Stay home.

49
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,090
Be your official taster.

50
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,870
Ow!

51
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,300
CeCe?

52
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,300
Ow! Oh, my gosh.

53
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,460
Whoa.

54
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,460
Honey.

55
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

56
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,400
What happened?

57
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,210
I'm getting so clumsy, honey.

58
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,070
Let me look. Let me...

59
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,070
No, no.

60
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,070
Please, please. Please.

61
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,010
All right. Learned this one

62
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,010
in biophysics.

63
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,140
Yeah.

64
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,150
Stop it.

65
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,150
That's actually pretty cool.

66
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,650
It's all in the lips, ladies.

67
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,090
I bet.

68
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,090
Hey.

69
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,320
Looks like

70
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,320
we're paired

71
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,320
together today.

72
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,650
Lucky me.

73
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,450
Excuse me.

74
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,670
So, babe. That Crockett guy

75
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,670
is working days now?

76
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,030
What's the deal with him?

77
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,570
Not sure he's my speed.

78
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,870
Strikes me as someone who

79
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,870
doesn't take things seriously.

80
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,430
Yeah.

81
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,270
Doctor Choi.

82
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,270
Yeah?

83
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,740
Treatment Four.

84
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,610
Mags?

85
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,610
Uh-huh.

86
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,780
Todd Shepard? Doesn't say

87
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,780
what he's in here for.

88
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,490
Said he wanted to

89
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,490
discuss it with a doctor.

90
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,680
No, I'm in the ED now.

91
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,680
Treatment Room Four.

92
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,620
How far away are you guys?

93
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,990
You're positive you'll be here

94
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,990
within the hour?

95
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,330
Right. Thanks.

96
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,940
Sorry, I really needed

97
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,940
to make that call.

98
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,060
That's okay, Todd.

99
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,840
I go by Shep,

100
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,840
if you don't mind.

101
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,840
Okay, Shep. I'm Dr. Choi.

102
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,970
What brings you in today?

103
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,680
About six weeks ago,

104
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,680
I was diagnosed with GBM.

105
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,810
It's a terminal...

106
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,940
Terminal brain cancer.

107
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm sorry, Shep.

108
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,210
I've got all my medical

109
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,210
records right here

110
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,210
in case you're interested.

111
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,310
Are you experiencing

112
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,310
any complications?

113
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,380
Not exactly.

114
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,380
Excuse me, one second.

115
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,500
The phone call I just made

116
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,500
was to a company called CCI.

117
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,970
Camden Cryonics Institute.

118
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,500
They're gonna preserve me

119
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,500
until a cure can be

120
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,500
found for my condition.

121
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,940
They're on the way here now.

122
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,030
To freeze you?

123
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,100
Um, it's called vitrification.

124
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,100
But, yeah.

125
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,870
You understand you have to be

126
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,870
declared dead first.

127
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,680
That's why I'm here.

128
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,520
For you to declare me dead,

129
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,520
so to speak.

130
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,420
I'm sorry, Shep, I'm confused.

131
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,990
The cocktail

132
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,990
I've been drinking

133
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,990
contains amitriptyline,

134
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,660
lorazepam and two hundred

135
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,660
milligrams of amphetamines.

136
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000
It should put me to sleep

137
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000
in a little over an hour

138
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,270
and arrest my heart

139
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,270
sufficiently for you to

140
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,270
declare me dead in about five.

141
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,210
I have a D.N.I. and D.N.R.

142
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,210
My lawyer assures me

143
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,210
it's all in order.

144
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,440
Doris! Come here,

145
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,440
we gotta pump his stomach.

146
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,040
Stop! I refuse treatment!

147
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,550
Don't listen to him, Doris.

148
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,550
Help! Assault!

149
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,980
Give me the tube.

150
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,980
This doctor keeps touching me,

151
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,040
I'll sue the whole lot of you!

152
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,040
Dr. Choi. Stop.

153
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,300
Well, here you can

154
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,300
see the fracture

155
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,300
of the distal radius.

156
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,530
Minimal displacement.

157
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,100
CeCe, are you all right?

158
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,100
Maggie said you took

159
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,100
some kind of fall...

160
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,230
Broke her wrist.

161
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,110
My arms aren't as long

162
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,110
as they used to be.

163
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,880
I've seen worse.

164
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,880
Four to six weeks

165
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,880
in a cast, you'll be fine.

166
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,310
What? Four to six weeks?

167
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,310
Well, wait a minute.

168
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,570
I need to be able

169
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,570
to use my arm.

170
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,610
Isn't there another

171
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,610
operation we can do?

172
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,750
Normally, yeah, we would

173
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,750
surgically insert a plate.

174
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,880
Shorten your recovery time,

175
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,980
but I really wouldn't

176
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,980
recommend that, Mrs. Charles.

177
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,120
Why?

178
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,390
You'd just open the door

179
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,390
to a whole host

180
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,390
of other complications

181
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,660
given your condition, babe.

182
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,660
It's just not worth it.

183
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,290
They're right, CeCe.

184
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,390
Let's just let ortho

185
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,390
put a cast on it.

186
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,830
It's the least worst option.

187
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,960
Right?

188
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,500
Hey, I'll go talk

189
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,500
to the attending.

190
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,230
Thank... Wait a minute.

191
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,470
You okay, CeCe?

192
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,740
She wants to make

193
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,740
a Baked Alaska for Robin.

194
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,580
It was a flambé. I was making

195
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,580
her a flambé for her birthday.

196
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,950
Okay. I'll go to the bakery.

197
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,950
I'll get a big old cake...

198
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,350
No way.

199
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,350
Sparklers. And we'll

200
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,350
do it up nice.

201
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,510
All right?

202
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,850
Daniel, I hate to

203
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,850
pull you away

204
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,850
but we've got a situation.

205
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,480
It's fine.

206
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,480
You can go. Go.

207
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,480
Okay?

208
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,850
It's fine. I'm fine.

209
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,850
I'll be right back.

210
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,760
I'm fine. I'm fine.

211
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,760
All right, ya all right?

212
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,930
He's committing suicide

213
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,930
right in front of us,

214
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,930
how's this a grey area?

215
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,100
Well, it's complicated,

216
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,100
due to his condition

217
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,100
and his prognosis.

218
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,630
Have you had a chance

219
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,630
to review Mr. Shepard's

220
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,630
medical records, Sam?

221
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,500
Yeah, he's terminal.

222
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,780
I mean, I could go in

223
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,780
and do a resection and

224
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,780
aggressively radiate but it...

225
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,940
It'd buy him

226
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,940
12 to 15 months, tops.

227
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,250
It's a question of "when"

228
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,250
and not "if" with this guy.

229
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,290
And Mr. Shepard has the right

230
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,290
to refuse treatment.

231
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,880
He's just a kid.

232
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,880
Not according to the law.

233
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,960
He's 18. He's talking about

234
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,960
freezing his brain,

235
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,960
for Christ's sakes.

236
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,960
He thinks he's living

237
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,960
in some kind of comic book.

238
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,620
Well, where are we with

239
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,620
cryonics, Sam?

240
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,630
I mean, is it possible

241
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,630
to freeze the brain?

242
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,690
Yeah, sort of,

243
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,690
but that's the easy part.

244
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,130
Hard part's

245
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,130
thawing it out again

246
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,130
and having it still work.

247
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
And that ain't even

248
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
close to happening.

249
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,300
Miss Goodwin, I need to lavage

250
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,300
this kid's stomach right now

251
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,970
or else the drugs'll

252
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,970
get into his bloodstream

253
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,200
and we'll be forced

254
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,200
to use supportive measures.

255
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,010
No, no. Mr. Shepard

256
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,010
has a D.N.I.

257
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,010
and a D.N.R., Dr. Choi.

258
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,210
So, unless the hospital

259
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,210
deems him incapable of

260
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,480
making an informed decision,

261
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,480
we have to honor his wishes.

262
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,190
All right, so let's

263
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,190
ascertain Mr. Shepard's

264
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,190
decisional capacity

265
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,090
and then go from there.

266
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,390
Uh, Daniel? Daniel?

267
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,930
Yeah.

268
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,930
Mr. Shepard?

269
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,820
Yes. I will talk to him.

270
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,760
How long before he starts

271
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,760
to lose consciousness?

272
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,330
Forty, 45 minutes.

273
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,000
Sharon, a word please.

274
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,340
Why is there someone

275
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,340
named Paula over there

276
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,840
saying that she's here

277
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,840
to shadow me?

278
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,930
Oh!

279
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,170
Maggie, I'm sorry.

280
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,410
I intended to speak with you

281
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,410
about that first.

282
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,410
For the next few weeks,

283
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,410
Paula is going to be

284
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,410
your new orientee.

285
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,920
Considering how much

286
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,920
you have on your plate.

287
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,610
Sharon, really, I feel great.

288
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,320
Don't you feel worn down

289
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,320
from your chemo?

290
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,320
No!

291
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,090
And you're happy with your

292
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,090
oncologist at East Mercy?

293
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,130
They're treating me fine,

294
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,130
Sharon.

295
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,430
And no one here

296
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,430
knows anything.

297
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,430
But if I've got someone

298
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,590
shadowing me around,

299
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,590
people here are

300
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,590
gonna start asking questions.

301
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,760
It's too late. Paula's yours.

302
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,600
But I just...

303
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,600
Humor me.

304
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,610
Hello, Keisha. Hi.

305
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,610
Hi.

306
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,710
I'm Dr. Manning.

307
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,710
I hear you hurt your leg?

308
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,450
She tripped and fell

309
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,450
carrying a cup of hot water

310
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,450
for me out of the microwave.

311
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,320
Spilled all over her leg.

312
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,120
I'm sorry to hear that.

313
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,120
How about I take

314
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,120
a look, all right?

315
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,890
All right, let's see.

316
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,160
Two to three percent

317
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,160
superficial partial thickness

318
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,600
on the left anterior thigh.

319
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,000
Mmm-hmm.

320
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,910
She has a second degree burn.

321
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,310
Oh, my God.

322
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,900
But it should be able

323
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,900
to heal on its own

324
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,900
without surgery,

325
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,640
but it will take a few weeks.

326
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,340
I'm gonna do a quick scrub

327
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,340
bedside just to

328
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,340
speed up the process.

329
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,510
Will you start her on an IV?

330
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,350
Is it gonna hurt her?

331
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,350
No.

332
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,150
I will give Keisha sedation.

333
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,150
She won't feel a thing.

334
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,780
Thank you for being

335
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,780
so still, Keisha.

336
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,760
You are a very brave girl.

337
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,800
All right,

338
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,800
I'll be back shortly.

339
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,990
Hey, good job.

340
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,300
Hey, guys.

341
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,300
Hi.

342
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,810
What are you doing here?

343
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,810
I thought you were

344
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,810
headed to the park?

345
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,140
Well, we were, but we were

346
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,140
putting some snacks together,

347
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,150
and we figured you might

348
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,150
get hungry, so, we thought

349
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,150
we'd stop by.

350
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,480
Whatcha got?

351
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,610
It's a cookie.

352
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,270
It's a cookie!

353
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,940
Aw!

354
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,950
Thank you.

355
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,950
I'm gonna eat it

356
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,950
with my lunch, okay?

357
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,150
Okay.

358
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,020
Well, why don't

359
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,020
we let Mommy

360
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,020
get back to work?

361
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,820
I'll see you.

362
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,820
Bye.

363
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,450
All right.

364
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,450
Let's head on out.

365
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,360
Oh, hey.

366
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,530
Don't work too hard.

367
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,400
You see this door?

368
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,400
We're gonna walk through

369
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,400
this door here...

370
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,310
Owen's getting so big.

371
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,870
Yeah.

372
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,350
Yeah, so, listen,

373
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,350
I've been doing some research

374
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,310
on post-traumatic injury

375
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,310
rehabilitation

376
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,820
and there's this computerized

377
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,820
training program funded

378
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,820
by the Pentagon

379
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,680
that's had some early success.

380
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,050
Now, it's not

381
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,050
on the market yet,

382
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,490
but Abrams says there's

383
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,490
a beta version upstairs

384
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,490
you can try out.

385
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,890
It might help you

386
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,890
get your memory back.

387
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,930
Keisha's ready

388
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,930
to be debrided.

389
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,330
Thanks. Will you hook her up

390
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,330
to the monitors

391
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,030
and prep her for five

392
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,030
milligrams of etomidate.

393
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,030
Mmm-hmm.

394
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,000
And I can forward you

395
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,000
the details on that program

396
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,000
if you like.

397
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,090
Sure.

398
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,830
This outfit that you've

399
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,830
contracted with, uh, CCI?

400
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,070
Uh-huh.

401
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,910
They're gonna store you

402
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,910
indefinitely with the hope

403
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,910
that in the future,

404
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,350
there'll be a cure

405
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,350
for the cancer

406
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,940
that you have?

407
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,940
Yeah.

408
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,910
Well, it sounds expensive.

409
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,690
I inherited some money

410
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,690
when Gramps died.

411
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,780
Enough to cover it.

412
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,620
Mmm-hmm. It is pretty

413
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,620
far-out stuff, Shep.

414
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,560
You discussed any of this

415
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,560
with your family?

416
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,960
I tried.

417
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,370
Yeah.

418
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,800
They don't...

419
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,800
They don't get it?

420
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,800
They don't understand?

421
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,580
Look.

422
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,550
You're here to determine

423
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,550
whether I'm sane enough

424
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,210
to make a decision like this,

425
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,210
aren't you?

426
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,780
Yeah.

427
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,410
Here's a hypothetical.

428
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,250
If the hospital across

429
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,250
the street could cure me,

430
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,490
wouldn't you feel ethically

431
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,490
compelled to send me there

432
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,490
for treatment?

433
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,890
I would.

434
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,900
Well, that's what I'm doing.

435
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,990
Sending myself to

436
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,990
a better hospital.

437
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,260
Only the hospital I'm going to

438
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,260
is in the future.

439
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,510
Have you really thought about

440
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,510
what that future looks like?

441
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,570
I mean, it won't be

442
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,570
recognizable. You won't

443
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,570
recognize yourself.

444
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,250
You're trading away,

445
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,250
potentially, a year

446
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,250
of your life.

447
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,580
I mean, that's something

448
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,580
priceless, for a huge unknown.

449
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,620
I mean,

450
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,620
you understand that, right?

451
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,620
Shep? Shep?

452
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,460
Look, if we're gonna

453
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,460
keep you alive,

454
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,930
if you're having

455
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,930
any second thoughts,

456
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,930
we need to know that now.

457
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,960
You know

458
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,960
the Apollo astronauts?

459
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,460
Those rockets were

460
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,460
just as likely to blow up

461
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,200
as they were to

462
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,200
propel them into space.

463
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,370
And the calculations made

464
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,370
to bring them home?

465
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,840
They were done

466
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,840
with pencil and paper.

467
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,040
Those astronauts had wives

468
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,680
and kids and lives to live.

469
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,190
You'd have had to been

470
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,190
crazy to climb into

471
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,190
one of those capsules,

472
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,860
don't you think?

473
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,330
So?

474
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,870
Finding somebody

475
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,870
doesn't have the capacity

476
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,740
to make an informed decision,

477
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,740
I mean, it's...

478
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,510
It's a high hurdle, Ethan.

479
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,510
He's committing suicide.

480
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,140
He's a danger to himself

481
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,140
by definition. Just put him

482
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,140
on a psych hold.

483
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,310
Yeah, but if you follow his

484
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,310
logic, he's... He's not

485
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,310
committing suicide.

486
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,080
He's, like, doing

487
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,080
precisely the opposite.

488
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,220
He's kinda remarkably

489
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,220
clear-headed about

490
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,220
the whole thing.

491
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,490
Then what about

492
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,490
the medications

493
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,490
he's taking for the GBM?

494
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,000
The steroids,

495
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,000
the anti-convulsives.

496
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,030
Those have been known to alter

497
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,030
someone's personality, right?

498
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,830
Yeah, but I mean, we...

499
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,830
We don't have a baseline

500
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,830
to compare it to.

501
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,200
A determination like that

502
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,200
at this point would

503
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,200
be entirely subjective.

504
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,500
His parents are on their way,

505
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,500
Dr. Charles.

506
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,000
Maybe they'll get here in time

507
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,000
to say goodbye to their son.

508
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,180
Hey, Dan. Hey, it's Caroline.

509
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,180
She's insistent

510
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,180
on having surgery.

511
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,020
I couldn't talk her out of it.

512
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,020
She's up in ortho.

513
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,860
Help!

514
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,760
My baby stopped breathing!

515
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,630
Oh...

516
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,760
Get help, we got a newborn!

517
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,900
Baghdad! Let's go!

518
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,530
On the move, excuse me!

519
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,030
Okay, step in,

520
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,030
close the glass.

521
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,030
Cyanotic and unresponsive.

522
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,310
Let's get her on the monitors

523
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,310
and start bagging.

524
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,910
Right away, Doctor.

525
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,910
Deep lac on

526
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,910
the left anterior chest.

527
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,980
Are you the mom?

528
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,980
Yes. Yes, I am.

529
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,790
What's your name?

530
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,790
Nicole. Is she gonna be okay?

531
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,380
Can you tell me

532
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,380
what happened, Nicole?

533
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,480
I was driving to pick up

534
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,480
some groceries, you know,

535
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,430
and all of a sudden,

536
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,430
the contractions started,

537
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,430
like out of nowhere.

538
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,430
Wait a second,

539
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,430
you were just in labor?

540
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,800
You delivered

541
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,800
the baby yourself?

542
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,800
In the back seat of my car.

543
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,170
That was an accident... I was

544
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,170
cutting the umbilical cord.

545
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,670
Can you get a line in?

546
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,670
I was supposed to do that,

547
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,670
wasn't I?

548
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,800
That's right.

549
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,000
Heart rate's coming back up.

550
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, she's still

551
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,000
not breathing.

552
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,240
I need to intubate.

553
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,240
Somebody get me

554
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,240
a neonatal pack.

555
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,010
I can't believe you're even

556
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,010
standing. Come on,

557
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,010
let's get you looked at.

558
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,280
I'm not leaving him!

559
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,280
Nicole, it's a girl.

560
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,410
Come on. You've lost

561
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,410
a lot of blood.

562
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,410
No!

563
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,860
Let her stay, Sexton.

564
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,750
Tube.

565
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,530
I'm in. Bag and call

566
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,530
neonatology.

567
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,530
You got it.

568
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,430
Can someone get a chair

569
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,430
for Mom here?

570
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm afraid, Mommy!

571
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,040
It's okay, baby.

572
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,940
The doctor said it wasn't

573
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,940
going to hurt.

574
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,940
That's right, Keisha.

575
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,000
Now, you may feel a little

576
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,000
drowsy from the medication.

577
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,880
It's okay to close your eyes

578
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,880
and go to sleep.

579
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,140
Monique?

580
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,450
She's a little hypotensive.

581
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,450
Is it okay to proceed?

582
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,540
BP?

583
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,540
Ninety-six over sixty.

584
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,480
That's not too low.

585
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,390
She's probably

586
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,390
just dehydrated.

587
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,390
Push the meds.

588
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,620
She's been complaining

589
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,620
about feeling lethargic

590
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,160
for a couple of weeks now.

591
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,960
Her pediatrician

592
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,960
couldn't find anything wrong.

593
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,160
I've been getting

594
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,160
on her lately,

595
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,160
for being so lazy.

596
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,060
What's going on?

597
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,400
She's seizing.

598
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,400
Mmm-hmm.

599
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,470
Push one of Ativan!

600
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,130
BP's crashing.

601
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,130
Sixty over forty.

602
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,680
Bolus 500 milliliters

603
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,680
of normal saline.

604
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,870
Keisha? Talk to me!

605
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,870
Ma'am?

606
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,380
I'm gonna need you

607
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,380
to move over here.

608
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,180
I need to intubate.

609
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,180
Draw up 50 of sux.

610
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,650
What's happening

611
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,650
with my little girl?

612
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,520
Your phone connects to the

613
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,520
CarePoint you're using, right?

614
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,520
Uh-huh.

615
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,990
I'm super-familiar with it.

616
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,160
FYI, got my MICN

617
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,160
certification last year.

618
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,600
So whenever you're

619
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,600
ready for me to do

620
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,600
an incoming call, I can...

621
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,570
You know what

622
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,570
would be really helpful?

623
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,940
You checking

624
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,940
all the drug expiration dates.

625
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,770
The drug expirations?

626
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, there are dates stamped

627
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
on every package.

628
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,840
You can start with

629
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,840
the Pyxis over there,

630
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,840
and then of course,

631
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,610
all the crash carts.

632
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,180
Okey-dokey.

633
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,180
Yeah. Okey-dokey.

634
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,180
The girl's sedated on a vent?

635
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,180
Mmm-hmm.

636
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,460
Any idea what

637
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,460
caused her to crash?

638
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,860
Apparently, Keisha fell

639
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,860
when she burned herself.

640
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,060
Maybe she bumped her head

641
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,060
and caused an epidural bleed?

642
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,570
Well, walk me through

643
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,570
what you know.

644
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,570
Maybe I can help.

645
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,930
So, the mother said

646
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,930
Keisha ran a bit

647
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,930
of a fever last week.

648
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,870
But the pediatrician

649
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,870
couldn't find anything

650
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,870
out of the ordinary.

651
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,310
She was a little hypotensive

652
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,310
when I had Monique

653
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,310
push the ketamine,

654
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,280
but nothing to

655
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,280
precipitate this...

656
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,970
Ketamine? You mean

657
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,970
etomidate, right?

658
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,710
What?

659
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,950
You had Monique

660
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,950
push etomidate.

661
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,950
I heard you call it earlier.

662
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,990
Yeah. It's right here

663
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,990
in the chart.

664
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,890
That's strange. I don't...

665
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,890
I don't know how

666
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,890
I confused those two.

667
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,560
Whatever, it doesn't matter,

668
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,560
there's no real

669
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,560
clinical difference.

670
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,600
You feeling all right, Nat?

671
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,960
Any headaches or problems

672
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,960
concentrating...

673
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,300
I misspoke, Will.

674
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,340
Let's not make

675
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,340
a big deal out of it.

676
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,350
What did you put

677
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,350
in her side there?

678
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,250
Well, your daughter's got

679
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,250
a collapsed lung.

680
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,790
That tube's gonna

681
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,790
help her breathe.

682
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,920
So, how long

683
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,920
until I'll be able

684
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,920
to get her out of here?

685
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,450
It's gonna be a while.

686
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,450
It'll be okay.

687
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,490
Have you thought

688
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,490
of a name yet?

689
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,990
Not really.

690
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,100
Okay, you don't need

691
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,100
to do this right now,

692
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,200
but before you leave

693
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,200
you're gonna need to

694
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,200
fill out these forms,

695
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,000
for the birth certificate.

696
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,930
And we need to let

697
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,930
your OB know that

698
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,930
you delivered already.

699
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,150
If you give me a name...

700
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,770
No, I didn't really

701
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,770
have an OB.

702
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,620
I mean, I had one,

703
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,020
but they were all the way

704
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,020
across town near where

705
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,020
the baby's father lives,

706
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,850
and we recently split, so...

707
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

708
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,230
Here. I'll fill out

709
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,230
as much as I can.

710
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,350
Oh, your hand.

711
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,560
Melissa, may I have

712
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,560
some gauze, please?

713
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,140
You know, I can't do

714
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,140
any more than this without

715
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,140
getting you admitted.

716
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,640
It's okay, I'm all right.

717
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,080
You need to see a doctor,

718
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,550
if for no other reason

719
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,550
than to make sure you've

720
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,550
passed all your placenta.

721
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,850
Dr. Marcel? Isn't that right?

722
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,410
Please, don't separate me

723
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,410
from my baby.

724
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,990
She needs me with her.

725
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,750
Hey.

726
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,750
How about we just

727
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,750
get you registered?

728
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,260
That way we can get you

729
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,260
out of these clothes

730
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,060
and into something

731
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,060
more comfortable.

732
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,320
Then you can stay here

733
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,320
with your child.

734
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,890
Okay. Thank you.

735
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,660
April here will

736
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,660
scare you up some scrubs.

737
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm sorry, Dr. Marcel?

738
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,840
Mmm-hmm.

739
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,000
She really needs

740
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,000
to be examined.

741
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,170
Oh, relax, Sexton.

742
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,170
We just saved a baby's life.

743
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,440
That's good news.

744
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,920
Look, something seems

745
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,920
off with Mom.

746
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,780
Why's she so resistant

747
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,780
to being seen by a doctor?

748
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,020
Who knows? Maybe she took

749
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,020
a little something-something

750
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,560
to get her through the birth

751
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,560
and now she's afraid

752
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,290
of having her baby taken away.

753
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,800
I don't know.

754
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,800
And neither do you.

755
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,730
But if she didn't just deliver

756
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,730
this baby, it's our

757
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,730
responsibility to find out.

758
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,030
Maybe we could figure out

759
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,030
a way to draw her blood,

760
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,030
check her HCG levels...

761
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,130
Oh!

762
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,580
You draw anyone's blood

763
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,580
without consent,

764
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,580
that's considered assault.

765
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,040
Now, I don't know about you,

766
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,040
but I like being a doctor.

767
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,940
And not going to jail.

768
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,250
If you won't help me,

769
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,250
I'll call DCFS in

770
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,250
to interview her.

771
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,320
Nicole's a righty,

772
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,320
by the way.

773
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,320
So?

774
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,720
So, if she actually

775
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,720
injured her hand while

776
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,720
cutting the umbilical cord,

777
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,630
wouldn't it more likely be

778
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,630
the free hand that got cut?

779
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,830
Hey.

780
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,430
So, what's up?

781
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,410
I understand you're

782
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,410
considering undergoing surgery

783
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,410
to repair your wrist.

784
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,740
Yes.

785
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,800
As your oncologist, I need to

786
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,800
strongly urge you against

787
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,800
that course of treatment.

788
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,750
That's exactly what he said.

789
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,750
Did you tell her to say that?

790
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,910
Absolutely not.

791
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,650
Your immune

792
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,650
system is profoundly

793
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,650
compromised by the chemo.

794
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,520
The risk of post-surgical

795
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,520
infection is very high.

796
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,460
I advise against

797
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,460
even minor surgery,

798
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,460
unless absolutely necessary.

799
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,660
This is absolutely necessary

800
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,260
because I'm making a Baked

801
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,260
Alaska for my daughter.

802
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,330
And I cannot do that

803
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,330
with, like, a cast on my hand.

804
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,670
Caroline, Robin would

805
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,670
happily celebrate

806
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,670
her birthday

807
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,800
with a supermarket cupcake

808
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,800
if she knew

809
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,800
what the risks were.

810
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,310
This isn't about

811
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,310
what Robin wants.

812
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,310
This is about what I want.

813
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,940
Why don't I give you two

814
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,940
some privacy?

815
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,840
What?

816
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,680
How about we just have

817
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,680
them put a temp cast

818
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,680
on it overnight.

819
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,550
And then we can

820
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,550
mull over the pluses

821
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,550
and the minuses...

822
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,650
Dr. Charles? Sorry to

823
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,650
interrupt, but you've been

824
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,650
requested down in the ED.

825
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,490
Yeah, they specifically asked

826
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,490
for you, Dr. Charles.

827
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,470
Go, Daniel. Go, please.

828
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,900
Heather?

829
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,030
Can you do me a favor

830
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,030
and please try and make sure

831
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,040
she does not get cleared

832
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,040
for surgery until I get back.

833
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,240
Daniel...

834
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,240
Please.

835
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,540
I just wanna make sure

836
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,540
she doesn't make

837
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,540
any rash decisions.

838
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,670
Thank you.

839
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,640
For the record,

840
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
CCI neither condones

841
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
nor endorses

842
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,650
the pre-emptive precipitation

843
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,650
of clinical death.

844
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,920
That said, we are

845
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,920
a service company...

846
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,920
Sure.

847
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,520
Hope the parents aren't

848
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,520
gonna be too much of

849
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,520
an impediment on this.

850
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,570
I don't wanna step on

851
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,570
anyone's toes here, but

852
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,570
time really is of the essence.

853
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,230
The second

854
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,230
he is declared dead,

855
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,230
we need to start.

856
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,240
Is this what you're using

857
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,240
to freeze him?

858
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,780
We don't freeze anyone.

859
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,780
We're gonna vitrify him.

860
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,240
We replace his blood

861
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,240
with a medical-grade

862
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,240
antifreeze.

863
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,180
As soon as his body temp hits

864
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,180
minus 124 degrees Celsius,

865
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,120
the body's liquid rises

866
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,120
so high in viscosity,

867
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,120
no molecule can budge.

868
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,210
Takes about three hours.

869
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,450
You paged me?

870
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,450
Yeah.

871
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,420
The parents wanted

872
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,420
to speak with you.

873
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,090
Mr. and Mrs. Shepard?

874
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,090
Please.

875
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,860
This is Dr. Charles.

876
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,960
Why is no one

877
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,960
stopping my boy

878
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,960
from doing this?

879
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,430
Todd just turned 18.

880
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,200
He can't make a decision

881
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,200
like this for himself.

882
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,400
He's bradying down.

883
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,600
What's that?

884
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,470
His heart stopped.

885
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,470
Well, do something!

886
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,710
I'm not legally authorized to.

887
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,710
Please!

888
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,870
We only have so much time

889
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,870
left with him!

890
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,250
Well, we're not ready

891
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,250
for him to die yet.

892
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,290
Have you noticed

893
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,290
any personality changes

894
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,290
in Shep since the diagnosis?

895
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,830
I don't know...

896
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,500
Has he been more impetuous,

897
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,500
stubborn, less willing

898
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,500
to listen to reason?

899
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,090
Yes, of course.

900
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,900
I'm deeming the patient

901
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,900
decisionally incapacitated.

902
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,840
As next of kin, you have

903
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,840
the right to make medical

904
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,840
decisions on his behalf.

905
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,570
Should we attempt

906
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,570
to resuscitate him?

907
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,570
Yes! Do it!

908
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,470
All right,

909
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,470
get me a crash cart.

910
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,470
Start bagging!

911
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,510
Quick-look paddles.

912
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,510
Hey, give us some room!

913
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,360
How long will he need

914
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,360
to stay on support?

915
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,480
Until the drugs work

916
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,480
through his system.

917
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,480
A few more hours at least.

918
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,590
Thank you, Doctor.

919
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,190
Sure.

920
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,760
Guess you guys

921
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,760
rushed here for nothing.

922
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,930
Well, transfer's already

923
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,930
paid for, so, we'll stand by,

924
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,930
if it's all the same,

925
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,030
just in case.

926
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,210
You can hang in that room

927
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,210
for the time being.

928
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,480
I didn't think you were

929
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,480
buying my personality

930
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,480
change argument.

931
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,390
Just erring on the side

932
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,390
of caution, you know?

933
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,790
Give everybody

934
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,790
a little more time.

935
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,690
You made the right call.

936
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,690
Thank you.

937
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,120
I hope so.

938
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,120
So, what?

939
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,160
You forbade me from

940
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,160
having the surgery? Really?

941
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,490
So we get married

942
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,490
and now I have to ask

943
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,490
for permission for stuff?

944
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,400
Is that right?

945
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,400
I wasn't...

946
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,870
Come here, come here.

947
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,030
I'm not forbidding

948
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,030
anything.

949
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,630
I just want to make sure

950
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,630
that we have enough time

951
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,140
to think this through.

952
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,140
I've thought about it.

953
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,180
I want the surgery.

954
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,180
For a Baked Alaska?

955
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,680
Yes.

956
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,680
Do you know how crazy

957
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,680
that sounds?

958
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,910
It's not about

959
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,910
the Baked Alaska.

960
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,350
It's about me showing love

961
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,350
to the people I care about

962
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,350
the way I want to.

963
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,010
Look, I know I'm not

964
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,010
the best cook in the world,

965
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,710
but I can figure out a whisk.

966
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,710
I'll help you.

967
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,410
No. No. No.

968
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,410
We'll do it together.

969
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,320
No!

970
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,550
Time is precious, Daniel, and

971
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,550
I don't wanna spend four weeks

972
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,320
not being able to use my hand.

973
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,660
You knew who I was when

974
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,660
you signed on for this.

975
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,860
You knew who I was.

976
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,170
No, this isn't what I signed

977
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,170
up for. You being reckless

978
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,170
with your health.

979
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,870
That wasn't the deal.

980
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,100
There's too much

981
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,100
to lose here.

982
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,870
I think you're being

983
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,870
a little selfish.

984
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,570
So, now I'm being selfish.

985
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,570
Really?

986
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,240
I mean,

987
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,240
I just found you again.

988
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,040
I wanna have as much time

989
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,040
with you as possible.

990
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,840
And I'm kinda hoping

991
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,840
you feel the same way.

992
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,910
I do, but you know what?

993
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,910
This is my choice.

994
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,540
Period. You hear that?

995
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,680
Period.

996
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,930
I tried to get her to let us

997
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,930
examine her, but she refused,

998
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,360
and given the circumstances

999
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,360
of the delivery...

1000
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,800
No. You did the right thing

1001
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,800
calling Child Services, April.

1002
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,960
It's what we're here for.

1003
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,300
Excuse me. Miss Burke?

1004
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,700
Nicole?

1005
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,870
Hey, Nicole,

1006
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,870
you gotta wake up.

1007
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,440
We need to ask you

1008
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,440
a few questions.

1009
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,110
She was feeling pretty

1010
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,110
anxious about her baby,

1011
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,110
so, I gave her Ativan.

1012
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,120
Should wear off

1013
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,120
in an hour or so.

1014
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,620
Melissa, will you notify us

1015
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,620
when she wakes up?

1016
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,650
Of course.

1017
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,650
Thank you.

1018
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,430
I cannot believe

1019
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,430
that you would

1020
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,430
undermine me like that.

1021
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,550
Excuse me?

1022
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,820
You knew I was

1023
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,820
calling DCFS in

1024
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,820
to talk to her.

1025
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,130
You sedated her on purpose.

1026
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,660
Please.

1027
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,060
You know what, you don't

1028
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,060
wanna help? Fine. Just do me

1029
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,060
a favor, stay out of my way.

1030
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,470
Goodwin got you a lackey?

1031
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,510
What'd you do

1032
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,510
to get such special treatment?

1033
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,790
I'm just training her, Doris.

1034
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,790
It's not permanent.

1035
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,650
That's not what I heard.

1036
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,080
Huh.

1037
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,320
Good thing I checked these.

1038
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,950
Look how many

1039
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,950
had almost expired.

1040
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,290
You know, if you want, I could

1041
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,290
rework things moving forward.

1042
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,270
Great.

1043
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,270
So what's next?

1044
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,430
Actually, I'd love

1045
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,430
a cup of coffee.

1046
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,800
Okay, I'll run down

1047
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,800
to the cafeteria.

1048
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,840
I prefer Dark Matter coffee.

1049
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,670
There's one about

1050
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,670
twelve blocks from here.

1051
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,470
Why don't you go get me

1052
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,470
a red eye and get yourself

1053
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,470
whatever you want.

1054
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,310
Thanks. I'll be back

1055
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,310
in a jiff.

1056
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,220
Hey, uh, Keisha's father,

1057
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,220
Darrell, arrived.

1058
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,810
Had a lot of questions.

1059
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,050
I know. I need to

1060
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,050
go talk to them.

1061
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,560
I'm not avoiding them. I just

1062
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,560
don't have the answers yet.

1063
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,830
What'd her CT show?

1064
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,830
Came back negative. No bleed.

1065
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,360
Bloodwork?

1066
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,300
Glucose and sodium

1067
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,300
are a little low,

1068
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,300
but otherwise normal.

1069
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,030
I'm gonna do an LP,

1070
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,030
make sure we're not looking

1071
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,030
at something like meningitis.

1072
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,700
Are you sure that's necessary?

1073
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,700
Is she spiking a fever?

1074
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,340
Well, not today, but her mom

1075
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,340
said she was last week,

1076
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,070
so, I gotta check it

1077
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,070
off my list.

1078
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,170
Hey, you want me

1079
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,170
to take over Keisha for you?

1080
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,180
What? Why?

1081
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,550
It's... Nat,

1082
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,550
it's been a long week.

1083
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,090
You know, and you were

1084
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,090
out of action for a while.

1085
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,350
I'd understand if you're

1086
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,350
feeling a little rusty.

1087
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,550
Maybe you should look

1088
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,550
into that program

1089
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,550
I mentioned earlier...

1090
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,320
This is because I misspoke,

1091
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,320
isn't it?

1092
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,590
You are fixated

1093
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,590
on me getting my memory back.

1094
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,100
Why?

1095
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,760
Nat, I just want you

1096
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,760
to get better.

1097
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,760
Nah, I don't think that's it.

1098
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,840
I think it's about you.

1099
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,000
You want me to remember why

1100
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,000
I came to see you that night,

1101
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,270
so that maybe I'll...

1102
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,110
...tell you something

1103
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,110
you wanna hear.

1104
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,780
Natalie, no...

1105
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,780
Stop it.

1106
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,720
I am fine.

1107
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,090
And I don't appreciate

1108
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,090
you talking

1109
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,720
to Dr. Abrams about

1110
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,720
my health behind my back.

1111
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,350
Monique. Will you prep

1112
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,350
Keisha for an LP?

1113
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,350
Okay.

1114
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,520
Thanks.

1115
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,520
Actually, Monique,

1116
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,520
hold off on that.

1117
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,290
I didn't want to have to

1118
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,290
tell you this, but I'm

1119
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,290
taking over the patient.

1120
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,800
The parents have

1121
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,800
lost confidence in you.

1122
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,460
They brought their daughter in

1123
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,460
to have a burn looked at,

1124
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,870
and now she's in a coma.

1125
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,970
Will, please don't do this.

1126
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,450
I'm sorry, they want you

1127
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,450
off the case.

1128
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,950
Juliette!

1129
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,620
Twenty-three-year-old female,

1130
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,620
found down, intubated

1131
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,620
in the field,

1132
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,920
18 gauge in the left arm.

1133
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,920
She's eviscerated.

1134
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,260
Baghdad!

1135
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,260
Bowels wrapped in

1136
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,260
moist saline gauze.

1137
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,920
She's gotten 500 mils

1138
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,920
of crystalloid.

1139
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,330
Let's go, everybody.

1140
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,330
Let's go, let's go!

1141
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,900
All right. On my count.

1142
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,900
One, two, three.

1143
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,500
Get her on the monitors.

1144
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,440
Heart rate's 130.

1145
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,440
BP's 72 over 44.

1146
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,750
Trigger the MTP.

1147
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,750
Open the hybrid room.

1148
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,940
I got you.

1149
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,950
Open the hybrid.

1150
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,950
Oh, man,

1151
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,350
her uterus is cut wide open.

1152
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,350
Looks like she was pregnant.

1153
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,350
Wait, what? Where's the baby?

1154
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,330
Where's this woman's baby?

1155
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,330
There was no baby on-site.

1156
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,850
It had to have been Nicole.

1157
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,990
Okay. Okay, this woman

1158
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,990
who did this,

1159
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,990
her name is Nicole Burke,

1160
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,590
she is in the NICU right now

1161
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,590
with the baby.

1162
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,260
Come on, I'll show you.

1163
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,260
Stop!

1164
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,670
Let the police do their job,

1165
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,670
Sexton! Come here

1166
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,670
and help me retract.

1167
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,210
You have to go up there

1168
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,210
fast! Oh, my God.

1169
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,680
I need some more

1170
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,680
lab sponges.

1171
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,970
Yes, Doctor.

1172
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,850
So, what do you think?

1173
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,850
Can we save the uterus?

1174
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,390
I don't know.

1175
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,390
It's looking

1176
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,390
pretty ratty.

1177
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,620
Even if we can fix it,

1178
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,290
she'd run the risk

1179
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,290
of it rupturing with

1180
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,290
a future pregnancy.

1181
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,730
I'd just do

1182
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,730
a hysterectomy.

1183
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,860
Well, she's only 23,

1184
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,860
and I'm not sure

1185
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,860
her baby's gonna survive.

1186
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,830
I'm gonna try and save it.

1187
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,170
I'll go scrub, but for

1188
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,170
the record, this is against

1189
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,170
my better judgment.

1190
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,230
You scrubbing in or not, Mags?

1191
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,230
I'm coming!

1192
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,670
Oh, uh... Hey, Maggie,

1193
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,670
are you all right?

1194
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,050
Should I jump in? I'm...

1195
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,050
I'm certified.

1196
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,880
I'm fine.

1197
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,320
Why does this

1198
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,320
keep happening?

1199
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,660
The drugs he took

1200
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,660
are making his heart stop

1201
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,030
and until they clear

1202
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,030
his system...

1203
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Feels like only yesterday

1204
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,240
we were waiting

1205
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,180
to see what college

1206
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,180
he would get into and...

1207
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,270
Now?

1208
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,380
We just couldn't let him

1209
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,380
go through with

1210
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,380
that plan of his, you know?

1211
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,080
The...

1212
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:56,060
The thought of his head just

1213
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:56,060
floating in a canister

1214
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:56,060
in a warehouse somewhere...

1215
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,370
Shep told me that he tried

1216
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,370
to talk to you two

1217
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,370
about this, is that right?

1218
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,460
Yeah.

1219
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,260
I don't know

1220
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,260
if it's any comfort,

1221
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,860
but I was genuinely impressed

1222
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,530
with how much thought

1223
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,530
that he had put into this,

1224
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,050
and how much sense

1225
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,050
that it made to him.

1226
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,880
Please, Dr. Charles,

1227
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,880
tell us what we're missing.

1228
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,280
Miss Shepard, I've been

1229
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,280
doing this for a while.

1230
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,820
And on a good day,

1231
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,060
I'm just starting to think

1232
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,060
I might be learning my way

1233
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,060
around the human mind.

1234
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,420
But trying to...

1235
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,260
To fathom the thinking of

1236
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,260
someone who's confronting

1237
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,260
their own mortality?

1238
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,830
Unless you're the one

1239
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,830
who's looking down

1240
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,830
that tunnel,

1241
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,130
I just... I don't know

1242
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,130
if it's possible.

1243
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,300
I think what we need to do

1244
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,300
is try and listen,

1245
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,280
understand and respect

1246
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,280
that it's their journey

1247
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,780
to... To go on alone.

1248
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,250
They got his heart back

1249
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,250
in rhythm. You should

1250
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,250
go be with him.

1251
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,350
What we need to do?

1252
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,290
You give us the power

1253
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,290
to make a decision and

1254
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,290
then judge us for making it?

1255
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,600
Mr. Shepard, believe me,

1256
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,600
I'm... I'm not

1257
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,600
judging anybody.

1258
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,800
Anyone from rheumatology

1259
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,800
showed up yet?

1260
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,940
No.

1261
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,520
Lean on them, okay?

1262
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,520
And run another set of labs.

1263
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,710
Mmm-hmm.

1264
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,650
Oh, hey, there. Again.

1265
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,550
Hi, Owen.

1266
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,550
Hi, Will.

1267
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,320
After we got done

1268
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,320
in the park,

1269
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,160
we went to the movies,

1270
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,390
and then we figured we would

1271
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,390
come here and wait for Mommy.

1272
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,290
Hey, Phillip...

1273
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,660
Yeah?

1274
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,070
Not so sure this is the best

1275
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,070
place for kids, you know?

1276
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,710
Some scary stuff happens here,

1277
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,710
and maybe they can't unsee.

1278
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,180
Oh, yeah. That's a good point.

1279
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,510
Um...

1280
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,990
There we go.

1281
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,990
Now there's nothing

1282
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,990
to unsee, right?

1283
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,560
We told your supervisor

1284
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,560
we didn't want you treating

1285
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,560
our daughter anymore...

1286
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,870
I know, I just need

1287
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,530
to check one last thing.

1288
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,530
Dr. Manning?

1289
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,900
I'll have to ask you

1290
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,900
to stay away

1291
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,900
from this patient.

1292
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,240
I was wrong. Okay?

1293
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,610
Etomidate and ketamine

1294
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,610
are not just

1295
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,610
the same thing.

1296
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,880
A big difference is that

1297
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,880
etomidate unmasks adrenal

1298
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,880
insufficiencies...

1299
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,110
While ketamine doesn't.

1300
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,350
Yes.

1301
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,250
Do you see the pigment spots

1302
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,250
on Keisha's foot?

1303
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,130
They are a sign that

1304
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,130
her adrenal glands are

1305
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,130
not producing enough cortisol.

1306
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,890
100 milligrams of

1307
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,890
hydrocortisone.

1308
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,890
I don't understand.

1309
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,900
Cortisol helps the body

1310
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,900
handle stress.

1311
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,440
In its absence,

1312
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,440
even the stress of

1313
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,440
being examined by a doctor

1314
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,200
was enough to plummet Keisha

1315
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,200
into a coma.

1316
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,100
BP's improving.

1317
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,900
Her color's coming back.

1318
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,420
She's trying to

1319
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,420
open her eyes!

1320
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,210
Oh, my baby girl...

1321
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,290
She's super-cold.

1322
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,720
I'm having trouble

1323
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,720
keeping her pressure up.

1324
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,450
You need to pack her up

1325
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,450
now and get out.

1326
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,330
Told you it wasn't worth it.

1327
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,330
Knot and I'm done.

1328
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,630
You're pushing it,

1329
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,630
Dr. Marcel.

1330
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,330
And there. Done.

1331
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,930
Looks better than I thought.

1332
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,930
Let's temp-close

1333
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,930
and get her upstairs.

1334
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,270
Open up a vac sponge.

1335
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,170
Maggie?

1336
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,570
I need to take a minute.

1337
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,310
Mags.

1338
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,520
Sexton, scrub in!

1339
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,170
Hey.

1340
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,670
If you need to go home early,

1341
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,670
I'm more than willing

1342
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,670
to cover for you.

1343
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,270
You cover for me?

1344
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,380
Your first day?

1345
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,180
A little constructive

1346
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,180
criticism, Paula,

1347
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,630
you have an insanely

1348
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,630
inflated sense of

1349
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,630
your own capabilities.

1350
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,070
"You know, I'm certified

1351
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,070
doing this. I did

1352
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,070
my dissertation on that."

1353
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,830
Please!

1354
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,070
I'm...

1355
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,070
Get out.

1356
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,170
I'm sorry, but I refuse

1357
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,170
to be spoken to like that.

1358
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,560
Is she gonna make it?

1359
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,030
Yeah, she lost a lot of blood,

1360
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,030
but, yeah, I'm hopeful.

1361
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,010
Do we know any more

1362
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,010
about what happened?

1363
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,670
The victim's name

1364
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,670
is Louisa Nash.

1365
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,330
She and the assailant

1366
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,330
were co-workers.

1367
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,570
This morning,

1368
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,570
Miss Burke invited Louisa over

1369
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,370
to give her

1370
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,370
some old baby clothes.

1371
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,710
When her guard was down,

1372
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,710
she chloroformed her

1373
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,550
and forcibly removed the baby.

1374
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,550
Who would ever do

1375
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,550
something like that?

1376
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,090
She lost her son

1377
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,090
recently to leukemia.

1378
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,390
Maybe she had some sort of

1379
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,390
mental breakdown?

1380
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,390
I don't know.

1381
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,390
We were lucky and

1382
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,390
we got an anonymous tip

1383
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,390
about Miss Burke.

1384
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,120
And that helped us

1385
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,120
find Louisa in time.

1386
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,890
Suspect's hand

1387
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,890
needs dressing.

1388
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,590
Is that something

1389
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,590
you can do here?

1390
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,590
I got it.

1391
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,610
Take care of my baby, okay?

1392
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,870
Tell him I'll come for him

1393
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,870
as soon as I can.

1394
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,620
It's getting to be

1395
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,620
a bit of a circus.

1396
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,820
Gwen? Gwen?

1397
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,820
Excuse me?

1398
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,790
Here. I'll take you

1399
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,790
out the back way.

1400
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,140
What's going on?

1401
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,140
They're withdrawing support.

1402
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,920
My wife and I decided

1403
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,920
we're going to honor

1404
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,920
our son's wishes.

1405
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,150
This way, maybe, someday,

1406
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,150
we'll get our son back.

1407
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,620
Time of death, 19:42.

1408
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,300
So, I'm thinking

1409
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,300
this might have

1410
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,300
been precipitated

1411
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,390
by some kind

1412
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,390
of underlying cause.

1413
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,460
Maybe Addison's Disease?

1414
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,460
I'm gonna have endocrinology

1415
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,460
come down and see her.

1416
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,160
I thought it was clear

1417
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,160
I was gonna be the primary.

1418
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,540
I'm sorry, but once I realized

1419
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,540
what caused her to crash,

1420
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
I had to act quickly.

1421
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
I mean, Keisha

1422
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
could have died.

1423
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,980
Oh, my ride's here.

1424
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,020
Adrenal crisis should have

1425
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,020
been on your differential

1426
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,020
from the start.

1427
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,160
It was an odd presentation.

1428
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,750
Or you just weren't

1429
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,750
thinking straight.

1430
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,860
I'm gonna want to oversee

1431
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,860
all your cases moving forward,

1432
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,490
until we know for sure

1433
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,490
your TBI isn't adversely

1434
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,490
affecting your patients.

1435
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,900
Are you serious?

1436
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,900
There's nothing wrong with me.

1437
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,440
You don't have the authority.

1438
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,780
I was hoping

1439
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,780
we could do this off-book.

1440
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,850
If not, we can formalize it

1441
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,850
with Lanik and Goodwin.

1442
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,610
I'm happy to talk to them.

1443
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,680
Natalie,

1444
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,280
it's for your own protection.

1445
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,060
Why do I feel like

1446
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,060
you're punishing me

1447
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,060
for something else?

1448
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,030
Hi, come here.

1449
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,300
So, you ready to go?

1450
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,300
Yeah.

1451
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,270
Yes.

1452
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,580
Louisa? Can you open

1453
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,580
your eyes for me?

1454
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,150
Hey.

1455
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,630
You're at Gaffney Chicago

1456
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,630
Medical Center, in the ICU.

1457
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,790
You sustained some injuries

1458
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,790
that required us

1459
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,600
to perform extensive surgery,

1460
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,600
but you are okay.

1461
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,670
Would you like to

1462
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,670
meet your baby girl?

1463
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,930
Uh-huh.

1464
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,910
Here she is.

1465
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,650
We got lucky, the police

1466
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,650
finding her in time.

1467
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,930
Can I trust you

1468
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,930
to keep a secret?

1469
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,660
Yeah. What?

1470
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,770
You know how that monster

1471
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,770
was so antsy to

1472
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,770
get out of here earlier?

1473
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,930
Mmm-hmm.

1474
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,970
Well, Dr. Marcel gave her

1475
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,970
enough Ativan

1476
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,700
to knock her out,

1477
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,700
and while she was,

1478
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,440
he drew some blood

1479
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,440
and had her HCG levels checked

1480
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,950
to see if she really

1481
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,950
delivered that baby.

1482
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,110
What?

1483
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,110
You can't tell anyone, April.

1484
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,350
Crockett could get fired.

1485
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,650
He's such a badass.

1486
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,050
Do you know

1487
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,050
if he's seeing

1488
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,050
anybody?

1489
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,630
No, I don't.

1490
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,490
Paula quit?

1491
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,130
Yeah. She said,

1492
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,130
and I quote,

1493
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,670
"the ED wasn't a healthy

1494
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,670
environment" for her.

1495
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,570
You know, I had a feeling

1496
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,570
that she couldn't cut it.

1497
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,200
You chased her off, Maggie.

1498
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,200
And I told you

1499
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,470
that I don't need the help.

1500
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,010
You're being stubborn.

1501
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,810
I have a hospital to run.

1502
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,580
So, if you don't want us

1503
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,580
to treat you medically,

1504
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,010
then you're getting help.

1505
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,860
April?

1506
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,860
Yeah.

1507
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,220
Thank you for scrubbing in

1508
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,220
for me today.

1509
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,220
Yeah.

1510
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,700
I'd like to start

1511
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,700
training you to take over

1512
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,700
the position formally.

1513
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,200
Sure, of course.

1514
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,200
It'll help me take some stuff

1515
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,200
off my plate.

1516
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,410
Does that mean

1517
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,410
I'd be working

1518
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,410
with Dr. Marcel?

1519
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,880
Is that a problem?

1520
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,010
No.

1521
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,010
Start tomorrow?

1522
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,420
Okay.

1523
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,850
Thank you.

1524
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,960
Thank you.

1525
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,230
Do you really think

1526
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,230
I'll get better care here

1527
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,230
than at East Mercy?

1528
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,360
Yeah.

1529
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,540
Hey.

1530
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,800
Why didn't you wait for me?

1531
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,970
Because you were

1532
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,970
still on rounds.

1533
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,980
And Sharon offered me

1534
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,980
a ride home.

1535
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,710
How did your, um...

1536
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
How'd your surgery go?

1537
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,050
I didn't get it.

1538
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,160
You didn't?

1539
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,160
No.

1540
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,960
They're gonna check my wrist

1541
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,960
again in four weeks

1542
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,760
to see if I still need a cast.

1543
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,150
Let me get that for you.

1544
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,260
You best not mess up

1545
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,260
my Baked Alaska.

1546
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,290
No, ma'am.
