1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,530
We are three weeks

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,530
into IVF.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,330
You know what they say,

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,330
you blink and the kids

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,330
are grown.

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,370
Dr. Hannah Asher,

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,370
Gynecology.

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,780
You shouldn't

9
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,780
even be working.

10
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,370
You OD'd. For all I know,

11
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,370
you're high right now.

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,380
How about you and I

13
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,380
keep our distance

14
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,380
from one another?

15
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,510
Just as soon as you

16
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,510
stop treating patients

17
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,050
and seek treatment

18
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,050
for your addiction.

19
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,680
If I go down, so do you.

20
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,850
So does the site.

21
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,790
Dr. Asher.

22
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,720
Could you say that any louder?

23
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,700
Not sure

24
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,700
everybody heard you.

25
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,830
Sorry.

26
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,740
I wasn't trying

27
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,740
to blow your spot.

28
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,100
Yeah, well, remember.

29
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,870
You tell on me,

30
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,870
I tell on you.

31
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,100
Thanks for the reminder.

32
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,230
Hmm.

33
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,640
Why are you here?

34
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey, hey. Wait.

35
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,580
Let's start over.

36
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,050
Okay, can we talk?

37
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,250
About options

38
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,250
to get clean?

39
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,020
Yeah, like I appreciate

40
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,020
you wanting to help,

41
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,680
but I'm not really

42
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,680
in the mood

43
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,680
for a lecture right now.

44
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,860
Hannah.

45
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,860
You're a doctor.

46
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,520
You know what

47
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,520
you're doing

48
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,520
to your body.

49
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,830
Yeah, so, I know

50
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,830
that this can't

51
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,830
last forever.

52
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,660
Okay, then

53
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,660
why don't you want

54
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,660
to do something about it?

55
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,860
I can get you an intake

56
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,860
at a rehab facility.

57
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,770
I can't just

58
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,770
go to rehab.

59
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,870
Okay? I have a job.

60
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,870
I have responsibilities.

61
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,870
Okay,

62
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,870
Narcotics Anonymous then.

63
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,530
You can drop

64
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,530
in and out.

65
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,840
There's a meeting

66
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,840
at the church

67
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,640
right around the corner

68
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,640
from the hospital.

69
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,320
8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

70
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,320
One hour of your time.

71
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,440
You won't even

72
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,440
be late to work.

73
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,590
Okay.

74
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,590
Yeah?

75
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,460
I'll go.

76
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,130
All right.

77
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,470
Thank you.

78
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,090
Hey.

79
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,090
Hi.

80
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,350
So,

81
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,090
wonder if

82
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,090
it's gonna snow today.

83
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,830
Crockett, it's okay.

84
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,090
What happened

85
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,090
is in the past.

86
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,470
Can't remember what it was.

87
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,070
Desmond, what do we got?

88
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,910
Rick Tyler, 40, passenger

89
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,910
in a motor vehicle collision.

90
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,110
Intubated in the field.

91
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,380
BP 88 over 57,

92
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,380
heart rate's 70,

93
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,380
GCS six.

94
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,220
What happened?

95
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,220
Wife was driving the car

96
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,220
and ran a red light.

97
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,220
She's in the ambo behind us.

98
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
CFD had to use

99
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
the Jaws of Life

100
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,360
to pry them

101
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,360
from the wreckage.

102
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,950
Ouch. Need a hand?

103
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,950
Yep.

104
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,660
All right, we're gonna

105
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,660
transfer on my count.

106
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,930
Ready? One, two, three.

107
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,870
Need an X-ray in here.

108
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,000
Right leg's badly mangled.

109
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,000
Lost a lot of blood.

110
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,370
Hang two units of O-neg.

111
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,370
Trigger the MTP.

112
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,310
Breath sounds are clear.

113
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,310
Chest and pelvis.

114
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,010
BP's low.

115
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,010
We need to FAST him.

116
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,410
X-ray's ready.

117
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,410
Everyone stand back.

118
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,350
Chest is clear.

119
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,900
There's blood in the belly.

120
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,430
Dr. Manning.

121
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,430
Yeah.

122
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,870
His wife's coming

123
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,870
into Trauma 2.

124
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,730
I got him.

125
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,730
You get the missus.

126
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,860
Okay.

127
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,030
Hey, Mike.

128
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,030
Shoot the pelvis.

129
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,400
Then we're taking him

130
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,400
to the OR.

131
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,070
All right,

132
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,070
let's transfer on my count.

133
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,040
Ready? One, two, three.

134
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,410
Her name's Kim.

135
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,780
BP 115 over 75.

136
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,980
Heart rate's 90. GCS 15.

137
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,750
Hi, Kim. I'm Dr. Manning.

138
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,750
I didn't see the light change.

139
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,350
All I care about is

140
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,350
your well-being.

141
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,860
All right, I'm gonna

142
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,860
check your neck, okay?

143
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,990
Okay.

144
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,860
All right, let's see.

145
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, can you touch

146
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,000
your chin to your chest?

147
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,270
How does that feel?

148
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,270
Any pain?

149
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,230
I'm okay.

150
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,230
All right.

151
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,810
Help me roll her over

152
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,810
so I can check her spine.

153
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,240
We're gonna do it

154
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,240
on my count.

155
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,940
All right,

156
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,940
one, two, three.

157
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,810
You're doing great.

158
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,220
All right. Let's see.

159
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,220
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

160
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,320
Kim, were you in an accident

161
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,320
prior to this one?

162
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,760
You have significant bruises

163
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,760
all down your lower back.

164
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,320
Must be from the crash.

165
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,260
It couldn't be

166
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,260
from the crash.

167
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,630
Bruises take a while

168
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,630
to turn yellow like this.

169
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,430
Yeah, I fell last week.

170
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,230
On the stairs.

171
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,230
I forgot.

172
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,930
All right.

173
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,940
Kim? I have to ask.

174
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,240
Did someone do this to you?

175
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,240
No.

176
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,910
Because if someone did...

177
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,910
No, I fell.

178
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,010
Okay.

179
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,020
But there's a goose egg

180
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,020
on her forehead.

181
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
I'd like to get a head CT.

182
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,810
My husband Rick...

183
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,820
Is he...

184
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,820
He's headed into surgery now.

185
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,150
Okay.

186
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,990
Dr. Manning?

187
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,990
Yeah.

188
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,000
Those bruises...

189
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,670
She was abused, right?

190
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
Come on, everyone.

191
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
Meeting's starting.

192
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,400
Hey. You free

193
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,400
for an intake?

194
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,980
Yeah. Your sister called.

195
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,510
Vincent's transitioning

196
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,510
to a toddler bed,

197
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,380
and she asked

198
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,380
if we want his crib.

199
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,540
He's getting so big.

200
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,910
And it's kind of early

201
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,910
for that,

202
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,380
but we're gonna need a crib

203
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,380
at some point, right?

204
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,820
I mean, yeah.

205
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,650
It is one less thing

206
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,650
to worry about.

207
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,320
I can pick it up tonight.

208
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,080
Hey.

209
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,860
I'm Dr. Choi.

210
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,860
This is Nurse Sexton.

211
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,860
Hi.

212
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,060
Nina. This is Harlan,

213
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,060
my husband.

214
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,030
Aw, I love it

215
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,030
when you call me that.

216
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,660
Newlyweds?

217
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,660
A month ago.

218
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,330
But we're still working

219
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,330
our way through the cake.

220
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,770
Ooh, but it's delicious.

221
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,200
So, what brings you in?

222
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,610
This awful rash.

223
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,840
It goes all the way

224
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,840
up my neck.

225
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,170
It's all over my legs.

226
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,380
My gynecologist prescribed me

227
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,380
fluconazole last week

228
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,510
for a yeast infection.

229
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,310
Could that be related?

230
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,310
Maybe.

231
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,720
What about something

232
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,720
in my apartment, maybe?

233
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,850
Nina just moved in.

234
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,390
Hadn't been cleaned

235
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,390
since 2015.

236
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,390
Okay.

237
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,550
Well, you're definitely

238
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,550
allergic to something.

239
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,860
We're gonna order some labs,

240
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,360
and get an antihistamine

241
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,360
for you,

242
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,950
then come back

243
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,950
for a full allergen history.

244
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,460
We'll get this rash

245
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,460
under control.

246
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,130
Aw, but I love you

247
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,130
all red and puffy.

248
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,030
Oh, come here, you.

249
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,030
No, you come here.

250
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,780
Missed you at the meeting.

251
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,720
So, you're stalking me now.

252
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,590
Do you do this

253
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,590
with all the women

254
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,720
that leave the injection site,

255
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,720
or am I special?

256
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,260
I'm just concerned.

257
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,460
Yeah, okay, if I had known

258
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,460
going to a safe injection site

259
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,590
would result in

260
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,590
you hounding me,

261
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,760
I never would've gone

262
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,760
in the first place.

263
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,140
Hi, I'm Dr. Lanik,

264
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,140
this is Ms. Curry,

265
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,140
fourth year medical student.

266
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,800
Hi, I'm Vanessa,

267
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,800
Xavier's mom.

268
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,280
And this is

269
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,280
my boyfriend, Alvin.

270
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,620
So, I see Xavier was diagnosed

271
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,620
as being in a persistent

272
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,620
vegetative state

273
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,020
at Norris Memorial

274
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,020
after a bike accident?

275
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,110
Yeah, about five months ago,

276
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,110
he hit his head.

277
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,780
So, what brings you in today?

278
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,590
I was changing Xavier's

279
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,590
clothes this morning,

280
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,090
and I noticed

281
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,090
a sore on his hip.

282
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,290
Maybe I left him

283
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,290
on his side too long?

284
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,830
I'm just worried

285
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,830
it's infected.

286
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,530
Let's roll him.

287
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,530
Okay.

288
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,270
We call that

289
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,270
a pressure ulcer.

290
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,140
Yeah, it does

291
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,140
look infected.

292
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,980
Have you been managing

293
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,980
Xavier's care at home?

294
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,780
Since he was discharged

295
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,780
from the hospital

296
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,440
about four months ago.

297
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,040
See the granulation

298
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,040
in the center?

299
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,820
We'll go ahead and clean

300
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,820
and dress the wound.

301
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,950
Okay.

302
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,680
So, it should never

303
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,680
get to this point.

304
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,990
We try to

305
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,990
turn him regularly.

306
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,360
Well, there's actually

307
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,360
an air mattress

308
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,360
that can help with that.

309
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,300
We'll send you home today

310
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,300
with some antibiotics,

311
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,230
but why don't you come

312
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,230
with me, and we can

313
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,230
go over a handout

314
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,740
about how to

315
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,740
prevent bed sores?

316
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,860
Keep this from

317
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,860
happening again.

318
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,050
Talk to me, Marty.

319
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,690
BP's better.

320
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,690
He's gotten a lot of blood.

321
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,530
Packed his liver crack

322
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,530
pretty well.

323
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,930
Bleeding should no longer

324
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,930
be an issue.

325
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,090
I'm worried.

326
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,600
There's only 10 CCs

327
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,600
of urine in his Foley.

328
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Dark and brown.

329
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
I sent a sample for labs.

330
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,510
Could mean

331
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,510
he's in rhabdo.

332
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,740
Let's remove

333
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,740
the drape please.

334
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,870
Nice and easy.

335
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,540
Yeah. Leg's not looking good.

336
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,550
Muscle is dying

337
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,550
and dumping off

338
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,550
into the bloodstream.

339
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,750
Lab report?

340
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,750
CPK levels are high.

341
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,350
25,000.

342
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,350
Whoa!

343
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,220
That does indicate rhabdo.

344
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,120
Leg's gotta come off

345
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,120
or it's gonna kill him.

346
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,020
Gotta talk to his wife.

347
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,770
So, based on your scans

348
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,770
and neuro exam,

349
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,740
we can safely rule out

350
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,740
a traumatic brain injury.

351
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,870
Yeah.

352
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,380
But I do want to

353
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,380
ask you again

354
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,380
about the bruising...

355
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,070
I told you. I fell.

356
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,940
Hi, Mrs. Tyler?

357
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,950
I'm Dr. Marcel.

358
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,540
I'm the surgeon who operated

359
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,540
on your husband, Rick.

360
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,710
How is he?

361
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,760
He had a bad liver injury

362
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,760
and he's still pretty sick.

363
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,920
So, is he going to live?

364
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,120
Well, we got

365
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,120
the bleeding

366
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,120
under control,

367
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,490
but my main concern

368
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,490
is his right leg.

369
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,660
The muscle is dying,

370
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,660
and it's poisoning

371
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,660
his blood,

372
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,390
which in turn

373
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,390
is hurting his kidneys,

374
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,230
putting him

375
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,230
in renal failure...

376
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,230
What does all that mean?

377
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,290
Rick's leg is

378
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,290
making him very sick.

379
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,800
It will kill him.

380
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,640
And I need your consent

381
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,640
to amputate.

382
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,000
He has to lose a leg?

383
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,340
Isn't there something else

384
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,340
you can do?

385
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
I'm sorry.

386
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,250
He'll be so upset.

387
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,980
Kim, I know this is

388
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,980
a lot to deal with.

389
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,180
I...

390
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,250
I'm not...

391
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,160
I'm not sure

392
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,160
what Rick would want.

393
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,030
He might rather be dead

394
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,030
than have only one leg, he...

395
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,860
You sure there's nothing else

396
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,860
you can do?

397
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,590
Not that I'd advise.

398
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,590
Please, tell me.

399
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,440
We could move him

400
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,440
to the ICU

401
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,440
and do the best we can

402
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,440
to keep him alive.

403
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,670
That might give us

404
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,670
some time

405
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,670
for him to wake up

406
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,800
and make the decision

407
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,800
himself.

408
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,940
Okay.

409
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,440
Let's do that.

410
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,340
Every second we wait

411
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,340
increases the risk

412
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,120
of him dying

413
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,120
of multi-organ failure.

414
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,950
I understand, but...

415
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,880
He should

416
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,880
be the one to decide.

417
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,490
Okay.

418
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,730
I'll be back in a moment.

419
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,730
Hey.

420
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,730
Yeah?

421
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,170
I am not

422
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,170
comfortable with this.

423
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,870
That woman was abused

424
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,870
by her husband.

425
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,380
You sure about that?

426
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,380
Yes.

427
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,810
And in my opinion, she should

428
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,810
not be making this decision.

429
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,890
What are the chances

430
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,890
Mr. Tyler does wake up

431
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,890
on his own

432
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,480
to make this call?

433
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,420
Slim.

434
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,360
Rick needs

435
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,360
to have his leg

436
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,360
amputated.

437
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,660
And I don't think it's right

438
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,660
to have Kim decide

439
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,070
if he's been abusing her.

440
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,370
Why not?

441
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,370
Because it's

442
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,370
a life or death call.

443
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,000
And she's not

444
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,000
in the right frame

445
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,000
of mind to make it.

446
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,910
She's too vulnerable,

447
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,910
and it's a decision

448
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,240
she'll have to live with

449
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,240
for the rest of her life.

450
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,040
So, let me get this straight.

451
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,210
We're gonna take away

452
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,210
the legal rights

453
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,210
of an abuse victim

454
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,720
because she was abused.

455
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,520
No, it's more

456
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,520
complex than that.

457
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,450
I mean, considering

458
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,450
the emotional

459
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,360
and psychological burden

460
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,360
that Kim's been under,

461
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,090
I really feel like

462
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,090
the hospital

463
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,090
should step in.

464
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,250
She's his wife.

465
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,060
She's entitled to make

466
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,060
this decision.

467
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,530
Then, you're in favor of him

468
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,530
not having the surgery?

469
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,470
I'm in favor

470
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,470
of respecting the rights

471
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,130
of the next of kin

472
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,130
to decide...

473
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,970
Even if it goes against

474
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,970
what's best surgically.

475
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,810
All right, I'll convene

476
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,810
an ethics committee.

477
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,650
Until then,

478
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,650
do everything you can

479
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,650
to keep Mr. Tyler alive.

480
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,220
Strange, isn't it?

481
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,320
Mmm-hmm.

482
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,650
Is this consistent

483
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,650
with a vegetative state?

484
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,960
No, it is not.

485
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,590
You know what?

486
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,590
Send me his chart.

487
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,460
Okay?

488
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,460
As soon as you can.

489
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,590
Okay.

490
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,940
What was Dr. Charles

491
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,940
doing in here?

492
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,580
Um, I thought he might

493
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,580
have some insights

494
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,580
into Xavier's condition.

495
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,240
Have you guys noticed

496
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,240
that his legs can stay up

497
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,240
like this?

498
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,510
We thought that was

499
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,510
part of his condition.

500
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,180
Ms. Curry? A word.

501
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,750
Excuse me.

502
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,260
Ms. Curry, you had no right

503
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,260
to consult another department

504
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,690
without clearing it

505
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,690
with me first.

506
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,790
You were busy

507
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,790
and I had a concern.

508
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,270
I mean, how do you

509
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,270
explain Xavier's leg

510
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,460
staying up on its own?

511
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,600
Probably just spasticity,

512
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,600
which is common

513
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,600
in a vegetative state.

514
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,300
Well, I've never heard of

515
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,300
muscle stiffness causing

516
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,300
that presentation.

517
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,500
Look, this kid was brought in

518
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,500
for a pressure ulcer,

519
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,340
so that is what

520
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,340
we're treating him for.

521
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,300
Okay.

522
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,350
Nina, you ready

523
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,350
for a scratch test?

524
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,980
I will give you two a minute.

525
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,490
The couple in Treatment 3

526
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,490
is having sex.

527
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,630
I don't get it.

528
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,470
The ED

529
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,470
is about the last place

530
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,470
I'd ever wanna have sex.

531
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,630
I know.

532
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,330
You know what?

533
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,210
God bless the couple

534
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,210
that can't keep

535
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,210
their hands off each other

536
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,870
even in this place.

537
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,070
Yeah.

538
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,410
What's going on?

539
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,490
Dr. Lanik is

540
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,490
sending them home.

541
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,880
Oh.

542
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,020
I'm Dr. Charles

543
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,020
with psychiatry.

544
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,530
I have been reviewing

545
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,530
Xavier's medical records.

546
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,730
And I think that

547
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,730
there's a very good chance

548
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,060
that he was

549
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,060
misdiagnosed there.

550
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,590
Misdiagnosed?

551
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,330
Yeah, I don't think your son

552
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,330
is in a vegetative state.

553
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,560
Do you know how his joints,

554
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,040
they stay in the same position

555
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,040
after they've been moved?

556
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,510
Mmm-hmm.

557
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,510
That's something called

558
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,510
waxy flexibility.

559
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,910
It is indicative

560
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,910
of only one condition.

561
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,710
Catatonia.

562
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,070
Catatonia?

563
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,340
Yeah, it's

564
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,340
a neuropsychiatric disorder

565
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,290
that can lead to paralysis,

566
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,290
but it's treatable.

567
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,550
And this was caused

568
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,550
by the head injury?

569
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,890
I'm suggesting that

570
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,890
this has nothing to do

571
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,260
with your son

572
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,260
hitting his head.

573
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,060
What's going on?

574
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,700
He's saying our son

575
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,700
might be catatonic.

576
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,420
Xavier was

577
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,420
fully evaluated

578
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,370
before being diagnosed

579
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,370
as being in a PVS.

580
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,740
Catatonia's a pretty

581
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,740
rare condition,

582
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,070
so without

583
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,070
a psychiatrist

584
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,070
weighing in,

585
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,980
it's possible that the doctors

586
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,980
at Norris weren't even

587
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,980
looking for it.

588
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,410
Yeah, but Xavier fell

589
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,410
off his bike.

590
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,410
He hit his head.

591
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,110
Yeah, but the scans were

592
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,110
inconclusive,

593
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,240
meaning that there was

594
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,240
no clear brain injury.

595
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,110
Look.

596
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,980
I think that

597
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,980
I can help your son.

598
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,280
But in order for me

599
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,280
to do that,

600
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,280
he needs to stay here.

601
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,220
Look, I'm just trying

602
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,220
to spare you

603
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,220
a bunch of tests

604
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,090
your son doesn't need,

605
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,090
so you don't wind up

606
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,090
right back where you are.

607
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,320
Wait.

608
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,730
We're staying.

609
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,140
All right, well, he is

610
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,140
discharged from my service,

611
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,270
so, Dan, if you wanna

612
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,270
admit him to yours,

613
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,400
be my guest.

614
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,110
Put him back

615
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,110
in his room please.

616
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,950
Somebody help! Please!

617
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,480
Babe, no, no, no.

618
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,480
Wake up.

619
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,490
Her rash suddenly

620
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,490
just flared up

621
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,490
and she just passed out.

622
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,260
Nina? Nina,

623
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,260
can you hear me?

624
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,630
She's not moving any air.

625
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,630
Pulse is thready.

626
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,130
Code blue, Treatment 3!

627
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,260
What's happening?

628
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,860
She's in

629
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,860
anaphylactic shock.

630
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,860
We need to intubate.

631
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,990
Bolus her a liter of NS,

632
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,110
and 0.3 milligrams

633
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,110
of epi IM, stat.

634
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,540
Nina? Nina!

635
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,110
Heart rate's in the 40s.

636
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,650
BP 70 over 33.

637
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,110
Atropine?

638
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,110
Yeah, push a mil IV.

639
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,720
Baby, baby,

640
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,720
come on, come on.

641
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,720
No, no, no, no, no.

642
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,110
I'm in.

643
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,230
Stats are coming up.

644
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,230
Pressure's still soft.

645
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,490
All right,

646
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,490
keep the fluids running.

647
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,530
Fifty of Benadryl IV,

648
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,530
start racemic epi,

649
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,000
and give her another dose

650
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,000
of epinephrine IM.

651
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,630
What caused this?

652
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,570
Catatonia only freezes

653
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,570
the voluntary muscle groups,

654
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,580
not the involuntary ones

655
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,580
like those that

656
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,580
help us breathe.

657
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,840
So if I'm right,

658
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,840
and Xavier is

659
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,840
indeed catatonic,

660
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,680
he does not need

661
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,680
the ventilator to breathe,

662
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,520
and we can disconnect it.

663
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,520
Wait.

664
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,720
But isn't that dangerous?

665
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,720
The doctor said

666
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,720
he'd die without it.

667
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,260
They said he wasn't...

668
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,260
What's the expression?

669
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,520
Protecting his airway.

670
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,520
He has a trach.

671
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,160
Which means that we can

672
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,160
always reconnect the vent

673
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,160
if he needs it.

674
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,670
Do, uh, do we have

675
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,670
your permission?

676
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,340
Yes.

677
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,710
Okay.

678
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,340
Ms. Curry?

679
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,630
Okay, SATS are dropping. 92.

680
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,570
Ninety.

681
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,570
Isn't that bad?

682
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,200
Not necessarily.

683
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,200
As carbon dioxide builds up,

684
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,400
it should kick

685
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,400
his respiratory system

686
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,400
into drive.

687
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,900
Eighty-five.

688
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,370
Dr. Charles.

689
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,710
He's not breathing!

690
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,810
Wait, wait, wait.

691
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,550
Oh, my God.

692
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,790
Xavier?

693
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,570
My little boy!

694
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,600
What does this mean?

695
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,600
What do we do now?

696
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,740
Well,

697
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,300
probably not a bad idea

698
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,300
to try and figure out

699
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,440
what put him

700
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,440
into a catatonic state

701
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,440
in the first place.

702
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,260
So the first doctor

703
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,260
to explain catatonia

704
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,200
about 150 years ago,

705
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,200
Dr. Kahlbaum, described it as

706
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,000
"immobility induced

707
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,000
by severe mental shock,"

708
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,200
like an emotional trauma.

709
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,510
Well, I mean it's like a...

710
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,510
Like a deer caught

711
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,510
in the headlights.

712
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,710
But instead of bounding

713
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,710
into the forest,

714
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,650
they stay there, frozen.

715
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,320
What, like PTSD?

716
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,220
I'm a cop.

717
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,220
I've seen PTSD.

718
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,160
It doesn't look

719
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,160
anything like this.

720
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,160
And there's been no trauma.

721
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,190
Xavier was always

722
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,190
a happy kid.

723
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,290
Okay, you mind telling me

724
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,290
a little bit more about...

725
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,390
About your home life?

726
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,160
It was good...

727
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,030
Before this happened.

728
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,500
I mean, there have been

729
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,500
some rough patches.

730
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,500
My ex, Xavier's father,

731
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,500
left us high and dry

732
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,010
when Xavier was

733
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,010
a little boy,

734
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,640
but we got through it.

735
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,210
And then Alvin came

736
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,210
into the picture.

737
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,480
Yeah, we started dating

738
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,480
five years ago.

739
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,640
We've been living together

740
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,640
for the past three years.

741
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,320
How about school?

742
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,850
Xavier's always been

743
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,850
a good student.

744
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,690
Loved reading.

745
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,230
Friends?

746
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,230
Lots.

747
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,890
I used to take them all

748
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,890
to White Sox games.

749
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
He did watch this movie

750
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
Poltergeist,

751
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,000
which gave him nightmares.

752
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,000
But that was a few years ago.

753
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,070
Unlikely that one movie is

754
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,070
gonna induce catatonia.

755
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,910
I have to take this.

756
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,840
I'm working a task force

757
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,840
with the DEA.

758
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,940
Sorry.

759
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,210
Alvin here. Yeah.

760
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,220
How did Xavier feel

761
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,220
about Alvin's work?

762
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,390
Alvin's always been good

763
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,390
about not bringing it home

764
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,390
with him.

765
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,120
He took all the precautions.

766
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,120
Keeps his gun in a safe.

767
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,460
But still, did he ever

768
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,460
talk to you about

769
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,460
how he felt about

770
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,470
the fact that Alvin

771
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,470
was a police officer?

772
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,900
Xavier's a 10-year-old boy.

773
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,800
Alvin being a cop is like

774
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,700
having a superhero

775
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,700
sleeping down the hall.

776
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,800
Hmm.

777
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,880
Why would you ask that?

778
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,210
Just trying to get

779
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,210
some background.

780
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,450
Alvin's the best father figure

781
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,450
Xavier could ever have.

782
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,720
You don't have to

783
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,720
worry about that.

784
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,790
Hey, why did you stop?

785
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,090
It seemed like

786
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,090
you were on to something.

787
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,290
I think we're getting

788
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,290
to a sensitive area here.

789
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,170
So I just like to,

790
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,170
you know, take a pause

791
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,170
before we push forward,

792
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,340
but Alvin's work life

793
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,610
is absolutely something

794
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,610
that we want to look into.

795
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,290
Nina's stable for now.

796
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,520
It doesn't make sense.

797
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,520
The antihistamine

798
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,520
was working.

799
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,920
So she must have been

800
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,920
re-exposed to the allergen.

801
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,120
I guess we can move her

802
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,120
to a clean room.

803
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,320
But she had the rash before

804
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,320
she even came to the hospital.

805
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,360
Yeah, I just wish we could've

806
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,360
gotten that scratch test.

807
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,370
I tried,

808
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,370
but they were indisposed.

809
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,200
Before I could get

810
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,200
back in there, she crashed.

811
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,330
Indisposed?

812
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,500
What do you mean,

813
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,500
"indisposed?"

814
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,170
Were they having sex?

815
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,940
Yeah.

816
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,310
We need to talk

817
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,310
to Harlan.

818
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,010
Harlan, I'm not here

819
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,010
to judge you,

820
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,950
but I gather you and Nina

821
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,950
had sex in the hospital.

822
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,710
Uh, I'm sorry

823
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,710
you had to walk in on that.

824
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,320
Did you finish?

825
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,320
Jeez, man.

826
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,190
It's pertinent, Harlan.

827
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,190
We need to know.

828
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,560
Did you ejaculate?

829
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,030
I did, yes.

830
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,070
I'm gonna write her an order.

831
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,070
You need to go to the lab.

832
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,550
Maggie.

833
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,550
Yeah.

834
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,480
What's the story

835
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,480
with the patient in 5?

836
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,320
Uh, second trimester

837
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,320
with preeclampsia.

838
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,880
Dr. Asher's seeing her now.

839
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,820
You all right?

840
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,760
Yeah, just have to do

841
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,760
something I don't want to do.

842
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,030
Well, in my experience,

843
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,030
better to not hesitate.

844
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,570
Just rip the Band-Aid off.

845
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,560
Thanks.

846
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,580
So after reviewing

847
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,580
the details

848
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,580
of Rick Tyler's case,

849
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,220
the ethics committee

850
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,220
has decided to take away

851
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,920
decision-making rights

852
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,920
from Kim.

853
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,050
Wow.

854
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,190
Kim's choice to wait

855
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,190
on amputating Rick's leg

856
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,860
puts his life

857
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,860
at unnecessary risk

858
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,900
and the committee

859
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,900
believes that Kim,

860
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,630
whatever her circumstances,

861
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,630
doesn't appreciate that risk.

862
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,270
Okay.

863
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,780
So you can take

864
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,780
Mr. Tyler to surgery.

865
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,140
All right.

866
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,570
I have to go tell Kim now.

867
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,950
Why don't I come with you?

868
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,080
Thanks.

869
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,980
Yeah?

870
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,460
Dr. Charles?

871
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,460
Come on in.

872
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,720
I called over to CPD,

873
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,720
and I found out some

874
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,560
pretty interesting things

875
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,560
about Detective James.

876
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,390
Without asking him?

877
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,260
Why?

878
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,130
Because you said

879
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,130
you didn't want

880
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,130
to bother them?

881
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,940
Until they were

882
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,940
ready to talk again.

883
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,640
What about

884
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,640
their privacy, Elsa?

885
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,970
Alvin's not the patient.

886
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,110
I mean, it's not like

887
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,110
I violated

888
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,110
anyone's HIPAA rights.

889
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,610
Well, that is,

890
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,610
in fact, debatable,

891
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,680
but you definitely

892
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,680
violated their trust.

893
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,820
This family's in a very

894
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,820
delicate place, Elsa.

895
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,980
They... They need to feel

896
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,980
like we're on their side,

897
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,650
or they could just

898
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,650
walk out the door.

899
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,250
Okay.

900
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,970
Do you wanna see what

901
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,970
I found out or not?

902
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,280
What's going on?

903
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,280
This is Sharon Goodwin.

904
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,110
She's the Executive Director

905
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,110
of Patient Services.

906
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,810
What's going on?

907
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,810
We're moving forward

908
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,350
with your husband's

909
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,350
amputation.

910
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,140
But I said

911
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,140
I wanted to wait!

912
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,150
The hospital believes

913
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,150
it's in your husband's

914
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,150
best interest

915
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,280
to take control

916
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,280
of his medical decisions.

917
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,690
Why?

918
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,690
Kim, I saw

919
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,690
signs of abuse.

920
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,690
We don't think you should

921
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,690
have to be responsible

922
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,630
for someone who might

923
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,630
be hurting you.

924
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,220
Kim? Hey, Kim.

925
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,230
Whatever your situation is,

926
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,230
it does not have to

927
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,230
stay that way.

928
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,570
You can talk to us.

929
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,010
When he wakes up,

930
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,180
and he remembers

931
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,180
I was driving the car...

932
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,510
It is my fault

933
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,510
he lost his leg!

934
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,210
There are shelters that can

935
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,210
provide you a safe haven.

936
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,190
You'll be taken to

937
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,190
a secret location where

938
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,190
no visitors are allowed.

939
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,490
Please, Kim.

940
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,490
Let us help you.

941
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,890
Okay.

942
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,900
I'll think about it.

943
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,880
Detective James,

944
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,880
I want to apologize.

945
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,420
I called CPD

946
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,420
to ask about you.

947
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,380
My thought was that

948
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,380
I might learn something

949
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,950
that could be helpful,

950
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,950
but I... I overstepped,

951
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,950
and I'm sorry.

952
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,360
Xavier's your patient.

953
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,920
Why would you be

954
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,920
checking up on me?

955
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,550
Ms. Curry

956
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,550
made a mistake.

957
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,290
A serious mistake.

958
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,290
I just hope that you'd

959
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,290
appreciate that

960
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,700
what she was trying to do was

961
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,700
gain a better understanding

962
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,630
of Xavier's situation

963
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,630
so that

964
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,040
we can give him

965
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,040
the best possible care.

966
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,410
And I hope she learned

967
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,410
what a good man...

968
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,410
What a good cop Alvin is.

969
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,970
Matter of fact,

970
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,970
she did.

971
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
You have an outstanding

972
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
record, Detective.

973
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,480
You took out the Southside

974
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,480
Ministers gang on your own?

975
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,080
I had a lot of help.

976
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,980
Sounds intense.

977
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,980
I mean, they put

978
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,980
a hit out on you.

979
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,320
They blew up your car.

980
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,560
What does this

981
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,560
have to do with anything?

982
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,100
Well, it just sounds like

983
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,100
a pretty monumental event.

984
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,290
Do you think that

985
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,290
there's any chance that

986
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,770
Xavier could've

987
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,770
been aware of it?

988
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,760
I don't think so.

989
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,760
The car was parked

990
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,760
around the corner.

991
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,600
So, he didn't witness

992
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,600
any of it?

993
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,400
I mean, he may have seen

994
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,400
the wreckage towed away.

995
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,500
There's no way he could've

996
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,500
understood what happened.

997
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,980
But I'm sure you were

998
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,980
probably pretty upset,

999
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,980
Vanessa.

1000
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,280
You think that he could've

1001
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,280
picked up on that?

1002
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,910
Alvin moved out after that.

1003
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,650
He stayed away while there was

1004
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,650
an active threat against him.

1005
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,620
Just out of curiosity,

1006
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,620
when did you move back in?

1007
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,830
It was about a week

1008
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,830
before Xavier became

1009
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,830
catatonic.

1010
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,470
Alvin would never let

1011
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,470
anything happen to us.

1012
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,030
He didn't do anything wrong.

1013
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,630
I'm not suggesting

1014
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,630
that he did.

1015
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,630
Then what are you suggesting?

1016
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,110
I'm suggesting

1017
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,110
that Alvin works

1018
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,110
in a very scary world

1019
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,620
and that, on some level,

1020
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,620
Xavier very much

1021
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,620
understands that.

1022
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,780
And his fear about

1023
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,780
the possible consequences

1024
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,050
could very well

1025
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,050
have triggered

1026
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,050
his catatonic state.

1027
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,320
So what does this mean?

1028
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,320
That Alvin needs to leave us?

1029
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,690
Look, honey, it's just...

1030
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,690
No, you are the best thing

1031
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,490
that's ever happened to me

1032
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,490
and Xavier.

1033
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,230
We've heard enough.

1034
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,870
Hey, Sean.

1035
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,870
Will.

1036
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,040
I have you on schedule

1037
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,040
for tomorrow night.

1038
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,210
Right. Thing is...

1039
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,880
It's not such a good idea

1040
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,880
for me to be involved

1041
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,010
with the site right now.

1042
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,850
Wait, we're really starting

1043
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,850
to make a difference

1044
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,850
with these people,

1045
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,390
in large part

1046
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,390
'cause of you.

1047
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,820
Appreciate that.

1048
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,930
But I want what's best

1049
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,930
for the site,

1050
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,000
and that means

1051
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,000
I have to go.

1052
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,250
I'm sorry.

1053
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,600
Are we at risk here?

1054
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,530
I think my leaving

1055
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,530
will protect you.

1056
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,830
Thanks.

1057
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,840
Think you're ready

1058
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,840
to have this out.

1059
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,680
Take a deep breath.

1060
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,680
All right,

1061
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,680
hard exhale.

1062
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,790
There we go.

1063
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,290
What happened?

1064
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,420
You had another

1065
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,420
allergic reaction.

1066
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,620
Yeah, I'm...

1067
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,850
I'm the problem, honey.

1068
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,590
It's me.

1069
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,200
What are you talking about?

1070
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,630
We ran tests

1071
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,630
on Harlan's semen,

1072
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,470
and it turns out

1073
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,470
you're allergic to it.

1074
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,900
What?

1075
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,130
No...

1076
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,300
It was never an issue before

1077
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,300
because you used condoms,

1078
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,470
which you stopped

1079
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,470
once you started trying

1080
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,470
to get pregnant.

1081
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,640
His semen? Come on.

1082
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,280
Oh, my God.

1083
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,280
So what are you saying?

1084
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,650
We can't have sex anymore?

1085
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,990
Yeah, what about kids?

1086
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,990
There are options.

1087
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,160
We'll get you to

1088
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,160
a fertility specialist.

1089
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,890
There are multiple

1090
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,890
procedures you could do.

1091
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,430
We'll also set you up

1092
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,430
with an allergist.

1093
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,830
There might be some methods to

1094
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,830
help you build up a tolerance.

1095
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,090
With treatment,

1096
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,090
your sensitivity may lessen.

1097
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,570
Meanwhile, you can go back

1098
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,570
to having sex with condoms.

1099
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,070
Hey, you two obviously

1100
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,070
love one another.

1101
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,440
You'll work this out.

1102
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,310
Just keep an EpiPen

1103
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,310
on your nightstand.

1104
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,080
You know, walking in

1105
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,080
on them like that

1106
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,180
got me thinking, um...

1107
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,800
Ever since

1108
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,800
we started IVF,

1109
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,530
I feel like

1110
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,530
the only time

1111
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,530
you touch me

1112
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,200
is when you're injecting me

1113
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,200
with hormones.

1114
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,460
You're right.

1115
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,540
How about

1116
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,540
we have a date

1117
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,540
tonight?

1118
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,840
And stay home?

1119
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,010
I'd like that.

1120
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,380
Come in.

1121
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,330
I'm sorry. I didn't

1122
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,330
mean to intrude.

1123
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,330
You got a minute?

1124
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,330
Of course.

1125
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,400
Um...

1126
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,680
You were right.

1127
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,640
My job.

1128
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,320
I do bring

1129
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,320
my work home with me

1130
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,550
whether I want to or not.

1131
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,560
And Xavier knows that.

1132
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,200
"Do the bad guys know

1133
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,200
where we live?"

1134
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,570
He asked me that once.

1135
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,240
And I told him

1136
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,240
that they didn't.

1137
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,570
But the fact

1138
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,570
that he had to ask...

1139
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,680
I mean, it

1140
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,680
kind of says it all.

1141
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,440
Doesn't it?

1142
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,510
Yeah.

1143
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,180
My job is

1144
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,180
to protect people.

1145
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,050
And if I can protect my...

1146
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,220
My son

1147
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,450
just by stepping aside,

1148
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,450
then that's what I'm gonna do.

1149
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,060
Look. Alvin.

1150
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,870
If you feel you need

1151
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,870
to get a little space

1152
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,370
while Xavier's coming out

1153
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,370
of this,

1154
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,570
while he's recovering

1155
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,570
his faculties,

1156
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,310
maybe that's

1157
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,310
not a bad idea.

1158
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,940
But

1159
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,540
as soon as he's ready

1160
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,540
to start the therapy

1161
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,550
that he needs

1162
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,550
to process his fear,

1163
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,050
you need to be right there

1164
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,050
next to him,

1165
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,560
so you can heal together.

1166
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,460
And move forward.

1167
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,830
Like as a family?

1168
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,290
Yeah.

1169
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,670
Is he going to

1170
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,670
wake up now?

1171
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,410
Well, after the surgery,

1172
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,410
and all the drugs,

1173
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,240
it'll be a while

1174
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,240
before he does.

1175
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,580
Okay.

1176
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,280
This might

1177
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,280
sound crazy, but...

1178
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,430
I think he really

1179
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,430
does love me.

1180
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,460
That's not crazy.

1181
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,330
A social worker

1182
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,330
will be by shortly

1183
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,340
to talk to you

1184
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,340
about your options.

1185
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,270
Thanks, Dr. Manning.

1186
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,870
Dr. Manning.

1187
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,610
You remember

1188
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,610
our social worker,

1189
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,610
Arlene Baker?

1190
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,810
Yes, hi.

1191
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,350
How's Ms. Tyler doing?

1192
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,480
She's anxious.

1193
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,840
Understandable.

1194
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,550
I think I can

1195
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,550
allay some of her fears.

1196
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,300
No pulse. He's in PEA.

1197
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,990
Starting compressions.

1198
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,330
Milligram of epi.

1199
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,710
Why's his ventilator off?

1200
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,710
I did it.

1201
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,740
How is this happening

1202
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,740
so fast?

1203
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,820
He's in multi-system

1204
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,820
organ failure.

1205
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,980
He had no reserve.

1206
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,880
Still no pulse.

1207
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,880
Another milligram of epi.

1208
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,520
Asystole.

1209
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,860
Time of death,

1210
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,600
18:08.

1211
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,210
I don't understand.

1212
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,590
She had options.

1213
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,020
I imagine she couldn't

1214
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,020
stomach the idea

1215
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,390
of looking over her shoulder

1216
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,390
the rest of her life

1217
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,560
waiting for her husband

1218
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,560
to get even.

1219
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,120
I thought we'd reached her.

1220
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,060
Considering

1221
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,060
what just happened,

1222
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,300
Kim might have

1223
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,300
run that red light

1224
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,300
this morning on purpose.

1225
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,940
And if she was willing

1226
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,940
to sacrifice herself

1227
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,980
to stop

1228
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,980
her husband's abuse?

1229
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,910
I doubt there was any way

1230
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,910
to reach her.

1231
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:57,980
Dr. Charles!

1232
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,930
Look, he's moving.

1233
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,430
Xavier, honey?

1234
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,430
Can you hear me?

1235
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,900
What do you want, baby?

1236
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,010
You thirsty?

1237
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,670
I can go get him

1238
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,670
some ice chips.

1239
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,320
Mommy's here.

1240
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,990
I'm here, baby.

1241
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,290
Mommy's here.

1242
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,700
Did he wake up?

1243
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,940
Yeah.

1244
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,280
Looks like

1245
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,280
he's coming out of it.

1246
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,040
That's my boy.

1247
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,980
Um...

1248
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,120
Will you

1249
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,120
send Vanessa out here

1250
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,820
when the time is right?

1251
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,460
Absolutely.

1252
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,370
Hey, you good?

1253
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,370
I heard what happened.

1254
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,300
It was awful.

1255
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,680
A lot of fine surgical work

1256
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,680
went to waste.

1257
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,980
Really? That's all

1258
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,980
you have to say?

1259
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,810
No, actually,

1260
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,810
I'd like to add

1261
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,750
that if we just let it be,

1262
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,750
he would've died on his own.

1263
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,750
Hey, you can't

1264
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,750
kill someone

1265
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,750
who's already dead.

1266
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,920
Can't even be tempted.

1267
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,890
Is that why

1268
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,890
you were so adamant

1269
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,390
about having Kim decide?

1270
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,860
Let me put it like this.

1271
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,430
A victim of abuse

1272
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,430
is being hauled off

1273
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,430
to jail.

1274
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,040
And in my opinion,

1275
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,040
that's a lousy outcome.

1276
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,240
I'll see you tomorrow,

1277
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,240
Natalie.

1278
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,120
That was a good catch

1279
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,120
today, Ms. Curry.

1280
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,420
Yeah, right.

1281
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,460
"Yeah, right"?

1282
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,460
Look, if it

1283
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,460
wasn't for you,

1284
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
Xavier might be back home

1285
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
on a vent for

1286
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
who knows how long.

1287
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,530
Really good thing that

1288
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,530
you piped up when you did.

1289
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,630
Good work. Well done.

1290
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,930
Asking a junkie

1291
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,930
to meet you in a bar.

1292
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
Not exactly sensitive.

1293
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,230
I guess not.

1294
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,800
Just a water for me.

1295
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,770
Sit.

1296
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,080
Look, I'm sorry

1297
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,080
about this morning.

1298
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,810
I may have

1299
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,810
overreacted a bit.

1300
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,080
That's okay.

1301
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,180
Hannah,

1302
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,490
I can't let this go on.

1303
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,860
If you won't

1304
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,860
turn yourself in...

1305
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
Look, I thought we had

1306
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
an understanding.

1307
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,470
I quit

1308
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,470
the injection site.

1309
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,500
I thought that it meant

1310
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,500
so much to you?

1311
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,040
Not more than this.

1312
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,040
I never would've

1313
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,040
turned you in.

1314
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,270
I just... I got...

1315
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,680
Desperate and scared.

1316
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,050
But you can't...

1317
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,220
You can't possibly know

1318
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,220
what it's like.

1319
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,400
Every day I say

1320
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm gonna quit and yet...

1321
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,620
Hannah.

1322
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,970
You don't have to

1323
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,970
do this alone.

1324
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,970
I'll be there.

1325
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,970
I'll help you.

1326
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,870
What?

1327
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,380
You care

1328
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,310
about me.

1329
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,150
I do.

1330
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,090
I do care.

1331
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,100
I will turn myself in.

1332
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,100
First thing in the morning.

1333
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,210
I can go with you.

1334
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,210
Yeah.

1335
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,440
Yeah.

1336
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,510
Yeah, I'd like that.

1337
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,340
Okay.

1338
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,760
Come to my place?

1339
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,040
Hey.

1340
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,740
Check it out.

1341
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,280
Looks good.

1342
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,550
Now we just have

1343
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,550
to set up the nursery.

1344
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,730
But in the meantime...

1345
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,770
How about that date?

1346
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,640
Hey.

1347
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,820
Everything okay?

1348
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,330
Yes.

1349
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,960
Come here.
