1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,930
I'm a horrible person,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,930
aren't I?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,700
No. You're human.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,240
After inseminating the eggs,

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,930
none of them fertilized.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,770
You can start

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,770
another cycle in

8
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,770
as little as six weeks.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,870
I'll do it.

10
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,620
It must've been

11
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,620
an agonizing decision,

12
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,620
turning in Hannah.

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,980
I think you did

14
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,980
the right thing.

15
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,140
Hannah, I was

16
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,140
just trying to...

17
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,350
Go and don't

18
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,350
come back again.

19
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,510
Go! Go! Go!

20
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,690
You're officially

21
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,690
in remission.

22
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,720
If you had one

23
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,720
wish right now,

24
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,720
what would it be?

25
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,060
To spend the rest

26
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,060
of my life with you.

27
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,690
You better not be playing

28
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,690
with me, because

29
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,690
I'd marry you tomorrow.

30
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,630
Finally.

31
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,830
What's the big emergency?

32
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,170
I'm late for work.

33
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,640
Sorry to inconvenience

34
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,640
you, Dan,

35
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,270
but your daughter

36
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,270
was sent home from school.

37
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,350
Suspended.

38
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,350
What?

39
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,880
For vaping.

40
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,280
God, Suzie...

41
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,250
Uh-uh-uh. No, no, no.

42
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,250
This one's your fault.

43
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,380
How's it my fault?

44
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,920
Because you've been

45
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,920
neglecting her.

46
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,220
I'm not the one who

47
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,220
moved to Milwaukee.

48
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,290
Okay, whatever you say.

49
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,290
Look, the point is,

50
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,090
we've been back in Chicago

51
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,090
almost a year,

52
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,220
and the past six months,

53
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,560
you found excuses not to

54
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,560
see her on the weekends.

55
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,600
You beg out of picking

56
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,600
her up after school.

57
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,870
Yeah. Look, I...

58
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,310
I've been

59
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,310
a little distracted,

60
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,370
you know, with CeCe

61
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,370
and everything...

62
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,210
I'm sorry your wife died, Dan.

63
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,210
I am.

64
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,410
But you have

65
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,410
a 13-year-old daughter

66
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,410
who's very much alive.

67
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,450
Is she in her room?

68
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,450
Where else?

69
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,950
It's Dad. Can I come in?

70
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,950
I'm coming in.

71
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,440
She took my phone.

72
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,560
Vaping? Really?

73
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,940
You know that's

74
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,940
gonna kill you, right?

75
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,170
You know I don't

76
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,170
care, right?

77
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,510
Get your schoolwork.

78
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,510
You're coming with me.

79
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,050
Where?

80
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,050
Work.

81
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,670
The hospital?

82
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,670
Yeah.

83
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,790
It's Father-Daughter Day,

84
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,790
and we're late.

85
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,750
Come on, get your stuff.

86
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,320
This is so stupid.

87
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,760
Yeah. You can

88
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,760
say that again.

89
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,820
The Opal Room

90
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,820
will let us start

91
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,820
setting up at noon.

92
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,660
No problem.

93
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,660
I can be there then.

94
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,430
No, you're gonna be

95
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,430
at the tailor's

96
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,430
trying on your tux.

97
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,940
I can't believe

98
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,940
you got all this

99
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,940
done in two weeks.

100
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,300
It's handled.

101
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,930
Maggie, I am

102
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,930
your maid of honor.

103
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,810
I should do something.

104
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,000
Well...

105
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,270
What?

106
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,980
Nothing.

107
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,320
The DJ will start

108
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,320
setting up at 5:00.

109
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,320
Okay...

110
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,910
Mags, I'm sorry

111
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,910
I gotta run.

112
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,910
Okay.

113
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,180
Bride's dressing room

114
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,180
at 6:00, okay?

115
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,310
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,680
All right.

117
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,520
What'd you think

118
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,520
about my playlist?

119
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,820
You won't mind

120
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,820
if I make changes, right?

121
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,130
Ms. Remus,

122
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,130
hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

123
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,030
And you must be Mindi.

124
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,230
Hi.

125
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,140
So, according to our chart,

126
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,140
you're no stranger to the ED.

127
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,180
Mindi was premature.

128
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,840
She's had a lot

129
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,840
of health issues.

130
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,010
I see. Respiratory

131
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,010
distress syndrome.

132
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,640
She has trouble breathing,

133
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,640
so, I keep her on oxygen.

134
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,720
Mmm. Well,

135
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,720
she's satting well.

136
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,520
100%. What brought

137
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,520
you in today?

138
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,020
She isn't sleeping.

139
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
It's even harder

140
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
for her to breathe.

141
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,050
And this morning,

142
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,050
she was just staring

143
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,050
at a wall,

144
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,760
which always happens

145
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,760
when she has a seizure.

146
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,870
All right, well, why don't

147
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,870
we take a look?

148
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,830
I'm gonna listen

149
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,830
to your lungs, okay?

150
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,830
Okay.

151
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Can you sit up

152
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,200
a little bit for me?

153
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,670
All right, now take

154
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,670
a deep breath in.

155
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,500
Good. How about

156
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,500
one more.

157
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,140
Great.

158
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,080
All right. Well,

159
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,080
her lungs sound good.

160
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,620
She's alert.

161
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,280
I'm not seeing any

162
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,280
sign of seizures now.

163
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,380
But we'll run some tests

164
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,380
to see what's going on.

165
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,620
Let's get a chest X-ray,

166
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
CBC, BMP, and let's

167
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,050
check her Keppra level.

168
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,180
I just wanna make sure

169
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,450
she's on

170
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,450
the appropriate dose.

171
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,160
I'll be back when we have

172
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,160
some answers, okay?

173
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,270
Dr. Manning. Do you

174
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,270
know Dr. Strauss?

175
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,860
I don't think

176
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,860
we've actually met yet.

177
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,860
You're in peds, right?

178
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,770
I specialize in

179
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,770
medical child abuse.

180
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,240
When Ms. Remus brought

181
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,240
her daughter in this morning,

182
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,540
it set off an alert.

183
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,700
An alert?

184
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,770
She's been red-flagged

185
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,770
at several hospitals

186
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,770
in the city.

187
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,940
Why?

188
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,480
We have every

189
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,480
reason to believe

190
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,640
she's been abusing

191
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,640
her daughter.

192
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,920
I gotta stop by

193
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,920
the cleaners after work,

194
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,830
pick up my suit for

195
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,830
Maggie's wedding tonight.

196
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,590
That's right.

197
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,070
Oh. Hey, you okay?

198
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,300
Yeah I just got a little

199
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,300
light-headed. I'm fine.

200
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,940
Are you sure?

201
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,940
Yeah, I'm sure.

202
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,940
I'm sure.

203
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Okay.

204
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,690
You can sit at my desk

205
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,880
and do your homework. Okay?

206
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,050
Don't I get to see

207
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,050
any crazy people?

208
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,560
Anna, how many

209
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,560
times have we

210
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,690
talked about your use

211
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,690
of that word?

212
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,970
And no, you don't get

213
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,970
to see my patients.

214
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,260
What's the point of me

215
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,260
being here, Dad?

216
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,360
What's the point?

217
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,410
The point is, you've been

218
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,410
suspended and you gotta

219
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,410
do your homework.

220
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,810
That's the point.

221
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,570
I bet it's not even

222
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,570
Father-Daughter Day, is it?

223
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,480
You just said that,

224
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,480
so you could

225
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,480
keep me in jail.

226
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,850
Wow.

227
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,580
You are so smart.

228
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,580
So, do your homework.

229
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,010
Look, I gotta go.

230
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,650
But I will be back.

231
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,720
And you and I

232
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,720
are gonna have

233
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,720
a little talk, okay?

234
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,880
Later.

235
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,570
Dr. Choi, Dr. Marcel,

236
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,570
GSW coming in. A cop.

237
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,570
Going to Baghdad.

238
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,040
John Bell, early 20s.

239
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,040
GSW, lower

240
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,040
right quadrant.

241
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,200
Stripped his body

242
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,200
armor in the ambo.

243
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,200
Hang in there, Johnny.

244
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,900
BP, 110 over 82,

245
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,900
heart rate 104.

246
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,340
Sats 100.

247
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,340
Doris, with me.

248
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,040
Yep.

249
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,040
Mike, gonna

250
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,040
need an X-ray.

251
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,380
KUB and chest.

252
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,680
Let's transfer

253
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,680
on my count.

254
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,020
Johnny's a hero.

255
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,020
He drew fire away

256
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,020
from a 10-year-old girl.

257
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,780
We got it, Rosado.

258
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,780
Everybody ready?

259
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,780
One, two, three.

260
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,550
That hurts!

261
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,260
Single lateral

262
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,260
gunshot wound.

263
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,330
No exit wound,

264
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,330
likely retained

265
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,330
the bullet.

266
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,200
All right,

267
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,200
bilateral breath sounds.

268
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Sorry about that,

269
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,600
focused lower

270
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,600
right quadrant pain.

271
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,970
Let's get that lateral

272
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,970
X-ray first.

273
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,970
Clear.

274
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,110
Retained bullet

275
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,110
in the posterior lateral,

276
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,110
definitely transabdominal.

277
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,240
That's enough

278
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,240
for me.

279
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,910
Okay, Officer Bell,

280
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,910
we're gonna take you

281
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,910
up for surgery, okay?

282
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,210
Okay.

283
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,210
All right. Doris,

284
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,950
let them know

285
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,950
we're coming up.

286
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,950
Yep.

287
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,080
How is he?

288
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,150
He is one of mine.

289
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,150
Do not give me any

290
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,150
of that HIPAA crap.

291
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,620
Trudy, Officer Bell's

292
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,620
vitals are good.

293
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,920
But the bullet's

294
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,920
in a dangerous spot.

295
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,120
We gotta get him

296
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,120
to surgery.

297
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,090
Do we need

298
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,090
Father Dan?

299
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,090
We're hoping no.

300
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,570
Hey. Keep me

301
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,570
in the loop on this one?

302
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,130
Why don't you

303
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,130
scrub in with me?

304
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,760
I understand you

305
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,760
know your way

306
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,760
around a gunshot wound.

307
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,270
Come on.

308
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,240
Dr. Charles?

309
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,680
We have a possible case

310
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,680
of Munchausen by proxy.

311
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,180
I believe Ms. Remus

312
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,180
is either faking her

313
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,180
daughter's symptoms,

314
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,520
or causing them to gain

315
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,520
attention for herself.

316
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,450
I just don't think

317
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,450
that's the case.

318
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,620
I spent time with her.

319
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,460
She seemed like a normal,

320
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,460
concerned parent.

321
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,920
This little girl Mindi

322
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,260
certainly has been

323
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,260
hospitalized a lot.

324
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,420
Based on vague symptoms,

325
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,130
which somehow health care

326
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,130
professionals don't see.

327
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,260
Just hold on a second.

328
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,830
I mean,

329
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,830
Mindi was diagnosed

330
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,630
with bronchopulmonary

331
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,630
dysplasia.

332
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,700
When she was an infant.

333
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,700
She's four, now.

334
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,280
Her mom's still

335
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,280
bringing her in for

336
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,280
nebulizer treatments.

337
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,640
Yeah, she's on a tremendous

338
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,640
amount of medication,

339
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,640
I will say that.

340
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,270
Which could be necessary,

341
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,270
given her history.

342
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,150
Let's not argue the case

343
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,150
until we have

344
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,150
more information.

345
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,810
Dr. Manning, let us know

346
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,810
if her test results

347
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,550
support the symptoms

348
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,550
her mother is describing.

349
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,890
And, Dr. Charles,

350
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,890
you'll need to

351
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,890
evaluate Ms. Remus.

352
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,290
If my suspicions

353
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,290
are correct,

354
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,530
then for Mindi's well-being,

355
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,530
we're gonna need

356
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,530
to get DCFS involved.

357
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,960
What you getting?

358
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,340
Look who's back.

359
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,980
I wouldn't want her

360
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,980
operating on me.

361
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,140
Nobody asked you.

362
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,550
Between Afghanistan

363
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,550
and Chicago,

364
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,090
I'm guessing

365
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,090
you've seen

366
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,090
all kinds of GSWs.

367
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,520
Mostly high-velocity

368
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,520
overseas handguns here.

369
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,060
Either way,

370
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,060
a world of loss.

371
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,590
Bullet went

372
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,590
through the cecum.

373
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,530
Need to repair.

374
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,530
2-0 Silk to me.

375
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,540
Whoa. Hold on.

376
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,200
Ethan, you see

377
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,200
that bulge?

378
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,830
Yeah. Large mass.

379
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,110
Hematoma?

380
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,840
No, too far

381
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,840
from the bullet track

382
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,840
to be related.

383
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,180
Okay, well, let's have

384
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,180
a look-see. Scalpel.

385
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,250
It's an abscess.

386
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,250
What the hell from?

387
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,630
Something foreign

388
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,630
must've caused

389
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,630
the abscess.

390
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,970
Ethan, what do

391
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,970
you make of this?

392
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
See if he's got scars

393
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
on his flank.

394
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,440
Yep.

395
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,440
And right next to it?

396
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,440
Entrance

397
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,440
and exit wounds.

398
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,320
Today wasn't

399
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,320
the first time

400
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,320
this patient was shot.

401
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,310
How can you be so sure?

402
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,410
Seen this before.

403
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,410
He was sitting in a car

404
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,410
when it happened.

405
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,820
So, this...

406
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,920
This is foam

407
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,920
from a car seat.

408
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,730
Hi.

409
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,770
The test results

410
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,770
come back?

411
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,770
Yes.

412
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,170
Everything was negative.

413
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,170
Nothing abnormal.

414
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,670
That's great.

415
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,300
What's wrong

416
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,300
with her?

417
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,070
I'm not sure.

418
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,680
Does she have

419
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,680
a fever?

420
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,340
No, ma'am.

421
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,850
Something is wrong

422
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,850
with her.

423
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,850
She's just not herself.

424
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,850
Mommy?

425
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,850
It's okay, baby.

426
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,150
Mommy's okay.

427
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,160
I'm sorry. It's just...

428
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,160
Trying to take

429
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,160
care of her...

430
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,700
Let's order an EEG,

431
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,700
see if she's having

432
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,700
subclinical seizures.

433
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,100
Thank you.

434
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,280
Whoa!

435
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,780
You all right?

436
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,690
All right, all right.

437
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,690
We got you.

438
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,490
We got you.

439
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,800
Two milligrams

440
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,800
morphine IV.

441
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,640
Right.

442
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,640
April, what do

443
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,640
I need to know?

444
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm doing IVF.

445
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,200
Okay. So, you're

446
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,200
on hormones?

447
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,510
Uh-huh.

448
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,510
I'm gonna palpate

449
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,510
your belly.

450
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,910
Sorry.

451
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,910
BP and heart rate

452
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,910
are normal.

453
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,560
Okay. Diffuse tenderness,

454
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,560
worse on the left side.

455
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,090
CBC, BMP and HCG.

456
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,660
April, this could

457
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,660
be ovarian

458
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,660
torsion or a cyst.

459
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,490
I'm gonna send you

460
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,490
to gynae for

461
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,490
an ultrasound. Hank?

462
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,720
Let's go.

463
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,060
I'll call gyne.

464
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,060
Hold up.

465
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,900
Page Dr. Asher,

466
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,900
tell her

467
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,030
I want her to personally

468
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,030
do this ultrasound

469
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,030
on a colleague.

470
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,660
Right.

471
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,340
Honey, I'm so sorry.

472
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,340
I gotta dash right

473
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,340
back out of here.

474
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,680
There's something

475
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,680
going on.

476
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,680
That's an antique.

477
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,940
I'm doing geography.

478
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,280
Yeah, you're funny.

479
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,580
So, look,

480
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,580
very limited selection.

481
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,090
But they did have

482
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,090
your favorite

483
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,090
barbecue potato chips,

484
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,290
which are gonna

485
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,290
go great with this

486
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,290
delicious tuna sandwich.

487
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,430
Gee, Dad, what do

488
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,430
you think would go

489
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,430
best with this?

490
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,060
What, you went

491
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,060
through my desk?

492
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,130
I finished all my homework.

493
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,130
What else was

494
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,130
I supposed to do?

495
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,930
Honey, my desk is private.

496
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,770
I mean, how would

497
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,770
you feel if I went

498
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,770
through your backpack?

499
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,140
You wouldn't find

500
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,140
any alcohol in there.

501
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,540
And you get on

502
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,540
my case about vaping?

503
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,540
That's pretty hypocritical.

504
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,240
Look, that was a gift.

505
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,610
Right.

506
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,610
Hey, look.

507
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,380
I'm an adult

508
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,380
of legal drinking age,

509
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,890
and you...

510
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,380
You're a kid.

511
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,620
So, let's talk about

512
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,620
vaping, shall we?

513
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,620
Oh, my God.

514
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,420
Every week,

515
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,420
into this hospital,

516
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,260
we have kids your

517
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,260
age coming with

518
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,260
their lungs destroyed.

519
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,390
Here we go.

520
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,760
I'm trying to have

521
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,760
a serious talk with you,

522
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,760
young lady.

523
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,230
And if you're gonna

524
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,230
sass back

525
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,230
everything I say...

526
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,290
We're not talking.

527
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,290
You're lecturing me.

528
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,770
Well, maybe there's

529
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,770
a reason for that.

530
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,070
Look, just...

531
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,270
Read a book,

532
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,270
or something.

533
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,310
Please.

534
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,260
Your ultrasound showed

535
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,260
bilateral enlarged

536
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,260
ovaries with good flow.

537
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,100
There's no indication

538
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,100
of torsion

539
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,100
or a hemorrhagic cyst.

540
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,630
Then what?

541
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,430
You do have some

542
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,430
fluid in your abdomen.

543
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,130
That, coupled with

544
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,130
the pain and nausea,

545
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,260
point to a mild

546
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,260
case of OHSS,

547
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,470
ovarian hyperstimulation

548
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,470
syndrome.

549
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,340
That's consistent

550
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,340
with IVF,

551
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,340
from the hormones.

552
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,380
I'm going to start you

553
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,380
on some IV fluids

554
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,380
and albumin.

555
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,880
Continue the pain meds.

556
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,390
Usually, this resolves

557
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,390
with time.

558
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,390
So, we'll wait and watch.

559
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,990
Thank you.

560
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,990
Okay.

561
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,230
Hannah?

562
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,900
Glad to see you back.

563
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,470
I know rehab

564
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,470
wasn't easy...

565
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,810
Let's just focus

566
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,810
on your patient.

567
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,710
So, you didn't find

568
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,710
any other bullet

569
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,710
or shrapnel?

570
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,880
Nothing metallic

571
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,880
on this X-ray?

572
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,080
No, ma'am,

573
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,080
just today's GSW.

574
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,850
But you're sure

575
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,850
he was shot before?

576
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,520
I don't see any

577
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,520
other explanation.

578
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,100
Well, any firearm injury

579
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,100
is a mandatory report.

580
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,230
It's not in his history.

581
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,230
And his partner doesn't

582
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,230
know anything about it.

583
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,000
Look, he did save

584
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,000
a little girl's life.

585
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,560
I mean, the man's a hero.

586
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,560
I say we leave it alone.

587
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,940
We can't leave it alone.

588
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,940
We have a legal obligation.

589
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,380
But I agree, we don't

590
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,380
wanna raise any red flags

591
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,380
if we don't have to.

592
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,350
So, when the patient

593
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,350
wakes up,

594
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,390
talk to him.

595
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,390
Hopefully, there's...

596
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,550
Yes?

597
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,550
Sorry to interrupt,

598
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,620
but, Dr. Choi,

599
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,620
you should know

600
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,620
April's not well.

601
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,390
What?

602
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,390
Dr. Halstead's

603
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,390
treating her.

604
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,860
It's okay.

605
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,860
Go, I got this.

606
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,730
She's tachycardic,

607
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,730
sats down to 94.

608
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
I can't breathe.

609
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,700
Doris, cannula.

610
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,700
Okay. Abdomen's distended.

611
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,800
Bedside ultrasound.

612
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,970
April.

613
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,970
Ethan.

614
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,100
What's going on?

615
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,940
OHSS.

616
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,810
Okay.

617
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,140
Ascitic fluid's irritating

618
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,140
the diaphragm.

619
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,750
That's why you're having

620
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,750
a hard time breathing.

621
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,080
She needs

622
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,080
paracentesis.

623
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,420
And a dose of albumin.

624
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,420
Excuse me.

625
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,650
I'm treating

626
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,650
this patient.

627
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,650
You?

628
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,590
Yes. Dr. Asher

629
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,590
is treating her,

630
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,630
and she's already

631
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,630
given April the albumin.

632
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,400
Okay, April,

633
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,900
I am going

634
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,900
to numb the area.

635
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,400
Baby, we're going to

636
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,400
drain the fluid

637
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,400
from your belly, okay?

638
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,410
Okay, you're not

639
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,410
going to do anything.

640
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,410
Please go.

641
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,940
I'm not going

642
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,940
anywhere.

643
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,470
Ethan, you know

644
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,470
you shouldn't be

645
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,470
here for this.

646
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,110
Ethan, go. It's okay.

647
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,110
No, no, no, no.

648
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,440
I'll be okay.

649
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,340
We got it.

650
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,340
Okay,

651
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,340
April, ready?

652
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,520
Okay.

653
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,360
You're doing great.

654
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,490
All right.

655
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,490
We've got 10 ccs.

656
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,630
That's it.

657
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,630
Keep breathing.

658
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,600
We've got 35, almost at 40.

659
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,270
Okay.

660
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,180
Good job, Dr. Asher.

661
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,210
Breathing's easier.

662
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,210
Doris, keep pressure.

663
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,350
Mmm-hmm.

664
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,120
April, I'll come

665
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,120
check on you

666
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,120
in a bit, okay?

667
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,470
Dr. Asher performed

668
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,470
the paracentesis

669
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,470
and it went well.

670
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,700
April's stable.

671
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,700
You can go in now.

672
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,140
Hannah.

673
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,850
You understand,

674
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,850
I couldn't let you

675
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,850
keep treating patients.

676
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,350
I had to make

677
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,350
your addiction known.

678
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,150
Publicly?

679
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,150
So everyone knew?

680
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,390
You have any idea

681
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,390
how humiliating it's been?

682
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,550
There was no other way.

683
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,550
If I just turned

684
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,550
you in, you'd deny it.

685
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,930
I had to make sure

686
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,930
they had evidence.

687
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,020
No. What you did

688
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,020
was a betrayal.

689
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,030
You're an excellent doctor.

690
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,030
I believe in you.

691
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,030
I wasn't about to let you

692
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,030
throw your life away.

693
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,100
And if I had to do it over,

694
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,100
I'd do the same thing.

695
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,230
Hey, guys. The sheers

696
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,230
don't go there.

697
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,030
They have to be

698
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,030
at the head of the aisle

699
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,030
so, I can walk through them.

700
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,940
Hey, sweetie.

701
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,940
Hey.

702
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,030
How you doing, babe?

703
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,370
What are you doing here?

704
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,370
You're supposed

705
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,370
to be at the tailor's.

706
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,710
Already been.

707
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,710
They're letting

708
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,710
out the slacks.

709
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,770
Oh.

710
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,770
So, what can

711
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,770
I do to help?

712
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,550
Nothing.

713
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,250
Ah, Palacio.

714
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,250
I got your orchids.

715
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,820
There's a problem.

716
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,820
What?

717
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,780
They were left

718
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,780
on the tarmac at O'Hare.

719
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,920
Frost damage.

720
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,970
They're ruined.

721
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,970
Yeah.

722
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,730
We can deal with this.

723
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,340
How about you pick out

724
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,340
a replacement, on us.

725
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,900
Here, daisies.

726
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,900
Very popular

727
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,900
wedding flower.

728
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,850
Daisies.

729
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,280
How about...

730
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,280
Babe, I've got this.

731
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,290
So, I just reviewed

732
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,290
the EEG on Mindi Remus.

733
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,660
I see no evidence she

734
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,660
had subclinical seizures

735
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,100
or any eleptiform

736
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,100
activity.

737
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,100
Are you sure?

738
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,530
Am I sure?

739
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,200
Only an incompetent would

740
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,200
prescribe anti-seizure

741
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,200
medication for her.

742
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,330
Anything else?

743
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,340
No. Thank you,

744
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,340
Dr. Abrams.

745
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,670
Okay, so, are we ready

746
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,670
to turn this over to DCFS?

747
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,200
You know,

748
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,200
I'm not quite.

749
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,470
Well, I am.

750
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,440
What do you suggest?

751
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,210
If we're accusing

752
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,210
Ms. Remus of faking

753
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,210
her daughter's symptoms,

754
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,850
why don't we just take

755
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,850
Mindi off of oxygen

756
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,850
and see how she does?

757
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,190
What do we have

758
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,190
to lose, really?

759
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,960
Are we in agreement?

760
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,390
All right, then.

761
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,200
Hey. He's awake?

762
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,200
Yeah.

763
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,070
How's April?

764
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,070
She's okay.

765
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,700
Glad to hear it, man.

766
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,040
Hey, John.

767
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,040
Hey, man.

768
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,920
Operation went well.

769
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,920
How're you feeling?

770
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,220
Okay...

771
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,220
Good.

772
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,420
So, we need to ask

773
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,420
you some questions.

774
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,420
You up to it?

775
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,730
Before today,

776
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,730
have you ever been shot?

777
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,690
Shot? No.

778
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,200
We found two

779
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,200
scars on your side.

780
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,200
How'd you get those?

781
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,580
Yeah, when I was a kid,

782
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,350
I was, you know,

783
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,350
play sword fighting.

784
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,550
I got jabbed.

785
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,290
Officer Bell, I'm sorry,

786
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,620
but that's just

787
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,620
not consistent

788
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,620
with what we found.

789
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,890
There was a piece of car

790
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,890
seat foam in your abdomen.

791
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,530
So, what?

792
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,400
We see that in people

793
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,400
who've been shot

794
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,400
while sitting in a car.

795
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,210
That didn't happen.

796
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,760
Then, can you

797
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,760
help us understand

798
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,310
how that foam

799
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,310
could've gotten in there?

800
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,150
Look, I don't care

801
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,150
what you think you found.

802
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,870
I've never been shot.

803
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,580
Right.

804
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,620
Excuse us a moment.

805
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,830
Ms. Remus,

806
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,830
this is Sharon Goodwin,

807
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,960
our Executive Director

808
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,960
of Patient Services,

809
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,260
and Dr. Strauss,

810
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,260
a pediatrician.

811
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,300
Is something wrong?

812
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,300
Please have a seat.

813
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,110
So, Mindi's EEG

814
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,110
came back normal,

815
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,110
which is a good thing.

816
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,480
Problem is,

817
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,480
it leaves us no closer

818
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,480
to a diagnosis.

819
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,310
Which is why

820
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,310
it would be

821
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,310
helpful for us

822
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,580
to take Mindi off oxygen

823
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,580
and see how she does.

824
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,750
But she needs it.

825
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,750
And that's what

826
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,750
we're going to find out.

827
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,850
And if she has any

828
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,850
trouble breathing,

829
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,020
we will immediately

830
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,020
put her back on it.

831
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,360
But we need

832
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,360
your permission.

833
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,760
You do wanna help

834
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,760
your daughter,

835
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,760
don't you?

836
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,200
Of course I do.

837
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,170
Okay.

838
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,430
Mindi, honey,

839
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,840
the doctors just

840
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,840
need to test

841
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,840
something, okay?

842
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,140
All right. We're gonna

843
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,140
take this out of

844
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,140
your nose, okay?

845
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,450
All right, you ready?

846
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,450
Here you go.

847
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,220
You're gonna

848
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,220
be all right.

849
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,020
There you go.

850
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,020
You okay?

851
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,390
Is it hard to breathe?

852
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,020
Sats are still

853
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,020
at 100%.

854
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't understand.

855
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,570
This is like a miracle.

856
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,570
How could this happen?

857
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,130
Do you mind,

858
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,130
could we step outside

859
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,130
and chat for a bit?

860
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,510
Mindi, Mommy'll be

861
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,510
right back, okay?

862
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,150
Ms. Remus,

863
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,150
are you familiar

864
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,150
with a condition

865
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,490
called Munchausen

866
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,490
by proxy?

867
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,360
You think I'm crazy.

868
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,360
You think I'm making

869
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,360
my daughter sick?

870
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,400
Other hospitals reported

871
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,400
that Mindi's symptoms

872
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,400
don't seem to present

873
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,240
when she's

874
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,240
in the emergency room.

875
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,540
Other hospitals?

876
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,540
Yes.

877
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,410
You've known about

878
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,410
this all day, and you

879
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,410
didn't say anything?

880
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,570
I'm sorry.

881
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,570
Oh, my God.

882
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,450
You're trying to take

883
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,450
my child away from me.

884
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,790
Ms. Remus,

885
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,790
our main interest

886
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,790
is Mindi's welfare.

887
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,720
No, no,

888
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,720
you can't take her.

889
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,730
You cannot take

890
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,730
my little girl from me!

891
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,350
Ms. Remus.

892
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,350
No, no, no...

893
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,020
We really should

894
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,020
have this

895
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,020
conversation outside.

896
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,800
You can't take her!

897
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,800
No, Ms. Remus,

898
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,800
it's very...

899
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,800
You can't take her!

900
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,800
I am not crazy!

901
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,100
Dad?

902
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,100
No, you can't

903
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,100
take her from me.

904
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,900
Dad!

905
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,900
Anna.

906
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,070
No.

907
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,070
She has been sick...

908
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,400
Give me a minute.

909
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,400
...her entire life

910
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,400
and I am

911
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,870
the only person

912
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,870
that she has.

913
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,870
Could that really happen?

914
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,640
Could they really take

915
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,640
her daughter away?

916
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,640
Honey,

917
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,870
what are you doing here?

918
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,870
You're not supposed

919
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,870
to be here, sweetie.

920
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,240
I love her.

921
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,240
I know you love her,

922
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,240
but we're not...

923
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,080
You are not taking

924
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,080
her away from me!

925
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,780
Honey, I am so sorry

926
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,780
that you had to see that.

927
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,260
But what was

928
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,260
going on there

929
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,260
was that that woman,

930
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:02,060
she may have an illness

931
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,470
that causes her

932
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,470
to not be a very good mom.

933
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,680
Dad, are they gonna

934
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,680
separate you from me?

935
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,810
What? Who?

936
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,640
Those people,

937
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,640
like downstairs.

938
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:24,190
No. No, nobody's

939
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:24,190
gonna separate us.

940
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,950
Why would you

941
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,950
ask that?

942
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,660
Because you haven't

943
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,660
been a very good dad.

944
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,290
I mean, it's like

945
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,290
you just forgot about me.

946
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:41,270
No. No, no, no.

947
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:41,270
Not for a second. I didn't...

948
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,940
You did,

949
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,940
but I'm not mad.

950
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,540
I don't care.

951
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,540
I don't want you

952
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,540
to go away.

953
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,110
No, sweetie,

954
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,110
I'm not going anywhere.

955
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,110
It's not gonna happen.

956
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,110
You promise?

957
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,110
I promise.

958
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,820
What?

959
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,570
It's just that

960
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,570
you know I do,

961
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,570
I love you so much,

962
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,370
and I feel so bad.

963
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,670
It's okay.

964
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,670
No, it's not okay.

965
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,980
You're right.

966
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,980
I have not been

967
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,980
a very good dad.

968
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,140
I haven't been around.

969
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,140
Well, that's

970
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,140
because CeCe died.

971
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,190
Yeah, but you know what?

972
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,190
That's not an excuse.

973
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,860
You're my daughter.

974
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,860
You're my little baby girl.

975
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,090
And...

976
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,660
I'm really sorry.

977
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,660
And I promise

978
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,660
I'm gonna...

979
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,760
I'm gonna do better.

980
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,760
Okay?

981
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,280
Okay.

982
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,390
Your fellow officers

983
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,390
would like to come in.

984
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,260
Did you say

985
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,260
something to them?

986
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,300
No. No,

987
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,300
we haven't.

988
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,630
Look, John, I'm in the Navy.

989
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,530
And it's been

990
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,530
my experience

991
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,200
that cops and military,

992
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,200
we're a lot alike.

993
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,110
Profound sense of duty.

994
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,300
But I gotta

995
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,300
tell you, man.

996
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,080
If something did

997
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,080
happen in your past,

998
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,450
you need

999
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,450
to own up to it.

1000
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,090
I'm not a military man,

1001
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,090
but my pops used to say,

1002
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,590
a lie can poison

1003
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,590
a man's life.

1004
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,100
What do you think

1005
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,100
about the pants?

1006
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,840
What's that smell?

1007
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,840
What's going on?

1008
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,910
The sewer's

1009
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,910
backed up.

1010
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,250
Can you fix it?

1011
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,250
We've got raw sewage

1012
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,910
coming up from the drains.

1013
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,910
Kitchen's not usable.

1014
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,080
We have to close.

1015
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,080
Close?

1016
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,130
I'm very sorry.

1017
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,130
We can reschedule,

1018
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,750
help you find

1019
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,750
another venue...

1020
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,830
Ben...

1021
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,130
It'll be okay.

1022
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,690
But it's always

1023
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,690
been my dream

1024
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,690
to get married here.

1025
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,500
We'll figure

1026
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,500
something out.

1027
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,940
I'm not gonna give up.

1028
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,940
I can do this.

1029
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,650
Where else

1030
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,650
can we have it?

1031
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,050
The Riverwalk,

1032
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,050
we could rent

1033
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,050
a tent...

1034
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,560
It's March. Maggie,

1035
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,560
let me help you out here.

1036
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,390
Ben, don't distract me.

1037
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,390
Stop it, all right? Stop.

1038
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,530
You're acting like

1039
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,530
someone in remission.

1040
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,330
What?

1041
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,310
Cancer, that's what

1042
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,310
this is about.

1043
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,310
You just went

1044
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,310
through something

1045
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,310
that made you feel helpless.

1046
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,900
And you never wanna

1047
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,900
feel that way again.

1048
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,050
Believe me, I know.

1049
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,640
But no matter

1050
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,640
how hard you try,

1051
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,150
you can't

1052
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,150
control everything.

1053
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,020
But it's all ruined.

1054
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,020
Mmm-mmm.

1055
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,990
You have

1056
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,990
a partner now.

1057
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,420
What's called in marriage

1058
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,420
a helpmate.

1059
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,900
And that helpmate is gonna

1060
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,900
do his job and help you.

1061
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,010
Sorry about that.

1062
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,010
Is everything okay?

1063
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,880
Yeah. Yes,

1064
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,880
it is, thanks.

1065
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,880
Good.

1066
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,520
Once you're finished

1067
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,520
evaluating her,

1068
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,180
we're supposed to meet

1069
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,180
in Goodwin's office.

1070
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,750
I so wanted

1071
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,750
to believe her.

1072
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,060
When I was pregnant,

1073
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,060
they told me that

1074
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,060
I would lose her

1075
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,700
if I didn't stay in bed,

1076
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,700
so, I did for two months.

1077
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,770
But still, she came

1078
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,770
at 24 weeks.

1079
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,610
Would you mind

1080
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,610
telling me a bit

1081
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,910
about what

1082
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,910
Mindi's birth

1083
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,910
was like for you?

1084
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,450
Terrible.

1085
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,080
I was so scared.

1086
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,380
And there was

1087
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,380
so much blood.

1088
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,260
And then

1089
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,260
she wasn't breathing.

1090
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,290
They took her away

1091
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,290
from me and they put

1092
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,290
all these tubes in her.

1093
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,970
I see the faces

1094
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,970
of the doctors,

1095
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,970
and I hear the machines.

1096
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,300
And I think

1097
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,300
my baby is dying.

1098
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,480
Even now, she sleeps

1099
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,480
next to me in bed.

1100
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,280
And I listen all

1101
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,280
night to make sure

1102
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,280
she's still breathing.

1103
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,920
But you're getting

1104
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,920
some rest, aren't you?

1105
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,620
When do you sleep?

1106
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,600
I don't.

1107
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,290
Okay. Everything

1108
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,290
is looking

1109
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,290
great, April,

1110
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,340
but you will need to

1111
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,340
follow up with your

1112
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,340
REI about continuing IVF.

1113
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,100
I will, thank you.

1114
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,100
I'm glad you're back.

1115
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,680
I'll go get your

1116
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,680
discharge started.

1117
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,780
You're gonna be okay,

1118
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,780
but we need

1119
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,780
to change your meds.

1120
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,980
When the last

1121
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,980
harvest failed,

1122
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,790
I wanted to make sure

1123
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,790
that the next one didn't.

1124
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,630
So, I doubled up

1125
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,630
on my hormone meds.

1126
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,990
I did it to myself.

1127
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,990
April...

1128
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,540
You want a baby.

1129
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,540
We both want a baby.

1130
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,200
But not at the expense

1131
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,200
of your health. Never.

1132
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,840
Look, it's okay.

1133
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,840
It's okay.

1134
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,370
I just wanted

1135
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,370
to make up for...

1136
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,680
You have nothing

1137
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,680
to make up for.

1138
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,980
I do.

1139
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,420
What are you

1140
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,420
talking about?

1141
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,320
Crockett.

1142
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,190
Crockett?

1143
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,400
The night that you

1144
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,400
left on deployment...

1145
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,770
I kissed him.

1146
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,100
I'm sorry.

1147
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,540
Wait. It wasn't his fault.

1148
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,540
It was mine.

1149
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,670
He had nothing

1150
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,670
to do with it.

1151
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,120
Nothing? Nothing

1152
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,120
to do with it...

1153
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,880
Ethan? Ethan...

1154
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,360
April? Really?

1155
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,130
Huh? All this time,

1156
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,130
acting like

1157
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,130
friends. Huh?

1158
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,590
Come on! Come on, friend!

1159
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,590
Let's be friends! Come on!

1160
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,790
Hey! Hey!

1161
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,790
Come on!

1162
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,060
Back up.

1163
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,060
Dr. Marcel!

1164
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,030
The patient

1165
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,030
wants to see you.

1166
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,540
Go.

1167
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,550
Officer, what

1168
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,550
do you need?

1169
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,660
They think I'm a hero.

1170
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,280
I'm not.

1171
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,430
You were right.

1172
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,430
I can't go on

1173
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,430
living a lie.

1174
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,000
I was 17.

1175
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,400
A real knucklehead.

1176
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,950
Friend had a gun,

1177
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,570
thought it'd be cool

1178
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,570
to knock off

1179
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,570
a liquor store.

1180
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,910
Trouble was,

1181
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,910
the owner also

1182
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,910
had a gun.

1183
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,950
Shot my friend,

1184
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,950
shot me when

1185
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,950
I was in the car,

1186
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,020
trying to get away.

1187
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,160
My friend died.

1188
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,200
But I lived.

1189
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,370
I had to believe

1190
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,370
it was for a reason.

1191
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,770
Turn my life around,

1192
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,110
make amends.

1193
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,150
Appreciate what it took

1194
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,150
for you to tell us this.

1195
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,220
Since the gunshot wound

1196
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,960
was never reported,

1197
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,130
you know that

1198
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,130
we have to...

1199
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,130
No.

1200
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,330
Let me.

1201
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,670
I will.

1202
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,140
Officer Bell would

1203
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,140
like to see you.

1204
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,690
So, are we agreed?

1205
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,920
DCFS will take

1206
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,920
custody of Mindi Remus?

1207
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,260
No, we're not.

1208
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,770
We are not agreed.

1209
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,770
What?

1210
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,170
Why not?

1211
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,030
Carol Remus is suffering

1212
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,030
from a mental illness,

1213
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,440
which happens to be

1214
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,440
easily misinterpreted

1215
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,030
as Munchausen by proxy,

1216
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,030
but it's not.

1217
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,080
I think she's suffering

1218
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,080
from PTSD.

1219
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,670
Post-traumatic

1220
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,670
stress disorder.

1221
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,910
Oh, come on. From what?

1222
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,450
From the experience

1223
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,450
of giving birth to

1224
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,450
an extremely premature baby.

1225
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,390
And of watching that

1226
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,390
baby almost die.

1227
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,690
No. Mindi is clearly not

1228
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,690
suffering from any of the

1229
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,690
conditions that Mom claims.

1230
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,700
PTSD leads

1231
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,700
to hyper-vigilance,

1232
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,700
in this case,

1233
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,290
a mother's constant

1234
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,290
worry about her

1235
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,290
daughter's health.

1236
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,240
This would cause

1237
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,240
Ms. Remus to misinterpret

1238
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,240
Mindi's symptoms,

1239
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,900
even blow them wildly

1240
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,900
out of proportion.

1241
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,070
What about

1242
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,070
the little girl?

1243
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,200
What about

1244
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,200
what she needs?

1245
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,710
What's best for Mindi

1246
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,710
is to remain with

1247
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,710
a mother who loves her.

1248
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,770
You're wrong.

1249
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,450
Ms. Goodwin?

1250
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,320
I'm going to stand

1251
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,320
with Dr. Charles.

1252
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,960
When that little

1253
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,960
girl comes back in here

1254
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,090
severely injured,

1255
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,090
and she will,

1256
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,230
that's on all of you.

1257
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,680
Hey, Will!

1258
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,170
You were right.

1259
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,180
I would've denied it,

1260
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,180
just talked

1261
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,180
my way out of it.

1262
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,260
Yeah, I was in too deep.

1263
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,260
Just total self-denial.

1264
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,700
Every day had just

1265
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,700
become about

1266
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,700
getting my next fix.

1267
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,000
You know, if I'm honest

1268
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,000
with myself,

1269
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,970
what you did

1270
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,970
was what I needed.

1271
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,540
It has not been easy,

1272
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,850
but you gave me

1273
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,850
my life back.

1274
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,460
You got plans tonight?

1275
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,520
No.

1276
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,330
How about a wedding?

1277
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,640
Dr. Choi?

1278
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,880
I understand we had

1279
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,880
some trouble upstairs.

1280
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,350
Yes, ma'am.

1281
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,910
I can't have my doctors

1282
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,910
coming to blows

1283
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,910
in the ICU.

1284
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,580
Understood.

1285
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,420
Ms. Goodwin,

1286
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,420
it was my fault.

1287
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,560
I take full

1288
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,560
responsibility

1289
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,560
for what happened.

1290
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,720
What do you mean?

1291
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,560
April and I,

1292
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,560
we've been trying

1293
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,560
to have a baby.

1294
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,110
And I guess

1295
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,110
I got obsessed

1296
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,110
with that.

1297
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,200
Didn't see there

1298
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,200
were problems.

1299
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,780
I can understand

1300
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,780
your wanting to have

1301
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,780
a baby, Dr. Choi.

1302
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,850
You've seen

1303
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,850
a lot of death.

1304
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,250
It's only natural

1305
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,250
you'd wanna bring

1306
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,250
life into the world.

1307
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,390
But don't be

1308
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,390
too hard on yourself.

1309
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,530
I'll see you

1310
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,530
at the wedding?

1311
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,980
You can open

1312
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,980
your eyes now.

1313
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,650
Oh, Nat.

1314
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,940
You know

1315
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,940
my Wednesday

1316
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,940
night league.

1317
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,310
They helped me

1318
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,310
put this together.

1319
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,320
We brought

1320
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,320
The Opal Room here.

1321
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,460
It's beautiful, Ben.

1322
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,650
No...

1323
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,590
You're beautiful.

1324
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,430
Should we do this?

1325
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,890
We're gathered tonight

1326
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,890
in this bowling alley

1327
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,890
to join my friends,

1328
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,890
Ben and Maggie,

1329
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,890
in holy matrimony.

1330
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,160
In a moment, they will

1331
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,160
say their vows...

1332
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,130
You hit on April?

1333
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,300
And I was beginning

1334
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,300
to think you were

1335
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,300
a good guy.

1336
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,970
Whatever gave

1337
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,970
you that idea?

1338
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,480
With this ring,

1339
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,480
I, Ben Campbell,

1340
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,980
take you,

1341
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,980
Maggie Lockwood,

1342
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,220
to be no other

1343
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,220
than yourself.

1344
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,890
With this ring,

1345
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,480
I, Maggie Lockwood,

1346
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,690
take you,

1347
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,690
Ben Campbell,

1348
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,190
to be no other

1349
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,190
than yourself.

1350
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Brave, loving...

1351
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,840
And your

1352
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,840
indispensable helpmate.

1353
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,440
And my

1354
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,440
indispensable helpmate.

1355
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,340
I promise to love

1356
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,340
and respect you,

1357
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,620
throughout all of our years...

1358
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,050
Throughout

1359
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,050
our shared life.

1360
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,050
And in all that life

1361
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,050
may bring us.

1362
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,080
By the power

1363
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,080
vested in me

1364
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,890
by the State of Illinois...

1365
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,800
I pronounce you

1366
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,800
husband and wife.

1367
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,400
Whoo!

1368
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,710
All right, everyone,

1369
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,710
let's roll!

1370
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,280
Now that we found love,

1371
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,280
what are we gonna do...

1372
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,220
with it?

1373
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,260
One two, tell me what you

1374
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,260
got

1375
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,420
Let me slip my quarters

1376
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,420
inside your slot to

1377
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,420
hit the jackpot

1378
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,290
Rev me up, rev me up,

1379
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,290
my little buttercup

1380
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,300
We can tug sheets snuggle up

1381
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,300
and get stuck

1382
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,220
Great job.

1383
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,240
A strugglin', bubblin'

1384
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,240
overweight lover hurt

1385
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,240
prone

1386
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,330
So what's it gonna be?

1387
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,330
Me or the TV

1388
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,410
Now let me take time to set

1389
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,410
your mind and your body

1390
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,410
free

1391
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,300
Oh, yeah...

1392
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,400
Come on, do the right

1393
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,400
thing, baby Kitty,

1394
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,400
kitty

1395
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,850
Now that we found love,

1396
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,850
what are we gonna do...

1397
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,980
with it?
