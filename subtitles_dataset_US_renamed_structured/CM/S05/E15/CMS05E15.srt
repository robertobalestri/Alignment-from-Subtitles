1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,070
Crockett, it's okay.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,800
What happened

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,800
is in the past.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,530
Can't remember

5
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,530
what it was.

6
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,360
Now we just have to

7
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,360
set up the nursery,

8
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,170
but in the meantime,

9
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,670
how about that date?

10
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,240
You won't turn yourself in.

11
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,240
I can't let this go on.

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,080
I thought we had

13
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,080
an understanding.

14
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,380
You can't possibly know

15
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,380
what it's like.

16
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,420
Every day I say

17
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,420
I'm gonna quit.

18
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,710
I will turn myself in.

19
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,850
I can go with you.

20
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,690
Yeah, I'd like that.

21
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,490
Come to my place?

22
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,800
Hey.

23
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,530
Hey.

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,870
Mmm, breakfast?

25
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,110
There's a spot on the corner

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,110
with excellent French press.

27
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,670
Um, what time is it?

28
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,520
No, sorry.

29
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,890
I gotta get to work.

30
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,890
My shift starts soon.

31
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,660
Mmm...

32
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,100
Listen,

33
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,540
what we talked

34
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,540
about last night,

35
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,440
this doesn't

36
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,440
change anything,

37
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,440
does it?

38
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,950
You mean my

39
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,950
reporting myself?

40
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,720
Do you think

41
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,720
I slept with you

42
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,720
just to get out of it?

43
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,840
No.

44
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,020
I just wanna make sure

45
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,020
that's still the plan.

46
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,220
It is.

47
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,490
I just need to round

48
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,490
on a few patients

49
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,490
so I can hand them off,

50
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,400
then I talk

51
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,400
to Ms. Goodwin.

52
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,630
I'll come with you.

53
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,130
Yeah, I want you to.

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,860
Hannah,

55
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,860
you're so smart.

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,270
And tough.

57
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,880
You're so much more

58
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,880
than this addiction.

59
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,110
I know you're

60
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,110
gonna beat it.

61
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,690
Hi, Mr. Sher.

62
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,690
Oh, please, call me Lewis.

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,660
This is my

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,660
ex-wife, Elaine.

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,260
Hi.

66
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,130
And my daughter Harper.

67
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,130
Hi.

68
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm Dr. Manning.

69
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,500
So, I see you're experiencing

70
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,500
some abdominal pain.

71
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,630
His tummy started hurting

72
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,680
as soon as he got off

73
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,680
the airplane today.

74
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,300
Oh, really? And where

75
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,300
did he fly in from?

76
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,380
Daddy lives in Geneva.

77
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,010
It's 2:20 in the afternoon

78
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,010
there right now.

79
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,680
Oh.

80
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,680
Harper, sweetie,

81
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,480
just let the doctor

82
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,480
do her work, okay?

83
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,610
It's okay.

84
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm just impressed

85
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,680
you know so much

86
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,680
about Geneva.

87
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,320
My daddy works

88
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,320
in a laboratory there.

89
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,090
He's a chemical scientist.

90
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,190
Wow.

91
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,320
A polymer engineer.

92
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,460
You mind?

93
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,560
Harper,

94
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,560
honey, come here.

95
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,210
Does your job require

96
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,210
you to handle

97
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,210
any toxic materials?

98
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,010
I work with a lot

99
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,010
of heavy metals,

100
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,210
but I always take proper

101
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,210
precautions. Why?

102
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,940
I am hearing

103
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,940
some congestion

104
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,940
in your chest.

105
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,850
As well as

106
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,850
a slight discoloration

107
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,980
in your eyes.

108
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,990
It could be due

109
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,990
to some kind

110
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,990
of toxic exposure.

111
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,360
Let's get a tox screen,

112
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,360
and a CBC, BMP and a UA.

113
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,520
Okay.

114
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,520
Is my daddy

115
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,520
gonna be okay?

116
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,060
I promise, I am

117
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,060
gonna take very good

118
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,060
care of your dad.

119
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,530
Okay?

120
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,400
I'll be back

121
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,400
to check on you soon.

122
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,360
Give me one sec.

123
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,230
Dr. Manning?

124
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,230
Yeah?

125
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,670
There's something

126
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,670
he's not telling you,

127
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,610
and I'm worried

128
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,610
if you don't know it,

129
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,340
it will be a problem

130
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,340
in treating him.

131
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,040
Absolutely.

132
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,040
What is it?

133
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,710
Well, everything

134
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,710
he just said in there,

135
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,710
it's not true.

136
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,580
I'm sorry?

137
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,260
Lewis is not

138
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,260
a polymer engineer

139
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,260
in Geneva.

140
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,090
His real name

141
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,090
is Derek Jordan,

142
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,690
and he's an actor

143
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,690
from New York.

144
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,870
An actor?

145
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,870
Yes.

146
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,230
It's a long story,

147
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,230
but I hired him

148
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,230
to play this role.

149
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,100
I don't understand.

150
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,100
What role?

151
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,270
The role of my

152
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,270
daughter's father.

153
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,730
One, two.

154
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,090
Harper, sweetie,

155
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,220
let's go get a snack

156
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,770
so the doctor can

157
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,770
talk to your father.

158
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,890
Be right back, Daddy.

159
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,130
Okay, sweetie.

160
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,310
Elaine filled me in

161
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,310
on your arrangement.

162
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,250
I understand you want

163
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,250
to keep pretending

164
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,250
for Harper's sake,

165
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,850
but since we're alone,

166
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,750
I do need to gather some

167
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,750
real information from you.

168
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
So, your initial

169
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
tox screen was negative,

170
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,760
and your hemoglobin

171
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,760
is low.

172
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,160
Have you ever had

173
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,160
any blood disorders

174
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,100
or iron deficiencies

175
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,100
in your past?

176
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,600
I don't think so.

177
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,790
Okay, why don't you

178
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,790
give me your

179
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,790
doctor's information,

180
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,000
and I'll have your

181
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,000
medical records sent

182
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,000
over from New York.

183
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,670
As my daughter told you,

184
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,670
I live in Geneva.

185
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,010
Mr. Jordan, if I'm gonna

186
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,010
treat you properly,

187
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,450
I'm gonna need your

188
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,450
medical history,

189
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,450
not your character's.

190
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,690
My name is Lewis Sher,

191
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,160
and I don't know

192
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,160
what you're talking about.

193
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
Hey, Doris, will you

194
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,470
add a liver panel to

195
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,470
my patient in Three?

196
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,170
And also page

197
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,170
Dr. Charles.

198
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,900
This guy is nuts.

199
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,400
Thanks.

200
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,970
Hey, how's your

201
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,970
hormone therapy going?

202
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,680
It feels

203
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,680
like my skin is

204
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,680
crawling with ants.

205
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,880
But other than that,

206
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,880
I'm holding up.

207
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,080
Hang in there.

208
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,720
Hopefully your numbers

209
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,720
will level out soon.

210
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,880
Yeah.

211
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,430
Need some

212
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,430
help over here.

213
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,390
Okay. Hold this.

214
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,990
Siana Fredericks,

215
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,990
seven months pregnant.

216
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,360
I just paged her OB.

217
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,920
Okay, let's take her

218
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,920
to Treatment Four.

219
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,160
I'm Dr. Halstead.

220
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,160
This is Nurse Lockwood.

221
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,830
You having contractions?

222
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm not in labor.

223
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm having a pain crisis.

224
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,870
Are you talking about

225
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,870
a sickle cell crisis?

226
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes.

227
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,000
Have you had any

228
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,000
flare-ups recently?

229
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,440
Not since

230
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,440
I've been pregnant.

231
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,070
My OB has me on

232
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,070
a special diet

233
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,070
that's been helping.

234
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,450
Is there anyone

235
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,450
we can call?

236
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,580
I already spoke

237
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,580
to my husband.

238
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,450
He's stuck

239
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,450
in Minneapolis.

240
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,920
When did the pain start?

241
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,390
Yesterday morning.

242
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,720
Let's get her on oxygen,

243
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,720
hang a liter of saline,

244
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,090
and push two milligrams

245
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,090
of morphine.

246
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,090
No!

247
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,890
No morphine.

248
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,430
Siana, 24 hours

249
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,430
is a long time.

250
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,130
We have to get your

251
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,130
crisis under control.

252
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
You don't understand.

253
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,060
I've been through

254
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,060
three rounds of IVF.

255
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,630
I'm finally

256
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,630
carrying an embryo

257
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,540
that doesn't have

258
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,540
this awful disease.

259
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,640
I'm gonna make sure

260
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,640
everything is perfect

261
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,640
for this baby.

262
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,770
Please call

263
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,770
my OB, Dr. Asher.

264
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,080
Hannah Asher?

265
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,080
Yes.

266
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,750
She's been helping

267
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,750
with my birth plan.

268
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,750
She'll know what to do.

269
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,220
Okay. Yeah, we'll contact

270
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,220
Dr. Asher, order some labs.

271
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,420
I'll be back to check

272
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,420
on you soon.

273
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,650
Okay.

274
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,650
You're calling OB?

275
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,620
I'll try Asher's cell.

276
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,430
We're friends.

277
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,630
Going straight

278
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,630
to voicemail.

279
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,500
OB must be backed up

280
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,500
this morning.

281
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,670
I'll run up and find her.

282
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,670
All right.

283
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,080
How'd it go?

284
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,780
He wouldn't break

285
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,780
character for me either.

286
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,350
Break character?

287
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,350
This isn't a play.

288
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,980
Yeah, I mean,

289
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,980
I've been doing

290
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,980
this for 30 years.

291
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,420
This is a new one.

292
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,130
And this poor little girl

293
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,130
growing up with this lie?

294
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,170
Okay, but she's

295
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,170
not sick. He is.

296
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,460
So what do we do?

297
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,870
I had fun last night.

298
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,640
Me, too.

299
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,610
How about we do it

300
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,610
again tonight?

301
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,210
Wow.

302
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,040
Absolutely.

303
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,950
April. With me.

304
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,640
Noah.

305
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,450
Paramedics just called.

306
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,720
I got a guy over

307
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,450
on Chicago Avenue

308
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,450
with some sort

309
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,450
of cardiac event.

310
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,830
All my attendings

311
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,830
are tied up.

312
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,860
Was hoping that you

313
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,860
two could handle it.

314
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,630
How long until

315
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,630
they land?

316
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,630
They're not.

317
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,070
I need you two

318
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,070
to get over there.

319
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,460
Guy's refusing

320
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,460
to get in the ambo.

321
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,910
So, you think that

322
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,910
he's really sick?

323
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,740
Yes, his symptoms

324
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,740
are all over the place.

325
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,740
But he refuses

326
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,740
to cooperate.

327
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,040
God.

328
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,880
We can't make a diagnosis

329
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,880
without an accurate history.

330
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,880
Do you think that

331
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,880
you could talk to him?

332
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,540
Get him to drop

333
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,540
the performance?

334
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,350
I wish that I could,

335
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,350
but that is how he is.

336
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,760
When I first met Derek,

337
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,090
he was playing

338
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,090
a paraplegic on Broadway.

339
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,990
He would go home every night

340
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,990
in his wheelchair.

341
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,900
Okay, I think

342
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,900
this is getting

343
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,900
out of hand.

344
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,030
I'm sorry, but we might have

345
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,030
to call Child Services.

346
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,190
No.

347
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,190
I'm sorry,

348
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,600
but we are

349
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,600
very concerned

350
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,600
about Harper.

351
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,930
No, no, no.

352
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,930
Don't do that.

353
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,680
This is all about Harper.

354
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,680
That is why I did this.

355
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,440
I grew up

356
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,440
without a father.

357
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,910
I couldn't stand

358
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,910
the thought of that

359
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,910
happening to her.

360
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,780
But, I mean,

361
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,780
hiring an actor?

362
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,220
I mean, you didn't have

363
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,220
any male friends

364
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,380
or relatives

365
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,380
who could serve

366
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,380
as role models?

367
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,890
No.

368
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,220
When Harper's real father

369
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,220
abandoned us,

370
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,560
there was nobody.

371
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,960
And when I hired Lewis,

372
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,970
it was just supposed

373
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,970
to be one time, okay?

374
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,730
It was father-daughter

375
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,730
day at her preschool,

376
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,770
and the thing is,

377
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,770
she just fell

378
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,770
in love with him.

379
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,270
And it made her

380
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,270
so happy.

381
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,640
So you did it again.

382
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,640
And again.

383
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,140
And again.

384
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,640
Look, I know what

385
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,640
I did was wrong,

386
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,650
but I am putting

387
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,650
an end to it.

388
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,310
I told Derek

389
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,310
this is the last time.

390
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,250
Lewis is gonna

391
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,250
go back to Europe.

392
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,790
He's going to get

393
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,790
busy with work.

394
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,090
He'll lose touch with Harper,

395
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,090
and after a few months,

396
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
I'm gonna tell her

397
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
that he died

398
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
in a work accident.

399
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,150
And that will be

400
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,150
the end of it.

401
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,390
But Harper's

402
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,390
eight years old.

403
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,930
I mean, don't you think

404
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,930
that killing off her father

405
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,730
would be pretty

406
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,730
traumatic for her?

407
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,500
Not as traumatic

408
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,500
as the truth.

409
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,640
Harper's real father

410
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,640
has zero interest in

411
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,640
being a part of her life.

412
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,570
Please, just try

413
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,570
to figure out

414
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,670
what's going on

415
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,670
with Derek, okay?

416
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,410
So, we're right

417
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,410
back where we started?

418
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,680
Well, maybe not.

419
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,430
I mean, if Derek knows

420
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,430
that his character

421
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,430
is gonna die,

422
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,360
is it really just

423
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,360
a coincidence

424
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,260
that he's ended up

425
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,260
in a hospital?

426
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,810
Hannah?

427
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,060
Can I help you?

428
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,060
Yeah.

429
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,400
I'm looking for Dr. Asher.

430
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,400
She hasn't come in yet.

431
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,990
We had to cancel

432
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,990
her first appointment.

433
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,660
Okay. Thanks.

434
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,010
Hey, Courtney.

435
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,010
What's going on?

436
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,980
Hey. Got here about

437
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,980
a half-hour ago.

438
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,880
He refused to get

439
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,880
in the ambo.

440
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,850
His name's Larry Simpson.

441
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,850
Cardiologist put him

442
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,850
on digoxin.

443
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,880
He mixed up his

444
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,880
meds this morning.

445
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,880
Took a triple dose.

446
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,010
All right,

447
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,010
we'll take it

448
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,010
from here.

449
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,150
Stand by.

450
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,150
Hey, Larry.

451
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,020
I'm April.

452
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,020
This is Dr. Sexton.

453
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,030
Thank God.

454
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,030
Please help me.

455
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,750
Tell us

456
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,750
what happened.

457
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,360
I started feeling faint

458
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,360
on my way into work.

459
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,160
I called

460
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,160
my cardiologist.

461
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,860
He said to find a way

462
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,860
to keep my heart

463
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,860
rate up and call 911.

464
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,540
Okay.

465
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,230
Hey, you thinking

466
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,230
what I'm thinking?

467
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,670
A milligram of epi.

468
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,410
Guys.

469
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,200
All right, Larry,

470
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,610
we're gonna give you

471
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,610
some meds to keep

472
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,610
your heart rate up

473
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,440
while we get you

474
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,440
to the hospital,

475
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,440
all right?

476
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,570
Do what you have to.

477
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,570
I can't keep this up.

478
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,620
Yeah.

479
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,620
All the way up.

480
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,280
All right.

481
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,280
You're gonna feel

482
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,280
a little pinch.

483
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,790
Okay.

484
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,790
All right.

485
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,790
Now, slow it down.

486
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,190
Wait.

487
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,190
Oh, Noah!

488
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,460
Whoa, whoa.

489
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,460
Hey, hey.

490
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,590
His heart rate

491
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,590
must be dropping.

492
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,430
Hey, Larry.

493
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,430
Larry, Larry.

494
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,060
All right,

495
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,060
you have to keep

496
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,060
moving, okay?

497
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,190
Okay.

498
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,190
Keep moving.

499
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,530
Okay, okay, okay.

500
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,900
It's gonna be eight hours

501
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,880
until his body

502
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,880
metabolizes the digoxin.

503
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,710
Till that happens,

504
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,710
he has to keep running.

505
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,440
We gotta pace his heart.

506
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,570
While he's running.

507
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,950
Hey, guys,

508
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,950
you gotta do something.

509
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,280
I got an idea.

510
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,820
Here we go.

511
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,420
Hey, what do we got?

512
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,420
Name's Walter Hobbs.

513
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,390
50-year-old prison

514
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,390
transfer from Indiana.

515
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,120
Vitals are stable,

516
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,120
but there's something

517
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,120
wrong with his arm.

518
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,990
What happened?

519
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,990
Not sure.

520
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,900
Okay, hang in

521
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,900
there, Walter.

522
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,270
Trainee, start an IV,

523
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,270
and get him

524
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,270
on the monitors.

525
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,800
Easy, buddy.

526
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,400
We're gonna do

527
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,400
a sheet transfer

528
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,400
on my count.

529
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,100
Nice and easy, folks.

530
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,610
Watch the shackles,

531
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,610
everybody.

532
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,070
Okay, ready?

533
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,070
One, two, three.

534
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,780
Easy, buddy, easy.

535
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,780
You're all right,

536
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,780
you're all right.

537
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,750
Scissors.

538
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,750
Start him on O2.

539
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,310
Belly's soft.

540
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,480
Lungs are clear.

541
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,490
Walter, can you

542
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,490
tell us what happened?

543
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,430
Arm's hard as a rock.

544
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,370
Okay, all right. He's got

545
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,370
compartment syndrome.

546
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,200
Needs a fasciotomy

547
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,200
to relieve the pressure.

548
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's get

549
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,000
the Hybrid OR ready.

550
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,300
Any idea

551
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,300
what caused this?

552
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,000
Fellas?

553
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,010
Drugs, fight,

554
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,010
what are we

555
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,010
working with here?

556
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,310
Hey, Indiana sent him

557
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,310
to the closest level-one

558
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,310
trauma center

559
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,780
because his wounds

560
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,780
are severe.

561
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,180
We can't treat him

562
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,180
if you don't tell us

563
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,180
what happened.

564
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,450
Walter's been on Indiana

565
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,450
death row for 10 years.

566
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,120
The creep killed

567
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,120
a family of five

568
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,120
at a home invasion.

569
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,060
He was scheduled

570
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,060
to be executed today,

571
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,860
but something went wrong,

572
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,860
didn't kill him.

573
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,730
You mean,

574
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,730
you gave this man

575
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,730
a lethal injection?

576
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,570
Yeah, except

577
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,570
it wasn't lethal.

578
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,480
Well, I was able to

579
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,240
open up his arm and

580
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,240
relieve the pressure,

581
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,050
but he's still

582
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,050
in bad shape.

583
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,740
And the corrections

584
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,740
officers insist

585
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,650
they don't know what was

586
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,650
in the lethal cocktail.

587
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
Well, I'm not surprised.

588
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,990
Pharmaceutical companies

589
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,990
are no longer permitting

590
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,220
the use of their drugs

591
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,220
for executions.

592
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,260
Odds are these guys

593
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,760
used something

594
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,760
without their authorization.

595
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,770
Fools missed

596
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,770
his vein completely.

597
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,100
Drugs are trapped

598
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,100
in his muscle,

599
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,530
slowly leeching

600
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,530
into his bloodstream.

601
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,830
We need to know

602
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,830
what they gave him.

603
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,600
Well, I'll call

604
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,600
the warden,

605
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,440
and see if I can

606
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,440
coax him into telling me

607
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,440
what they used.

608
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,670
Meantime, see what

609
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,670
else you can do

610
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,670
to flush his system.

611
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,340
Yes, ma'am.

612
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,950
They really did

613
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,950
a number on him.

614
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,950
Let's just treat the guy

615
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,950
and get him out of here.

616
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,680
Amen to that.

617
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,260
Where's Dr. Asher?

618
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,300
I'm afraid

619
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,300
she's not available

620
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,300
right now.

621
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,590
Good news is I went

622
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,590
ahead and paged

623
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,590
Dr. Patchefsky.

624
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,890
I don't want

625
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,890
another doctor.

626
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,590
She's more than qualified.

627
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,590
No way.

628
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,870
I've had too many doctors

629
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,870
accuse me of using my pain

630
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,870
as an excuse to get high.

631
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,570
Dr. Asher's the only one

632
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,300
who understands

633
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,300
my situation.

634
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,640
Siana, your labs show

635
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,640
that you're anemic.

636
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,870
If you won't see another OB,

637
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,870
at least let me give you

638
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,870
some blood.

639
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,040
A transfusion?

640
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,310
Yes.

641
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,910
I don't know.

642
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,910
Siana,

643
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,650
the last thing Dr. Asher

644
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,650
would want is for this

645
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,650
to evolve into something

646
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,780
that could harm the baby.

647
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,660
Let us help you.

648
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,660
You need this transfusion.

649
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,550
Okay.

650
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,960
Type and cross her

651
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,960
for two units.

652
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,550
Start the first unit

653
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,550
as soon as it's up.

654
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,660
Got it.

655
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,430
Hang in there.

656
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,430
You're gonna

657
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,430
feel better soon.

658
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,000
Mmm-hmm.

659
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,170
Hannah, where are you?

660
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,640
You should've been

661
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,640
here hours ago.

662
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,010
You have a patient

663
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,010
who needs you.

664
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,680
Listen, whatever

665
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,680
your situation is,

666
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,680
just call me. Please.

667
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,820
Just let me know

668
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,820
you're okay.

669
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,480
Can't keep this up

670
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,480
for much longer.

671
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,320
We're almost set.

672
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,260
So, what is this?

673
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,260
Defibrillator.

674
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,860
Now that you're

675
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,860
staying in place,

676
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,660
we can send

677
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,660
a continuous charge

678
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,660
to your chest, okay?

679
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,790
It'll steady

680
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,790
your heart rate

681
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,130
long enough

682
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,130
for us to get you

683
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,130
to the hospital.

684
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,640
We're good.

685
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,530
All right, Larry.

686
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,530
Here we go.

687
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,470
Okay.

688
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,470
Turning it on.

689
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,310
Whoa. Hey!

690
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,310
Whoa, whoa.

691
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,980
Give me a hand!

692
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,220
Oh, God!

693
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,350
What happened?

694
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,290
We need you to get

695
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,290
back on the treadmill.

696
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,990
What? No, no.

697
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,990
Yeah.

698
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,830
Your heart rate is still

699
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,830
dangerously low.

700
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,300
You have to keep

701
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,300
running to keep it up.

702
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,340
I can't.

703
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,340
Hey, Larry.

704
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,340
You have no choice.

705
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,230
Come on. Larry,

706
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,230
come on! Come on!

707
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,330
Okay, okay.

708
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,330
Just stop slapping me.

709
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,810
All right, now,

710
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,810
come on.

711
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,810
Give me a hand.

712
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,700
Give me a hand.

713
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,640
There you go.

714
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,010
Take it up to a five.

715
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,010
Five?

716
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,320
The pads couldn't make

717
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,320
good contact with the skin

718
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,760
because of the sweat.

719
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,020
It was not your fault.

720
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,190
I gotta call Med,

721
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,190
get an attending.

722
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,390
"Derek Jordan

723
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,900
"doesn't simply

724
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,900
inhabit Richard III,

725
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,990
"he embodies

726
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,990
the psychopathic king

727
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,340
"with every molecule

728
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,340
of his being."

729
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,210
The New York Times,

730
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,210
no less.

731
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,410
So, for an actor

732
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,410
who approaches his work

733
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,410
on a molecular level,

734
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,910
I would imagine

735
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,710
that every

736
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,710
aspect of Lewis

737
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,050
has been carefully

738
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,050
researched, crafted,

739
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,460
to give Harper an incredibly

740
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,460
real and loving father.

741
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,730
And that's the role

742
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,730
of a lifetime.

743
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,020
Right? I mean,

744
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,020
no wonder you're having

745
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,020
a hard time giving it up.

746
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,800
The character dies, okay?

747
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,800
But not like that.

748
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,130
How do you mean?

749
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,740
Elaine wants

750
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,740
Lewis to disappear.

751
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,740
He would never do that.

752
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,050
No?

753
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,050
No way.

754
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,050
Lose contact

755
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,050
with his daughter?

756
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,450
Lewis loves her too much.

757
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,780
So you have...

758
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,780
You have a different

759
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,780
ending in mind?

760
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,450
I'm gonna stay true

761
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,450
to the character.

762
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,120
Right. And how are you

763
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,120
planning on doing that?

764
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,670
Wait, you're not...

765
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,470
You're not planning on dying

766
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,470
in front of Harper, are you?

767
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,130
Oh, my God.

768
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,130
What do you think

769
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,130
that will do?

770
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,500
Give her the closure

771
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,500
she deserves.

772
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,480
You poisoned yourself,

773
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,480
didn't you?

774
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,070
You would do that

775
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,070
to this little girl?

776
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,670
What did you take?

777
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,450
Tell us what

778
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,450
you took right now,

779
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,490
or we'll tell Harper

780
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,490
who you really are

781
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,580
and put an end

782
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,580
to all of this.

783
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,580
Dr. Manning.

784
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,920
You're not allowed

785
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,920
to do that.

786
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,260
That's protected

787
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,260
information, Doctor.

788
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,130
Dr. Manning, a moment.

789
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,970
What is wrong with him?

790
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,970
Look, I googled him, okay?

791
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,340
He hasn't worked

792
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,340
in six years,

793
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,700
just lost his wife

794
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,700
to cancer.

795
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,800
So he's suicidal.

796
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,800
You can put him

797
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,800
on a psych hold.

798
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,470
We can't afford

799
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,470
to antagonize him.

800
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,880
If we're gonna

801
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,880
save his life,

802
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,850
we have to get him

803
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,850
to tell us what

804
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,850
poison he took.

805
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,480
Then we have to get Elaine

806
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,040
to tell her daughter

807
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,040
the truth.

808
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,150
Where am I?

809
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,700
Chicago Med.

810
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,700
We fixed your arm.

811
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,390
Now we're giving you

812
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,390
a drug to flush the toxins

813
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,390
from your system.

814
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,570
Don't. Just let me die.

815
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,170
Easy, buddy, easy.

816
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,010
I... I could feel everything.

817
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,710
My whole body was on fire.

818
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,710
Hey.

819
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,310
I couldn't move,

820
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,310
I couldn't talk.

821
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,410
Easy.

822
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,260
I know I deserve to die,

823
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,260
but not like that.

824
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,540
How's the patient?

825
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,540
Stable and recovering.

826
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,170
In that case,

827
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,170
the warden would like him

828
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,340
transferred back

829
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,340
as soon as possible.

830
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,780
We should still

831
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,780
monitor him for any

832
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,780
post-op complications.

833
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,720
Prison medical unit

834
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,720
will take it from here.

835
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,410
The death warrant

836
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,410
was extended.

837
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,520
They just rescheduled

838
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,520
his execution.

839
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,590
How about that?

840
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
First time I ever

841
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
patched up a guy

842
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,200
just so some other guys

843
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,200
could kill him.

844
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,890
Walter Hobbs is

845
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,890
a ward of the state,

846
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,730
so as long as

847
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,730
he's stable, we comply

848
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,730
with their demands.

849
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Hey, I'm not one to fuss

850
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
about capital punishment,

851
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,900
but those bozos

852
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,900
don't have a clue

853
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,900
what they're doing.

854
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,270
That's not our problem.

855
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,270
Our job is to treat him

856
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,780
regardless of what happens

857
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,780
when we're done.

858
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,410
Oh.

859
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,540
Know what?

860
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,210
I think that's

861
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,210
what they call

862
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,210
compartmentalizing.

863
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,560
Yeah, I called

864
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,560
10 minutes ago.

865
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,750
When is he gonna

866
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,750
get here?

867
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,000
Try to hurry it up.

868
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,660
It's gonna be an hour

869
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,660
until an attending

870
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,660
gets here.

871
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,570
What if you paced him

872
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,570
internally?

873
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,230
Push a wire

874
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,230
into a man's heart

875
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,470
while he's running

876
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,470
on a treadmill?

877
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,670
Are you insane?

878
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,180
You serious?

879
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,180
Do you have

880
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,180
a better idea?

881
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
If I push the wire too far,

882
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
it'll puncture his heart.

883
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,810
Kill him

884
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,810
on the spot. No.

885
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,010
No, the best option

886
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,010
is to wait for backup.

887
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,250
Noah, look at him.

888
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,250
We do not have time.

889
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,660
You need to

890
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,660
pace him internally.

891
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,660
April...

892
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,430
Come on.

893
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,430
You can do this.

894
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,430
I'll help you.

895
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,760
O2's at 88.

896
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,270
Stop the transfusion,

897
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,270
get her on a mask.

898
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,770
Got it.

899
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,770
What's happening?

900
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,530
You're having

901
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,530
an inflammatory

902
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,530
reaction to the blood.

903
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,270
What? Why?

904
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,210
There's always

905
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,210
a risk of complications.

906
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,940
Sats are down to 79.

907
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,280
The baby's not getting

908
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,280
enough oxygen.

909
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,820
Siana, you need

910
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,820
an emergency C-section.

911
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,820
She's only seven months.

912
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,820
It's too early.

913
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,620
I know. I'm sorry.

914
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,620
We don't have a choice.

915
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,620
You just have to trust me.

916
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,990
I told you,

917
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,990
I want Dr. Asher!

918
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,550
Siana, she's not here.

919
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,560
Please, listen

920
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,560
to Dr. Halstead.

921
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,720
We have to get you

922
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,720
up to surgery now.

923
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,860
Don't lay another

924
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,860
finger on me!

925
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,020
Okay.

926
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,510
Start her on racemic epi,

927
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,510
a gram of Tylenol,

928
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,670
and push 50

929
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,670
milligrams of Benadryl.

930
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,670
Should buy us some time.

931
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,510
Where are you going?

932
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,750
I think I know where

933
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,750
to find Dr. Asher.

934
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,390
Why's it taking so long?

935
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,430
He's threading

936
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,430
a little wire

937
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,430
into your heart.

938
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,730
It's a delicate process.

939
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,060
God.

940
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,860
Just try not to tense up.

941
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,870
Uh, there's something

942
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,870
moving in my arm.

943
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,100
You mean your chest?

944
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,100
No, my arm, my left arm.

945
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,570
Okay, you must

946
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,570
have overshot

947
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,570
the vena cava.

948
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,870
You have to

949
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,870
retract the wire

950
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,870
and start again.

951
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,570
What? Start again?

952
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,740
No, no, no.

953
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,740
I can't do this anymore.

954
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,220
Larry, just hang

955
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,220
in there, okay?

956
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,340
I can't, I can't, I can't.

957
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,850
You gotta keep

958
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,850
running, Larry.

959
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,560
No, no, no! Larry!

960
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,560
Larry, hang in there

961
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,560
for a minute.

962
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,090
No, no, no, no.

963
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,090
Don't do this, Larry!

964
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,560
Finally!

965
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,560
Hey, help me out, man.

966
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,620
All right, bag him.

967
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,890
All right, I'll get

968
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,890
on his chest.

969
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,630
Heart rate's 30.

970
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,630
He's not circulating.

971
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,230
Come on.

972
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,230
Retract the wire,

973
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,230
start over.

974
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,740
He poisoned himself?

975
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,900
All his labs and symptoms

976
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,900
indicate that he has.

977
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,710
He believes

978
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,710
Lewis needs to die

979
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,220
in the presence

980
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,220
of his daughter,

981
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,380
so that Harper

982
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,380
can say goodbye

983
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,380
and get closure.

984
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,550
Look, you need

985
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,550
to tell your daughter

986
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,550
the truth.

987
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,590
I can't. No.

988
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,820
If you end it now,

989
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,900
Derek will have no reason

990
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,900
to play this all out.

991
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,900
But if Harper finds out

992
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,900
that I lied to her,

993
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,730
she will never

994
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,730
trust me again.

995
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,730
Elaine,

996
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,170
if you don't stop this,

997
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,170
Derek is going to die.

998
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,600
Harper can handle

999
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,600
the truth. Trust me.

1000
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,640
I'm not saying

1001
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,640
it's gonna be easy,

1002
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,640
but eventually,

1003
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,730
she'll understand

1004
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,730
and she will forgive you.

1005
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,310
All right.

1006
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,310
But only if he agrees.

1007
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,350
Harper will never believe

1008
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,350
that Derek is not her dad

1009
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,780
unless he is the one

1010
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,780
that tells her.

1011
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,080
Okay. Go and talk to him.

1012
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,080
Please.

1013
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,750
We can ask a nurse

1014
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,750
to take Harper

1015
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,750
to the cafeteria.

1016
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,850
Okay.

1017
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,120
Connie.

1018
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,180
I couldn't get Sean

1019
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,180
on the phone.

1020
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,620
He's not in today.

1021
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,620
Can I help?

1022
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,220
I'm looking for a woman.

1023
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,220
She's a regular.

1024
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,220
She calls herself Val.

1025
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,450
Oh. Yeah.

1026
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,520
Have you

1027
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,520
seen her today?

1028
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,520
No.

1029
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,070
Is everything okay?

1030
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,340
He's been down too long.

1031
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,340
You gotta hurry.

1032
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,230
Yeah, I'm...

1033
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,230
I'm stuck in his neck,

1034
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,370
and I... I can't

1035
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,370
advance the wire

1036
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,370
to his heart.

1037
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,410
Heart rate's

1038
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,410
down to 20.

1039
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,980
Steve, take over for me.

1040
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,690
Okay, I can

1041
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,690
feel the wire.

1042
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,690
It is stuck.

1043
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,050
Okay, I'm gonna

1044
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,050
turn his head

1045
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,590
and see if that expands

1046
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,590
the opening,

1047
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,060
and when I do,

1048
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,060
see if you can push

1049
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,060
the wire forward, okay?

1050
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,390
Okay.

1051
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,390
All right.

1052
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,490
One, two, three.

1053
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,560
Hold compressions.

1054
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,900
I see PVCs. We're in.

1055
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,900
Pacing him now.

1056
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,910
Come on.

1057
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,910
Nothing.

1058
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,910
Take it up to 100.

1059
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,610
Hundred.

1060
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,560
I don't understand.

1061
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,180
It won't capture.

1062
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,180
Come on, come on.

1063
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,020
Pressure's climbing.

1064
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,760
What happened?

1065
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,770
Just breathe, Larry.

1066
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,770
We're taking you

1067
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,770
to the hospital.

1068
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,260
Let's get him

1069
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,260
on the gurney.

1070
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,260
Okay. Yeah.

1071
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,100
Prison transport

1072
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,100
is standing by.

1073
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,700
Well, I'll let

1074
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,700
the warden know

1075
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,700
he's on his way.

1076
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,640
Dr. Choi, Dr. Marcel.

1077
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,410
My arm!

1078
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,580
Push 50 mics Fentanyl,

1079
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,580
get him on oxygen.

1080
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,060
Okay, okay, okay,

1081
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,060
all right.

1082
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,660
All right.

1083
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,230
Arm's dead

1084
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,230
and necrotic.

1085
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,400
Lethal injection drugs

1086
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,400
constricted blood supply.

1087
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,070
We need to amputate.

1088
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,070
Get the Hybrid OR ready.

1089
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,410
Dr. Choi, can I...

1090
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,810
There's no point

1091
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,810
amputating a man's arm

1092
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,080
who's just gonna

1093
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,080
get executed.

1094
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,580
Look, we're here

1095
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,580
to treat him,

1096
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,980
and right now that means

1097
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,980
amputating his arm.

1098
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,180
Arm's already

1099
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,180
dead and gone.

1100
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,690
Won't be long

1101
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,690
before he's septic.

1102
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,090
I say we load him up

1103
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,090
with pain meds,

1104
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,350
let nature take its course.

1105
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,290
We're doctors,

1106
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,290
not executioners.

1107
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,960
Hybrid OR's ready.

1108
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,090
Okay.

1109
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,670
Let's move.

1110
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,510
Siana?

1111
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,690
You and your baby

1112
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,690
are not getting

1113
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,690
enough oxygen.

1114
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,280
You need a C-section

1115
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,280
right now.

1116
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,820
You're just gonna

1117
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,820
make things worse.

1118
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,620
I know you

1119
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,620
don't trust me,

1120
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,620
and I get it.

1121
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,820
But you can't rely

1122
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,820
on Dr. Asher

1123
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,820
today, either.

1124
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,960
She's not coming.

1125
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,960
No.

1126
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,330
No!

1127
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,660
Siana, listen to me.

1128
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,660
In a few minutes,

1129
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,200
you're gonna go

1130
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,200
into respiratory failure.

1131
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,670
You'll suffocate and die,

1132
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,330
at which point

1133
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,330
we'll rush you upstairs

1134
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,210
for a C-section

1135
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,210
and deliver your daughter.

1136
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,540
Siana, you said you

1137
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,540
wanted everything to

1138
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,540
be perfect for your baby.

1139
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,650
That means making sure

1140
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,650
she grows up with her mother.

1141
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,090
Please.

1142
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,990
Will you let us

1143
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,990
help you?

1144
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,990
Mmm-hmm.

1145
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,190
Open intubation tray.

1146
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,190
Call OB, tell them

1147
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,190
we're on our way.

1148
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,680
Almost there.

1149
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,110
Okay, bone's cut.

1150
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,080
Just need to release

1151
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,080
the posterior muscle.

1152
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,550
Okay.

1153
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,950
Here we go.

1154
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,100
All right, let's go ahead

1155
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,100
and tie off the vessels.

1156
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,960
Wait a second.

1157
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,440
The skin on his

1158
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,440
shoulder's dusky.

1159
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,440
Hand me a scalpel.

1160
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,270
Whoa!

1161
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,240
Sorry, Doc.

1162
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,060
The necrosis has spread

1163
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,060
all the way into the

1164
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,060
shoulders and chest.

1165
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,220
We gotta keep going.

1166
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,920
Okay,

1167
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,920
I'm gonna get help.

1168
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,630
He won't do it!

1169
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,760
He wouldn't

1170
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,760
even discuss it!

1171
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,170
Now he's getting

1172
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,170
really sick!

1173
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,470
He's in bronchospasm.

1174
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,480
Push 0.3 milligrams

1175
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,480
sub-q epi.

1176
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,600
On it.

1177
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,600
Tell us what you took.

1178
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,480
Sats are coming up.

1179
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,320
Your kidneys are starting

1180
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,320
to shut down.

1181
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,120
Tell us what you took.

1182
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,520
Do you have any idea

1183
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,520
what it looks like

1184
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,490
when a human being

1185
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,490
goes into organ failure?

1186
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,200
It's gruesome.

1187
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,200
Horribly painful,

1188
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,200
it's violent.

1189
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,370
Are you sure

1190
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,370
that that's...

1191
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,100
That's the kind of closure

1192
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,760
that you wanna

1193
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,760
give to Harper?

1194
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,870
What if we can

1195
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,870
figure out a way

1196
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,310
to give you what you want

1197
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,310
and save your life?

1198
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,040
How?

1199
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,710
By staging your death.

1200
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,780
Okay?

1201
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,820
You give your daughter

1202
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,820
a final farewell,

1203
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,690
and then you

1204
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,690
drift off to sleep.

1205
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,150
What? No.

1206
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,720
It has to be perfect.

1207
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,860
It has to be real

1208
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,860
for Harper.

1209
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,520
Real, but peaceful.

1210
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,830
You go to sleep,

1211
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,830
she leaves the room.

1212
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,830
All right?

1213
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,300
Tell us what you took.

1214
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,330
I will.

1215
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,140
Afterwards.

1216
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,300
Dr. Charles.

1217
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,710
You can't do this.

1218
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,840
What's the alternative?

1219
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,820
Sit there

1220
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,820
while the guy dies?

1221
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,150
Just do nothing

1222
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,150
while he kills himself?

1223
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,660
There has to be

1224
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,660
another option.

1225
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,420
Look, unfortunately,

1226
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,420
one way or the other,

1227
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,050
Harper's gonna experience

1228
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,050
her father's death. Right?

1229
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,690
But this way,

1230
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,690
hopefully, it'll be

1231
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,690
less traumatic for her,

1232
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,890
and maybe we can

1233
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,890
save the guy's life.

1234
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,100
Decay's

1235
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,100
infiltrated all the way

1236
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,100
into his chest cavity.

1237
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,570
Pressure's dropping.

1238
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,840
Axillary

1239
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,840
artery's torn and

1240
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,840
retracted into his chest.

1241
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,680
I can't pinch it off.

1242
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,350
Pressure's down to 80.

1243
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,610
Come on.

1244
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,190
I need to clamp it.

1245
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,600
I can't reach it.

1246
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,900
He's peri-arrest.

1247
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,470
I can't get control

1248
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,470
of the vessel.

1249
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,940
He's bradying.

1250
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,940
Heart rate's 20.

1251
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,600
Doing

1252
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,600
the best I can.

1253
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,080
He's arresting.

1254
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,080
Lost his pulse.

1255
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,150
You need to

1256
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,150
start compressions.

1257
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,240
Circulate what?

1258
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,110
He's right.

1259
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,060
His blood's

1260
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,060
already on the table.

1261
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,120
Time of death, 16:22.

1262
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,910
Daddy?

1263
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,310
Hey, sweetheart.

1264
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,970
Daddy's really sick.

1265
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,520
But you're gonna

1266
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,520
get better, right?

1267
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,350
I don't think

1268
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,350
they can fix me,

1269
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,350
honeybear.

1270
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,260
But I want you to know

1271
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,500
that I'm so proud of you.

1272
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,790
And remember,

1273
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,000
Daddy loves you

1274
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,000
more than anything.

1275
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,640
I love you too, Daddy.

1276
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,960
I think, uh, we should

1277
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,960
let your daddy get some rest.

1278
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,970
Okay, baby.

1279
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,970
Come on. Come on.

1280
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,400
You're gonna get better.

1281
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,070
You're gonna

1282
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,070
get better, okay?

1283
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,310
We're gonna do

1284
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,310
all the things

1285
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,310
you talked about.

1286
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,210
You're gonna take me

1287
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,210
to Geneva, and Paris,

1288
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,550
and we'll see

1289
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,550
the Eiffel Tower

1290
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,550
and the Mona Lisa

1291
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,420
and that really

1292
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,420
big museum.

1293
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,820
You can't die, Daddy!

1294
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,820
You can't die!

1295
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,030
Daddy?

1296
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,370
I can't do this to you.

1297
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,370
I'm so sorry.

1298
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,570
You're okay?

1299
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,510
I am, sweetie.

1300
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,510
I'm right here.

1301
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,690
Don't let me die,

1302
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,690
for her sake.

1303
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,690
It was cyanide.

1304
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Grab a cyano kit

1305
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,080
from the Pyxis

1306
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,180
and hang

1307
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,180
the hydroxocobalamin now.

1308
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,860
Is my daddy really

1309
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,860
gonna be okay?

1310
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,900
Is he?

1311
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,900
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

1312
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,860
Come on, honey,

1313
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,860
let's let the doctors

1314
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,860
work on him, okay?

1315
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,700
Okay, come on.

1316
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,800
It's gonna be

1317
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,800
okay, Daddy.

1318
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,930
Yeah.

1319
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,370
I'm sorry.

1320
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,370
Go.

1321
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,420
Almost there.

1322
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,510
Baby girl.

1323
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,510
Premature but healthy.

1324
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,090
All right, let's get her

1325
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,090
to the NICU.

1326
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,930
How's Mom?

1327
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,590
Sats and pressure

1328
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,590
are holding steady.

1329
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,590
Should be fine.

1330
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,110
Hey. How are Siana

1331
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,110
and the baby?

1332
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,330
They're fine.

1333
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,030
Oh, thank God.

1334
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,030
Now?

1335
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,170
I just, uh,... My phone

1336
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,170
crashed on me.

1337
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,210
I had to get it fixed,

1338
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,210
and I caught a flat,

1339
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,210
it was just...

1340
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,370
It was like

1341
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,370
the perfect storm.

1342
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,710
I just could not

1343
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,710
get in here today.

1344
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,220
Your patient

1345
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,220
and her baby

1346
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,220
almost died today

1347
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,810
while you were off

1348
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,810
somewhere getting high.

1349
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,110
High?

1350
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,720
I told you,

1351
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,720
I caught a flat.

1352
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,990
You expect me

1353
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,990
to believe that?

1354
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,390
You didn't seem

1355
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,390
to have a problem last night.

1356
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,130
Yeah, that was a mistake.

1357
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,130
A mistake?

1358
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,390
Yeah, and it was a mistake

1359
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,390
thinking you'd turn

1360
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,390
yourself in today.

1361
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,900
You know what?

1362
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,900
You think whatever

1363
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,900
you want to.

1364
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,630
I need to go

1365
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,630
check on Siana.

1366
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,980
A few hours ago,

1367
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,980
you were ready

1368
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,980
to discharge him.

1369
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,350
Now you're telling us

1370
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,350
he's dead?

1371
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,010
The doctors encountered

1372
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,010
complications in surgery.

1373
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,420
Bleeding,

1374
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,420
to be specific.

1375
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,320
Ultimately, we weren't able

1376
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,320
to get it under control.

1377
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,720
They did everything

1378
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,720
they could.

1379
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,490
You can explain

1380
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,490
all that to the AG.

1381
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,060
That man belonged

1382
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,060
to the state of Indiana,

1383
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,060
and he died on your watch.

1384
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,590
Let's go.

1385
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,430
Is there anything

1386
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,430
I need to know

1387
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,340
about what happened

1388
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,340
in there?

1389
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,950
Ms. Goodwin...

1390
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,910
I assure you,

1391
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,910
Dr. Marcel and I

1392
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,910
did all we could.

1393
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,210
Mmm-hmm.

1394
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,760
I'm glad to hear that.

1395
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,270
How's he doing?

1396
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,780
Dr. Latham was able

1397
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,780
to implant a permanent

1398
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,780
pacemaker.

1399
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,210
He should make

1400
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,210
a full recovery.

1401
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,410
Thank God.

1402
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,240
He also said that

1403
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,240
given the circumstances,

1404
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,880
it was a very

1405
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,880
impressive save.

1406
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,120
I don't understand.

1407
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,590
My daddy's

1408
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,590
not my daddy?

1409
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,430
But he is.

1410
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,500
You know,

1411
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,500
Harper, it really is

1412
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,500
kind of confusing.

1413
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,800
And it might take a while

1414
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,800
for you to understand.

1415
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,100
But all you really

1416
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,100
need to know

1417
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,480
is that he loves you

1418
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,480
very, very much.

1419
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,740
I know that.

1420
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,810
Can I go see him now?

1421
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,580
Okay.

1422
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,620
Yeah, of course.

1423
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,620
We can go see him.

1424
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,010
Hey. You ready?

1425
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,340
Yeah.

1426
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,510
Listen,

1427
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,380
I know we had

1428
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,380
plans tonight,

1429
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,650
but I was wondering

1430
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,650
if maybe we could

1431
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,520
grab a drink

1432
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,520
with Crockett first.

1433
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,110
With Crockett?

1434
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,620
I know you don't think

1435
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,620
the world of the guy,

1436
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,460
but we had

1437
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,460
a really rough day

1438
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,460
on the case today.

1439
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,490
Oh. Okay.

1440
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,170
Why don't you go ahead...

1441
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,170
Forget it.

1442
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,870
I can do it another time.

1443
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,530
You sure?

1444
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,530
Yeah.

1445
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,580
Come on.

1446
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,580
Let's go home.

1447
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,510
We got a date

1448
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,510
tonight, right?

1449
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,020
Yeah. Okay.

1450
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,540
Hey, Earl.

1451
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,540
You got a minute?

1452
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,940
What do you need,

1453
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,940
Dr. Halstead?

1454
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,930
A favor.

1455
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,680
Seek. Seek.

1456
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,050
You were right.
