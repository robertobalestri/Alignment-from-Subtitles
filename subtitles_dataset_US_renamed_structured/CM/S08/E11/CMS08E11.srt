1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,290
You never told me

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,290
you were in an accident.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,460
I know how it looks.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,130
How am I supposed

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,130
to believe you?

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,580
We've had

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,580
a couple very pleasant

8
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,580
coffees together.

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,580
How about we, I don't know,

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,580
advance to dinner?

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,310
My apartment. 8:00.

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,520
Did I hear

13
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,520
something about an inmate

14
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,520
from Cook County?

15
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,060
Yeah.

16
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,060
Shanked in the neck.

17
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,560
His last name's Archer.

18
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,120
Dad.

19
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,330
It's gonna be okay,

20
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,330
my boy.

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,280
Sean, what is the matter?

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,280
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,280
Are you in trouble?

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,180
Dad, take a breath.

25
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,310
I'm getting

26
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,310
all these calls...

27
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,680
Well, something's come up.

28
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,010
Huh?

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,280
I'm getting out.

30
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,720
You're getting out?

31
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,060
It... What... Really?

32
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,630
When?

33
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,630
Tomorrow.

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
And, uh, it's a done deal?

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,330
You got 14 months left

36
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,330
on your sentence.

37
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,500
I know.

38
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,500
I guess good behavior,

39
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,480
compassionate release,

40
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,480
overcrowding...

41
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,740
Who cares?

42
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,510
You're getting out.

43
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,560
So what's the...

44
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,560
What's next?

45
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,520
You going back to school?

46
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,650
Or you gonna get a job?

47
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,560
Right now, I just wanna

48
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,560
get to tomorrow.

49
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,240
Well, I'm happy for you.

50
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,670
Liliana? Fantastic cook.

51
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,680
Man, she made me

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,680
this dish last night.

53
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,650
Kluski slaskie?

54
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,650
Kluski slaskie.

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,580
You can't pronounce it.

56
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,850
I don't have a clue.

57
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,390
I can't pronounce any of

58
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,390
the dishes she's made for me.

59
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,290
Wait, "dishes"? Plural?

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,390
I've been over to her house

61
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,390
twice for dinner now.

62
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,590
Third one's on the books.

63
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,670
That's wonderful, Daniel.

64
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,670
I'm so happy for you.

65
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,570
Thank you.

66
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,570
Thank you very much.

67
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,570
How are you doing? How's biz?

68
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,500
There's still a few

69
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,500
supply snags here and there,

70
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,840
but no major headaches.

71
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,110
And I probably

72
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,110
just jinxed it.

73
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,650
Uh-oh.

74
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,650
You know.

75
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,440
If it's quiet today,

76
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,440
doesn't mean

77
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,440
it's quiet tomorrow.

78
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,610
Tell me about it.

79
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,740
Keep up the good work.

80
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,740
Bye.

81
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,180
Oh, Maggie.

82
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,520
Oh, good morning.

83
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,280
Morning. I have an idea.

84
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,290
Came to me on the train

85
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,290
on the way in.

86
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,320
Balderdash.

87
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,320
Balder-what?

88
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,450
Dash. It's a party game.

89
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,360
For the next, game night

90
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,360
at your place.

91
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,870
It's been a while

92
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,870
since you've had one.

93
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,600
Yeah, not sure

94
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,600
when there'll

95
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,600
be another one, though.

96
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,470
No worries.

97
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,470
Just putting in

98
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,470
the request now.

99
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,270
Hoping to level out

100
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,270
the playing field.

101
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,500
Ah.

102
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,500
Balderdash is a solo game,

103
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,270
so you and Ben

104
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,270
can't join forces

105
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,780
and destroy the rest of us

106
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,780
like you did in Heads Up!

107
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,520
You got this.

108
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,450
Keep working the beta.

109
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,450
Flow through the moves.

110
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,530
I have no idea

111
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,530
what any of that means.

112
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,460
Okay.

113
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
I think I'm stuck.

114
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,690
No, you're good.

115
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,890
Right leg up

116
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,890
on the next hold.

117
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,890
Okay.

118
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,830
Left hand

119
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,830
up and over.

120
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,470
There we go.

121
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,940
That's right, Asher.

122
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,940
Send it.

123
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,240
Wow, nice reach.

124
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,620
5.13. Nice job, Omar.

125
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,350
What do you say?

126
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,950
Give it another try?

127
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,950
I got close.

128
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,500
Makes it all the more

129
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,500
worth it when you ring

130
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,500
that summit bell.

131
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,300
Omar? You good, man?

132
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,410
No one on belay.

133
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,410
Omar, you clipped in?

134
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,610
Is he okay?

135
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,610
I don't think so.

136
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,770
Clip in, Omar!

137
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,310
Omar, clip in!

138
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,260
Oh, my God.

139
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,260
I'll call 911.

140
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,750
Stay with me, man.

141
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,230
Stay with me.

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,230
Hi. This is

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,230
Dr. Hannah Asher.

144
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,670
I need an ambulance at the

145
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,670
rock climbing gym off Morgan.

146
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,480
Courtney, what've we got?

147
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,850
Omar Thomas, 34.

148
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,820
Long fall while indoor

149
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,820
rock climbing.

150
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
Landed on his heels

151
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
with axial load.

152
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,620
No loss of consciousness.

153
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,620
Heart rate 120. BP 140/90.

154
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,460
Gave him 4 of morphine

155
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,460
in the ambo,

156
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,460
but he's still in pain.

157
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,620
He a friend of yours?

158
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,790
Gym buddy.

159
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,790
All right.

160
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,560
Omar, we're gonna

161
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,560
take good care of you.

162
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,560
Okay, buddy?

163
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,030
Nice and easy.

164
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,030
On my count, all right?

165
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,830
One, two, three.

166
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,870
Give me 100 of fentanyl

167
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,870
for the pain.

168
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,340
Lungs are clear.

169
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,340
Belly's soft.

170
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,610
Smelling alcohol

171
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,610
on his breath.

172
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,310
Yeah, we smelled that too.

173
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,310
Think it's beer.

174
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,910
He wasn't clipped in.

175
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,910
No one on belay.

176
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,890
I don't see him making

177
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,890
those kinds of rookie mistakes

178
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,360
without being impaired.

179
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,620
Okay, Kathleen,

180
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,660
X-rays of his chest, pelvis,

181
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,660
hips, knees, and ankles.

182
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,730
Mindy, CT head,

183
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,730
CTLS abdomen and pelvis,

184
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,930
standard trauma labs

185
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,930
and type and screen.

186
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,560
Let me see your hands.

187
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,030
Ooh.

188
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,310
That's a gnarly rope burn.

189
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,310
Yeah. I'll be fine.

190
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,710
Dr. Asher, Leah's asking

191
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,710
for you in the waiting room.

192
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,970
All right.

193
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,970
Let me change first.

194
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,980
Cool water and aloe

195
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,980
on those hands.

196
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,980
And keep me updated

197
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,980
on him, okay?

198
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,680
Thank you.

199
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,680
You got it.

200
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,890
Hey, Leah. You needed me?

201
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,000
Name's Jodie Dunner.

202
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,620
Says she's having

203
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,620
an endometriosis flare-up.

204
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,600
She's been crying

205
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,600
since she signed in.

206
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,830
Okay. Thank you.

207
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,470
Ms. Dunner,

208
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,470
I'm Dr. Asher.

209
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,770
I hurt so bad.

210
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,540
Endometriosis is...

211
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,540
it's cruel.

212
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,440
I'm a yoga teacher.

213
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,510
I practice patience

214
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,510
for a living,

215
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,510
but this pain, it's...

216
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,610
Come on.

217
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,980
Let me help you

218
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,980
to an exam room.

219
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,820
Uh... Is it my turn?

220
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,050
Triage system.

221
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,650
Your pain's bumping you

222
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,650
to the front of the line.

223
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,750
Here.

224
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,960
Hook him up.

225
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,960
I'll be right there.

226
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,760
Hey.

227
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,760
How's Omar?

228
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,500
Bilateral tibiotalar

229
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,500
dislocations.

230
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,700
No broken spine

231
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,700
or pelvis.

232
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,140
No fractured femurs.

233
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,540
Liver and spleen

234
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,540
are still intact.

235
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,480
I figured you'd agree

236
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,480
that that's good news.

237
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,070
It is.

238
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,620
It's just Omar's BAC

239
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,620
was only .04.

240
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,550
What's that, two beers?

241
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,750
He wasn't drunk,

242
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,750
so why'd he fall?

243
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,830
Maybe he just

244
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,830
made a mistake.

245
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,720
Dr. Marcel, Dr. Lieu,

246
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,720
something's not right

247
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,720
with Mr. Thomas.

248
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,790
Mr. Thomas?

249
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,430
What happened to my legs?

250
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,630
Justin?

251
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,970
Yeah, Omar, it's me.

252
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,040
You were in an accident

253
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,040
at the gym this morning,

254
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,130
and you fell.

255
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Dislocated both

256
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
your ankles.

257
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,040
What? I did?

258
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,480
Where am I?

259
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,850
What happened to my legs?

260
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,980
You had an accident,

261
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,980
Mr. Thomas.

262
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,490
You fell,

263
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,490
injured your ankles.

264
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,590
Justin?

265
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,790
All right, hang in there

266
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,790
for me, Mr. Thomas.

267
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,070
Dr. Lieu, doors.

268
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,080
Some sort of memory loop?

269
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,480
Maybe a whiplash injury,

270
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,480
concussion?

271
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,210
I literally caught him

272
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,210
when he hit the ground.

273
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,490
He didn't hit his head.

274
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,080
The summit bell.

275
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,620
He kept ringing it.

276
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,180
Same sort of loop

277
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,180
like he's doing now.

278
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,820
But it was before the fall.

279
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,490
All right,

280
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,490
first things first.

281
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,960
Let's reduce his dislocation.

282
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,120
Soon as that's done,

283
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,120
let's pull in

284
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,120
Dr. Charles, okay?

285
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,800
Just so you know, I've never

286
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,800
officially been diagnosed

287
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,800
with endometriosis.

288
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,600
Yeah, I noticed

289
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,600
that in your chart.

290
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,170
My sister, though,

291
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,170
she has it.

292
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,770
We're so alike.

293
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,110
Tender?

294
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,110
Yeah.

295
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,780
In my back.

296
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,680
Your back? Really?

297
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,520
Endo pain is primarily focused

298
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,520
in the pelvic area.

299
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,250
I don't know.

300
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,250
I guess it's radiating.

301
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,550
About to start my period.

302
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,550
Maybe that's why.

303
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,150
All right, well,

304
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,150
I'd like to run some tests,

305
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,100
do a bimanual exam,

306
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,100
then an ultrasound.

307
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Sure. Yeah, anything.

308
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
I just want to feel better.

309
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,270
Do you think I could

310
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,270
get something now, though?

311
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,000
For the pain?

312
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,140
How about Tylenol?

313
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,270
Okay. If you think

314
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,270
it'll help.

315
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,780
One thousand milligrams

316
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,780
acetaminophen.

317
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,750
That's it?

318
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,750
For this degree of pain?

319
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,550
Yeah, I want to hold off

320
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,550
on anything stronger for now.

321
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,680
Okay.

322
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,020
Dr. Halstead,

323
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,020
you're going to five.

324
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,290
Cesar, talk to me.

325
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,960
Aaron Curtis, 22.

326
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,960
Severe abdominal pain.

327
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,830
He doubled over at work

328
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,830
while stocking shelves.

329
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,230
BP 133/86. Heart rate 99.

330
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,640
Sats 100%.

331
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,140
Two of morphine

332
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,140
given in the ambo.

333
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,670
All this ain't necessary.

334
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,300
Maybe, but you're here now,

335
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,300
so let us check you out.

336
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,610
Okay, on my count.

337
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,610
One, two three.

338
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,020
Thank you.

339
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,920
Look, my manager

340
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,920
at the grocery store,

341
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,750
that's who called

342
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,750
the ambulance. He's just

343
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,750
overreacting. That's all.

344
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,890
Sorry we can't take

345
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,890
your word for it.

346
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,790
Hey, Aaron,

347
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,790
your stomach pain,

348
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,630
did it just start

349
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,630
this morning, or you been

350
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,630
feeling it a while?

351
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,070
I don't know. Couple days.

352
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,330
Can you describe it?

353
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,900
Dull? Sharp? In between?

354
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,010
Ooh...

355
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,340
Okay. Sharp.

356
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,640
KUB.

357
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,720
We're gonna grab some X-rays,

358
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,720
see what's going on.

359
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,080
I know it's uncomfortable,

360
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,080
but stay still, okay, Aaron?

361
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,110
Please,

362
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,880
just let me up out of here.

363
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,250
X-ray up. Clear.

364
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,190
That's a bullet, Aaron.

365
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,890
You were shot?

366
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,640
Okay, let's turn him.

367
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,730
Nice and easy.

368
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,980
There you are.

369
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,810
Partially healed entry wound

370
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,810
in the left flank.

371
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,780
I'd guess

372
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,780
it's a few days old.

373
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,250
What happened, Aaron?

374
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,180
Aaron?

375
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,620
Triple contrast CT.

376
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,190
Maybe it'll tell us

377
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,190
something.

378
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,170
Were you able to get anything

379
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,170
out of him?

380
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,270
Nope.

381
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,110
He won't share

382
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,110
the what, when,

383
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,110
or why of his gunshot.

384
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,880
Yeah, something sketchy

385
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,880
went down.

386
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,120
So, Aaron, here's where

387
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,120
we are, okay?

388
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,380
The bullet is resting

389
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,380
just above the neck

390
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,380
of your pancreas.

391
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,920
Do I need an operation?

392
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,860
Trauma surgeon

393
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,860
doesn't think so.

394
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,030
Then I could bounce?

395
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,830
The pancreas is very

396
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,830
unforgiving.

397
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,300
Just because you're stable now

398
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,300
doesn't mean you're

399
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,300
out of the woods.

400
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,700
There's one more thing.

401
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,340
By law, gunshot wounds have

402
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,340
to be reported to the police.

403
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,030
Aaron...

404
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,910
If you're in trouble,

405
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,910
maybe we can help you.

406
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,340
You just gotta talk to us.

407
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,030
It doesn't matter what I say.

408
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,700
Hmm.

409
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,170
Vegan portabella

410
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,170
mushroom jerky.

411
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,860
Yeah, low in sodium.

412
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,460
Lower on taste.

413
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,170
Your kidneys thank you.

414
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,710
Well, they better.

415
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,710
What's up?

416
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,970
Ah, OpioHealth,

417
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,280
that new AI program

418
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,280
that the hospital's

419
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,280
testing out

420
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,480
to assess

421
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,480
a patient's risk

422
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,480
of opioid abuse?

423
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,080
Yeah, it's one of those

424
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,080
new technologies

425
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,090
designed to sniff out

426
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,090
doctor shoppers, yeah?

427
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,090
Yeah, well, I ran

428
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,090
my endometriosis

429
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,090
patient's name

430
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,720
through it,

431
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,720
Jodie Dunner.

432
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,820
She was red-flagged.

433
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,830
Well, I can see why.

434
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,450
That's a lengthy

435
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,450
prescription history.

436
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,730
Opioids, benzos,

437
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,730
barbiturates.

438
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,860
Yeah, reads like

439
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,860
a classic pill-seeker.

440
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,000
And given that her primary

441
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,000
complaint was back pain,

442
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,270
I thought so too.

443
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,830
But now,

444
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,830
I'm not so sure.

445
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,240
Okay. What do you need?

446
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,510
Second opinion.

447
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,110
The AI program tagged her

448
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,110
as high-risk.

449
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,380
That means if it is endo,

450
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
I'm locked out

451
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
of prescribing

452
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
her meds, but...

453
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,750
As chief of the ED,

454
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,750
I can override

455
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,750
the OpioHealth program.

456
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,910
Yes.

457
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,120
Dean, you know my past.

458
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,450
It takes one to know one,

459
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,450
but Jodie...

460
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,020
I'm just not getting

461
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,020
that vibe from her.

462
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,530
Maggie?

463
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,430
Maggie.

464
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

465
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,540
What do you need?

466
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,940
Treatment seven is cleared

467
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,940
and turned over.

468
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,950
Everything good?

469
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,180
Yeah, of course.

470
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,820
Okay.

471
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,520
Hey, they're done.

472
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,790
So he tell you

473
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,790
what happened?

474
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,260
No, he probably doesn't want

475
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,260
to dig his hole any deeper.

476
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,370
And what does

477
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,370
that mean?

478
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,490
Area South Robbery-Homicide's

479
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,490
working a case off 91s

480
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,490
from last week.

481
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,040
Mini-mart got stuck up.

482
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,110
Clerk pulled a gun,

483
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,110
tried to protect himself.

484
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,300
Took one to the chest.

485
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,400
Didn't make it.

486
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,840
And you think Aaron's

487
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,840
your guy?

488
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,910
The description we got

489
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,910
on the offender,

490
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,880
male, Black, average height,

491
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,880
medium build, hoodie.

492
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,180
Clerk fired off a round

493
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,180
before he went down.

494
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,260
Separate blood on the scene

495
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,260
shows he hit someone.

496
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,550
Detective working the case

497
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,550
is on his way over.

498
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,850
We're gonna sit on the room

499
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,850
until he gets here.

500
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,160
All right. Thanks, guys.

501
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,000
Be advised...

502
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,130
I know these guys are

503
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,130
just chasing leads, but...

504
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,140
Male, Black,

505
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,140
average height,

506
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,140
medium build?

507
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,970
That could be

508
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,970
a lot of people, Will.

509
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,130
Yeah, and getting shot

510
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,130
doesn't mean

511
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,130
you're a criminal.

512
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,310
I mean,

513
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,310
the way that Aaron

514
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,310
took my hand at the intake,

515
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,970
the way he looked

516
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,970
into my eyes...

517
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,310
I felt it too.

518
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,940
I mean, I don't know

519
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,940
if he did it or not,

520
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,990
but I'm certain that they've

521
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,990
already made up their minds.

522
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,460
So I fell while

523
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,460
I was climbing...

524
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,430
I dislocated both my ankles,

525
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,060
and they're set now.

526
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,570
And that's what

527
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,570
these casts are for.

528
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,940
Exactly.

529
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
And we were talking

530
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
about next steps.

531
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,500
Can you remember

532
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,500
what we said?

533
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,500
Right.

534
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,080
Yeah, you said that...

535
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,310
You said...

536
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,910
Damn it!

537
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,080
I don't... I don't know.

538
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,450
Omar, you had a big fall.

539
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,580
It's not okay.

540
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,580
Why can't I remember?

541
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,990
What is happening to me?

542
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,560
Omar, your blood pressure

543
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,560
is getting a little high,

544
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,530
so we're gonna give you

545
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,530
some medicine

546
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,530
to bring it back down.

547
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,400
Just breathe in

548
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,400
through your nose.

549
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,430
Out through the mouth.

550
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,370
In through the nose,

551
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,240
and out through the mouth.

552
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,640
Okay. You know

553
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,640
what, buddy?

554
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,380
I'm gonna let you rest

555
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,380
a little bit, but I want

556
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,380
you to be assured

557
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,910
we're gonna figure this out.

558
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,940
In the meantime,

559
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,540
can I get you

560
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,540
another sandwich?

561
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,540
You kind of mangled that one.

562
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,620
No? All right.

563
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,620
I will, uh,

564
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,620
check back in a bit.

565
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,300
Clearly, he's got some kind

566
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,300
of short-term memory issue,

567
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,460
which is understandably

568
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,460
stressing him out

569
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,460
a little bit.

570
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,040
I mean,

571
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,040
you know Omar, right?

572
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,470
Can you tell me

573
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,470
a little bit about him?

574
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,440
He's only been climbing

575
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,440
a few years,

576
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,010
but he's a star at the gym.

577
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,370
He trains hard.

578
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,370
Disciplined. Driven.

579
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,310
All right.

580
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,310
So more of a type A?

581
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,680
You thinking

582
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,680
he had a mental break

583
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,350
from pushing himself

584
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,350
too hard?

585
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,080
Well, memory loss

586
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,080
can be a result

587
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,050
of a number of

588
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,050
psychiatric conditions,

589
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,620
but it can also be

590
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,620
neurologic.

591
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,120
You know what

592
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,120
I want to do? I want to

593
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,120
get a nutrition panel.

594
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,250
See what we get,

595
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,250
go from there?

596
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,250
Okay.

597
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,690
Thank you.

598
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,690
Yeah.

599
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,360
Any discomfort?

600
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,360
Kind of.

601
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,060
Hmm? Can you be

602
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,060
more specific?

603
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,260
How does this feel?

604
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,730
Um...

605
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,480
I guess pressure.

606
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,380
Pressure, like

607
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,380
I'm pressing on your abdomen?

608
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,180
Yeah. Sorry. It's just

609
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,180
hard to describe.

610
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,980
Okay. Pressing farther up now,

611
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,980
near your diaphragm.

612
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,550
How does this feel?

613
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,680
Same, I guess.

614
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,020
Okay.

615
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,190
Not sharp, stabbing?

616
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,560
No, just, like, pressure.

617
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,160
Okay, Jodie, I don't think

618
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,160
this is endometriosis.

619
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,140
But to be sure,

620
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,140
I'm gonna run

621
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,140
some tests.

622
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,500
CT, MRI, diagnostic lap.

623
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,040
Lap? What's that?

624
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,300
Laparoscopy.

625
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,240
We insert a scope

626
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,240
into your abdomen,

627
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,740
check out what's going on.

628
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,540
Surgery?

629
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,540
Yeah.

630
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,140
And unfortunately,

631
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,140
we won't be able to give you

632
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,140
pain meds beforehand,

633
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,020
'cause it might interfere

634
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,020
with the results.

635
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,650
Okay. I get it.

636
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,290
Hey, it'll be all right.

637
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,430
Pupils practically pinpoint.

638
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,060
Overall listlessness.

639
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,690
Yeah, all signs

640
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,690
she's high.

641
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,360
Her tox screen was likely

642
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,360
a false negative.

643
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,500
She probably loaded up

644
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,500
on water before coming in,

645
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,100
knew it could dilute

646
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,100
her urine sample.

647
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,110
Yeah, doubt she saw a mountain

648
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,110
of tests coming her way,

649
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,110
and I didn't get the sense

650
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,370
that she knew

651
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,370
that they were phony.

652
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,180
No, my guess

653
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,180
is that right now,

654
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,740
she's planning her escape

655
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,740
before any social workers

656
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,740
become involved.

657
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,120
I believed her,

658
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,580
or I don't know, maybe

659
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,580
I just wanted to believe her.

660
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,360
Look, you thought Jodie

661
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,360
was in pain, okay?

662
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,190
You didn't care what kind.

663
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,190
You just wanted to help.

664
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,070
How long has the detective

665
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,070
been with Aaron?

666
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,670
About ten minutes.

667
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,470
He's not talking

668
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,470
to him either.

669
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,710
He was sitting there,

670
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,710
and then his eyes rolled back.

671
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,810
And he just slumped.

672
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,450
Aaron?

673
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,690
Aaron? Bag him.

674
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,090
BP's a mess.

675
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,090
88/50 and falling.

676
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,180
Roll him.

677
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,390
Huge melanotic stool.

678
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,290
He's bleeding

679
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,290
into his GI tract.

680
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,100
Two units of blood

681
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,100
on the rapid transfuser.

682
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,360
Already on it.

683
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,600
Watch your step.

684
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,400
All right, we're moving.

685
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,400
CT. Let's go.

686
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,670
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

687
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,280
You said I didn't

688
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,280
need surgery.

689
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,280
Well, that was before.

690
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,850
Your condition

691
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,850
has deteriorated.

692
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,380
The bullet has eroded

693
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,380
into the, uh, the neck

694
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,380
of the pancreas.

695
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,320
That means

696
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,320
it's touching the organ,

697
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,330
making it bleed into the tube

698
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,330
that drains your intestines.

699
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,620
It won't stop on its own?

700
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,790
It may or it may not.

701
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,530
The safest option

702
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,530
is to go in,

703
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,530
take out the bullet,

704
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,730
and remove the damaged area

705
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,730
of the pancreas.

706
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,860
No. No surgery. No.

707
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,840
Look, Aaron, your

708
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,840
blood pressure's unstable.

709
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,310
You've lost a lot of blood.

710
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,900
Opening me up means

711
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,900
he gets the bullet.

712
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,380
I know how it works.

713
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,640
He gonna use it

714
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,640
to tie me to the robbery.

715
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,920
Are you saying

716
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,920
that you were there?

717
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,650
I was there,

718
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,650
but I didn't

719
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,650
rob nobody.

720
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,460
Definitely didn't

721
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,460
shoot nobody.

722
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,530
I was getting a sandwich

723
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,530
on my way to work.

724
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,240
Went to the counter to pay,

725
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,240
and next thing I know,

726
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,830
a guy's jacking the place.

727
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,940
I mean, he got a gun.

728
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,570
Clerk got a gun.

729
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,810
They firing.

730
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,240
I ran.

731
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,710
I felt getting hit, but...

732
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,480
I just kept running.

733
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,880
It's been

734
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,880
a week, though.

735
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,510
Why didn't you come forward,

736
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,180
tell the police, us,

737
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,180
when you first came in?

738
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,450
Because trust

739
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,450
has to go both ways.

740
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,490
Look, I grew up bouncing

741
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,490
house to house in foster care.

742
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,760
Spent time living on

743
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,760
the street too.

744
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,870
People like me,

745
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,870
it don't matter

746
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,870
what really happened.

747
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,450
We gonna get blamed for it.

748
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,710
I ain't the guy.

749
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,410
I swear.

750
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,850
Look, Aaron

751
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,850
your pancreas is bleeding,

752
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,320
and without surgery,

753
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,320
your life could be at stake.

754
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,790
And if I get it,

755
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,790
my life could be over.

756
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,390
I seen people get convicted

757
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,390
and sent away forever.

758
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,800
They were innocent too.

759
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,940
I'm gonna take my chance

760
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,940
the bleeding stops on its own

761
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,800
rather than put my fate

762
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,800
in his hands.

763
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,570
No surgery.

764
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,240
Okay.

765
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,350
She's seizing.

766
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,310
Four milligrams of Ativan.

767
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,350
Naloxone on standby.

768
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,790
Overdose?

769
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,790
It looks like it.

770
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,420
Thought you

771
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,420
had eyes on her.

772
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,420
I did.

773
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,460
I was watching her like a hawk

774
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,460
so she couldn't bolt

775
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,830
before the addiction counselor

776
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,830
came down.

777
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,920
So she hasn't

778
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,920
used at all recently?

779
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,920
Not a chance.

780
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,560
Okay.

781
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,340
So if not an OD,

782
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,340
maybe withdrawal?

783
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,530
Yeah, doubt it.

784
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,670
She's missing

785
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,670
all the telltale symptoms.

786
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,980
Agitation, runny nose,

787
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,980
watery eyes, dilated pupils.

788
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,710
Well, endometriosis

789
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,710
doesn't trigger seizures.

790
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,790
So if not an OD

791
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,790
and not withdrawal,

792
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,790
what is it?

793
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,380
Let's get

794
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,380
a CT head and chest,

795
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,380
this time for real.

796
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,520
Hey, so I...

797
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,890
I got Omar's

798
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,890
nutrition panel back.

799
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,760
Serious B1 deficiency.

800
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,360
Body can't generate B1.

801
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,800
We only get it from food.

802
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,370
This low a level means

803
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,370
Omar's not eating enough.

804
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,060
Probably been malnourished

805
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,060
for a while now.

806
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,840
Eating disorders

807
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,840
aren't uncommon

808
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,810
in the rock climbing

809
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,810
community.

810
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,810
Really?

811
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,310
You're fighting gravity

812
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,310
with only fingertips

813
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,310
and toes,

814
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,570
so lighter's better.

815
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,310
What do you say we

816
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,310
hang some IV nutrients?

817
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,540
Those memory issues

818
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,540
should resolve pretty quick.

819
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,850
Yeah.

820
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,330
Will, he's here.

821
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,030
Thanks for coming.

822
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,030
Uh-huh.

823
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,970
So I, looked

824
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,970
at the security video

825
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,740
from the mini-mart.

826
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,740
Yeah.

827
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,010
Crap footage

828
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,010
and bad angles.

829
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,480
You can tell something's

830
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,480
going on, but you don't

831
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,480
know who's doing what.

832
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,520
Eyewitness statements?

833
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,520
All over the place.

834
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,080
So no proof that Aaron's

835
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,080
the offender, but no proof

836
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,080
that he's not either.

837
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,650
No. I spoke with the manager

838
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,650
at the grocery store where

839
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,650
he stocks shelves.

840
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,920
Said he always

841
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,920
comes in early.

842
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,920
Leaves late.

843
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,760
"Aaron's a great guy.

844
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,760
Wish I had more like him."

845
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,660
His words.

846
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,660
He ever been

847
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,660
in trouble before?

848
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,500
No run-ins with the police.

849
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,500
No criminal record.

850
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,500
No contact card.

851
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,590
No gang affiliation.

852
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,790
So what do you

853
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,790
think, Kevin?

854
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,000
I mean, it's not

855
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,000
my case, Maggie.

856
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,970
Hey, look, I know

857
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,970
we're asking you

858
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,370
to speak out of turn,

859
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,370
but Aaron's passing

860
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,370
on a surgery

861
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,880
he desperately needs

862
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,880
over this.

863
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,080
Well, you know,

864
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,080
I like to say

865
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,850
that there's always a why

866
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,850
before there's a who.

867
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,980
There is no why for Aaron

868
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,980
in this robbery.

869
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,080
I mean, I don't believe

870
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,080
that he's good for it,

871
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,080
but that's the way I see it.

872
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,120
I mean, the state's attorney

873
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,120
is hungry.

874
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,120
With an election coming up,

875
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,120
he might see it differently.

876
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,020
Right.

877
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,020
All right. Thanks, man.

878
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,890
Yeah. I'll be here

879
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,890
if you need me.

880
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,470
Good seeing you.

881
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,470
Mmm-hmm.

882
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,930
So, Jodie,

883
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,930
we've got an answer.

884
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,940
Okay.

885
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,940
Your back pain is not

886
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,940
from endometriosis.

887
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,810
It is from a Pancoast tumor.

888
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,040
Uh, a tumor?

889
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,040
Yes.

890
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,450
It's a rare lung cancer.

891
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,810
Your body's response to it

892
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,810
caused pinpoint pupils

893
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,820
and ultimately

894
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,820
your seizure.

895
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,750
So it's right here.

896
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,820
Oh, God.

897
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,060
That's in me?

898
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,720
It is, but it doesn't appear

899
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,720
to have metastasized.

900
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,070
Do you know what

901
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,070
that means, metastasized?

902
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,930
Um...

903
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm not sure.

904
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,530
It means that the cancer

905
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,530
hasn't spread.

906
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,700
So it'll make it easier

907
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,700
to treat. The tumor can be

908
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,700
removed surgically.

909
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,180
It's called resection.

910
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,940
Do you understand?

911
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,920
I think so.

912
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,680
Okay, Jodie,

913
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,680
Dr. Archer and I

914
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,680
are gonna step outside.

915
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,950
We'll be right back, okay?

916
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,850
That was not

917
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,850
an informed consent.

918
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,160
Postictal confusion

919
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,160
from the seizure?

920
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,130
Could be,

921
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,130
or it could be another

922
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,130
complication from the tumor.

923
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,800
There were some glimmers

924
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,800
of recognition, though.

925
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,530
Yeah. I'll call psych,

926
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,530
get their take.

927
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,630
Okay.

928
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,810
Sixty-five, 58, 51.

929
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,680
Keep going?

930
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,680
No, it's good stuff.

931
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,590
How about that

932
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,590
word sequence I gave you?

933
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,590
Let's give that a shot.

934
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,680
Um, San Antonio.

935
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,990
Bubblegum.

936
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,560
Shoelace, ice skate,

937
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,560
stapler.

938
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,560
Excellent.

939
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,130
Well, looks like your memory's

940
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,130
certainly coming back.

941
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,700
Justin, man...

942
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,970
I'm sorry for putting you

943
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,970
through all this.

944
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,600
I have a tendency

945
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,600
to overdo things.

946
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,970
Actually, wondering

947
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,970
if we could talk to you

948
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,970
about that.

949
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,770
Maybe discuss

950
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,770
your eating habits.

951
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,040
Oh, yeah.

952
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,140
I can see how that looks now.

953
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,240
Right after

954
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,240
the world shut down

955
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,240
'cause of COVID,

956
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,110
I started getting

957
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,110
these headaches.

958
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,590
And I read online

959
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,180
if you drink two pints

960
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,180
of beer a day,

961
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,180
it helps,

962
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,850
so I started drinking

963
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,850
two pints a day.

964
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,930
But it didn't work,

965
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,930
so I added exercise.

966
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,060
Rock climbing was perfect,

967
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,060
'cause it was...

968
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,270
It was outside,

969
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,270
socially distant,

970
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,270
challenging,

971
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,560
but now I was...

972
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,080
I was sporting

973
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,080
this beer belly,

974
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,080
so I started dieting.

975
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,700
And I noticed that you...

976
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,010
You only ate the tomato

977
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,010
and the lettuce

978
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,090
out of your sandwich,

979
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,090
so I'm assuming vegetarian?

980
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,880
Uh, and keto.

981
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,680
And keto?

982
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,680
Yeah.

983
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,260
Wow, okay.

984
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,050
So you mentioned that this...

985
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,920
This all started

986
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,920
with headaches, right?

987
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,020
Are you still getting those?

988
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,790
Actually, yeah.

989
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,560
Yeah, I do.

990
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,560
Okay.

991
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,570
I want you to do something

992
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,570
for me. I want you

993
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,570
to look at my finger.

994
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,230
Follow my finger with

995
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,230
just your eyes, without moving

996
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,230
your head, okay?

997
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,330
Mmm-hmm.

998
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,680
What the hell?

999
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,680
I can't move my eyes.

1000
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,270
It's okay.

1001
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,270
No, I can't move my eyes.

1002
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,080
No, it's all right.

1003
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,080
Just close 'em.

1004
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,210
No, but what's wrong?

1005
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,980
I can't move my eyes!

1006
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,980
Close your eyes,

1007
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,980
all right?

1008
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,150
Close your eyes.

1009
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,150
Okay.

1010
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,350
Okay, order an MRI.

1011
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,750
I'm scared.

1012
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,730
I'm really scared.

1013
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,320
It's all right, Omar.

1014
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,320
Keep 'em closed,

1015
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,320
all right?

1016
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,960
Keep 'em closed.

1017
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,330
Any progress?

1018
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,330
No.

1019
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,000
Well, we'll just have

1020
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,000
to keep hanging blood

1021
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,810
and hope for the best.

1022
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,140
Dr. Halstead.

1023
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,650
Ms. Lockwood.

1024
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,810
We've positively

1025
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,810
matched blood

1026
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,940
from pads discarded

1027
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,940
in Aaron's treatment room

1028
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,140
to blood at the crime scene.

1029
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,690
Pads?

1030
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,720
The melanotic stool.

1031
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,290
We rushed him to CT.

1032
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,260
Anything tossed

1033
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,260
on the floor is detritus,

1034
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,260
fair game for evidence.

1035
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,130
Blood links Aaron

1036
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,130
to the crime scene,

1037
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,930
and that bullet inside him

1038
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,930
is gonna link him

1039
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,930
to the clerk.

1040
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,930
Which only proves

1041
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,930
that the clerk shot Aaron,

1042
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,400
not that he's the offender.

1043
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,730
That isn't my distinction

1044
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,730
to make.

1045
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,370
It's my understanding

1046
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,370
that Aaron requires surgery.

1047
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,800
This is a warrant for

1048
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,800
the bullet once it's removed.

1049
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,740
You're out of luck.

1050
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,740
He declined the procedure.

1051
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,870
And by law, the state

1052
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,870
can't force him to have it.

1053
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,010
True, but Aaron's a minor.

1054
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,180
ID he's been using to get

1055
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,180
a job, rent an apartment,

1056
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,380
it's fake.

1057
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,180
Turns out, a few months ago,

1058
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,180
he ran away from

1059
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,180
his latest foster family.

1060
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,730
Been pretending to be of age

1061
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,730
to cover his trail.

1062
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,020
Aaron's DCFS paperwork.

1063
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,000
He's only 17, so yes,

1064
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,000
the state can compel surgery,

1065
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,200
and we'd like that bullet

1066
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,200
in the process.

1067
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,010
Been asking myself how Omar

1068
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,010
didn't realize

1069
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,920
he was moving his whole head

1070
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,920
instead of just his eyes.

1071
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,090
And then I remembered

1072
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,090
this avalanche victim.

1073
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,820
By the time we got there,

1074
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,820
he had dug himself free.

1075
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,420
His hands were jet black

1076
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,420
with frostbite,

1077
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,720
but he didn't realize it

1078
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,720
until we pointed it out.

1079
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,700
It's crazy, right,

1080
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,700
how the brain

1081
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,170
recognizes problems

1082
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,170
long before we do

1083
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,360
and instinctively compensates?

1084
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,360
Image up.

1085
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,970
Oh, okay. Look.

1086
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,970
Right here.

1087
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,440
Wait, Gene, can you...

1088
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,440
Can you blow

1089
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,440
that section up?

1090
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,770
Mmm-hmm.

1091
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,110
So we got microadenoma

1092
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,110
pressing against

1093
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,110
the pituitary gland.

1094
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,280
Not that big either, which is

1095
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,280
probably why CT didn't

1096
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,280
pick it up this morning.

1097
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,120
Well, the brain lesion

1098
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,120
explains Omar's headaches,

1099
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,380
but the eye lock?

1100
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,980
Well, you see this sort of

1101
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,980
diffusion right around here?

1102
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,790
I'm pretty sure

1103
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,790
that's a bleed,

1104
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,360
which would definitely,

1105
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,360
you know,

1106
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,160
put pressure on

1107
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,160
the cranial nerves

1108
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,160
and could cause a lock.

1109
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,500
Omar's headaches started

1110
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,500
almost three years ago.

1111
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,000
Eye lock only set in

1112
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,000
30 minutes ago,

1113
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,470
which means the bleed had to

1114
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,470
have started just before then.

1115
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,300
I think it might've happened

1116
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,300
this morning

1117
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,110
when I was first

1118
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,110
talking to him.

1119
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,380
The BP spike?

1120
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,380
Yeah.

1121
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,920
A jolt of hypertension

1122
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,920
like that, it'd absolutely

1123
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,920
trigger a bleed.

1124
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,350
So the lesion is the root

1125
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,350
of all of Omar's issues.

1126
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,440
How do we fix it?

1127
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,790
Well, we don't.

1128
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,790
Neurosurgery does.

1129
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,060
So there's a slowness

1130
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,030
to Jodie's thought process

1131
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,030
that's evident,

1132
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,500
but she grasped

1133
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,500
that she's ill,

1134
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,360
that there's a tumor present,

1135
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,940
that we recommend

1136
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,940
it be resected,

1137
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,410
and the consequences

1138
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,410
if she doesn't have surgery.

1139
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,500
Okay, four for four.

1140
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,800
Sounds like she's capable

1141
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,800
of consent.

1142
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,510
So I'll get it, and then

1143
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,510
I'll get her up to the OR.

1144
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,940
Okay.

1145
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,020
The hospital's new AI

1146
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,020
pegged Jodie as a drug-seeker.

1147
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,260
We almost let her walk

1148
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,260
because of an algorithm.

1149
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,520
Opiates are a problem.

1150
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,350
I get building tools

1151
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,350
to help solve it.

1152
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,860
Yeah, except patients are

1153
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,860
falling through the cracks.

1154
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,260
Well, luckily, not today.

1155
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,260
No...

1156
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,230
But I'm worried

1157
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,230
about tomorrow.

1158
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,430
I mean, it's a warrant.

1159
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,010
Do we even have a move?

1160
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,010
Well, perhaps.

1161
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,080
Legally, Med only

1162
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,080
has to operate

1163
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,250
if Aaron's life

1164
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,250
is at stake, so is it?

1165
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,260
BP's in the toilet.

1166
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,260
He's still bleeding.

1167
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,450
Without surgery,

1168
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,450
it only gets worse.

1169
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,030
Okay,

1170
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,030
there's no projectile

1171
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,030
to hand over

1172
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,560
if it never comes out,

1173
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,560
so, Dr. Marcel,

1174
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,560
is there a way to operate

1175
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,560
and stop Aaron's bleeding

1176
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,200
without removing the bullet?

1177
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,130
That's what

1178
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,130
I've been debating.

1179
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,200
The bullet is in

1180
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,200
a terrible position,

1181
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,870
right on the neck

1182
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,870
of the pancreas.

1183
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,880
All the damage is...

1184
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,880
It's directly below it.

1185
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,910
So it's gotta come out, then.

1186
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,910
I didn't say that.

1187
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,440
Well, I'm confused.

1188
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,990
How do you get to the damaged

1189
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,990
area of the pancreas if

1190
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,990
the bullet's in the way?

1191
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,280
I'm just gonna have to

1192
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,280
slip in around it.

1193
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,420
I am all for helping

1194
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,420
to curb opiate abuse,

1195
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,560
but this OpioHealth AI

1196
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,560
is flawed.

1197
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,290
The program has bugs,

1198
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,290
and Med shouldn't

1199
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,290
use it.

1200
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,870
Look, analytics

1201
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,870
that help identify

1202
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,030
a patient's risk for misusing

1203
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,030
opioids protect our liability.

1204
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,170
This is a program Med

1205
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,170
should absolutely

1206
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,170
be using.

1207
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,580
Liability is

1208
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,580
the driving force?

1209
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,580
What about patient care?

1210
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,870
You know that's not

1211
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,870
what I'm saying.

1212
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,540
Plus, OpioHealth,

1213
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,540
it's not meant to supplant

1214
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,540
a doctor's diagnosis.

1215
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,380
But it does! It sows

1216
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,380
seeds of distrust.

1217
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,990
My patient today, the scrips

1218
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,990
in her file, the ones

1219
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,990
that got her red-flagged,

1220
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,890
they were for her aging cat.

1221
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,360
Veterinarian put it

1222
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,360
in her name.

1223
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,490
And I'm sorry about that,

1224
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,490
but if you look hard enough

1225
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,290
into any AI program,

1226
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,290
you are gonna find

1227
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,290
outlier cases.

1228
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,420
The night shift

1229
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,420
had a patient

1230
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,420
a few weeks ago

1231
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,090
who got flagged for filling

1232
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,090
scrips in multiple states.

1233
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,670
Turns out he was a pilot.

1234
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,000
His pharmacies depend

1235
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,000
on what route he's flying.

1236
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,010
Yes, there are some

1237
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,010
growing pains,

1238
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,140
but algorithms

1239
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,140
are not the enemy.

1240
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
They can help predict

1241
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
which patient

1242
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,510
is most likely to benefit

1243
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,510
from a particular treatment,

1244
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,640
estimate ICU probabilities,

1245
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,510
whether a patient's

1246
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,510
gonna deteriorate or die

1247
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,350
after being discharged.

1248
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,350
Peter, we get it.

1249
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,350
You're a believer.

1250
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,320
But Dr. Asher's problem

1251
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,320
is less with AI

1252
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,160
and more with this

1253
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,160
specific program.

1254
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,320
And frankly, I share

1255
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,320
her concerns.

1256
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,270
As soon as the board approved

1257
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,270
testing OpioHealth,

1258
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,130
I reached out

1259
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,130
to the parent company

1260
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,640
for clarity on how they amass

1261
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,640
and interpret their data.

1262
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,110
They have yet to share

1263
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,110
any information,

1264
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,550
and they claim that it

1265
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,550
would infringe

1266
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,550
upon their proprietary

1267
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,550
algorithm.

1268
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,040
Look.

1269
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,290
If OpioHealth

1270
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,290
isn't comfortable

1271
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,590
sharing how

1272
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,590
their program works,

1273
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,050
I'm just not comfortable

1274
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,050
using it.

1275
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,430
And given the growing number

1276
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,430
of errant cases,

1277
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm going to petition

1278
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,000
the board to remove

1279
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,000
the program hospital-wide.

1280
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,340
You're gonna be

1281
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,340
picking a fight,

1282
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,240
and not just with the board

1283
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,240
but with Jack Dayton.

1284
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,040
So be it.

1285
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,040
Okay.

1286
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,210
Okay.

1287
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,210
There's the papilla.

1288
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,210
Gonna cannulate.

1289
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,350
Moving into

1290
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,350
the pancreatic duct.

1291
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,260
2.0, visualize the neck

1292
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,260
of the pancreas.

1293
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,660
Loading.

1294
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,260
Clear view of the bullet.

1295
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,260
It's right on the duct.

1296
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,730
Uh-huh.

1297
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,640
Slipping around it.

1298
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,280
Okay. Deploy the stent.

1299
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,280
Looking good.

1300
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,690
The bullet is fully excluded

1301
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,690
by the stent.

1302
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,160
It is no longer eroding

1303
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,160
into the duct.

1304
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,320
Yeah.

1305
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,660
That should stop the bleed.

1306
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,560
Okay.

1307
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,630
Hey, Omar.

1308
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,630
How you feeling?

1309
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,270
Uh...

1310
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,600
My eyes are moving.

1311
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,310
My headache's gone,

1312
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,310
so that's a win.

1313
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,140
I'm pretty embarrassed

1314
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,140
over my comedy of errors.

1315
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,310
Don't be.

1316
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,250
Stuff like this happens,

1317
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,250
you know?

1318
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,590
Ugh. Anyway, I promise,

1319
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,590
this is... This is never

1320
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,590
gonna happen again.

1321
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,220
I'm gonna rehab my legs.

1322
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,620
I'm gonna get on a new diet.

1323
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,750
And I'm gonna add

1324
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,750
yoga, meditation.

1325
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,430
I'm gonna add a new

1326
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,430
sleep regimen.

1327
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,430
Woah, woah, woah.

1328
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,090
Easy, Omar. You know

1329
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,090
what they say.

1330
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,730
Mountains have

1331
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,730
a way of dealing

1332
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,730
with overconfidence.

1333
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,660
Get better first.

1334
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,660
Then I'll see you at the gym.

1335
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,380
"Mountains have

1336
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,380
a way of dealing

1337
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,380
with overconfidence."

1338
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,350
You know,

1339
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,350
I kind of like that.

1340
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,620
I am no mountain climber

1341
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,620
and I cannot see

1342
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,120
any rock walls in my future,

1343
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,120
so I guess I'm wondering,

1344
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,280
if I were to kind of use that

1345
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,280
every now and then,

1346
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,690
would that be considered

1347
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,690
stolen valor?

1348
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,350
Not in my book.

1349
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,160
Applies to everybody.

1350
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,700
Ah, there she is.

1351
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,670
Pit bull.

1352
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,170
I heard you

1353
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,170
stuck it to legal

1354
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,170
while I was in surgery.

1355
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,370
Nice.

1356
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,170
Goodbye, OpioHealth.

1357
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,370
But that's

1358
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,370
only here at Med.

1359
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,110
Program's still in hospitals

1360
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,110
all over the country.

1361
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,380
You know, a lot of other

1362
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,380
patients could be

1363
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,380
unfairly labeled.

1364
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,550
Might even be me one day.

1365
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,150
Entered my name

1366
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,150
into the system.

1367
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,630
Yeah?

1368
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,420
Was immediately red-flagged.

1369
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,800
So it doesn't...

1370
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,660
Doesn't matter how long

1371
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,660
I've been sober.

1372
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,470
That algorithm

1373
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,470
has branded me forever.

1374
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,140
The capabilities

1375
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,140
are endless.

1376
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,340
I'm telling you.

1377
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,340
Yeah.

1378
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,680
Give me ten minutes

1379
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,680
to change,

1380
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,340
and I'll meet you

1381
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,340
in post-op.

1382
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,340
Yeah.

1383
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,250
Hey.

1384
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,180
You two saved

1385
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,180
Aaron's life today,

1386
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,850
in more ways than one.

1387
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,820
Nine years of R&D.

1388
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,490
Never imagined that 2.0

1389
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,490
could be used as a tool

1390
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,490
for medicine

1391
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,760
and social justice.

1392
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,700
It's a good day.

1393
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,710
Hey, Dean.

1394
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,840
Rumor is that you keep

1395
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,840
a bottle in your desk drawer.

1396
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,540
Who told you that?

1397
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,910
Shut the door.

1398
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,950
So, uh...

1399
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,520
Sean's being paroled tomorrow.

1400
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,930
That's great.

1401
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,930
Yeah...

1402
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,900
Isn't it?

1403
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,900
Yeah.

1404
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,910
Yeah, I just want him

1405
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,910
to have a fair shot.

1406
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,370
That's all.

1407
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,970
Well, why wouldn't he?

1408
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,210
You know, these days,

1409
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:37,250
we're all just, data points

1410
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:37,250
for AI to analyze, you know?

1411
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,740
This patient of mine today,

1412
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,480
she was just defined

1413
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,480
by her...

1414
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,490
Her prescription history,

1415
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,490
right?

1416
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,650
And tomorrow, someone could be

1417
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,650
defined by their medical

1418
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,650
records, you know,

1419
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,230
their banking information,

1420
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,230
their...

1421
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,700
Their criminal

1422
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,700
background, right?

1423
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,930
It's supposed to be,

1424
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,930
work hard enough,

1425
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,360
you can be anything

1426
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,360
you want,

1427
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,440
but if Sean gets out,

1428
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,440
he's just a...

1429
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,740
A rating some

1430
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,740
computer program

1431
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,740
spits out.

1432
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,820
I mean, all I can say is,

1433
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,820
in my book, character counts,

1434
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,820
you know?

1435
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,250
I can't believe

1436
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,250
I'm the only one

1437
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,250
who still thinks that way.

1438
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,840
Well, sure hope not.

1439
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,800
There you are.

1440
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,800
Hey.

1441
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,030
So PD arrested someone

1442
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,030
in connection with

1443
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,030
the robbery-homicide.

1444
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,330
Aaron's not

1445
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,330
their prime suspect

1446
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,330
anymore.

1447
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,640
Yeah, I spoke to Kevin.

1448
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,010
Said he's gonna be cleared.

1449
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,840
Heading towards

1450
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,840
a happy ending.

1451
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,040
Thankfully.

1452
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,880
And despite the truth,

1453
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,880
Aaron almost lost everything.

1454
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,680
Mmm.

1455
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,990
Mags, you okay?

1456
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,630
Ben and I are separated.

1457
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,400
And I don't know if

1458
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,400
we're on a path

1459
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,560
to getting back together or...

1460
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,470
Divorce.

1461
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,880
Oh, Mags.

1462
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,640
I'm so sorry.

1463
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,420
I love Ben

1464
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,420
with all my heart,

1465
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,680
and despite that truth, I...

1466
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,350
I might lose everything.

1467
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,090
I was thinking about

1468
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,090
our talk yesterday,

1469
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,950
about what's next.

1470
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,120
Yes.

1471
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,620
Yes to school. Yes to a job.

1472
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,130
Yes to everything.

1473
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,460
I want to do it right

1474
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,460
this time, Dad.

1475
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,500
Will you help me?

1476
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,740
Yeah.

1477
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,580
Us against the world, son.

1478
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,580
Us against the world.
