1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,030
Here at Gaffney

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,030
Chicago Medical Center...

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,500
We'll want to get

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,500
as much press as possible.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,200
They're doing infomercials

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,200
for 2.0 now?

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,240
When you were a kid, you

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,240
started having your problems,

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,340
and I wasn't there for you.

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,610
You're here now.

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,580
I could construct

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,580
a neural network

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,680
and compare it against tens of

14
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,680
thousands of known mutations.

15
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,190
I wonder if you might train me

16
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,190
on that new program you were

17
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,190
talking about.

18
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,620
Dr. Halstead,

19
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,620
can you give Dr. Song a hand?

20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,760
You can't play

21
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,760
with the bumpers up.

22
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,370
So what? I'm not embarrassed.

23
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,270
How are you supposed

24
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,270
to improve?

25
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,140
Who said anything about

26
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,140
improving?

27
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,760
I'm here for the drinks.

28
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,270
Maggie's buying first round?

29
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,440
That's what I heard.

30
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,450
This is why I don't invite you

31
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,450
two out, because you're cheap.

32
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,110
Where's Ben?

33
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,110
The science fair is tomorrow.

34
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,020
He's prepping the gym for

35
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,020
a mass eruption of baking soda

36
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,020
volcanoes.

37
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,490
But don't you worry,

38
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,490
I got a fourth.

39
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,280
Oh, yeah? Who?

40
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,550
Hey, Grace. Over here.

41
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,060
Word is she's single. Mm-hmm.

42
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,060
What, you're trying

43
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,060
to set us up?

44
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,630
Hi.

45
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,630
Hey.

46
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,330
We're hitting the bar.

47
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,330
Can we get you anything?

48
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,060
Oh, my gosh, yeah.

49
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,200
Guinness.

50
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,200
Anything dark, really.

51
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,540
Anything dark.

52
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,540
Just like Halstead.

53
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,040
Go figure.

54
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,240
Well, be back in a flash.

55
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,210
Didn't know you bowled.

56
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,550
Neither did I,

57
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,550
until undergrad.

58
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,280
It's the least physically

59
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,280
demanding gym credit

60
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,280
I could get away with.

61
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,620
Not too analog for your taste?

62
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,720
It's not gonna do much

63
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,720
for my street cred, but

64
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,720
I fell in love with it.

65
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,420
The physics of the game,

66
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,420
it's just really elegant.

67
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,130
Besides, Jack has me

68
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,130
all over the place

69
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,130
these past few years,

70
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,570
and it's easy to find

71
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,570
an alley pretty much

72
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,570
anywhere in the world.

73
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,230
It's comforting,

74
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,740
finding something familiar

75
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,740
when you travel all the time.

76
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,470
Maybe it's the smell.

77
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,670
Floor wax, sweaty shoes,

78
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,670
and old beer.

79
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,370
It's the sweaty shoes

80
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,370
that do it for me.

81
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,550
You're gonna have to tell me

82
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,550
if I'm any good, though.

83
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,730
Rarely in one place

84
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,730
long enough

85
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,730
to see how I stack up.

86
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,220
All right.

87
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,540
Dr. Berger said placement

88
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,540
went smoothly.

89
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,800
So I can get out of here?

90
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,800
I'd say so.

91
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,530
Remember to keep the site

92
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,530
sterile every time

93
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
you connect to the cycler.

94
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
Yeah, spare me the speech.

95
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,540
I've placed hundreds

96
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,540
of PD catheters.

97
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,480
You sure?

98
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,480
It's a pretty good speech.

99
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,410
Just take it easy

100
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,410
on yourself.

101
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,350
Peritoneal dialysis

102
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,350
will let you keep working,

103
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,650
but you won't be feeling 100%

104
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,650
anytime soon.

105
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,620
I'll take it under advisement.

106
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,360
Hey, sweetie. Still at it?

107
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,560
Yeah.

108
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,230
Well, I just have one more.

109
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,230
I'm almost done.

110
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,400
But Notre Dame, Northwestern,

111
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,340
and the University of Chicago

112
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,340
are all finished.

113
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,340
I just need to submit them.

114
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,570
Wow.

115
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,880
So proud of you, sweetie,

116
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,880
how hard you've worked.

117
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,180
What's the last one?

118
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,610
Um, Stanford.

119
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,610
Stanford?

120
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,920
Well, their school of

121
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,920
sustainability

122
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,490
has all these research groups

123
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,490
on everything

124
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,560
from decommissioning

125
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,560
combustion engine

126
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,560
s to carbon storage.

127
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,220
The opportunities are unreal.

128
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,320
And I think I'd actually

129
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,320
have a decent shot at it.

130
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,230
I guess I just thought

131
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,230
that you were

132
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,830
planning to stay closer

133
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,830
to Chicago.

134
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,340
Well, yeah, I mean,

135
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,340
obviously I do.

136
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,340
I mean, I was just

137
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,340
considering all the options.

138
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,740
As well you should.

139
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,830
Um...

140
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,610
Honey, I don't want

141
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,610
to slow your roll,

142
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,610
so keep up the good work.

143
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,680
And just give me a shout

144
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,680
if you need anything.

145
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,450
What can you tell us

146
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,450
about Kuan-yu's journey?

147
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,550
Kuan-yu has a condition

148
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,550
called ankylosing spondylitis.

149
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,490
It's an inflammatory disease.

150
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,830
As it progresses, it fuses

151
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,830
the vertebrae of the spine.

152
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,870
I took him many places,

153
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,870
but no one fixed him.

154
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,800
No, it didn't work at all.

155
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,270
We always hoped

156
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,270
that it would stop,

157
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,770
but he got more bent over.

158
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,840
Kuan-yu, how long have you

159
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,840
been in this position?

160
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,410
I have not laid

161
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,410
on my back in 19 years.

162
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,460
It must be hard to function,

163
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,460
to do everyday things.

164
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,620
Yes, but my mother

165
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,620
helps me in all ways.

166
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,750
She keeps my hope alive.

167
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,400
Can you tell us

168
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,400
how they came to Chicago Med?

169
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,770
An international aid

170
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,770
organization

171
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,710
tried to pair Kuan-yu with

172
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,710
a number of renowned surgeons,

173
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,470
but they all declined

174
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,470
his case.

175
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,940
They were too scared.

176
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,950
Yeah, there are significant

177
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,950
technical challenges

178
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,450
to a surgery like this.

179
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,950
A similar procedure was

180
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,950
performed in China

181
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,950
a few years ago,

182
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,580
but it was spaced out

183
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,580
over several months.

184
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,450
Not everywhere is equipped

185
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,450
for something like this.

186
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,550
But thankfully, social media

187
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,550
jumped to the rescue

188
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,390
and tagged Dr. Marcel.

189
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,990
Yeah, I knew we should

190
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,990
and could help,

191
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,770
so I presented Kuan-yu's case

192
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,770
to Jack Dayton,

193
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,960
and he immediately agreed.

194
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,910
Mr. Dayton flew us here,

195
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,910
paid everything.

196
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,840
He asked nothing

197
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,840
but to make this film.

198
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,750
Mr. Dayton and Dr. Marcel

199
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,750
are my angels.

200
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,290
Kuan-yu has candidly

201
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,290
discussed the risks,

202
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,290
and he's mentally prepared.

203
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,590
But are you concerned?

204
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,360
Tomorrow's surgery

205
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,360
has been meticulously planned

206
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,360
for months,

207
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,530
and I have full faith

208
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,530
in our doctors and nurses.

209
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,630
And we have OR 2.0.

210
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,330
Because Kuan-yu's spine

211
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,330
is one long, rigid bone,

212
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,840
there are severe risks

213
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,840
involved in separating

214
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,840
and reconstructing it,

215
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,970
which is where 2.0

216
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,970
is a gamechanger,

217
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,350
allowing us to be more precise

218
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,750
as we perform a series

219
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,750
of osteotomies, meaning--

220
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,510
Sorry to interrupt the

221
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,510
infomercial,

222
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,610
but would you rather hear this

223
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,610
from the surgeon

224
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
who's actually performing

225
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
the procedure?

226
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,390
This is Dr. Abrams,

227
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,390
our chief of neurosurgery

228
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,360
and lead surgeon

229
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,360
on Kuan-yu's surgery.

230
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,630
Yes, and Dr. Marcel,

231
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,630
our esteemed general surgeon,

232
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,360
will be assisting.

233
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,070
Yes, I will be helping

234
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,070
Dr. Abrams

235
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,670
gain access to Kuan-yu's spine

236
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,670
via anterior approaches.

237
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,800
So as we discussed,

238
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,510
we'll be placing screws

239
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,510
along every level

240
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,510
of the spine,

241
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,810
connected by

242
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,810
at least four rods

243
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,810
from the skull to the pelvis,

244
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,750
along with multiple pedicle

245
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,750
subtraction osteotomies

246
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,820
and cerebral column

247
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,820
resections.

248
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,720
Dr. Abrams, this is wonderful,

249
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,950
but could you turn

250
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,950
and face the camera

251
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,050
and give us that information

252
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,050
again in layman's terms

253
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,460
for our documentary audience?

254
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,830
Your show pony's right there.

255
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,600
Yes, I'll be happy

256
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,600
to translate.

257
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,780
Hey, Sharon.

258
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,790
How was filming last night?

259
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,790
Fine.

260
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,820
I'm relieved my part is over.

261
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,120
And the filming

262
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,120
will be completed

263
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,120
after the surgery today.

264
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,860
You don't sound too happy

265
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,860
about the documentary.

266
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,450
Well, I think Jack

267
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,450
has a unique

268
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,620
and commendable understanding

269
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,620
of the power of PR.

270
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,460
Go on. I'm listening for the

271
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,460
"but."

272
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,170
Having cameras in the hospital

273
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,910
doesn't exactly create

274
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,910
a therapeutic environment.

275
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,770
Yeah, I hear you.

276
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,940
But, Sharon, this is

277
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,940
the kind of case

278
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,420
that puts Gaffney on par

279
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,420
with the Mayo Clinic.

280
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,920
Well, I can't pretend that

281
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,920
I don't like the sound

282
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,920
of that.

283
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,550
So for everyone's sake,

284
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,750
let's hope that there's

285
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,750
a good outcome.

286
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,520
Now that sounds like a plan.

287
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,600
So that four-bagger earn me

288
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,600
a spot on the practice team?

289
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,970
I think you had us all

290
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,970
outclassed.

291
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,770
You held your own.

292
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,680
Maybe we could square off

293
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,680
sometime, you and me.

294
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,810
Sure. Sounds good.

295
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,140
Got to run. Big day in 2.0.

296
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,020
Good luck.

297
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,690
Uh... Kind of

298
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,690
flat-footed, Halstead.

299
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,190
What?

300
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,130
Will and Grace.

301
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,630
It has a nice,

302
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,630
familiar ring to it.

303
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,230
If I'm correct,

304
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,230
they were just friends.

305
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,800
Okay, come on.

306
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,800
You can't talk to your ex

307
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,800
about your new crush?

308
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,670
I think you misread

309
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,670
the situation.

310
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,220
Hey.

311
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,580
Mornin'.

312
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,580
Whoa, whoa.

313
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,180
What's with the jacket?

314
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,850
I work here now.

315
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,850
Yeah, that much I guessed.

316
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,790
You all right?

317
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,600
Yeah, I slept funny.

318
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,570
So you're parking cars.

319
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,970
Hannah--

320
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,970
Dr. Asher hooked me up.

321
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,130
Sent over the job opening.

322
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,130
Put in a good word.

323
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,610
How considerate of her.

324
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,940
Well, I wanted

325
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,940
to surprise you.

326
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,600
Hey, you think I should, like,

327
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,600
write her a thank you note?

328
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,800
Is that weird?

329
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,210
Maybe I'll buy her

330
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,210
a cup of coffee.

331
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,870
I'll pass along your regards.

332
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,870
Hustle up.

333
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,680
You don't want

334
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,680
to be written up

335
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,680
for loitering on the job.

336
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,090
Dr. Archer, good morning.

337
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,090
How are you?

338
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,720
Fine. Why would you

339
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,720
ask me that?

340
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,720
No reason.

341
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,530
Anything you need? Water or--

342
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,300
Yeah, I need residents

343
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,300
to talk less.

344
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,200
Hey. Hey, how'd

345
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,200
the PD cath go?

346
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,640
Okay. Why would you get

347
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,640
Sean a job here?

348
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,040
Excuse me?

349
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,040
Every person in this place

350
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,610
knows what's going on with me.

351
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,910
How long do you think it'll be

352
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,910
before he finds out the news?

353
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,750
Wait. He doesn't know

354
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,750
about your renal failure?

355
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,550
And I had planned

356
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,550
to keep it that way.

357
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,710
Listen, I just got this kid

358
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,710
back, all right?

359
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,160
With his sobriety,

360
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,160
I don't want

361
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,160
to burden him with my stuff.

362
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,230
Okay, Dean, I'm sorry

363
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,230
if I'm butting in here,

364
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,320
but sobriety depends

365
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,320
on both of you being honest.

366
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,830
If you really want that

367
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,830
real relationship with Sean,

368
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,270
he needs to know.

369
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,270
You are butting in, all right?

370
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,340
And I'll tell him

371
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,340
when he's ready.

372
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,010
Okay, hey.

373
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,810
If you need a hand with

374
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,810
anything, I'm here.

375
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,040
I know that the first

376
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,040
few nights of dialysis

377
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,040
can be really rough.

378
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,620
Yeah, I'm not in the market

379
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,620
for a nursemaid.

380
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,280
I can help. His veins roll.

381
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,760
Oh, I've got it. Thank you.

382
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,230
He can't keep it?

383
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,300
No, I'm sorry. He can't wear

384
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,300
anything during surgery.

385
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,360
Hey, Dan. Everything good?

386
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,070
Yeah. Ms. Goodwin asked me

387
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,070
to come down, you know,

388
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,070
check up on your patient.

389
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,700
Big, stressful day,

390
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,700
even without the damn cameras.

391
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,940
But he seems

392
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,940
to be doing great,

393
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,640
you know,

394
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,640
focused on the positives.

395
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,310
Well, looks like

396
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,310
we're ready to go.

397
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,310
Exciting day, huh?

398
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,110
Good luck.

399
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,110
Thanks, buddy.

400
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,880
Hey, Kuan-yu.

401
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,750
It's Dr. Marcel.

402
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,650
Ready to see the world?

403
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,820
I am born ready.

404
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,820
Oh, that's the spirit.

405
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,160
Good, buddy. Great. All right.

406
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,800
I'm gonna have you guys step

407
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,800
back for a moment. Thank you.

408
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,770
Can I give you a hand?

409
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,400
Did you need an extra bag

410
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,400
or anything?

411
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,300
I can't keep still.

412
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,380
Worse today.

413
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,380
Perfectly normal

414
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,380
to be worried.

415
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,290
Every day, I get older,

416
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,290
less strong,

417
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,080
and he gets worse.

418
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,420
So yes, I am worried today.

419
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,660
But I am also hopeful.

420
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
Good.

421
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,730
Maybe I go into surgery now.

422
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,770
You know what? I'm afraid that

423
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,770
that's not gonna be possible.

424
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,770
It's against hospital policy.

425
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,430
No. No, I must be there.

426
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,940
I'm so sorry that this wasn't

427
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,940
made clear to you earlier,

428
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,840
but it's actually

429
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,840
for Kuan-yu's safety.

430
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,740
But I can be useful.

431
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,840
Maybe they have questions

432
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,840
or need help moving him.

433
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,920
Mrs. Wu, your son is

434
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,920
in the best possible hands.

435
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,180
Look, how about

436
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,180
if I find you a place to wait

437
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,420
right next to

438
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,420
the operating room?

439
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,420
That way, you can be

440
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,420
as close as possible.

441
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,190
Would that make you

442
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,190
feel better?

443
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,370
Dr. Archer, incoming MVC.

444
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,370
Going to Trauma 3.

445
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,440
Zach, you're going with them.

446
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,340
Court! Vincent Jones, 40s.

447
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,310
T-boned at Cermak

448
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,310
and Clark. GCS 8.

449
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,810
Sats have been hovering in the

450
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,810
high 80s.

451
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,940
Pressure?

452
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,940
105 over 80. Heart rate's 135.

453
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,960
All right, let's go. Get ready

454
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,960
to transfer on my count.

455
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,180
Should we get

456
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,180
an extra set of hands

457
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,180
so you don't have to--

458
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,730
No.

459
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,800
Ready? One, two, three.

460
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,050
Dr. Archer, are you--

461
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,360
Yeah, just worry about your

462
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,360
patient, all right?

463
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,830
What's the first order

464
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,830
of business?

465
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,900
Airway.

466
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,900
Airway, right.

467
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Trini, I need ET kit,

468
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
RSI drugs.

469
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,770
I need X-ray in here, please!

470
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,240
All right. Feeling some

471
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,240
instability in the pelvis.

472
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,510
What is taking so long?

473
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,510
I think I've got it.

474
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,810
You think?

475
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,810
I'm in.

476
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,290
Breath sounds bilateral.

477
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,290
Sats rising.

478
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,290
Pressure still soft.

479
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,350
All right. What's next, Zach?

480
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,350
X-ray chest and pelvis,

481
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,350
and then a fast.

482
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,800
You want to resuscitate

483
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,800
this guy

484
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,960
or just let him die

485
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,960
while you order stuff?

486
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,090
Right. Two units whole blood.

487
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,370
Negative fast.

488
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,970
All right. Where's my X-ray?

489
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,770
All right, clear!

490
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,820
Let's see it.

491
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,910
Left-sided posterior hip

492
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,910
dislocation.

493
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,990
Got it in one. And?

494
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,990
We'll need to reduce.

495
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,960
Set the scoreboard

496
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,960
back to zero.

497
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,960
He needs a panscan.

498
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,220
Rule out cavitary hemorrhage.

499
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,350
He might need surgery

500
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,350
before we reduce him.

501
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,260
All right, let's move.

502
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,500
Here we go.

503
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,470
Kuan-yu's ready,

504
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,470
and the cameras

505
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,470
are in place.

506
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,980
I had the one at the head

507
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,980
of the table moved back.

508
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,180
Better if you moved them

509
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,180
all the way out of the room.

510
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,540
What, are you afraid

511
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,540
they're gonna

512
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,540
throw you off?

513
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,050
Nothing throws me off.

514
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,950
I just don't think publicity

515
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,950
has a place in my OR.

516
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,080
I'm surprised

517
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,080
you took this case then.

518
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,220
Well, I thought

519
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,220
about refusing,

520
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,220
but any other neurosurgeon

521
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,390
would probably paralyze

522
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,390
the poor guy.

523
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,200
No, sadly, at the end

524
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,200
of the day,

525
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,860
you and I are just

526
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,860
shilling for a billionaire

527
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,860
padding his pockets.

528
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,030
Well, if you want

529
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,030
to look at it that way, okay.

530
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,340
But this surgery never would

531
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,340
have happened without 2.0,

532
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,380
and it never would have

533
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,380
happened without Jack.

534
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,410
Right. In other words,

535
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,410
your participation in it.

536
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,510
Ms. Wallace, I'm Dr. Halstead.

537
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,590
My mom's looking after my son.

538
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,590
Trying to explain

539
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,920
how to swaddle

540
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,920
a six-week-old via text.

541
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,250
Take your time.

542
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,360
She'll manage.

543
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,360
I turned out okay.

544
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,420
So what brings you in today?

545
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,420
Here it comes.

546
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,900
Asked and answered.

547
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,900
How long you

548
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,900
been feeling this way?

549
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,910
A few days now.

550
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,910
I thought maybe

551
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,910
it was food poisoning,

552
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,940
but it shouldn't last

553
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,940
this long, right?

554
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,070
Could be

555
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,070
viral gastroenteritis.

556
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,480
Stomach bug. Easily treatable.

557
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,570
But we'll start with some labs

558
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,570
and IV fluids.

559
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,380
I can also prescribe you

560
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,380
something for nausea.

561
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,580
That would be

562
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,580
much appreciated.

563
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,580
All right.

564
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,390
Here we go.

565
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,620
You know, I did the whole

566
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,620
single-mom IVF thing.

567
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,370
Everyone warned me

568
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,370
about the risks of

569
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,370
a geriatric pregnancy.

570
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,990
I didn't know the effects

571
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,990
would last postpartum.

572
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,140
Well, we're gonna get you

573
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,140
sorted out and back to

574
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,140
your son as soon as possible.

575
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,540
All right, CBC, BMP, KUB,

576
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,540
and bolus a liter

577
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,540
of normal saline.

578
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,010
You got it.

579
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,010
Thanks, Doc.

580
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,270
Of course.

581
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,220
Hey, can I get your eyes

582
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,220
on this?

583
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,910
Yeah, sure. What's up?

584
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,110
40-year-old IVF primip came in

585
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,160
with nausea and vomiting,

586
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,160
but her labs are normal.

587
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,590
Tox?

588
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,590
Clean.

589
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,160
Okay, yeah, her BP is up.

590
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,160
147 over 92.

591
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,130
Yeah, been that way

592
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,130
since intake.

593
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,290
Could be preeclampsia?

594
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,290
This far out?

595
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,160
Yeah, it's rare,

596
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,160
but it happens.

597
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,140
I'd check a CMP and

598
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,140
PC ratio and consider mag,

599
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,140
just in case.

600
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,440
I can do the order

601
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,440
if you want.

602
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,940
Sure. Thanks.

603
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,940
Yeah.

604
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,110
Hey, Will, about earlier,

605
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,340
you know, you and Grace...

606
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,610
Hannah--

607
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,610
No. I never should have

608
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,610
teased you.

609
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,520
Obviously, men and women

610
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,520
can be friends.

611
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,090
Okay, look, even

612
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,090
if I were interested in her,

613
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,630
Grace is a nomad.

614
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,630
Jack has her

615
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,630
all over the world.

616
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,030
It's tough to start something

617
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,030
with someone like that.

618
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,330
Yeah.

619
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,530
I'll let you know

620
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,530
when these labs come back.

621
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,040
Cervicothoracic PSOs

622
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,040
look good.

623
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,270
I think so.

624
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,110
Let's see if 2.0 agrees.

625
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,740
I don't need another opinion.

626
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,510
Well, it could

627
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,510
only help us, Sam.

628
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,670
Standby.

629
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,050
Okay, so 2.0 would determine

630
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,520
if the osteotomy

631
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,520
is at the ideal depth,

632
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,520
height, and angle

633
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,150
to achieve correction.

634
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,160
Acceptable C7 and T1

635
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,160
osteotomies.

636
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,560
Acceptable? It's perfect.

637
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,530
Can you explain

638
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,530
how those lasers are helpful

639
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,530
for the surgeons?

640
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,360
Yeah, Dr. Marcel,

641
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,360
could you explain that?

642
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,070
Sure. Yeah.

643
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,070
Could you move over?

644
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,480
In fact, direct your camera

645
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,480
towards the screen there.

646
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,340
You'll see that 2.0 will

647
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,340
superimpose lines

648
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,650
onto the spine to help guide

649
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,650
the surgeon where to drill

650
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,450
and the extent of bone to

651
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,450
remove.

652
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,790
Dr. Abrams, I'm seeing

653
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,790
50% decreases in amplitude

654
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,680
and increased latency in

655
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,680
both legs. Running a motor.

656
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,190
Put the evoked potential

657
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,190
response on screen.

658
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,530
Dr. Marcel,

659
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,530
is there a problem?

660
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,620
Are we concerned with

661
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,620
cord injury and compression?

662
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,330
Yeah, 'cause I'm assuming

663
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,330
that our patient's goal

664
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,330
wasn't to become paralyzed.

665
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,560
Push his MAPs. Reverse

666
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,560
everything that's reversible.

667
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,500
Find out if this

668
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,500
IOM change is real.

669
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,080
And if it is, close him up

670
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,080
and get him down

671
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,080
for an MRI stat.

672
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,510
MRI? No, hold on.

673
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,100
We don't have to move him.

674
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,100
2.0 can do an intraop CT.

675
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,050
Yeah, which won't show me

676
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,050
anything about cord edema

677
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,050
or ligamentous buckling.

678
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,810
But if I can merge a CT with

679
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,810
an intraoperative ultrasound,

680
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,450
you'd have everything

681
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,450
you'd need right here.

682
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,390
That would work, and we

683
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,390
wouldn't have to move Kuan-yu.

684
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,220
Look, experiment with

685
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,220
this thing on another patient.

686
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,590
I want to be 100% sure.

687
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,420
Sam, there are

688
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,420
a hundred reasons

689
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,420
why we should not move him.

690
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,760
Pick one. Infection risk.

691
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,350
Prolonged time

692
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,350
under anesthesia.

693
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,700
Hell, he could even be

694
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,700
unstable after the move

695
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,700
to even continue surgery.

696
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,730
Do it.

697
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,540
Let's hope you're right.

698
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,300
Otherwise, you're committing

699
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,300
a career-ending mistake

700
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,300
to film.

701
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,810
You sure there's nothing

702
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,810
we can get you?

703
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,110
Maybe something to eat?

704
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,110
No.

705
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,280
How are we doing?

706
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,650
Any updates?

707
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,650
Not yet.

708
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,490
Oh. Excuse me.

709
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,400
You know,

710
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,400
that's a lovely stone.

711
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,800
I was noticing it earlier

712
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,800
when I was talking

713
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,800
to your son.

714
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,630
From the river.

715
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,630
Kuan-yu found this as a child.

716
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,600
It was smooth and shiny.

717
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,870
He thought it was a gem.

718
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,510
It was one of the last times

719
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,510
he was able to move,

720
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,520
to play.

721
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,460
I made this to give him hope

722
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,390
that one day,

723
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,390
he would play again.

724
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,470
I promised I would help him.

725
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,540
Well, you have certainly

726
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,540
kept that promise.

727
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,700
What's going on?

728
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,870
I need to talk to Da-xia.

729
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,870
About what?

730
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,810
There's been a complication,

731
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,810
something about

732
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,810
a cord compression.

733
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,610
I've got to get

734
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,610
her point of view.

735
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,610
Now is not the time.

736
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,150
Ms. Goodwin, this is

737
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,150
one of the major risks

738
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,880
they knew he was facing.

739
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,820
Narratively, that's important

740
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,820
to their story.

741
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,590
Well, this is not

742
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,590
about a story.

743
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,390
It's a complicated

744
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,390
medical procedure

745
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,390
involving real people.

746
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,800
I have a directive

747
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,800
from Mr. Dayton.

748
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,670
She signed a contract

749
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,670
to be filmed.

750
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,540
You film at my discretion,

751
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,540
not Jack Dayton's.

752
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,670
And you can speak to Da-xia

753
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,710
after the doctors provide

754
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,710
an update and not before.

755
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,180
Well, I need to call

756
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,180
Mr. Dayton.

757
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,780
Well, you just do that.

758
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,650
Did he need to speak to me?

759
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,190
Did he have news?

760
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,630
No, nothing concrete.

761
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,630
But the surgeons will

762
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,630
check in with you soon.

763
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,560
Why don't we go wait

764
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,560
in my office?

765
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,800
It's right upstairs,

766
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,800
and, you know, we'll be

767
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,800
more comfortable there.

768
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,800
Thank you, Dr. Charles.

769
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,800
You bet.

770
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,540
I'm not seeing

771
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,540
any obvious cord compression.

772
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,450
That's why I'm also checking.

773
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,460
His evoked potentials

774
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,460
look better.

775
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,260
All right, I'm satisfied that

776
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,260
the cord was merely

777
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,260
compressed, not injured.

778
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
We can continue.

779
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,390
Dr. Marcel?

780
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,390
Yeah?

781
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,530
Would you ask 2.0 to prepare

782
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,530
the next osteotomy, please?

783
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,470
Certainly. Grace?

784
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,310
Will?

785
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,510
I'll call you back.

786
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,410
Results for your patient,

787
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,410
Cara.

788
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,910
Good news, doesn't look like

789
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,910
postpartum preeclampsia.

790
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,990
Bad news is nothing definitive

791
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,990
to explain her symptoms.

792
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,590
Yeah, I'm thinking stress.

793
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,720
I mean, she did just

794
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,720
give birth six weeks ago,

795
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,850
and pregnancy puts the body

796
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,850
at the literal limit

797
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,660
of human endurance

798
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,660
for nine months.

799
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,560
Makes sense that stress

800
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,560
would manifest physically.

801
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,290
Yeah, I'll look into anything

802
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,290
else to test her for,

803
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,290
but I think you're right.

804
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,800
Dr. Archer,

805
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,800
do you want my seat?

806
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,340
Uh, I'm good.

807
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,340
I got to turn six over anyway,

808
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,880
so it's not a big deal.

809
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,880
For crying out loud.

810
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,950
Listen, I'm not an invalid.

811
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,950
I'm fine!

812
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,280
Dr. Archer?

813
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,280
What?

814
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,490
I have Vincent's CT results.

815
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,460
He has a pelvic hematoma

816
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,460
with a blush.

817
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,590
We need to embolize him.

818
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,590
Now we can reduce his hip.

819
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,460
Send him up to IR.

820
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,000
You ever done

821
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,000
an Allis reduction?

822
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,370
I've observed one.

823
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,370
All right. Well,

824
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,370
you're assisting me.

825
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,940
What now?

826
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,940
I just know an Allis reduction

827
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,840
can be physically taxing.

828
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,680
And?

829
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,680
I just don't think

830
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,680
it's the best idea

831
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,310
for you to do this procedure.

832
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,350
Yeah,

833
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,350
I'm an attending physician

834
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,010
and the chief

835
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,010
of this department.

836
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,420
I will not be advised

837
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,420
by some resident

838
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,020
who barely knows

839
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,020
what the hell

840
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,020
he's talking about!

841
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,360
I'm sorry.

842
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,360
Yeah, you know what?

843
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,020
Go get yourself

844
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,020
another case, man.

845
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,860
I'm sorry.

846
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,860
Yeah, you said that! Go! Go!

847
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,990
I have another patient

848
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,990
for you in two.

849
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,440
Need a hand

850
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,440
with a hip reduction?

851
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,440
Mm-hmm.

852
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,410
Dr. Archer, I will not

853
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,410
have you speaking

854
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,410
to residents like that.

855
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,740
Can we just get this done?

856
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,580
Murphy,

857
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,580
will you assist, please?

858
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,580
Sure. No problem.

859
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,920
Over here. Push down on the

860
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,920
pelvis and give Dr. Archer

861
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,920
counter traction.

862
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,390
All right, we're gonna

863
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,390
do this on three.

864
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,360
Ready? One, two, three.

865
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,990
That's good. It's in. Oh.

866
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,500
Are you okay?

867
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,830
I'm okay.

868
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,830
No, you're not.

869
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,370
I just got to get him up

870
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,370
to IR.

871
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,940
Stop talking. Murphy,

872
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,940
you take him up.

873
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,410
We need to get you in a bed.

874
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,410
Come on.

875
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,380
All right. All right.

876
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,380
So you think

877
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,380
this was all stress?

878
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,420
We could not find any

879
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,420
other clinical explanation.

880
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,710
Stress takes

881
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,710
a real physical toll--

882
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,850
nausea, vomiting,

883
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,850
hypertension.

884
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,980
All common and treatable

885
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,980
presentations,

886
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,960
even in the case of

887
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,960
happy stress.

888
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,030
We'll prescribe you

889
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,030
a low-dose antihypertensive

890
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,030
for your blood pressure.

891
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,970
But the best thing you could

892
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,970
do for yourself right now

893
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,970
is find ways

894
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,400
to reduce your stress levels.

895
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,600
I waited so long

896
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,600
to become a mother,

897
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,040
probably too long,

898
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,040
if I'm being honest.

899
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,630
I naively thought

900
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,630
the perfect moment would

901
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,630
just waltz into my life.

902
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,910
Now that my little Lee

903
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,910
is here,

904
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,910
I don't want to miss anything.

905
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,420
Well, he's a lucky boy.

906
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,420
Don't forget to take care

907
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,420
of yourself too.

908
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,710
Thank you.

909
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,850
Cara?

910
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,650
You okay?

911
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,030
Help me.

912
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,030
Aphasia.

913
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,460
Stroke alert!

914
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,460
Need some help in here!

915
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,530
You're okay. Just breathe,

916
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,530
breathe, breathe.

917
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,660
Okay, try to relax.

918
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,740
All right.

919
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,550
Nope. No, no, back away.

920
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,840
Let's close up the lumbar PSO.

921
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,480
Compressor and set screws.

922
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,850
So Dr. Abrams and Gottfried

923
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,850
are placing the final bit

924
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,850
of instrumentation.

925
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,950
Then they will collapse

926
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,950
Kuan-yu's spine,

927
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,220
which will correct his posture

928
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,220
to an upright--

929
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,630
His sats are dropping.

930
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,930
Heart rate and BP

931
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,930
are down too.

932
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,470
Airway pressures?

933
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,470
Peaks are 50s.

934
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,870
Still dropping. Sats at 80%.

935
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,500
It must be

936
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,500
due to his position.

937
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,010
Well, there's not much

938
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,010
we can do about that in

939
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,010
the middle of a spine surgery.

940
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,630
It's got to be

941
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,630
a tension pneumothorax.

942
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,210
Stethoscope?

943
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,210
Hey. This isn't a trauma case.

944
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,040
Just bronch him

945
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,040
and check the tube's position.

946
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,880
Kuan-yu's chest

947
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,880
and abdominal muscles

948
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,880
are probably atrophied.

949
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,750
When we straightened him,

950
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,750
we likely cracked a rib,

951
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,980
punctured the lung.

952
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,850
There. Diminished breath

953
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,850
sounds on the right.

954
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,980
Chest tube kit for Dr. Marcel.

955
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,980
28 French.

956
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,560
No, he needs a rescue now.

957
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,130
What's happening?

958
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,130
Has Kuan-yu stopped breathing?

959
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,700
I need

960
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,700
to needle decompress him.

961
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,700
Chest tube later.

962
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,530
Can you reach

963
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,530
the anterior chest?

964
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,160
- I've got no other option.

965
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,160
- Just get it done.

966
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,740
Heart rate's 40. Sats at 50s.

967
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,010
Running out of time here,

968
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,010
Crockett.

969
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,640
Yeah, I don't want

970
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,640
to stick his heart.

971
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,640
Not a ton of room to work.

972
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,740
Dr. Marcel, can you explain--

973
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,080
Be quiet!

974
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,790
Okay, needle's in.

975
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,920
Oxygen saturation

976
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,920
climbing. 85%.

977
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,660
Airway pressure's down to 30.

978
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,660
BP's back up to 120 systolic.

979
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,260
Okay. Let's finish up

980
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,260
the spine.

981
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,730
I need you to back up.

982
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,730
Back up.

983
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,940
Doesn't look like

984
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,940
you tore the stitch.

985
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,610
Probably just overexerted

986
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,610
yourself.

987
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,610
Wonderful.

988
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,650
There.

989
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,090
Who do you think

990
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,090
you're kidding

991
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,090
with this tough guy act?

992
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,060
Everyone here knows

993
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,060
what you're going through.

994
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,860
Well, see, that's the problem.

995
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,900
That's all they see: a sick,

996
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,900
weak old man.

997
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,930
"Let me get that for you."

998
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,930
"Take my seat."

999
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,800
"Should you be doing that?"

1000
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,800
I can't stand that.

1001
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,600
There's no shame

1002
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,600
in having an illness.

1003
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,940
Listen, I'm the doctor

1004
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,940
in this ED, all right?

1005
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,300
I'm not a patient

1006
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,300
Oh.

1007
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,170
You know,

1008
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,170
I once thought like you.

1009
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,080
After my cancer diagnosis.

1010
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,880
I thought folks would only see

1011
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,880
what was wrong with me,

1012
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,050
that every kind word

1013
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,050
or offer to help

1014
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,890
was just an act of pity.

1015
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,260
Then someone who lived

1016
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,260
through my experience

1017
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,800
made me realize how far

1018
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,800
from the truth that was,

1019
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,930
that I was the only one

1020
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,930
defining myself by my illness.

1021
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,240
My friends, my family,

1022
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,240
my community,

1023
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,280
all they wanted to do

1024
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,280
was support me.

1025
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,610
And all I needed to do

1026
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,610
was let them.

1027
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,690
It's not weakness

1028
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,690
to let people be kind.

1029
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,730
It's strength.

1030
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,120
Okay.

1031
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,730
Oh.

1032
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,780
And Zach's a good doctor.

1033
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,110
He just needs

1034
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,110
to be encouraged.

1035
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,980
And that's our job.

1036
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,280
Message received.

1037
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,360
One chamomile tea.

1038
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,950
My mom drinks this

1039
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,950
to help her sleep

1040
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,260
because she insists

1041
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,260
on drinking coffee

1042
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,260
till late in the afternoon.

1043
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,920
Go figure. Ooh.

1044
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,290
Yes?

1045
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,070
Okay.

1046
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,440
Well, good. I will tell her.

1047
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,440
Thank you.

1048
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,440
Thank you very much.

1049
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,250
So the surgery is complete,

1050
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,050
and Kuan-yu

1051
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,050
came through it very well.

1052
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,420
As a matter of fact,

1053
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,420
the next time you see him,

1054
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,450
he will probably be

1055
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,450
sitting up.

1056
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,160
You mean he'll stand?

1057
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,690
He'll walk?

1058
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,690
Yeah.

1059
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,870
With time, rehabilitation,

1060
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,990
he should live

1061
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,990
a pretty normal life.

1062
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,770
Oh, my.

1063
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,140
I'm so sorry.

1064
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,180
No, you have absolutely

1065
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,180
nothing to apologize for.

1066
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,810
There's a lot to take in.

1067
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,250
This is the day we've been

1068
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,250
waiting for.

1069
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,950
All these years,

1070
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,950
I take good care of him.

1071
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,230
And now, what will happen now?

1072
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,270
This surgery has upended

1073
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,270
a life that you and your son

1074
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,270
have known

1075
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,960
for, what, almost 30 years?

1076
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,770
And it makes perfect sense

1077
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,770
that you would grieve

1078
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,770
the loss of that life

1079
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,470
and be apprehensive

1080
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,470
about the future.

1081
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:50,080
But this is not right,

1082
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:50,080
these feelings.

1083
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,060
How can I think of me

1084
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,060
at such a time?

1085
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,160
How can I be so selfish...

1086
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,190
Oh, no, no.

1087
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,190
And not be happy?

1088
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,390
No, no, no.

1089
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,390
You are not selfish.

1090
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,130
Every parent in the world

1091
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,130
understands what

1092
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,130
you're feeling right now.

1093
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,760
From the moment

1094
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,760
our kids are born,

1095
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,270
they start

1096
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,270
to move away from us.

1097
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,930
And when they finally leave,

1098
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,270
it's only because

1099
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,270
we've actually

1100
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,270
done our jobs well.

1101
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,340
But this, I can promise you:

1102
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,180
you will always be his mother.

1103
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,340
Always.

1104
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,120
One half of the same stone.

1105
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,340
As you can see...

1106
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,340
That's in my head?

1107
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,040
It's a condition called

1108
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,040
Moyamoya disease.

1109
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,120
Moyamoya literally means

1110
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,120
"puff of smoke" in Japanese.

1111
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,990
It's a progressive disorder

1112
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,990
which blocks blood flow

1113
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,990
to your brain's arteries.

1114
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,490
So to compensate,

1115
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,490
your body created

1116
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,320
all these smaller vessels,

1117
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,320
which are prone to bleeding.

1118
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,160
So your symptoms were

1119
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,160
caused by small strokes.

1120
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,100
Progressive.

1121
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,190
So this is going to get worse?

1122
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,930
Keeping you on aspirin

1123
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,930
and calcium channel blockers

1124
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,840
will help reduce the risk

1125
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,840
of another stroke.

1126
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,840
Just reduce but not prevent.

1127
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,310
It'll keep you stable

1128
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,310
for the foreseeable future.

1129
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,240
There is a surgical option,

1130
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,080
but we don't think

1131
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,080
that you're there yet.

1132
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,580
Surgery? I want the surgery.

1133
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,250
It's an invasive

1134
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,250
neurosurgical procedure.

1135
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,550
You have a newborn.

1136
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,550
You've been through a lot.

1137
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,060
The surgery can wait

1138
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,060
for a more ideal time.

1139
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,860
I don't want this cloud

1140
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,860
hanging over me.

1141
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,440
I've waited

1142
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,440
for ideal times before.

1143
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,200
They don't come.

1144
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,380
Please, the surgery.

1145
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,350
We'll have neurosurgery

1146
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,350
come speak to you.

1147
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,040
Thank you.

1148
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,920
Yeah.

1149
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,450
Dr. Hudgins.

1150
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,020
Yes?

1151
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,020
I hear our patient, Mr. Jones,

1152
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,530
is resting comfortably

1153
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,530
in the ICU

1154
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,000
after successful embolization.

1155
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,430
Oh, good.

1156
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,600
There's a sim dummy in seven.

1157
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,070
I'm gonna show you

1158
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,070
how to reduce a hip.

1159
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,240
You said it was a physically

1160
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,240
demanding procedure,

1161
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,250
so you can do it.

1162
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,290
Mama.

1163
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,630
I can see you.

1164
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,100
Yes.

1165
00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:00,340
And you look so beautiful.

1166
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,640
I'm so old.

1167
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,240
No. No.

1168
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,350
I'll see you.

1169
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,260
A word, please.

1170
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,490
Yes?

1171
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,490
Look.

1172
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,670
It's one thing

1173
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,670
to bar them from

1174
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,670
filming her during surgery,

1175
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,110
but, Sharon, this is what

1176
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,110
audiences would want to see.

1177
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,180
And you've stopped them

1178
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,180
from capturing it.

1179
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,480
After all they've been

1180
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,480
through, George,

1181
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,040
they deserve this time

1182
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,040
without cameras.

1183
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,120
They wouldn't even have had

1184
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,120
a chance to get this surgery

1185
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,980
if it wasn't for

1186
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,980
Jack's generosity.

1187
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,350
Yes, and I still have

1188
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,350
to look out for my patients.

1189
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,980
George, you're a doctor.

1190
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,980
You know that.

1191
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,320
I do.

1192
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,700
But I also believe in Jack's

1193
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,700
vision for this hospital.

1194
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,170
He wants us to be the leader

1195
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,170
in cutting-edge healthcare.

1196
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,110
Sharon, this film tells

1197
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,110
the world exactly who we are.

1198
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,680
And who are we, George,

1199
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,220
if we forget about

1200
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,220
our patients

1201
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,220
and their loved ones?

1202
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,180
But Jack is a man who's not

1203
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,180
used to hearing the word "no."

1204
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,310
Well, maybe it's time he did.

1205
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,320
Yeah.

1206
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,400
Hey, neurosurgery is getting

1207
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,400
ready to operate on Cara.

1208
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,670
That's great.

1209
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,260
Woman's braver than I am.

1210
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,800
And me.

1211
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,210
Hey, you weren't wrong.

1212
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,650
I am interested in Grace.

1213
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,180
Okay.

1214
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,620
So why did you give her

1215
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,620
the brush-off this morning?

1216
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,460
And don't give me that stuff

1217
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,460
about her being a nomad.

1218
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,100
I mean, look at

1219
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,100
my dating track record here.

1220
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,100
Hasn't been exactly stellar.

1221
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,830
No offense.

1222
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,830
Yeah.

1223
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,840
Well, I might be crazy

1224
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,840
or out of line,

1225
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,680
but I wonder

1226
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,680
if all of these excuses

1227
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,840
are really just about one

1228
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,840
reason, or rather one person.

1229
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,680
Natalie.

1230
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,490
Natalie?

1231
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,430
It did always feel like

1232
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,430
you were still carrying

1233
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,430
a torch for her.

1234
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,490
Yeah, maybe.

1235
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,200
Maybe I still was.

1236
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,500
But now, I mean, it's just me

1237
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,500
trying to get it right.

1238
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,600
Good.

1239
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,180
You're a really

1240
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,180
great guy, Will.

1241
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,440
You deserve to be happy.

1242
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,650
Thanks, Hannah.

1243
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,800
Now, what was

1244
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,800
particularly difficult

1245
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,800
about this operation?

1246
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Well, the angle

1247
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,900
was slightly unusual.

1248
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,140
But fortunately, we were able

1249
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,140
to relieve the pressure

1250
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,230
and reinflate his lung.

1251
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,780
You were basically

1252
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,780
folded over yourself,

1253
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,850
and alarms were blaring, so...

1254
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,850
Right.

1255
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,920
Why don't you tell us

1256
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,920
what you felt in that moment?

1257
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,330
I guess the real headline here

1258
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,520
is successfully aligning

1259
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,520
Kuan-yu's spine.

1260
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,530
You saw firsthand

1261
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,530
a revolution in medicine,

1262
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,900
thanks in part to OR 2.0.

1263
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,730
I mean, this is

1264
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,730
just the beginning

1265
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,810
of what this Dayton

1266
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,810
partnership can--

1267
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,900
can produce.

1268
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,210
Hell of a day, huh?

1269
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,310
Hope you're off to celebrate.

1270
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,680
You know, you're not

1271
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,680
a terrible surgeon,

1272
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,620
but you do have

1273
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,620
awful taste in heroes.

1274
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,280
Heroes? Come on, Sam.

1275
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,730
At least

1276
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,730
he's using his billions

1277
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,730
for some good, right?

1278
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,660
Oh, yeah, confident

1279
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,660
that's why he

1280
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,660
amassed his fortune.

1281
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,620
Point is, we can help

1282
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,620
so many more people

1283
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,930
with Jack's vision

1284
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,930
and money in our corner.

1285
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,570
No, his vision of whom to help

1286
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,570
seems a bit more narrow

1287
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,570
than yours.

1288
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,640
What does that mean?

1289
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,640
I just found out.

1290
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,410
Dayton says from now on, 2.0

1291
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,410
is for paying customers only.

1292
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,380
Wait, what?

1293
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,380
You heard me.

1294
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,780
No more subsidized care.

1295
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,790
Well, if that's true,

1296
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,790
then your fight's with

1297
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,790
the insurance companies.

1298
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,540
We're all out

1299
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,540
of the good stuff.

1300
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,980
Radiology's got

1301
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,980
a secret stash, though.

1302
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,750
Thanks for the tip.

1303
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,010
Or maybe I could buy you

1304
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,010
a cup of coffee.

1305
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,820
I don't think

1306
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,820
that's a good idea.

1307
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,620
Okay. Have a good night.

1308
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,660
What about a drink instead?

1309
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,550
Guinness, right?

1310
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,400
Mm-hmm.

1311
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,970
Guess that

1312
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,970
made you happy, huh?

1313
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,310
I don't know

1314
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,310
what you're talking about.

1315
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,410
I gather you told him.

1316
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,410
More or less.

1317
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,380
Told him I needed dialysis.

1318
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,380
Left it pretty vague.

1319
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,650
But I don't want to

1320
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,650
make him a caretaker.

1321
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,380
He doesn't need that

1322
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,380
right now.

1323
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,650
It's a good thing

1324
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,650
you told him, though,

1325
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,650
not just for his sake.

1326
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,920
Good night, Dean.

1327
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,590
Wait, hold on.

1328
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,920
I have a favor to ask.

1329
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,770
Hey, Dad. There's pizza

1330
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,770
in the fridge.

1331
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,540
I promise it's not Hawaiian.

1332
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,510
Wait. Are you finished

1333
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,510
with your applications?

1334
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,700
Yeah.

1335
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,010
All proofed, agonized over,

1336
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,010
and submitted.

1337
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,750
And I chose early decision

1338
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,750
to University of Chicago.

1339
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,550
What happened to Stanford?

1340
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,550
Nothing.

1341
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,320
I wasn't really

1342
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,320
all that serious about it.

1343
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,320
Plus, I'm...

1344
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,660
not exactly a California girl.

1345
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,360
I don't really know

1346
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,360
what that means,

1347
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,560
but, I mean, you seemed

1348
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,560
pretty serious about it to me.

1349
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,430
There's other schools

1350
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,430
with sustainability stuff.

1351
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,560
Plus, I would miss

1352
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,560
Italian beef too much.

1353
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,670
And, you know, and maybe you.

1354
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,100
You know what?

1355
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,100
I'd miss you too.

1356
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,080
But the right school,

1357
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,080
is the right school.

1358
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,050
Why go so far

1359
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,050
and leave you all alone

1360
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,920
when I have

1361
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,920
great options at home?

1362
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,820
Okay, first of all,

1363
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,820
I'm not gonna be all alone.

1364
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,590
And guess what?

1365
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,590
It's actually not your job

1366
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,590
to worry about me.

1367
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,060
Anna, when you've accomplished

1368
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,060
what you have in school,

1369
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,130
you get to go to whatever

1370
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,130
school you want to.

1371
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,990
I don't care where it is.

1372
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,660
And honestly,

1373
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,660
I've really started

1374
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,660
to kind of look forward

1375
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,900
to having an excuse to go

1376
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,900
to California in February.

1377
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,600
So, you know, don't step

1378
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,600
on my dreams.

1379
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,010
Thank you, Dad.

1380
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,980
I'm gonna apply.

1381
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,640
Why not?

1382
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,020
Yeah.

1383
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,710
Let's see.

1384
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,820
Okay.

1385
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,890
All set.

1386
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,800
Is that all right?

1387
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,800
Are you in any pain?

1388
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,760
No, it's fine. Thanks.

1389
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,130
Uh... Front door sticks,

1390
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,130
so just lift up

1391
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,130
when you close it.

1392
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,910
I know it's late.

1393
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,040
Actually, I'm a--

1394
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,040
I'm a bit of a night owl.

1395
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,740
Occupational hazard

1396
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,740
of being an OB-GYN:

1397
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,840
always on call.

1398
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,940
Hannah,

1399
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,940
you don't have to stay.

1400
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,420
There is a quiz in here,

1401
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,420
and I have always

1402
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,420
wanted to know

1403
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,150
which classic car matches

1404
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,150
my sparkling personality.

1405
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,090
Oh, easy.

1406
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,630
You're a Prius.
