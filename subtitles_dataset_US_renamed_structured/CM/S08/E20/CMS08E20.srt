1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,700
Richard, this is

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,700
the first time 2.0

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,700
is being used on a patient.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
We were able to remove

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
the patient's tumor.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,540
And we're optimistic

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,540
for his future.

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,510
I'm not taking

9
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,510
my son's kidney, Hannah.

10
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,410
Donating could be a really

11
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,410
positive experience for him.

12
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,510
If you turn out to be a match,

13
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,510
I won't say no.

14
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,980
I was wanting you

15
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,980
to meet my brother.

16
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,990
So tell me, Doctor,

17
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,990
you deal with any

18
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,990
crazy people today?

19
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,990
Pawel.

20
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,990
I didn't mean

21
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,990
to offend.

22
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,120
I was meeting

23
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,120
with a headhunter.

24
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,720
I have a bad feeling

25
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,720
about the direction that

26
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,720
Jack is taking us.

27
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,020
Jack.

28
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,020
He got the votes.

29
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,730
We are now

30
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,730
a for-profit hospital.

31
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,430
Hello, Daniel.

32
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,530
Hoping I'd run into you.

33
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,530
Walk you out?

34
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,740
Your desk, bottom drawer,

35
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,740
left you a treat.

36
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,450
You didn't have to do that.

37
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,420
We don't get to see

38
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,420
each other during the day.

39
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,040
It's my way

40
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,040
of feeling close to you.

41
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,380
Wow.

42
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,450
The esteemed Dr. Charles,

43
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,450
Chicago's very own Carl Jung.

44
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,290
Pawel, how you doing?

45
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,290
Fine.

46
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,630
Hurry, Liliana. Get in.

47
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,100
Let's not keep him.

48
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,100
He must be very busy.

49
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,160
Just a minute.

50
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,470
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,470
It's okay.

52
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,230
Pawel can be rude.

53
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,240
He was a lawyer

54
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,240
back in Poland.

55
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,280
And he has had a hard time

56
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,280
finding a career

57
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,280
here in America.

58
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,350
I think he feels...

59
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,510
Left behind?

60
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,510
Yes

61
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,610
Yeah, it's hard.

62
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,190
Making jokes

63
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,190
is just his frustration.

64
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,380
He has a big heart.

65
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,720
Have a good day, Daniel.

66
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,390
Morning, Sharon.

67
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,430
Hey, Maggie.

68
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,430
Good morning.

69
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,530
You know that recruiter

70
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,530
that I met with last week?

71
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,540
Well, she may be calling you

72
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,540
for some references.

73
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,570
You're really doing this,

74
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,570
leaving Med?

75
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,310
Well, just testing the waters.

76
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,310
And what would it take

77
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,310
to make you stop testing?

78
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,610
You got a time machine?

79
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,690
Take Med back to when

80
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,690
patients came before profits?

81
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,120
All right. I get it.

82
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,620
I'll let you know

83
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,620
if someone calls.

84
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,710
Thank you.

85
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,790
I wish you didn't have to take

86
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,790
a day off work for this.

87
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,230
I feel bad.

88
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,820
Testing to see

89
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,820
if I can give you my kidney

90
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,760
kind of trumps

91
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,760
parking a few cars.

92
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,760
Mmm.

93
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,460
Hey, guys.

94
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,700
Big day.

95
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,400
You ready, Sean?

96
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,500
I'm cool.

97
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,240
He's a nervous wreck.

98
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,240
Mmm.

99
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,180
I'm grateful.

100
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,250
My job as a dad

101
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,250
is being there for you.

102
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,180
And you being there

103
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,180
for me

104
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,480
has been more trying

105
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,480
than I thought.

106
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,250
Oh, thank God.

107
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm needed in the ED.

108
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,850
Too much emotion

109
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,850
for you, Dean?

110
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,560
Yeah, way, way too much.

111
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,560
Yeah.

112
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,300
Hey, Dr. Asher.

113
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,300
Just the usual chai tea?

114
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,130
Yes, please.

115
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,130
Thank you, Carly.

116
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,690
Sean.

117
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
You sure I can't get you

118
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
a coffee?

119
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,200
Not today. Just water.

120
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
Okay.

121
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,810
I think Carly just gave you

122
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,810
flirty eyes.

123
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,280
Is there, like,

124
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,280
something-something

125
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,280
brewing between you two?

126
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,280
Just friends.

127
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,910
Oh. Because smart, kind,

128
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,910
and super cute

129
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,310
are just not your type.

130
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,410
No, that's my type.

131
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,410
Mmm.

132
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,420
Mind's just somewhere else

133
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,420
right now.

134
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,420
What if I'm not

135
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,420
a donor match?

136
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,730
Then we'll figure

137
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,730
something else out.

138
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,940
Good morning.

139
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,330
So are the rumors true?

140
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,570
What rumors?

141
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,200
The rehab clinic going

142
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,200
part-time.

143
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,610
The dialysis center

144
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,610
possibly shutting down.

145
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,280
Oh, those rumors.

146
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,580
Well, maybe.

147
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,410
New mandate says that if

148
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,410
a department is losing money,

149
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,510
it could be

150
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,510
on the chopping block.

151
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,880
Well, what about the ED?

152
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,350
I don't know.

153
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,590
Maggie, I need some help.

154
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,750
Talk to me.

155
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,520
Name's Jan Dover,

156
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,520
30s, single vehicle crash,

157
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,620
low impact,

158
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,620
backed into a light pole.

159
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,290
GCS 15, laceration

160
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,290
on her left palm.

161
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,660
Appears slightly jaundiced,

162
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,830
and has some

163
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,830
very interesting theories

164
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,670
about the medical

165
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,670
industrial complex.

166
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,870
Ma'am, please.

167
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,870
It's policy.

168
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,640
What about my autonomy?

169
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,340
Am I not allowed to govern

170
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,340
my own health and wellness?

171
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,750
She was a little rattled

172
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,750
at the scene.

173
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,510
I think that's why

174
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,510
she didn't fight us

175
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,250
getting into the ambo.

176
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,510
But now that the shock

177
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,510
has worn off,

178
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,610
she won't come out.

179
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,660
Okay. Let me see

180
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,660
what I can do.

181
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,660
Thank you, Cesar.

182
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,720
Hi, Jan.

183
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,230
I'm Maggie.

184
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,490
I'm a nurse here

185
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,490
at Chicago Med.

186
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,660
I know what

187
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,660
you're going to ask,

188
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,390
and I'm not

189
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,390
going inside.

190
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,930
Well, the thing is,

191
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,930
you're already here.

192
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,520
And your hand, it looks like

193
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,520
it needs stitches.

194
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,970
Oh, it's fine.

195
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,330
Well,

196
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,330
let's confirm that.

197
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,800
And then we'll send you

198
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,800
on your way.

199
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,740
They've got you

200
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,740
on the payroll,

201
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,740
don't they?

202
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,610
I'm sorry. Who's "they"?

203
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,440
The pharmaceutical companies.

204
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,950
All you nurses

205
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,950
are on the take.

206
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,020
I can assure you,

207
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,020
I'm not on any take.

208
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,880
No. I've read about it.

209
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,420
And I know that the minute

210
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,420
I walk through that door,

211
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,250
you're going to inject me

212
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,250
with a virus,

213
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,450
and I will spend

214
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,450
the rest of my life

215
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,390
paying for

216
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,390
overpriced medications.

217
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,900
You'll get a cut,

218
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,900
and your pals at big pharma

219
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,730
will make a fortune

220
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,730
keeping me alive.

221
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,990
Told you.

222
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,990
Okay, um,

223
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,330
Jan, I'm not sure where

224
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,330
you got your information.

225
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,030
But if you come inside

226
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,030
with me, maybe we can...

227
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,680
No. I'm not going anywhere.

228
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,390
She's very distrustful

229
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,390
of hospitals, paranoid,

230
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,660
maybe even delusional.

231
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,820
And she says

232
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,820
her name is Jan Dover.

233
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,540
It sounds like a variation

234
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,540
on Jane Doe, doesn't it?

235
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,430
Exactly. And she's been

236
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,430
white-knuckling those handles

237
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,430
ever since they got here.

238
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,730
By the way,

239
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,730
her hand's been bleeding.

240
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,000
That lac must be deep

241
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,000
and hurt like hell.

242
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,040
Is she angry? Combative?

243
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,610
No, she's just

244
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,610
terrified and thinks

245
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,610
we're going to hurt her

246
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,010
and has a ton of internet

247
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,010
research to back it up.

248
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,580
You know, COVID,

249
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,580
with all the isolation

250
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,310
and loneliness

251
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,310
really amplified

252
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,650
the conspiracy theories

253
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,650
in general,

254
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,730
made the medical system

255
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,730
in particular an easy target.

256
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,990
Jan, how you doing?

257
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,990
I'm Dr. Charles.

258
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,430
A psychiatrist.

259
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,430
Here we go.

260
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,020
What do you mean?

261
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,500
Medicine's answer for people

262
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,500
who don't play along

263
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
is call them crazy.

264
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,340
Jan, we just met, okay?

265
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
The only thing

266
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
I know about you

267
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,770
is that you're losing

268
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,770
a lot of blood,

269
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,770
and we gotta...

270
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,370
We gotta take a look

271
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,370
at that hand.

272
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,040
And I appreciate that,

273
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,040
but I already told her

274
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,380
that I am not going

275
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,380
inside the hospital.

276
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,890
It is too dangerous.

277
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,890
How so?

278
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,980
X-rays, gamma rays,

279
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,980
infrared radiation.

280
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,750
I mean,

281
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,750
we can keep chatting

282
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,750
if you can fix those.

283
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,760
Well, we actually

284
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,760
have a protocol for that.

285
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,420
You do?

286
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,420
Yeah. Trust me.

287
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,660
You are not the first person

288
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,660
to come into this hospital

289
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,600
with that set of concerns.

290
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,660
Okay. Fine then.

291
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,930
Great.

292
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,370
Wheelchair, please.

293
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,140
We have a protocol for

294
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,140
the electromagnetic spectrum?

295
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,510
We do now.

296
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,010
By the way,

297
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,010
she is very jaundiced.

298
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,050
It could be

299
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,050
something serious

300
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,140
Yeah.

301
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,480
So look,

302
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,480
in order to actually

303
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,480
get her into a treatment room,

304
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,820
I'm going to ask you to get

305
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,820
with the X-ray techs, okay?

306
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,020
And here's what I want you

307
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,020
to ask them for...

308
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,560
Tim, how long has your

309
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,560
stomach been bothering you?

310
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,460
A few weeks or so.

311
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,830
It's mostly when I eat.

312
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,060
Yeah? And how does it

313
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,060
feel now?

314
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,400
Mild? Sharp?

315
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,410
Kind of like

316
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,410
indigestion or bloating,

317
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,640
but then last night

318
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,640
it got a little worse.

319
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,570
Seriously, Tim?

320
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,570
A little worse?

321
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,170
He woke up from

322
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,170
a dead sleep screaming.

323
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,420
He had tears in his eyes.

324
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,420
Pam.

325
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,640
My wife overshares

326
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,640
when she's nervous.

327
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,780
And my husband downplays

328
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,780
when he's in pain.

329
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,580
Can you tell

330
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,580
we've been married forever?

331
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,520
That's all good. Okay.

332
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,180
So one to ten,

333
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,180
how's the pain feel now?

334
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,980
Ow! That's like a six

335
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,980
or seven right there.

336
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,890
Nope. Downplaying.

337
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,890
That's a ten face.

338
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,690
I see it every time

339
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,690
we have a stair day.

340
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,930
Stair day?

341
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,660
Our resolution for 2023

342
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,660
was to lose weight,

343
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,660
get fit.

344
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,760
And one of our workouts

345
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,840
is walking the stairs

346
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,840
in our building.

347
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,700
She makes it sound like

348
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,700
it's a mid-rise.

349
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,610
It's not even close.

350
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,610
It's 35 stories.

351
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,150
Well, he never makes it

352
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,150
past the eighth floor.

353
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,150
Meanwhile, I make it

354
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,150
to the top every time,

355
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,010
and I haven't lost a pound.

356
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,590
Tim here's lost 22.

357
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,590
Twenty-four.

358
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,090
Yeah, I don't know.

359
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,090
It must be my metabolism.

360
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,950
Or it's whatever's going

361
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,950
on with your stomach,

362
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,820
and, if that's the case,

363
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,820
I want it too.

364
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,760
Ow! You can have it.

365
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,760
Okay, well,

366
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,800
we'll give you something

367
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,800
to take the edge off, okay?

368
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,830
Uh, 25 of fentanyl

369
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,830
and a GI cocktail.

370
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,160
Also, order an upright

371
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,160
and flat abdominal X-ray

372
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,130
and a CT abdomen and pelvis.

373
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,700
Okay. Just take

374
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,700
some deep breaths.

375
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,040
It'll help with the pain.

376
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,490
George, a minute?

377
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,260
Sharon. Of course,

378
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,260
of course.

379
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,960
Just sketch in the aquarium.

380
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,960
I'll be right back.

381
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,260
An aquarium?

382
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,000
I thought we were only

383
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,000
taking over a couple

384
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,000
of rooms

385
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,940
for this new VIP build.

386
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,170
Well, demand was much

387
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,170
greater than expected.

388
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,800
So, at the 11th hour,

389
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,740
Jack decided to take

390
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,740
the entire floor.

391
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,870
But this is

392
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,870
the geriatrics unit.

393
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,720
Did he even consider

394
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,720
those patients?

395
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,020
Well, the plan

396
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,020
is to fold geriatrics

397
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,020
into the orthopedic.

398
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,820
Oh, so that's the plan, huh?

399
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,630
Clearly, word didn't

400
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,630
get to you.

401
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,750
Well, clearly.

402
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,720
I'm so sorry, Sharon.

403
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,160
It must have been

404
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,160
an oversight.

405
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,760
Since turning for-profit,

406
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,760
there have been

407
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,740
dozens of new voices

408
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,740
in the mix.

409
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,540
And it's really gummed up

410
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,540
the lines of communication.

411
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,730
Well, un-gum them.

412
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,110
Because I will not be left out

413
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,110
of the loop

414
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,650
in my own hospital.

415
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,080
Well, anything further,

416
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,280
and I will notify you myself.

417
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,580
Good.

418
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,120
How far do we have to go?

419
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,860
Uh, just number three

420
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,860
down here on the right.

421
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,700
These poor people,

422
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,700
staring at me,

423
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,700
yet they have no idea

424
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,560
how dangerous this place is.

425
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,200
All the things

426
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,200
they're being exposed to.

427
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,300
You know,

428
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,300
I used to be like them

429
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,630
till I discovered the truth.

430
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,710
The truth?

431
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,340
What, um, what exactly

432
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,340
do you mean by that?

433
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,880
Jan, every machine that

434
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,880
could be removed has been,

435
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,580
and the equipment

436
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,580
that we couldn't

437
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,750
has been draped

438
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,750
with a lead vest

439
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,080
like the one

440
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,080
that you're wearing.

441
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,880
And the walls

442
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,880
have been insulated

443
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,650
with anti-radiation blankets.

444
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,150
Wow.

445
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,630
You did this fast.

446
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,630
Yeah.

447
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,890
Protocol, right?

448
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,090
Here we go.

449
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,960
Fine. Okay.

450
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,690
Jan, that's Tracy.

451
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,330
Be right back.

452
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,140
Well, she's in.

453
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,140
Yeah.

454
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,740
Hopefully she's comfortable

455
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,740
enough to let us fix her hand,

456
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,280
but we really got to

457
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,280
figure out this jaundice.

458
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,110
How we going to do that?

459
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,270
She's taking every tool

460
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,270
we've got out of play.

461
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,220
Richard, Vickie.

462
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,150
Dr. Halstead.

463
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,150
How you been?

464
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,390
Wonderful.

465
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,160
Last week, he was

466
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,160
five months cancer-free.

467
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,920
That's fantastic.

468
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,900
I only wish you could

469
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,900
have treated my clumsiness.

470
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,190
I think I busted

471
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,190
my ankle.

472
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,860
Yeah. I can see that.

473
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,860
What happened?

474
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,700
Uh, I tripped going down

475
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,700
the stairs.

476
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,860
I've been icing it for a week,

477
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,860
but it's not getting

478
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,860
any better.

479
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,040
Vickie made me come in.

480
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,310
I need him in walking shape.

481
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,970
We're going to Machu Picchu

482
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,970
next month,

483
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,810
hiking the Inca trail.

484
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,110
We got time back that

485
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,110
I never thought we'd have.

486
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,680
Uh, we're trying to make

487
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,680
the most of it.

488
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,680
That's wonderful.

489
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,380
We'll get some X-rays,

490
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,380
but I suspect

491
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,380
it's just a sprain.

492
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,920
Oh, that's good to hear,

493
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,290
considering last time

494
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,290
we were here.

495
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,030
Thank God for OR 2.0.

496
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,100
Yeah, Richard, you were

497
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,100
its first patient.

498
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,700
Your success

499
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,700
was a real inspiration.

500
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Shoot, honey,

501
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I left my cell in the car.

502
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,900
Do you mind

503
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,900
grabbing it for me?

504
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,900
Sure.

505
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,100
I'll be right back.

506
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,950
Oh, God.

507
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,740
Richard, you all right?

508
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,680
I needed her to leave

509
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,680
for a minute.

510
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,240
What's going on?

511
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,020
I tripped because

512
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,020
I've been weak.

513
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,190
There's a dull pain

514
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,190
in my belly,

515
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,260
and I haven't had

516
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,260
an appetite.

517
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,200
The cancer's back. I know it.

518
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
Let's not get ahead

519
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
of ourselves.

520
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,930
We'll run some tests

521
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,930
and go from there.

522
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,740
So I assume

523
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,740
Vickie doesn't know.

524
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,440
I can't bring myself

525
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,440
to tell her.

526
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,870
Since my surgery, we've been

527
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,870
living our best lives.

528
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,380
She's so happy.

529
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,740
I don't want to take that

530
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,740
from her.

531
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,820
I understand.

532
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,130
Free fluid and free air

533
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,130
in my abdomen?

534
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,430
What does that mean?

535
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,830
That there's a hole somewhere

536
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,270
in your intestine

537
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,270
or your stomach.

538
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,360
From what?

539
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,940
Could be

540
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,940
a perforated ulcer.

541
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,840
It might be something sharp

542
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,840
that you swallowed.

543
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,170
Honestly, I won't be sure

544
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,170
until I get in there.

545
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,300
Get in there?

546
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,300
You mean surgery?

547
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,810
Yeah. A leak in the GI tract

548
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,110
needs to be

549
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,110
addressed immediately.

550
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,210
But he'll be all right?

551
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,210
Yes.

552
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,190
It's a routine operation.

553
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,190
There's a waiting room.

554
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,480
We also have a cafe,

555
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,480
if you like.

556
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,450
I don't know.

557
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,450
I want to be close.

558
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,260
Pam, honey, you know what?

559
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,260
Why don't you take a walk?

560
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,020
You love this time of year,

561
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,020
nice weather.

562
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,260
You can get your steps in.

563
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,490
I guess the fresh air

564
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,490
might do me some good.

565
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,770
Quell the nerves.

566
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,030
Sure. Okay.

567
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,030
So we're good here? Yeah?

568
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,400
All right, well,

569
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,400
I'll change my scrubs,

570
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,440
and I'll get the techs

571
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,440
to bring you upstairs

572
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,530
to pre-op holding.

573
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,240
Hi.

574
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,840
Sweetie, you need to let go.

575
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,110
Oh, I'm sorry.

576
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,280
Don't worry.

577
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,280
We'll keep you updated

578
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,820
throughout

579
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,820
the entire operation.

580
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,110
Thank you.

581
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,850
Oh, and another one...

582
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,120
Vaccines.

583
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,320
You want to know

584
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,320
who they're helping,

585
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,090
just look at the sponsor

586
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,090
behind it.

587
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,130
Hey, a lot of people

588
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,130
have problems

589
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,360
with vaccines, you know?

590
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,360
It's a complicated issue.

591
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,450
Exactly.

592
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,260
I didn't think

593
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,260
you would understand.

594
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,230
It's really important for

595
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,230
somebody in my position

596
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,230
to keep an open mind.

597
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,360
Refreshing.

598
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
You know, Jan,

599
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
I'm noticing some

600
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
skin discoloration.

601
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,970
Oh, it's just

602
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,970
the fluorescent

603
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,970
lights in here.

604
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,210
You know, it could be.

605
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,010
But it also

606
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,010
might be jaundice.

607
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,910
You mind if I just take

608
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,910
a tiny bit of blood,

609
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,580
do a couple of

610
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,580
very simple blood tests?

611
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,580
Yes, I mind very much.

612
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,480
Got it. Understood.

613
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,920
You were saying?

614
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,120
Oh, HIV.

615
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,560
I read

616
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,560
a very persuasive article

617
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,860
basically saying that

618
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,860
they intentionally dusted it

619
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,300
over low-income communities

620
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,030
as a form of

621
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,030
population control.

622
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,370
Wow.

623
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,370
Yeah.

624
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,170
I mean, people

625
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,170
wanted to blame

626
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,170
the Reagan administration,

627
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,070
you know, the FBI,

628
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,070
but the research I've done

629
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,310
points to the CIA.

630
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,510
What kind of research?

631
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,510
I'm just curious.

632
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,880
I mean, written literature,

633
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,880
podcasters, YouTubers.

634
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,540
But I prefer online forums

635
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,450
because people are always

636
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,450
sharing information.

637
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,960
So, I mean,

638
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,960
do you have, like a...

639
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,190
A favorite forum that

640
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,190
you could show me?

641
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,990
Yeah, I don't know.

642
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,330
Look, I will draw

643
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,330
my own conclusions.

644
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,230
It's just the more

645
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,230
up-to-the-minute stuff

646
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,200
I have access to,

647
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,200
the better.

648
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,890
No big deal.

649
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,640
Okay, uh...

650
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,080
All right.

651
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,080
Look at this thread.

652
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,310
It talks about the scanners

653
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,310
that they use in hospitals.

654
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,380
We're

655
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,380
seeing that, yeah.

656
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,510
CTs, ultrasounds,

657
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,510
especially MRIs,

658
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,580
and how they inject

659
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,580
dangerous hydrogen protons

660
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,580
into the body.

661
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,280
Wow.

662
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,050
Hospitals kill people.

663
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,190
They kill them.

664
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,230
Okay. We had

665
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,230
a good chat, but...

666
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,470
Look, you seem like

667
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,470
a nice guy, but I would...

668
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,430
I would really like

669
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,430
to go home now.

670
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,100
Got it. Um, let me

671
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,100
just quickly go

672
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,200
find somebody

673
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,200
to stitch you up.

674
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,540
No, no, no, no.

675
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,540
I don't think so.

676
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,050
That's a deep wound, okay?

677
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,080
If we don't close it up,

678
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,080
it's going to keep bleeding.

679
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,580
And what I really

680
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,580
don't want to happen

681
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,650
is that it gets infected.

682
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,650
No, no. I'll keep it clean.

683
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,390
You want to risk having

684
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,390
your hand infected?

685
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,390
You could lose it.

686
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,950
Okay. Fine.

687
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,330
But no scans, no IVs,

688
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,330
just a needle and thread.

689
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,660
And then you let me go.

690
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,060
Deal.

691
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,000
Back in a flash.

692
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,430
Mags?

693
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,010
Yeah.

694
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,010
Find Zack.

695
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,080
Have him stitch up her hand.

696
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,080
She's gonna let us treat her?

697
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,700
Just the hand,

698
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,700
not the jaundice.

699
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,040
Well, that's a start.

700
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,040
What about her mental state?

701
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,520
You know, conspiracy theories

702
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,520
are not necessarily connected

703
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,520
to any kind of paranoid

704
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,520
personality disorder.

705
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,050
I mean, certainly not

706
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,050
in Jan's case.

707
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,710
And she's what?

708
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,710
Just gullible?

709
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,550
I'd say more like

710
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,550
a combination of,

711
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,720
I don't know, lonely

712
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,720
and prone to persuasion.

713
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,730
I'm starting to think that

714
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,730
something bad happened

715
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,730
to her in a hospital.

716
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,160
That makes sense.

717
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,160
How do we get past that?

718
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,430
Because I'm concerned

719
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,430
that her jaundice

720
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,400
means that

721
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,400
her liver's failing.

722
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,400
Yeah, I mean, look.

723
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,000
She wouldn't let me

724
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,000
draw blood, all right?

725
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,230
Scans are

726
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,230
out of the question.

727
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,370
So I guess we're just going

728
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,370
to have to go with, you know,

729
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,000
her medical history.

730
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,170
Well, we don't even

731
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,170
have that.

732
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,680
We don't even have her name.

733
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,680
It's Jacqueline Warner.

734
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,370
She handed me her phone.

735
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,080
The settings trick

736
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,080
that I taught you.

737
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,310
Anyway, it's not going to

738
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,310
take Zack that long

739
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,310
to stitch her up,

740
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,620
but she's already

741
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,620
asking to leave, so...

742
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,990
Don't worry.

743
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,990
I'll buy you some time.

744
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,320
Thank you.

745
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,320
Got you.

746
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,760
Vickie, Richard.

747
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,260
Dr. Marcel?

748
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,260
Nice to see you both.

749
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,460
Yeah, it's nice

750
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,460
to see you too.

751
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,730
Yeah.

752
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,730
I don't understand.

753
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,370
You're a surgeon.

754
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,200
You said

755
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,200
it was just a sprain.

756
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,740
Richard,

757
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,740
what's going on?

758
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,040
The cancer's back,

759
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,040
isn't it?

760
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,140
I'm afraid so.

761
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,080
CT scan showed

762
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,080
multiple lesions

763
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,080
in your liver.

764
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,080
So it metastasized.

765
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,710
It spread

766
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,710
from my pancreas.

767
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,050
Yes.

768
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,180
Oh, Richard.

769
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,790
You knew something

770
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,790
was wrong.

771
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,060
Why didn't you tell me?

772
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,030
I wanted to.

773
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,460
But I also just

774
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,460
didn't wanna face it.

775
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,730
These last few months,

776
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,400
the way you laugh

777
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,400
at my dumb jokes,

778
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,670
burn my toast on the edges.

779
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,470
I've fallen for you

780
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,470
all over again.

781
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,120
You beat cancer once.

782
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,250
You can beat it again.

783
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,250
No, honey.

784
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,790
I'm a science guy.

785
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,790
The odds of that happening...

786
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,220
Are good.

787
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,820
Richard, OR 2.0

788
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,820
knows your body.

789
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,220
It's been learning

790
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,220
and improving

791
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,200
with every surgery

792
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,200
it's done since yours.

793
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,630
Now, don't get me wrong.

794
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,360
This procedure you need now,

795
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,360
high-frequency ablation,

796
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,570
it's a delicate operation.

797
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,230
But 2.0 has all the tools.

798
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,570
But a third lease on life?

799
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,400
Really?

800
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,670
I believe so.

801
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,170
Okay.

802
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,480
Let's do it again.

803
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,580
Good.

804
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,780
Thank you both.

805
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,780
Yeah.

806
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,550
Here we go.

807
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,460
Perforated ulcer

808
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,460
on the anterior surface

809
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,590
of the first portion

810
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,590
of the duodenum.

811
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,530
Got some undigested

812
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,530
food remnants, lavage.

813
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,600
Betcha it's corn

814
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,600
and green beans.

815
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,340
Close.

816
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,410
Corn and cauliflower.

817
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,280
I was going to

818
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,280
say cauliflower.

819
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,110
All right.

820
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,110
Uh, suction, please.

821
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,820
Let's move on

822
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,820
to the omental patch,

823
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,650
3-0 silk suture.

824
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,420
Whoa!

825
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,360
What the hell was that?

826
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,360
That's a tapeworm.

827
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,830
Where the hell did it go?

828
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,870
That's a good question.

829
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,610
Booked the whole day for

830
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,610
one person's pacemaker?

831
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,150
Apparently, Jack has

832
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,150
decided to rent out OR 2.0.

833
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,480
As long as you have the money,

834
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,480
you can reserve it

835
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,880
for as long as you want.

836
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,820
I know

837
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,820
this is unorthodox,

838
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,480
but when Jack started

839
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,480
analyzing revenue streams...

840
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,920
No, he's selling seats

841
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,920
on a rocket ship,

842
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,460
making up rules

843
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,460
only his rich pals

844
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,460
can play by.

845
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,830
Okay. Right now, I need

846
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,830
a solution for my patient.

847
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,520
Rich is ready for surgery,

848
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,520
and this other guy

849
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,520
is still in Colorado.

850
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,660
And my priority

851
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,660
is patient care,

852
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,900
and I'm not going to

853
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,900
have an operating room

854
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,600
held hostage by Jack Dayton.

855
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,930
Start your surgery.

856
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,670
Wait. Just hold on.

857
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,670
Jack's already made it clear

858
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,570
that he's no longer

859
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,570
subsidizing 2.0.

860
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,640
We sure

861
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,640
Evans can pay?

862
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,480
Are you kidding me?

863
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,480
We're talking about

864
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,480
a man's life.

865
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,520
Dr. Halstead,

866
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,520
the way I see it,

867
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,280
Mr. Evans's initial surgery

868
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,280
was pro bono,

869
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,360
so we can consider this

870
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,360
a necessary follow-up

871
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,480
and forgive the bill.

872
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,490
Start your surgery,

873
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,490
Dr. Marcel.

874
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,620
Thank you.

875
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,620
You know, Jack's ideas,

876
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,290
chasing profits

877
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,290
for the hospital,

878
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,770
it only widens the gap.

879
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,200
It's not right.

880
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,430
Wow. I got to let Jack know

881
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,430
what's going on.

882
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,300
No, no, no.

883
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,300
You let me tell him myself.

884
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,280
We're going to keep this line

885
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,280
of communication direct.

886
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,280
Dr. Charles,

887
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,280
Zack's finished

888
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,280
stitching Jan up.

889
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,510
And I've stalled

890
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,510
all that I can.

891
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,920
She's antsy,

892
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,920
and she wants

893
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,920
out of here.

894
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,580
Okay, well,

895
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,580
I'm starting

896
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,580
to see why.

897
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,590
Nothing glaring

898
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,590
in Jan's chart,

899
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,750
but it turns out

900
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,750
her sister, Deborah,

901
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,420
was seen at East Mercy

902
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,560
right before the pandemic

903
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,560
for a broken arm.

904
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,860
Upon examination,

905
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,860
they discover

906
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,860
aggressive pancreatic cancer.

907
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,440
She's dead in a month.

908
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,500
So in Jan's mind,

909
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,510
her sister went into

910
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,510
the hospital healthy,

911
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,410
had a bunch of scans

912
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,410
and tests,

913
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,940
and came out

914
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,940
with a terminal disease?

915
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,540
Exactly. She has this sudden

916
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,540
catastrophic loss,

917
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,680
and she's furious

918
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,680
and looking for

919
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,680
someone to blame.

920
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,250
Oh, my God.

921
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,260
Jaundice is a symptom

922
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,260
of pancreatic cancer.

923
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,560
Isn't it hereditary?

924
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,560
Yes.

925
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,250
And it was killing her sister

926
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,690
before she even knew

927
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,690
she had it.

928
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,560
Same thing could be

929
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,560
happening to Jan.

930
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,330
She needs a full workup now.

931
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,330
What are we going to do?

932
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,330
Okay, look.

933
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,370
I'm going to dive back into

934
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,370
these sites, these forums,

935
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,270
see if I can find something

936
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,270
that we can connect on.

937
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,500
In the meantime,

938
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,500
start the discharge,

939
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,500
but slow roll it for me.

940
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,740
Okay. Work fast.

941
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,580
All right, Trini, I'm back.

942
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,580
What've we got?

943
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,740
Nothing.

944
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,740
Seriously?

945
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,340
Since we stopped taking

946
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,340
walk-ins without insurance,

947
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,750
numbers are down.

948
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,520
Well, we can't do that.

949
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,520
It's illegal.

950
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,990
I don't know. I guess

951
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,990
we're only taking

952
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,990
"true emergencies" now.

953
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,530
I know you've been

954
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,530
waiting a long time.

955
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,530
And I'm sorry, sir.

956
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,660
They'll be able to help you

957
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,660
at East Mercy.

958
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,610
We're turning him away

959
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,610
because he doesn't

960
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,610
have insurance?

961
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,760
Yeah.

962
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,970
Excuse me, sir.

963
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,300
I'm Dr. Halstead.

964
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,300
What's going on?

965
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,640
Gout's flaring up again.

966
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,910
I'm sorry.

967
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,910
I know that's painful.

968
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,350
How about your chest?

969
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,350
Any pain?

970
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,950
What? No.

971
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,060
Are you sure?

972
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,060
'Cause if you do,

973
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,850
well, that'd be considered

974
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,850
an emergency,

975
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,550
and we'd have to

976
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,550
treat you here.

977
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,430
So no chest pain?

978
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,070
I might have

979
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,070
a slight feeling of tightness.

980
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,970
Well, in that case,

981
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,970
let's get you checked out.

982
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,600
Okay, what do you feel?

983
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,410
We got grilled cheese,

984
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,410
dim sum, pizza.

985
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,480
Any of them.

986
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,480
I'm starving.

987
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,920
I had to fast

988
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,920
for the blood test,

989
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,820
then no time to eat

990
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,820
before the scans started.

991
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,520
Any idea when the results

992
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,520
come in?

993
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,790
Well, they said

994
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,790
a couple of days.

995
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,450
Probably going to feel like

996
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,450
weeks though.

997
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,930
Mmm-hmm.

998
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,120
Oh, my God.

999
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,830
Oh, my God.

1000
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,630
Are you hurt? What...

1001
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,630
I don't know.

1002
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,790
I was just walking,

1003
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,790
and then all of a sudden

1004
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,790
my stomach...

1005
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,060
Argh!

1006
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,060
Okay, all right.

1007
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,140
Help me get her

1008
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,140
to the bench.

1009
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,140
What's your name?

1010
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,570
Pam.

1011
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,570
Pam, I'm Dr. Asher.

1012
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,700
That's Sean.

1013
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,700
Thank you.

1014
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,470
Is it okay

1015
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,470
if I feel your belly?

1016
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,570
Yes.

1017
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,570
Yeah? Okay.

1018
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,550
My husband's in surgery

1019
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,550
right now

1020
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,010
for a hole

1021
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,010
in his intestine.

1022
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,610
Could I have

1023
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,610
the same thing?

1024
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,050
Sorry.

1025
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,420
It's okay.

1026
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,420
Squeeze as hard

1027
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,420
as you like.

1028
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,580
Oh, God.

1029
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,890
Oh, I'm sorry.

1030
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,890
I just peed myself.

1031
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,490
Oh, no, Pam.

1032
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,490
That's not urine.

1033
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,090
Your uterus is enlarged

1034
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,090
and firm.

1035
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,530
Your water just broke.

1036
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,530
You're in labor.

1037
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,460
What? I'm pregnant?

1038
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,060
I'm sorry.

1039
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,060
You didn't know?

1040
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,870
Wow, okay.

1041
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,870
So I imagine you have

1042
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,870
a lot of questions.

1043
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,770
But right now, we need

1044
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,770
to get you inside.

1045
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,540
I'll get a wheelchair.

1046
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,540
Wait. I'm scared.

1047
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,110
I need to

1048
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,110
hold on to someone,

1049
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,110
and my husband's in the...

1050
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,700
I'll step in for him,

1051
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,700
if you'd like.

1052
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,810
Thank you.

1053
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,780
Okay. I'll go

1054
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,780
get that wheelchair.

1055
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,150
I see.

1056
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,950
Oh, lost it. Damn it.

1057
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,150
Is this

1058
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,150
a cause-and-effect thing?

1059
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,860
Tapeworm lead to the ulcer?

1060
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,990
No.

1061
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,460
Ulcer's usually from

1062
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,460
the H. pylori bacteria,

1063
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,160
super common,

1064
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,160
almost all of us have it.

1065
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,770
Tapeworm's from a bad meal.

1066
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,170
I'm never eating again.

1067
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,200
Gotcha. Ha ha.

1068
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,910
Wife's not picking up.

1069
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,570
Leave your number.

1070
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,570
Ask her to text you.

1071
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,550
Pull this out slowly.

1072
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,750
Tapeworms regenerate.

1073
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,550
Don't want this

1074
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,550
breaking off on me.

1075
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,820
How long

1076
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,820
do you think it is?

1077
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,780
No idea.

1078
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,730
But I can't wait to find out.

1079
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,920
Need some help in here!

1080
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,570
Move it.

1081
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,570
Where?

1082
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,500
Anywhere but here, Mike.

1083
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,500
What happened?

1084
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,000
They took an X-ray

1085
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,000
in the treatment room

1086
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,630
next door

1087
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,630
and it set her off.

1088
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,630
I heard them.

1089
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,670
They said X-ray. And then

1090
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,670
someone yelled, "Clear."

1091
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,540
See, they're admitting

1092
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,540
the radiation is bad

1093
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,540
for you.

1094
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,800
And these blankets

1095
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,800
are not enough.

1096
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,940
Okay. I'm sorry.

1097
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,940
But we got rid

1098
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,940
of the X-ray machine.

1099
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,040
Well, Dr. Charles said

1100
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,040
I could go,

1101
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,840
so I'm leaving right now.

1102
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,840
Jacqueline...

1103
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,040
What? How do you know

1104
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,040
my name?

1105
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,180
I can explain.

1106
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,950
No. Forget it.

1107
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,950
I don't trust any of you.

1108
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,780
We know about your sister

1109
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,780
and her cancer.

1110
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,590
Yeah, that the hospitals

1111
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,590
gave her

1112
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,130
with their X-rays

1113
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,130
and their CTs

1114
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,130
and their MRIs.

1115
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,030
Those scans killed her!

1116
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,030
It's not true.

1117
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,100
Deborah had cancer before

1118
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,100
she went to the hospital.

1119
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,100
No.

1120
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,760
Her death had nothing

1121
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,760
to do with the test.

1122
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,100
It was genetic.

1123
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,730
That's why you need

1124
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,730
to get tested too.

1125
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,730
No. Stay away from me.

1126
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,940
You have all been lying to me

1127
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,940
since I got here.

1128
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,240
That's not true.

1129
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,240
We've been trying to help you.

1130
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,020
Then let me go!

1131
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,020
Maggie, just a word.

1132
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,550
Be right back.

1133
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,550
I'm done here.

1134
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,620
Give me five minutes.

1135
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,620
I'll walk you out myself.

1136
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,710
Mags?

1137
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,850
What are you doing?

1138
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,080
We've got to get through

1139
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,080
to her somehow.

1140
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,030
Reinforcing her paranoid

1141
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,030
fantasies is not the way

1142
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,030
to do that.

1143
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,620
She may have

1144
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,620
a terminal cancer,

1145
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,620
Dr. Charles.

1146
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,820
She needs

1147
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,820
to get screened.

1148
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,060
Well, of course she does.

1149
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,760
But it's got to be

1150
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,760
her decision to do that.

1151
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,840
Well, we know that's never

1152
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,840
going to happen, don't we?

1153
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,940
Yeah, it's a safe bet

1154
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,940
this is why Tim was

1155
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,940
shedding weight.

1156
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,840
Tapeworm was

1157
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,840
stealing calories.

1158
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,610
Tim's wife text you back yet?

1159
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,720
No. Still MIA.

1160
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,020
I don't get it.

1161
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,180
So worried about Tim

1162
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,180
having surgery.

1163
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,280
Where'd she go?

1164
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,280
One last push!

1165
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,150
Awesome, Pam.

1166
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,150
You're almost there.

1167
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,150
Keep going.

1168
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,930
Okay.

1169
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,930
Oh, my God.

1170
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,900
Full-term?

1171
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,910
Ultrasound revealed that

1172
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,910
the gestational age

1173
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,910
is around 37 weeks.

1174
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,340
It doesn't make any sense.

1175
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,970
I have polycystic

1176
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,970
ovarian syndrome.

1177
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,570
I get a period once,

1178
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,570
maybe twice a year.

1179
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,050
We've tried forever,

1180
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,050
and nothing.

1181
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,780
Okay, we can figure out

1182
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,780
the hows and whys later, Pam.

1183
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,910
Right now,

1184
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,910
I need you to focus.

1185
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,110
Here comes

1186
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,110
another contraction.

1187
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,750
All right.

1188
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,750
Ready, Pam?

1189
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,090
Push as hard as you can, okay?

1190
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,190
Sean?

1191
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,160
Right. Breathe through it.

1192
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,090
Short, short, long.

1193
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,290
Okay. I see

1194
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,290
the top of the head.

1195
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,600
All right, Tim.

1196
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,140
Can't imagine

1197
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,140
there's much more.

1198
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,710
Holy smokes.

1199
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,380
One more pull. One more.

1200
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,200
And, ugh!

1201
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,870
It's out.

1202
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,710
Whew.

1203
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,620
He is out.

1204
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,250
It's a boy, Pam.

1205
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,950
Oh, my God.

1206
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,950
This is incredible.

1207
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,190
I'm a mom.

1208
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,030
Congratulations.

1209
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,030
Thanks.

1210
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,960
Here he is.

1211
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,030
There we go.

1212
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,970
Oh, my God.

1213
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,840
My husband is...

1214
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,840
Is he still in surgery?

1215
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,710
I'll find out for you.

1216
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,640
He is not going to believe

1217
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,640
what just came out of me.

1218
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,230
2.0, give me a lateral

1219
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,230
cross-section of the liver.

1220
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,850
Rotating.

1221
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,760
Okay. I've got visuals

1222
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,760
of the lesions.

1223
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,420
2.0, triangulate.

1224
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,790
Guidance initiated.

1225
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,700
Angle three degrees left.

1226
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,400
Three degrees.

1227
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,070
Okay.

1228
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,240
Probe has penetrated

1229
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,240
the first lesion.

1230
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,840
Activate radiofrequency.

1231
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,420
Activating.

1232
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,690
Very nice.

1233
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,020
First lesion has been ablated.

1234
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,960
Six more to go, Richard.

1235
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,760
2.0, guide me to the next one.

1236
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,190
Calculating.

1237
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,390
Calculating.

1238
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,870
2.0, guide me

1239
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,870
to the next lesion.

1240
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,960
Calculating. Calculating.

1241
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,440
Calculating. Calculating.

1242
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,700
Push forward three millimeters

1243
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,040
to circumvent

1244
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,040
the common hepatic vein.

1245
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,240
All right.

1246
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,750
Advancing forward.

1247
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,480
That came out of my intestine?

1248
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,980
Yeah. All six feet,

1249
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,980
four inches of it.

1250
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,250
No more YOLO moments for me.

1251
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,380
YOLO? You Only Live Once?

1252
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,720
Yeah.

1253
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,320
Nine months ago, Pam and I

1254
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,320
went to Thailand for our 10th.

1255
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,720
I was all over

1256
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,720
those street carts.

1257
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,270
Pork, chicken, fish, insects.

1258
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,400
I probably picked up that

1259
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,400
tapeworm somewhere

1260
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,400
in that smorgasbord.

1261
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,730
Perhaps.

1262
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,310
Although, tapeworms

1263
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,310
only take two months

1264
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,780
to reach adult size,

1265
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,780
so it's possible

1266
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,210
that you were infected

1267
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,210
more recently.

1268
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,810
Same thing goes for

1269
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,810
the H. pylori bacteria

1270
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,810
that caused your ulcer.

1271
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,350
Could've happened

1272
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,350
any time, any place.

1273
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,080
So the two

1274
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,080
aren't connected?

1275
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,380
Well, not medically.

1276
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,860
But tapeworms can go

1277
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,860
undetected for years.

1278
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,860
So if you hadn't

1279
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,860
developed an ulcer

1280
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,450
which required surgery,

1281
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,450
then who knows how long

1282
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,360
it would've taken

1283
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,360
to discover it?

1284
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,790
I guess it was

1285
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,790
my lucky day,

1286
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,790
then, huh?

1287
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,060
Yeah.

1288
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,060
Actually, yeah.

1289
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,370
About your trip to Thailand...

1290
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,300
Pretty sure you didn't bring

1291
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,300
anything back in you,

1292
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,380
but I'm very certain

1293
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,380
that your wife

1294
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,840
brought something back in her.

1295
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,470
Surprise.

1296
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,870
Who is that?

1297
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,810
Our son.

1298
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,480
What?

1299
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,820
We're parents.

1300
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,150
And who is that?

1301
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,150
That's my son.

1302
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,490
Parents? Is this really

1303
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,490
happening right now?

1304
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,530
Yes. It's really happening.

1305
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,100
And I guess now we know why

1306
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,100
I haven't lost any weight.

1307
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,410
But your OB, she said you

1308
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,410
couldn't ever get pregnant.

1309
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,270
Yes, well,

1310
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,270
she was wrong.

1311
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,580
Whoa.

1312
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,580
I know.

1313
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,250
It's a lot.

1314
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,080
Oh.

1315
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,520
Do you want

1316
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,520
to hold him, Dad?

1317
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,020
Yeah.

1318
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,020
Yeah?

1319
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,390
Ow.

1320
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,390
Here he is.

1321
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,330
Hey, bud.

1322
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,270
I can walk.

1323
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,270
I hate these things.

1324
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,350
I'm sorry. It's just,

1325
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,350
it's hospital policy,

1326
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,350
you know.

1327
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,240
Of course.

1328
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,240
Get me out of here.

1329
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,060
I've been thinking about

1330
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,060
these conversations we've had.

1331
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,890
It occurred to me

1332
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,360
it wasn't that long ago

1333
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,360
that doctors actually thought

1334
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,220
that cigarettes

1335
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,220
were good for you.

1336
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,900
I mean, we sold them

1337
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,900
in hospitals, right?

1338
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,900
Point being that

1339
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,900
the medical world

1340
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,900
always has been,

1341
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,940
always will be

1342
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,940
constantly evolving.

1343
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,630
I mean, look, I do this

1344
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,630
for a living every day.

1345
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,910
I'm a doctor.

1346
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,910
No way I can keep up.

1347
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,910
You know what I mean?

1348
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,980
How's your hand?

1349
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,520
Feeling any better?

1350
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,880
Yeah. A little.

1351
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,610
Here. Let me...

1352
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,660
There we go.

1353
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,660
Okay.

1354
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,430
So listen, uh,

1355
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,990
I just wanted to say that

1356
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,990
the last couple of years

1357
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,470
has been really hard

1358
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,470
for a lot of people, right?

1359
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,230
Loneliness, isolation, loss.

1360
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,270
I really miss my sister.

1361
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,640
I bet you do.

1362
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,680
And that's why I was thinking

1363
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,680
there might come a time

1364
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,420
when you might want

1365
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,420
to talk to somebody

1366
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,010
about her, about her cancer,

1367
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,010
about what it was like

1368
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,010
to lose her.

1369
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,450
And I thought of somebody

1370
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,460
who you really

1371
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,460
might respond to.

1372
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,260
A doctor?

1373
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,260
No. Not an MD.

1374
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,300
This is an MSW, actually,

1375
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,300
trained therapist,

1376
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,330
but somebody

1377
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,330
who really thinks,

1378
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,330
like, way outside the box.

1379
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,030
Anyway, this is her card,

1380
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,030
you know,

1381
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,630
I mean, just in case.

1382
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,340
Okay.

1383
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,410
All right, bye.

1384
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,320
A referral, Dr. Charles?

1385
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,580
That's the best

1386
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,580
we could do?

1387
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,020
Hey, Maggie,

1388
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,020
she took the card.

1389
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,590
I mean,

1390
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,590
under the circumstances,

1391
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,220
for me, it's a plus.

1392
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,060
And by the way,

1393
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,060
already talked

1394
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,060
to that therapist.

1395
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,140
And in case she ever calls,

1396
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,140
first order of business,

1397
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,300
encourage her to get screened.

1398
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,300
So you know, I'll take it.

1399
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,970
I'm sorry about earlier.

1400
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,010
Maybe I made it

1401
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,010
a little too personal.

1402
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,310
Hardest part of my job is just

1403
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,310
constantly checking myself,

1404
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,280
make sure I'm not projecting

1405
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,280
my life onto the people

1406
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,280
I'm trying to help.

1407
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,480
So I get it.

1408
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,250
Yeah. It's not easy.

1409
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,360
Yeah, and then, bam,

1410
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,360
there it was.

1411
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,730
You know, just looked at it

1412
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,730
right in the eyes, you know?

1413
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,700
Wait. Do tapeworms

1414
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,700
even have eyes?

1415
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,530
Eyes, no eyes,

1416
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,530
you know what I mean.

1417
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,110
Mmm. Okay, well,

1418
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,000
afraid I'm going to have

1419
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,000
to listen to the rest

1420
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,000
of the saga later.

1421
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,550
I promised Pam that I would

1422
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,550
visit her and the baby.

1423
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,210
Mmm. Okay.

1424
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,210
Sean,

1425
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,210
you want to come?

1426
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,480
Pretty sure after today

1427
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,480
that Tim and Pam

1428
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,480
consider you family.

1429
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,650
No. I'll stop by later.

1430
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,550
I wanna hit the gift shop,

1431
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,550
get something for the baby.

1432
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,680
Okay.

1433
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,230
See you guys later.

1434
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,130
I know that look.

1435
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,430
Yeah.

1436
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,700
I've been feeling it

1437
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,700
for a while.

1438
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,070
I mean, Hannah's smart,

1439
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,670
kind, and super cute.

1440
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,270
And seeing her

1441
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,270
in action today...

1442
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,310
Yeah. She's a catch.

1443
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,310
No question.

1444
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:53,220
But, you know, you're just

1445
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:53,220
getting back on your feet,

1446
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:53,220
you know?

1447
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,120
I know. Lot of cons.

1448
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,420
But the pros?

1449
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,650
I feel good with her.

1450
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,520
I trust her.

1451
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,700
Yeah, I get it. You know,

1452
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,700
you're still in recovery.

1453
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,360
And so is Hannah,

1454
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,360
for that matter.

1455
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,240
Did okay?

1456
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,240
Surgery was flawless,

1457
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,640
just like the first time.

1458
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,540
2.0 took care

1459
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,540
of all the lesions

1460
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,710
and ran additional scans

1461
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,710
that confirm

1462
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,310
the cancer was confined

1463
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,310
to his liver.

1464
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,250
Oh, thank you.

1465
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,250
They say third time's

1466
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,250
a charm,

1467
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,150
but I hope we never

1468
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,150
have to see you again.

1469
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,090
I totally get it. Yeah.

1470
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,220
How we looking?

1471
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,220
Just lowered his sedation.

1472
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,420
Okay. Richard, hey.

1473
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,420
Time to wake up, buddy.

1474
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,620
Richard?

1475
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,390
Hey.

1476
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,710
Richard, can you hear me?

1477
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,540
Last time,

1478
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,540
he woke right up.

1479
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,170
Yeah. It was a long surgery.

1480
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,170
He may need

1481
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,170
a little more time.

1482
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,800
Richard.

1483
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,800
Not responding

1484
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,800
to deep, painful stimuli.

1485
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,180
Need a head CT.

1486
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,850
What's happening?

1487
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,850
Is something wrong?

1488
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,320
Difficulty coming out of

1489
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,320
anesthesia could indicate

1490
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,320
he's had a stroke.

1491
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,590
Oh, my God.

1492
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,830
Oh, my God. Richard?

1493
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,830
Richard? Open your eyes.

1494
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,290
Richard, open your eyes.

1495
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,570
Richard, it's time to wake up.

1496
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,840
Richard, wake up!

1497
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,440
Oh, Maggie.

1498
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,440
Oh, hey.

1499
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,490
The recruiter called,

1500
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,490
and I sang your praises.

1501
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,590
Thank you.

1502
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,780
Tough day?

1503
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,820
It was just the case hit home.

1504
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,890
I just wish

1505
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,890
I could do more, you know?

1506
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,400
Yeah, well, I know

1507
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,400
exactly what you mean.

1508
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,890
Chin up.

1509
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,890
Yeah.

1510
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,810
Oh.

1511
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,880
All good with Pam

1512
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,880
and the baby?

1513
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,250
Yup. She is

1514
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,250
online feverishly

1515
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,250
ordering baby bottles

1516
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,510
and clothes and diapers.

1517
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,610
Yeah. Tim too.

1518
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,610
Crib, car seat,

1519
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,610
and a stroller.

1520
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,210
What a day.

1521
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,210
I know.

1522
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,590
I mean, I wonder what's

1523
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,590
going to happen next, right?

1524
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,820
Yeah, you got me.

1525
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,830
I mean,

1526
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,830
where did you get this?

1527
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,500
The hobby store on Madison.

1528
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,500
Oh, man.

1529
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,570
The paramedics got them

1530
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,570
for me in-between runs.

1531
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,870
Yeah.

1532
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,310
How long were you

1533
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,310
sitting there pretending

1534
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,710
to read your chart while

1535
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,710
waiting for me to come in?

1536
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,210
Since I clocked out.

1537
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,210
Hey, Doris.

1538
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,210
Seen my father?

1539
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,220
Uh, Doctors' lounge.

1540
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,220
Thanks.

1541
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,700
No, no, no.

1542
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,820
Yeah.

1543
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,740
Oh, hey, Pawel.

1544
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,740
What are you doing?

1545
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,550
Dropping off Liliana

1546
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,550
for her shift.

1547
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,810
Did I miss her?

1548
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,010
She will be back.

1549
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,910
Grabbing me a sandwich

1550
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,910
from the cafe.

1551
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,250
Nice photo.

1552
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,480
Very impressive.

1553
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,590
Used to have my name

1554
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,590
on the wall.

1555
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,680
But that's the past.

1556
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,530
You know, Pawel, I...

1557
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,530
I can't imagine

1558
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,530
how frustrating it must be

1559
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,660
to feel like you've got

1560
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,660
to start all over again.

1561
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,470
Look, it's none

1562
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,470
of my business.

1563
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,410
But I do have a buddy,

1564
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,410
pretty good buddy, actually,

1565
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,500
who has a small law firm...

1566
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,500
No, I don't need your help.

1567
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,280
I have a plan,

1568
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,280
and I'm not one

1569
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,280
of your patients.

1570
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,370
Pawel.

1571
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,550
I'll pick you up

1572
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,550
in the morning.

1573
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,460
My brother. I'm sorry.

1574
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,360
What he's going through

1575
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,360
is very difficult.

1576
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
We've got to give him

1577
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
some time.

1578
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,370
He'll be okay.

1579
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,930
Daniel, you're a very

1580
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,930
patient man.

1581
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,430
Me?

1582
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,410
I'm a...

1583
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,410
I'm a lucky man.

1584
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,980
Pupils were fixed

1585
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,980
and dilated.

1586
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,580
I mean, no gag reflex.

1587
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,580
No corneal reflex.

1588
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,630
Stroke. No chance

1589
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,630
of recovery?

1590
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,360
Vickie's decided

1591
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,360
to discontinue life support.

1592
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,070
She's saying goodbye.

1593
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,380
Dr. Marcel.

1594
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,380
Yeah.

1595
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,420
Hey. How you doing?

1596
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,720
I don't know what happened.

1597
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,720
2.0 didn't indicate

1598
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,720
anything was wrong.

1599
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,890
No alarms.

1600
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
Vitals were stable

1601
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
the entire time.

1602
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,400
This had to be on me.

1603
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,100
I must have done something,

1604
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,100
you know?

1605
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,040
Had to have done

1606
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,040
something wrong.

1607
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,640
I know that's how it feels.

1608
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,380
But sometimes, even under

1609
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,380
the best of circumstances,

1610
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,850
patients don't survive.

1611
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,420
And I'm not

1612
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,420
telling you anything

1613
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,420
you don't already know.

1614
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,690
It's awful. It is.

1615
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,860
But it's the burden

1616
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,860
we bear.
