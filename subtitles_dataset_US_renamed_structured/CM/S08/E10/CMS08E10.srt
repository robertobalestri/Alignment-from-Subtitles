1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,060
After our honeymoon,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,060
we'd like to start

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,060
treating people.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,040
Are you

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,040
giving me notice?

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,130
Yes, ma'am.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,270
Come on, Dean.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,270
What's going on?

9
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,210
Is there anything

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,210
I can do?

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,210
You can keep it to yourself.

12
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,070
Justin Lieu.

13
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,320
I spent a decade doing

14
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,320
search and rescue before

15
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,320
deciding on med school.

16
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,980
I'm Liliana.

17
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,290
I clean your office.

18
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,160
Would you like

19
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,160
to have some coffee

20
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,160
with me?

21
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,250
How about now?

22
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,160
Are you having

23
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,160
an affair?

24
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,160
No. Never.

25
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,060
He thinks that

26
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,060
we need time apart.

27
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,060
And thanks

28
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,060
to Mr. Dayton's

29
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,060
generosity,

30
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,000
Chicago Med

31
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,000
is able to provide

32
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,700
a whole new level

33
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,700
of surgical intervention.

34
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,000
I know the tech.

35
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,600
I promise you,

36
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,600
it won't let you down.

37
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,010
You know tech,

38
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,010
but you don't

39
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,010
know surgery.

40
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,140
Jack Dayton has bought

41
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,140
controlling interest

42
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,680
in the Gaffney Medical Group.

43
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,520
So I guess

44
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,520
he's in charge now.

45
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,600
Man, I've been seeing

46
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,600
these 2.0 ads everywhere.

47
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,400
Kind of makes me wish

48
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,400
I needed surgery.

49
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,630
Yeah. These are

50
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,630
a lot of signs.

51
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,140
I guess there are worse things

52
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,140
than having Jack Dayton's

53
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,140
PR machine

54
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,470
in our corner,

55
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,470
though, right?

56
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,470
Hey, look.

57
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,640
As long as he

58
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,640
keeps us ahead

59
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,640
of the supply shortages,

60
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,110
I am not complaining.

61
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,110
You know what?

62
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,810
Come to think of it,

63
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,810
I saw a whole new shipment

64
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,810
of PPE came in.

65
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,180
Let me catch up

66
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,180
with you later.

67
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,480
Hey, Maggie.

68
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,120
Oh, hey, Sharon.

69
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,590
How you doing?

70
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,160
I'm okay.

71
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,490
You know,

72
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,490
Ben used to make me

73
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,490
breakfast every morning.

74
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,260
You two still

75
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,260
aren't talking, huh?

76
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,460
Uh-uh.

77
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,370
Well, I know

78
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,370
it must be hard

79
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,370
not having him around,

80
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,530
so I'm here if you ever

81
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,530
need to talk.

82
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,440
I know. Thank you.

83
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,770
Liliana.

84
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,610
Good morning, Daniel.

85
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,420
What a pleasant way

86
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,420
to start the day.

87
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
Thank you, though

88
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
I just finished my shift.

89
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,420
I am on my way out.

90
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,860
You know what

91
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,860
I've been thinking?

92
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,420
We've had a couple

93
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,420
of very pleasant

94
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,420
coffees together.

95
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,660
How about we,

96
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,360
I don't know,

97
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,360
advance to dinner?

98
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,200
Okay, sure.

99
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,770
You want to pick

100
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,770
the restaurant? Should I?

101
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,360
Better idea. Let me cook.

102
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,360
I'll make zrazy.

103
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,340
Zrazy. Fantastic.

104
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,340
What is that?

105
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,540
It's Polish dish.

106
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,540
It's my grandmother's recipe.

107
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,340
Okay.

108
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,880
So my apartment, 8:00?

109
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,880
Great.

110
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,240
I'll text you

111
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,240
my address.

112
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,240
I will see you there.

113
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,510
What have we got?

114
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,390
Martha Kittle,

115
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,390
75 years old.

116
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,720
Took a bad spill

117
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,720
in her kitchen.

118
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,630
Let's get you checked out,

119
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,630
Martha. I need an X-ray

120
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,630
in treatment five.

121
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,790
Grandma!

122
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,370
I hear you,

123
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,370
Alexander.

124
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,690
I'm coming, Grandma.

125
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,230
Where are they taking her?

126
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,630
Just into her room to

127
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,630
check her out. You can

128
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,630
go in with her if you want.

129
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,730
What's that?

130
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,270
That's an

131
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,270
X-ray machine.

132
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,840
Will it hurt her?

133
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,840
No, no.

134
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,840
That's just so

135
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,840
the doctor can help

136
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,840
your grandmother.

137
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,310
Are you okay?

138
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,310
Yeah.

139
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,680
His name's Alexander.

140
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,410
Looks to me like

141
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,410
he could be on

142
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,410
the autism spectrum.

143
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,220
He's having trouble

144
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,220
making sense of what's going

145
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,220
on with his grandmother.

146
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,450
Leave her alone!

147
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,530
Get away from her!

148
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,820
She's just trying

149
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,820
to get an X-ray.

150
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,820
Yeah, Alexander. It's okay.

151
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,690
I'm not going

152
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,690
to let you hurt her.

153
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Alexander, how about

154
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,600
we get you a little space?

155
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,330
Would that be good?

156
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,330
Let's get you some space.

157
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,660
Thank you, Nancy.

158
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,930
Let's go home, Grandma.

159
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,900
Alexander, please stop.

160
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,260
Let's go home.

161
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,530
I need to be here.

162
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,370
And I need you

163
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,370
to calm down, please.

164
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,170
These are nice people.

165
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,940
They're trying

166
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,940
to help me.

167
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm sorry.

168
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,540
I...

169
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,700
Aw, again?

170
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,700
Yeah.

171
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,240
Is Jack Dayton gonna have

172
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,240
fresh donuts for us every day?

173
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,500
I suppose these

174
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,500
aren't allowed

175
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,500
on your renal diet.

176
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,310
I'm sorry.

177
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,310
Don't be.

178
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,320
You're the one missing out

179
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,320
on my cranberry juice.

180
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,820
Woah, brand-new

181
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,820
espresso machine?

182
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,360
Yeah, a generous gift

183
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,360
bestowed upon us

184
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,360
by Jack Dayton.

185
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,760
Well, hopefully,

186
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,760
these upgrades extend

187
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,760
to patient care too.

188
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,630
Yeah, you keep telling

189
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,630
yourself that, pal.

190
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,500
Dean won't be swayed

191
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,500
by Dayton's new shiny

192
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,500
toys and sweets.

193
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,300
Don't tell me you don't

194
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,300
remember the story of

195
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,300
"Hansel and Gretel," right?

196
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,560
The witch

197
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,560
fattening them up?

198
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,900
You think Jack Dayton

199
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,900
wants to eat us?

200
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,240
Guy seems to have

201
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,240
a big appetite.

202
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,850
Dr. Lieu,

203
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,850
you're with me today.

204
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,850
Sure thing, Dr. Archer.

205
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,680
Dr. Archer, we've got

206
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,680
one coming down

207
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,680
from the helicopter pad.

208
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,480
Use Baghdad.

209
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,780
What do we got?

210
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,690
Brandon Thompson,

211
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,690
34-year-old male.

212
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,260
Restrained driver in MVC.

213
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,420
Intubated en route.

214
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,430
Five hundred

215
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,430
milliliters of fluid

216
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,430
in the field.

217
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,260
HR 120. BP stable,

218
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,260
130 over 82.

219
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,300
What happened?

220
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,300
Drove his car off road.

221
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,430
Barreled through the woods

222
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,430
until smashing into a tree.

223
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,630
All right,

224
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,630
on my count. Ready?

225
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,000
One, two, three.

226
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,610
All right.

227
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,610
Lungs are clear.

228
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,480
Bilateral breath sounds.

229
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,910
Okay.

230
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,460
Pupils are equal

231
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,460
and reactive.

232
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,680
Fast him.

233
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,950
No free fluid.

234
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,720
Put in an A-line

235
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,720
and blood gas.

236
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,460
Doris, I'm gonna need

237
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,460
a chest and pelvis X-ray

238
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,630
as well as a EKG

239
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,630
and a PanScan.

240
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,720
Got it.

241
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,400
Must have lost control

242
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,400
of the car. Wonder why.

243
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,810
Let's hope he can wake up

244
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,810
and tell us.

245
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,980
I'm sorry, we didn't get

246
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,980
a chance to introduce

247
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,980
ourselves before.

248
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,850
This is Dr. Cuevas.

249
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,850
I'm Dr. Charles.

250
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,980
Is now a good time?

251
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,980
Of course.

252
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,790
Go ahead, Alexander.

253
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,050
What do you say?

254
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm sorry.

255
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,030
I was wrong.

256
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,360
I didn't know

257
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,360
what was happening.

258
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,440
Alexander, you know what?

259
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,440
This can be a very

260
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,440
confusing place.

261
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,530
You have absolutely nothing

262
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,530
to worry about, okay?

263
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,840
Are you gonna

264
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,840
fix Grandma?

265
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,980
We're gonna do

266
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,980
our very best.

267
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,570
Martha, I would like to go

268
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,570
over your X-rays with you.

269
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,770
Um...

270
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,370
Alexander, maybe you

271
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,370
could go get a snack?

272
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,420
There's some vending

273
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,420
machines in

274
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,420
the waiting room.

275
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,540
I can take you.

276
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,680
There's some money

277
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,680
in my purse.

278
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,870
Thanks for not sharing

279
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,870
anything in front

280
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,870
of Alexander.

281
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,710
It's hard for him knowing

282
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,710
I'm in pain.

283
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,880
Ms. Kittle, when you fell,

284
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,880
you suffered

285
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,880
an intertrochanteric fracture.

286
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,420
You broke your hip.

287
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,110
Perhaps more concerning,

288
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,980
you've got lytic lesions

289
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,980
on your bones

290
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,490
that are causing areas

291
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,490
of weakness.

292
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,120
That's probably

293
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,120
because of the cancer.

294
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,990
Stage 4 lymphoma.

295
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,990
It's metastasized

296
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,990
to my bones.

297
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,960
Very sorry to hear that.

298
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,760
It is what it is.

299
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,390
I've decided

300
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,390
not to treat it,

301
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,700
though I do take medication

302
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,700
for the pain.

303
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,710
The doctors say I might have

304
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,710
only a few more months.

305
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,440
Does Alexander know?

306
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm struggling to find

307
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,500
the right way to tell him.

308
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,670
I understand.

309
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,940
Um...

310
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,110
Listen, Martha, you are

311
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,110
gonna need some surgery, okay?

312
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,590
But I want you to know that

313
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,590
we're gonna do everything

314
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,590
we can to make this workable

315
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,620
for Alexander.

316
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,620
Surgery?

317
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,450
You're gonna need

318
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,450
to have your hip pinned.

319
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,620
What's the recovery time

320
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,620
for that?

321
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,490
At least a month,

322
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,490
but likely longer.

323
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,860
An orthopedic surgeon

324
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,860
can give you a more

325
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,860
accurate estimate.

326
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,990
I'll page the ortho resident

327
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,990
on call to come down.

328
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,200
Don't, please. I can't go

329
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,200
through a surgery like that.

330
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Who will take care

331
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
of Alexander?

332
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,580
There isn't another

333
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,580
family member who

334
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,580
might be able to help?

335
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,540
No, not since he was a baby.

336
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,670
It's always just been

337
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,670
the two of us.

338
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,580
Right. No friend

339
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,580
that he feels

340
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,580
comfortable with or...

341
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,480
You saw how he was earlier.

342
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,780
Blowups like that happen

343
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,780
at least once a day.

344
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,690
No one I know

345
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,690
would want to

346
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,690
take that on.

347
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,690
Then what we're gonna do

348
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,690
is we're gonna appoint

349
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,690
a short-term guardianship.

350
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,190
Alexander won't listen

351
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,190
to anyone but me. I'm the only

352
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,190
one who can calm him down.

353
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,660
So no surgery.

354
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,930
Grandma?

355
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,860
Look.

356
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,490
Can I have it?

357
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,530
Yes, but not before lunch.

358
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,110
Hi, Sophia.

359
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,110
I'm Dr. Halstead.

360
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,580
Are you her mom?

361
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,580
Her swim coach, Cindy.

362
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,620
Her dad should be

363
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,620
here soon. He lives

364
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,620
a few hours away.

365
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,990
Sophia goes

366
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,990
to St. Joseph Prep

367
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,990
here in the city.

368
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,960
The boarding school, right?

369
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,960
Mmm-hmm.

370
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,150
Okay. So what's

371
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,150
going on, Sophia?

372
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,060
I don't know honestly.

373
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,860
It was the weirdest thing.

374
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,800
Sophia and her teammates

375
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,800
were practicing their

376
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,800
individual medley races,

377
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,870
and right after Sophia

378
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,870
made her last flip turn,

379
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,910
she fell behind

380
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,910
all the others.

381
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,940
Then she stopped

382
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,940
swimming altogether.

383
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,010
I think I felt something

384
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,010
in my chest,

385
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,700
but then I passed out.

386
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,680
Okay if I give

387
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,680
a quick listen?

388
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,710
Oh,

389
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,710
it was terrifying.

390
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,580
I mean, she was just

391
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,580
floating there, face down.

392
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,880
One of the other

393
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,880
coaches helped me get

394
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,880
her out of the pool.

395
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,120
And she was unconscious

396
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,120
at first.

397
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,590
And then after a few seconds,

398
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,590
she came to, thank goodness.

399
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,860
Anything like this

400
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,860
ever happened before?

401
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,160
No, never.

402
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,200
Sophia is

403
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,200
a fantastic swimmer.

404
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,570
I broke the state record

405
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,570
for the 200-meter

406
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,570
breaststroke last year.

407
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,100
Wow, impressive.

408
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,070
All right, let's get

409
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,070
a chest X-ray, CBC,

410
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,070
CMP, EKG, and cardiac labs.

411
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,700
And why don't we get

412
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,700
Sophia a gown?

413
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,870
Hey, is this the hospital

414
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,870
Jack Dayton bought?

415
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,310
It is.

416
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,980
Any chance

417
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,980
I'll get to see him?

418
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,250
You're 16 and you keep up

419
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,250
with Jack Dayton?

420
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,020
When Jack Dayton was 16,

421
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,690
he'd already created the beta

422
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,690
version of what would become

423
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,690
SapphireCash.com.

424
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,820
You know

425
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,820
a lot about him?

426
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,820
Of course.

427
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,920
I'm a dev.

428
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,900
Dev?

429
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,900
Developer.

430
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,670
It's hard not to

431
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,670
look up to somebody

432
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,670
like Jack Dayton.

433
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,140
Unfortunately, I doubt

434
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,140
Jack will make

435
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,140
an appearance today.

436
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,930
He's a pretty

437
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,930
busy guy. Sorry.

438
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,130
But we'll get

439
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,130
these tests and figure out

440
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,130
what's going on.

441
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,300
Sound good?

442
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,300
Mmm-hmm.

443
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,930
Yeah.

444
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,610
I swear,

445
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,240
I would never wish

446
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,240
Crohn's disease

447
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,240
on my worst enemy.

448
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,590
The gastric tube

449
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,590
is definitely clogged.

450
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,750
You called it, Roy.

451
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,260
That's the fourth time

452
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,260
in the last three months.

453
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,930
Yeah. You flushing it out?

454
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,790
I've used warm water,

455
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,060
seltzer, soda,

456
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,230
everything short of Drano.

457
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,740
Okay, well, let's upsize

458
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,740
the tube a little bit.

459
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,670
Come on, Dr. Marcel.

460
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,670
It's a temporary solution.

461
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,240
There's got to be

462
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,240
something better than this

463
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,240
game of musical tubes.

464
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,370
Yeah, look, I get

465
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,370
that you're frustrated, Roy,

466
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,310
but we got to get you

467
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,310
nutrition somehow.

468
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,780
You don't understand.

469
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,750
I can't take this.

470
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,840
I need to eat something.

471
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,990
Look, sadly, that's not

472
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,990
possible anymore

473
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,030
because of your

474
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,030
esophageal strictures.

475
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,890
You won't be able

476
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,890
to get the food down.

477
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,900
What about

478
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,900
my surgical options?

479
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,900
I read online you can remove

480
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,900
and replace my esophagus.

481
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,400
Can we do something

482
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,400
like that?

483
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,190
Well, if I do that,

484
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,190
I'll need to replace it

485
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,100
by reconstructing

486
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,100
a new esophagus

487
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,900
from a part

488
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,900
of your stomach

489
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,900
or intestine.

490
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,980
But it's

491
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,980
a complicated procedure,

492
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,980
especially for you.

493
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,180
Look, you've had a lot

494
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,180
of surgeries over the years,

495
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,010
and all of that

496
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,010
resulting scar tissue

497
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,010
makes it very difficult

498
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,880
to find a piece

499
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,880
of intestine

500
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,880
that can work.

501
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,150
But you could try, right?

502
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,420
Too much can go wrong.

503
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,690
How much worse

504
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,690
can it be than this?

505
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,290
You worried

506
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,290
you might kill me?

507
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,360
I can't stand the idea

508
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,360
of having to keep

509
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,360
living like this.

510
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,800
I'm serious.

511
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,400
I don't know

512
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,400
how much longer

513
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,400
I could go on.

514
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,170
I hear you, Roy.

515
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,210
All right, well...

516
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,900
let me have a think

517
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,900
on it, okay?

518
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,040
Dr. Dupre, morning.

519
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,350
Can you input that for me?

520
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,820
Dr. Marcel, I couldn't

521
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,820
help but overhear

522
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,820
you discussing

523
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,820
what sounded to be

524
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,420
like an Ivor Lewis

525
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,420
operation

526
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,420
on a Crohn's patient

527
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,420
with a hostile abdomen.

528
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,130
Eavesdropping much?

529
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,700
Not intentionally.

530
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,400
Look, I would love

531
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,400
to offer 2.0 services

532
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,400
for the operation.

533
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,940
Thanks, but I told him

534
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,940
we're not gonna go

535
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,940
the surgical route.

536
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,800
Roy's Crohn's disease

537
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,800
and adhesions

538
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,800
from prior surgeries

539
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,280
make him a very high risk

540
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,280
and poor surgical candidate.

541
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,970
I think this is the perfect

542
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,970
case to take advantage

543
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,970
of 2.0's imaging.

544
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,780
If 2.0 is gonna

545
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,780
revolutionize surgery,

546
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
this is exactly

547
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
the kind of case

548
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
it should be used on.

549
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,280
You know, Roy's situation

550
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,280
is very precarious.

551
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,790
I'm not convinced

552
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,790
2.0 can make a difference.

553
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,050
I understand

554
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,050
your reservations,

555
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,720
but don't you think

556
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,720
it's worth exploring?

557
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,100
You must be Sophia's dad.

558
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,470
Glen Eastman.

559
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,470
I'm sorry I'm late.

560
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,340
I live out in Rochelle.

561
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,340
Got here as soon as I could.

562
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,380
I'm glad you made it.

563
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,380
I'm Dr. Halstead.

564
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,910
I have your lab results.

565
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,010
I'll step outside.

566
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,980
No, Coach, please stay.

567
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,780
You're basically

568
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,780
family, Cindy.

569
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,820
She's been a wonderful

570
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,820
influence in Sophia's life

571
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,390
over the past few years,

572
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,390
especially since I live

573
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,390
so far away.

574
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,820
Okay.

575
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,330
Well, the good news is

576
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,330
your labs and EKG

577
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,330
came back normal.

578
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,190
Any idea what did

579
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,190
cause this then?

580
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,170
Not yet, but I'd like to test

581
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,170
Sophia for something called

582
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,170
Brugada syndrome.

583
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,830
It's a very rare disorder

584
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,830
that causes arrhythmias

585
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,340
or irregular heartbeats,

586
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,100
especially if someone

587
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,100
who has it

588
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,770
overexerts themselves

589
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,770
like you did swimming today.

590
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,040
That sounds serious.

591
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,880
In the very worst cases,

592
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,880
it can cause the heart

593
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,880
to stop altogether.

594
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,470
But there are treatments

595
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,470
that will prevent that

596
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,470
from happening.

597
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,880
That's why I'd like

598
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,880
to do another EKG.

599
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,180
But this time, I'd like

600
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,180
to administer a medication

601
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,950
called procainamide

602
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,950
that will trigger

603
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,950
an irregular EKG result

604
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,150
if Sophia does in fact

605
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,150
have Brugada syndrome.

606
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,360
We've got to do it, right?

607
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,460
So we know either way.

608
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,340
All right, I'll have a nurse

609
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,340
get you set up right away.

610
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,830
Brandon's CT.

611
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,210
He's got a grade two

612
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,210
splenic crack

613
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,210
with no blush.

614
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,010
All right. What's your

615
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,010
recommendation?

616
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,280
Track his hemoglobins

617
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,280
over the next 24 hours.

618
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,510
As long as it

619
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,510
remains stable,

620
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,950
I don't see any need

621
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,950
for surgical intervention.

622
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,150
He also passed

623
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,150
a spontaneous

624
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,150
breathing test.

625
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,850
Good. Let's extubate.

626
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,860
Here you go.

627
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,360
Brandon, we're gonna

628
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,360
remove your endotracheal

629
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,360
tube now, okay?

630
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,520
All right, Brandon,

631
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,520
I'm just gonna loosen

632
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,520
the strap.

633
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,030
There you go.

634
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,030
Nice and easy.

635
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,030
Breathe.

636
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,530
Good job.

637
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,240
Is Tiffany okay?

638
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,270
Tiffany?

639
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,380
My wife. Did they bring

640
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,380
her here?

641
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,520
I don't understand.

642
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,520
Was she in the car?

643
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,480
Yes.

644
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,960
She's pregnant.

645
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,030
In labor.

646
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,930
Where is she?

647
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,370
Just spoke to the

648
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,370
local fire department

649
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,370
on the scene.

650
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,970
I'm afraid they didn't

651
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,970
find anyone else there.

652
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,070
What?

653
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,580
No, What are you saying?

654
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,120
Brandon, are you sure

655
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,120
you're not misremembering

656
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,120
what happened?

657
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,050
I'm not making this up.

658
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,050
She was sitting

659
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,050
right next to me.

660
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,060
I can prove it. Just...

661
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,060
Where's my phone?

662
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,350
Okay.

663
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,260
Look, this dot on the map

664
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,260
is her cell phone.

665
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,060
That's right by

666
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,060
Interstate 55.

667
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,900
That's where

668
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,900
I crashed, right?

669
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,470
Okay, I'll go back there

670
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,470
myself if I have to.

671
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,010
Brandon, you're in no shape

672
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,010
to leave the hospital.

673
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,980
We're gonna

674
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,980
get on top of this.

675
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,980
You just sit tight.

676
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,170
Please.

677
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,680
This is what

678
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,680
she looks like.

679
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,450
We'll do everything

680
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,450
we can to find her.

681
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,690
Doris, call the Illinois State

682
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,690
Police and the local

683
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,690
sheriff department.

684
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,090
Tell them we've pinned

685
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,090
a possible location.

686
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,470
I should go out there

687
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,470
to help them.

688
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,590
I have experience

689
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,590
in search and rescue.

690
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,100
Yeah, but there are

691
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,100
other people for that.

692
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,540
Look, back in Colorado,

693
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,540
hikers would go missing

694
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,540
all the time.

695
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,010
We would have a designated

696
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,010
incident commander

697
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,210
and experienced

698
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,210
hasty teams

699
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,210
at the ready

700
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,610
with helicopters and trucks

701
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,610
and commtech.

702
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,480
I'm not sure the local sheriff

703
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,480
has those kind of resources.

704
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,680
Maybe I can make up

705
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,680
for some of that.

706
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,650
Yeah, you're not

707
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,650
a helicopter.

708
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,320
But I do have 63 rescues

709
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,320
under my belt.

710
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,330
For Tiffany and her baby

711
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,330
to have the best chance

712
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,330
of survival,

713
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,950
I need to be out there.

714
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,490
I can bring

715
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,490
the hospital to her.

716
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,630
Dr. Asher.

717
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,260
Hmm?

718
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,600
What's up?

719
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,730
There's a pregnant woman

720
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,730
missing out in the woods

721
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,740
and Dr. Lieu here seems

722
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,740
to be convinced

723
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,570
that he needs to join

724
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,570
the search and rescue.

725
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,480
I want you to go with him.

726
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,140
She's reportedly

727
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,140
in labor, okay?

728
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,620
Sixty-three rescues, huh?

729
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,310
Make Tiffany number 64.

730
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,620
The stomach is just

731
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,620
too fibrotic and scarred

732
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,530
to manipulate

733
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,530
into an esophagus.

734
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,720
How about a colonic

735
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,720
interpositioning?

736
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,360
Can you use his colon?

737
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,370
There's too many strictures

738
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,370
throughout the bowel,

739
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,200
not to mention the extensive

740
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,200
adhesions we can't see

741
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,200
on the scans.

742
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,740
Look, I want this

743
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,740
to work. I do.

744
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,340
I hate that Roy

745
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,340
has to suffer this much,

746
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,350
but I'm not gonna open him up

747
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,350
and risk further damage

748
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,350
to his intestine

749
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,110
without a plan

750
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,110
in place, okay?

751
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,450
Perhaps a better angle

752
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,450
can help.

753
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,490
2.0, show us the digital twin

754
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,490
for patient Roy Tooley.

755
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,060
Loading.

756
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,620
Based on Roy's

757
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,620
charts and scans,

758
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,670
2.0 has created

759
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,670
this twin that is

760
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,670
anatomically identical.

761
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,140
Feel free to poke around

762
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,140
in there.

763
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,530
What do you mean?

764
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,510
I've enabled a function

765
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,510
with 2.0

766
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,510
that allows you to manipulate

767
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,510
the hologram using

768
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,510
the sensory gloves.

769
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,140
Here, try it.

770
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,580
Okay.

771
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,130
Okay.

772
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,560
Here we go.

773
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,400
Area of bowel has previous

774
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,400
intestinal anastomosis.

775
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,700
Neat trick.

776
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,310
But it's just a hologram.

777
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,440
There's no telling how

778
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,440
Roy's body would respond

779
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,310
to any of this

780
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,310
in real life.

781
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,320
2.0 can simulate

782
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,320
the real-life responses

783
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,850
based on an extensive

784
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,850
database of previous

785
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,850
surgical input

786
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,320
while continuously

787
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,320
recalibrating

788
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,620
to incorporate Roy's

789
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,620
personal data as well.

790
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,190
Hmm.

791
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,390
Look, if you're worried

792
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,390
about that little hiccup

793
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,630
where 2.0 questioned

794
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,630
your suturing technique,

795
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,170
it won't happen again.

796
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,170
2.0 is here to assist,

797
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,170
not hinder.

798
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,800
Well, I guess there's no harm

799
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,800
in running a simulation.

800
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,570
Okay, we ready?

801
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,520
Okay, it all looks normal

802
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,520
so far, just like

803
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,520
the first time.

804
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,140
Push the procainamide.

805
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,660
So see the slope

806
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,660
that gradually descends

807
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,660
after each heartbeat?

808
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,700
I don't feel

809
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,700
any different.

810
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,890
You're not supposed to.

811
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,570
The medication

812
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,570
only changes

813
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,570
the EKG reading

814
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,270
if you have

815
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,270
Brugada syndrome.

816
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,810
So does this mean

817
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,810
Sophia has it?

818
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,810
I'm afraid so.

819
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,510
Yeah. A cardiologist will walk

820
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,510
you through it, but, Sophia,

821
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,510
you're going to need

822
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,850
an implantable cardioverter

823
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,850
defibrillator, an ICD.

824
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,320
What's that?

825
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,510
It's a device

826
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,510
that monitors

827
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,510
your heartbeats.

828
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,220
And if you were

829
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,220
to ever have another

830
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,220
heart-stopping arrhythmia,

831
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,220
it will deliver a very

832
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,220
small shock to your heart

833
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,550
to restore

834
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,550
regular rhythm.

835
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,530
It's a procedure

836
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,530
typically done

837
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,530
in a cath lab OR,

838
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,500
but after four to six weeks,

839
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,500
Sophia should be able

840
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,690
to resume

841
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,690
all normal activities,

842
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,690
including swimming.

843
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,290
Wait, you mean

844
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,290
I can't swim

845
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,290
at all until then?

846
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,930
You will need

847
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,930
to take a break.

848
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,730
Um, that's gonna be

849
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,730
a problem for regionals.

850
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,900
If Sophia doesn't compete

851
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,900
in the upcoming meet

852
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,900
in two weeks,

853
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,940
she'll be ineligible

854
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,940
for future events.

855
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,740
That means I won't be able

856
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,740
to compete at state.

857
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,410
Can't we put

858
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,410
this surgery off until later?

859
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,780
That makes me

860
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,780
a little nervous.

861
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,480
I agree. It's best to

862
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,480
take care of this right away.

863
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,560
Okay, we'll do it.

864
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,560
Dad.

865
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,560
Dr. Halstead is saying

866
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,560
your heart could stop beating.

867
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,460
You don't understand, Dad.

868
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,800
You're not around,

869
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,800
and you hardly come

870
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,800
to my meets.

871
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,460
If I don't compete at state,

872
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,460
that screws up my chances

873
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,330
of going out for the Olympics

874
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,330
a year from now.

875
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,840
I'm sorry, honey.

876
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,840
It's just too risky.

877
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,540
There'll be plenty more

878
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,540
opportunities for you

879
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,540
to compete in the future.

880
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,400
Yeah, I will have someone

881
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,400
from cardiology

882
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,400
come speak with you.

883
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,870
Well, thank you very much.

884
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,870
You've been really helpful.

885
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,550
Huh.

886
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,280
So that's the mayor's office

887
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,280
for people with disabilities

888
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,450
with a very

889
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,450
promising referral

890
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,450
for a short-term guardian

891
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,460
who has extensive experience

892
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,460
working with adults

893
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,460
with special needs.

894
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,890
Well, that's good.

895
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,890
Yeah.

896
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,930
Hopefully, Martha

897
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,930
will sign off on it.

898
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,930
We need some help in here.

899
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,400
Alexander!

900
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,940
Help him!

901
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,530
What's going on?

902
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,240
Okay, he's unresponsive,

903
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,240
and he's not breathing.

904
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,610
Oh, God.

905
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,240
His lips

906
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,240
are turning blue.

907
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,490
Pinpoint pupils.

908
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,490
Did he take something?

909
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,610
It looks like

910
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,610
he's overdosed.

911
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,610
Do something, please.

912
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,850
Narcan.

913
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,320
Alexander, are you

914
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,320
all right? You okay?

915
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,270
What happened?

916
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,270
You're okay, baby.

917
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,430
You're okay.

918
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,730
I don't feel good.

919
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,000
You're going to be fine.

920
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,000
Don't worry.

921
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,340
The car crashed

922
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,340
through this fence here.

923
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,540
The car then careened

924
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,540
into the woods

925
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,850
until an oak tree brought it

926
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,850
to a halt right about here.

927
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,390
There was no sign

928
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,390
of a passenger, so we went

929
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,390
ahead and had it towed.

930
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,520
Sheriff, I found these

931
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,520
about 100 yards due east.

932
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,320
Those are Tiffany's.

933
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,760
Brandon had the same picture

934
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,760
on his phone.

935
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,890
Deputy Russell,

936
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,890
this is Dr. Lieu

937
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,890
and Dr. Asher.

938
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,560
They treated the driver

939
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,560
at Chicago Med.

940
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,070
Bring over Brix.

941
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,070
Has Brix helped you out

942
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,070
on other search

943
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,070
and rescues before?

944
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,870
No, but he once found

945
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,870
12 kilos of blow buried

946
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,870
in a local trailer park.

947
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,470
Hopefully,

948
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,470
he'll be able to find

949
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,470
a pregnant woman in the woods.

950
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,670
Sheriff Parker, we'd like to

951
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,670
head out with the first team.

952
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,650
We can provided immediate

953
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,650
medical support.

954
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,740
Works for me.

955
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,620
First team, let's head out.

956
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,620
Let's go.

957
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,050
Let's grab our supplies.

958
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,750
Here?

959
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,800
Vascular pedicle

960
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,800
is too short.

961
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,660
This looks promising.

962
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,930
Left colon just past

963
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,930
the splenic flexure.

964
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,060
Tissue is extremely friable.

965
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,460
Many adhesions. Easy to tear.

966
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,940
Well, it seems 2.0 has already

967
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,940
assessed all my options.

968
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,910
So why don't we

969
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,910
just skip to the part

970
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,380
where it tells me what segment

971
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,380
of the bowel to pull up?

972
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,850
2.0, your recommendation?

973
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,470
Abort esophageal

974
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,470
reconstruction.

975
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,350
You're kidding me.

976
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,350
Place gastric tube

977
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,480
and commit to

978
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,480
liquid enteral nutrition.

979
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,080
Well, Roy's already

980
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,080
been doing all of that,

981
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,620
so what was the point

982
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,620
of any of this?

983
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,710
Hold on.

984
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,350
2.0, what is the prognosis

985
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,730
of an esophageal

986
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,730
reconstruction

987
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,730
with this patient?

988
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,960
48% chance of success.

989
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,690
Forty-eight percent?

990
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,690
Those are decent odds.

991
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,790
Why would 2.0

992
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,790
insist this will fail?

993
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,700
Well, 2.0

994
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,700
has a default setting.

995
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,670
Not to support

996
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,670
any surgical procedure

997
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,110
that has less than

998
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,110
a 50% chance of success.

999
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,570
But I am going to lower

1000
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,570
that threshold.

1001
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,610
You are good to go.

1002
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,110
Okay.

1003
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,910
Here we go.

1004
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,010
Starting from square one, 2.0.

1005
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,920
The left colon

1006
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,920
has the best odds

1007
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,920
of viability.

1008
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,090
Yeah, I see it.

1009
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,090
Looks pretty good.

1010
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,860
Oh.

1011
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,530
Yeah, that section

1012
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,530
looks long enough.

1013
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,130
Seems like it has adequate

1014
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,130
blood flow.

1015
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,740
I think this

1016
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,740
could actually work.

1017
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah.

1018
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,870
Okay, well, let's do

1019
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,870
a couple of practice rounds,

1020
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,880
and then we can bring in

1021
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,880
the real Roy.

1022
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,080
Okay, from the top.

1023
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,080
Let's go.

1024
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,180
Alexander,

1025
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,180
how are you doing?

1026
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,760
Can I see Grandma now?

1027
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,760
Very soon.

1028
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,420
We want to keep you

1029
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,420
on IV fluids,

1030
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,900
that tube that's in your arm,

1031
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,900
just a little while longer.

1032
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,470
Make sure you feel better.

1033
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,590
In the meantime,

1034
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,590
we're hoping you

1035
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,590
can help us

1036
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,730
figure out exactly

1037
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,730
what happened.

1038
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,100
I think I fainted.

1039
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,440
Any idea why that might

1040
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,440
have happened?

1041
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,740
Can you remember eating

1042
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,740
anything different

1043
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,750
than you normally do,

1044
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,750
like anything at all?

1045
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,910
No.

1046
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,990
Think real hard,

1047
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,990
Alexander.

1048
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,890
We're here to help you.

1049
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,580
I know.

1050
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,630
Alexander, are you...

1051
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,850
Are you a candy person?

1052
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,520
Do you like candy?

1053
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,520
Yes.

1054
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,120
I'm just wondering

1055
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,120
if there's any chance

1056
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,000
you could have looked

1057
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,000
in your grandma's purse

1058
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,040
and seen red and blue pills

1059
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,690
and thought that they

1060
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,690
were candy maybe?

1061
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,660
I don't eat anything

1062
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,660
unless Grandma lets me.

1063
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,870
I have to ask.

1064
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,580
Like the soda this morning

1065
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,580
from the vending machine?

1066
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,840
Uh-huh.

1067
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,570
She said I could.

1068
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,570
She opened it for me.

1069
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,020
I guess

1070
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,020
it doesn't matter

1071
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,020
what I think.

1072
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,820
We're very sorry,

1073
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,820
Mr. Eastman.

1074
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,090
What's going on?

1075
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,720
Sophia's refusing to stop

1076
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,720
swimming competitively.

1077
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,160
She's petitioned a judge

1078
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,730
to issue a stay

1079
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,730
on her ICD implantation.

1080
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,960
Well, how is that possible?

1081
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,970
Her father signed off,

1082
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,970
and she's a minor.

1083
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,630
She's filing

1084
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,630
for emancipation.

1085
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,110
What? She's gonna need

1086
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,110
her father's consent, right?

1087
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,580
Well, in most cases, yes.

1088
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,770
But she's been living

1089
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,770
independently

1090
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,910
at her boarding school

1091
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,910
these last few years

1092
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,540
on a swimming scholarship,

1093
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,540
so the court may grant her

1094
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,710
emancipation regardless

1095
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,710
of what her father wants.

1096
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,720
She has a heart disorder,

1097
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,720
and you're telling me

1098
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,720
a judge is, what,

1099
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,990
gonna let her ignore it?

1100
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,790
It's out

1101
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,790
of our hands now.

1102
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,060
We're sorry.

1103
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
Great. Yeah, okay.

1104
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,730
As long

1105
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,730
as we have

1106
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,270
an automated external

1107
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,270
defibrillator on standby,

1108
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,970
you are okay

1109
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,970
to compete.

1110
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,310
That another doctor

1111
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,310
you were talking to there?

1112
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,840
A friend who's in contact

1113
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,840
with the state's

1114
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,840
competitive committee.

1115
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,080
Sophia, you do realize

1116
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,080
the more you exert yourself,

1117
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,880
the higher the chances

1118
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,880
this happens again?

1119
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,550
Which is why we're looking

1120
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,550
into precautionary measures

1121
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,950
that don't

1122
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,950
require surgery.

1123
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,950
There aren't any.

1124
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,920
I've trained

1125
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,920
my whole life

1126
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,920
for this,

1127
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,190
and I'm not about to throw it

1128
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,190
all away just because

1129
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,190
I passed out once.

1130
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,590
Sophia, if another

1131
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,590
arrhythmia occurs,

1132
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,630
you may not get the chance

1133
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,630
to go to the Olympics.

1134
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,960
Dr. Halstead.

1135
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,990
You could die.

1136
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,770
May I have a word?

1137
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,700
Ms. Goodwin,

1138
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,700
she's taking medical advice

1139
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,700
from a swim coach.

1140
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,340
You need to give

1141
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,340
this girl some space.

1142
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,210
I don't like it any more

1143
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,210
than you do,

1144
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,010
but it's time to step away.

1145
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,200
Is Alexander okay?

1146
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,200
He's gonna be.

1147
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,860
But, you know,

1148
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,860
Martha, there was, um,

1149
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,030
a pretty significant amount

1150
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,030
of opiates in his bloodstream.

1151
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,610
And, you know,

1152
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,610
it occurred to me

1153
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,080
that given your stage 4

1154
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,080
cancer pain,

1155
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,140
it would be completely

1156
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,140
understandable if you were

1157
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,140
carrying around, you know,

1158
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,020
just a lot of very strong

1159
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,020
medicine with you

1160
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,020
all the time, right?

1161
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,680
And at first,

1162
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,680
I thought that maybe...

1163
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,950
I don't know,

1164
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,950
maybe Alexander

1165
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,950
was looking in your purse,

1166
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,160
and I don't know,

1167
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,160
he mistook the medicine

1168
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,130
for candy

1169
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,130
or something.

1170
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,000
But then he told me pretty

1171
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,000
explicitly that he never puts

1172
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,000
anything in his mouth

1173
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,700
without your permission.

1174
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,640
So, Martha,

1175
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,640
I have to ask you,

1176
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,640
did you...

1177
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,010
Did you put a bunch of pills

1178
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,010
in his soda this morning?

1179
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,820
I didn't know

1180
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,820
what else to do.

1181
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,120
When I got my diagnosis,

1182
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,950
I thought if I could just

1183
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,950
hold on a little longer,

1184
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,260
maybe when he got

1185
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,260
a bit older,

1186
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,830
he could manage by himself.

1187
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,770
But then I realized

1188
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,770
that was never gonna happen.

1189
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,300
You know, there are other

1190
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,300
options, though.

1191
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,940
Martha...

1192
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,940
I've tried them.

1193
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,350
I put Alexander

1194
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,350
in different

1195
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,350
group homes,

1196
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,780
but he wouldn't eat,

1197
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,050
wouldn't sleep.

1198
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,760
He'd sob and bang

1199
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,760
the ground with his fists

1200
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,760
until they bled.

1201
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,020
Every time,

1202
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,020
it was a disaster.

1203
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,890
So you thought

1204
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,890
that he would...

1205
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,230
He would be

1206
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,230
better off dead?

1207
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,010
I love Alexander more

1208
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,010
than I've loved anybody.

1209
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,170
But after I fell

1210
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,170
this morning, I couldn't

1211
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,170
stop thinking,

1212
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,010
if I can't be there

1213
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,010
for him, who will?

1214
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,040
I'm sorry.

1215
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,790
I'm so sorry.

1216
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,720
It looks like Brix

1217
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,720
wants to cross.

1218
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,790
Let's split up.

1219
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,790
You guys cross.

1220
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,730
Dr. Asher and I

1221
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,730
will stay on this side,

1222
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,730
move downstream.

1223
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,860
Cover more

1224
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,860
ground that way.

1225
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,860
You got it.

1226
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,510
So what was that about?

1227
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,940
Brix has been trained

1228
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,940
to detect drugs

1229
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,940
and contraband.

1230
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:52,140
It's not the same skillset

1231
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:52,140
as searching for

1232
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:52,140
a missing person.

1233
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,480
I'm just not sure

1234
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,480
it makes sense

1235
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,980
for Tiffany to cross

1236
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,980
the stream in her state.

1237
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,390
All right,

1238
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,390
see this twig here?

1239
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,390
Yeah.

1240
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,990
How it's broken

1241
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,990
about waist level?

1242
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,790
You think

1243
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,790
Tiffany did that?

1244
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,530
It's high off the ground.

1245
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,530
Some human did.

1246
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,470
Check this out.

1247
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,040
Huh.

1248
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,870
Looks like fresh

1249
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,870
blood to me.

1250
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,870
Could be Tiffany's.

1251
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,780
Sheriff, this is

1252
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,780
Dr. Lieu.

1253
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,080
We've got blood droplets

1254
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,080
just off the creek

1255
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,850
in grid D5 on the map.

1256
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,360
We're marking

1257
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,360
it off now.

1258
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,550
SHERIFF PARKER ON RADIO:

1259
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,550
Copy that.

1260
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,230
She's close.

1261
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,230
Come on.

1262
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,340
Okay, gonna take

1263
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,340
the left colon just up to

1264
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,340
the middle colic artery.

1265
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,170
Tissue appears viable.

1266
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,170
Adequate blood supply.

1267
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,800
Okay, good.

1268
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,940
I'm gonna resect.

1269
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,940
GIA stapler.

1270
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,210
Thank you.

1271
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,350
Is something wrong?

1272
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,910
Colon looks okay,

1273
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,910
but the small bowel

1274
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,910
looks much better.

1275
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,890
It's got a good

1276
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,890
vascular pedicle.

1277
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,550
Appears more

1278
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,550
freely mobile.

1279
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,420
Might be better

1280
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,420
for the reconstruction.

1281
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,230
Small bowel interposition

1282
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,230
is not recommended.

1283
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,530
Why is that?

1284
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,530
There's no dataset

1285
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,530
to guide you.

1286
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,370
I don't need a data set.

1287
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,370
I just need a viable bowel.

1288
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,840
Okay, but first,

1289
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,840
let's remove

1290
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,840
the esophagus.

1291
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,850
Once you take

1292
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,850
the esophagus out,

1293
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,850
there's no turning back.

1294
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,610
Scalpel, please.

1295
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,580
Mr. Dayton, hi.

1296
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,450
I'm Will Halstead,

1297
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,450
one of the ED docs.

1298
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,220
Sorry. Mr. Dayton's

1299
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,220
on a very tight schedule.

1300
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,030
I understand, but I have

1301
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,030
a patient, a teenager,

1302
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,030
who has a heart condition.

1303
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,330
She needs a procedure,

1304
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,330
and she's refusing

1305
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,460
because it'll get in the way

1306
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,460
of her competitive swimming.

1307
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,630
But I think

1308
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,630
you might be able

1309
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,630
to change her mind.

1310
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,200
Why would she listen to me?

1311
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,500
She's into computers.

1312
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,510
She idolizes you.

1313
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,510
I wouldn't be

1314
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,510
asking otherwise.

1315
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,980
Mr. Dayton, you have to

1316
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,980
be in San Francisco

1317
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,980
by 8:00 p.m.

1318
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,020
I've got a very

1319
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,020
important meeting.

1320
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,020
It can't be rescheduled.

1321
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,280
All I'm asking for

1322
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,280
is a few minutes.

1323
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,080
Convincing Sophia

1324
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,080
to get this procedure,

1325
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,080
it could save her life.

1326
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,880
I appreciate your concern

1327
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,880
for your patient,

1328
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,320
but I really do have

1329
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,320
a plane to catch.

1330
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,950
Why did you even buy

1331
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,950
a hospital if you don't care

1332
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,950
about the patients in it?

1333
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,050
Excuse me?

1334
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,150
You know, when you

1335
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,150
took over Med,

1336
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,990
I hoped it might have

1337
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,990
something to do with

1338
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,990
a desire to help people,

1339
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,090
but clearly, that was

1340
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,090
naive on my part.

1341
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,460
We're nothing to you.

1342
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,130
Just another

1343
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,130
toy to play with.

1344
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,130
Have a safe flight.

1345
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,630
There.

1346
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,000
Tiffany.

1347
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,680
Hey, Tiffany.

1348
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,680
We're doctors.

1349
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,680
We're here to help you.

1350
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,680
What's happening?

1351
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,380
You were in

1352
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,380
a car accident.

1353
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,040
She's cold to the touch.

1354
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,450
We're gonna put a tarp

1355
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,450
under you, okay?

1356
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,350
Here we go.

1357
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,160
Lift up just a little.

1358
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,130
Great job.

1359
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,170
Okay, I'm gonna

1360
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,170
remove your jacket

1361
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,290
so we can put a warming

1362
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,290
blanket on you.

1363
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,300
Sheriff,

1364
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,300
this is Dr. Lieu.

1365
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,970
We've located Tiffany

1366
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,970
in grid C7.

1367
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,980
Track the orange markers,

1368
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,980
and you'll find us.

1369
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,010
SHERIFF PARKER ON RADIO:

1370
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,010
Copy. On our way.

1371
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,680
Tiffany, I'm gonna

1372
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,680
examine you, okay?

1373
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,080
Am I bleeding?

1374
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,080
You're in labor.

1375
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,350
She's disoriented.

1376
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,080
Could be from the head lash

1377
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,080
or from hypothermia.

1378
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,490
Abdomen's hard

1379
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,490
as a rock.

1380
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,150
Most likely

1381
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,150
placenta abruption.

1382
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,420
Baby's not getting enough

1383
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,420
blood or oxygen.

1384
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,620
Heart rate 110,

1385
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,620
BP 90 over 42.

1386
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,320
Hand me

1387
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,320
the fetal doppler.

1388
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,420
Help me.

1389
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,030
It's gonna be okay, Tiffany.

1390
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,030
We're trying, okay?

1391
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,540
Just hang on in there.

1392
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,440
Baby's heart rate

1393
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,440
is down to 80.

1394
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,540
She's completely dilated.

1395
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,420
All right.

1396
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,420
Hang in there, Tiffany.

1397
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,720
Tiffany, we're gonna

1398
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,720
need to deliver

1399
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,720
your baby right now.

1400
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,390
So when I tell you,

1401
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,390
you're gonna push as hard

1402
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,390
as you can, okay?

1403
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,990
Okay.

1404
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,430
May we interrupt?

1405
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,660
You okay, Grandma?

1406
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,290
I will be.

1407
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,600
How about you?

1408
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,140
I feel...

1409
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,730
I'm feeling better now.

1410
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,140
When can we go home?

1411
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,580
Alexander...

1412
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,350
I can't go home.

1413
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,690
You have to.

1414
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,690
You live there.

1415
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,060
I know,

1416
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,060
but I'm very sick.

1417
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,390
I'll help you

1418
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,390
get better.

1419
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,660
Oh, baby,

1420
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,660
I wish you could,

1421
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,260
but I'm the kind

1422
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,260
of sick that never

1423
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,260
gets better.

1424
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,800
Then I'll stay here

1425
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,800
with you.

1426
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,800
You can't.

1427
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,230
Why? Did I do

1428
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,230
something wrong?

1429
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,040
No. No, you didn't do

1430
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,040
anything wrong.

1431
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,510
This wasn't

1432
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,510
your fault at all.

1433
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,210
But I'm not able to care

1434
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,210
for you anymore.

1435
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,580
Alexander, we're gonna

1436
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,580
help you find somebody

1437
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,580
who can, okay?

1438
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,210
You stay out of this.

1439
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,810
Alexander, no.

1440
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,810
Listen to me, please.

1441
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,060
You need to trust

1442
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,060
Dr. Charles.

1443
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,680
He can help you

1444
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,680
in ways that I can't.

1445
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,820
But I want you,

1446
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,820
Grandma.

1447
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,470
Alexander,

1448
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,470
you are so special

1449
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:11,330
and deserve the very best

1450
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:11,330
this world has to offer.

1451
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,460
I just can't give that

1452
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,460
to you anymore.

1453
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,070
Someone else can.

1454
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,810
And I'm going to need you

1455
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,810
to let them.

1456
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,210
Can you do that for me?

1457
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,420
I love you, Grandma.

1458
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,850
Baby, I love you so much.

1459
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,530
I love you

1460
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,530
with all my heart.

1461
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,330
Okay, Tiffany,

1462
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,330
we're gonna go again.

1463
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,330
You ready? Push.

1464
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,560
You got it.

1465
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,200
You're doing

1466
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,200
great, Tiffany.

1467
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,200
Keep pushing.

1468
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,370
You're doing great.

1469
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,370
Come on.

1470
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,170
I can't. I can't.

1471
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,510
Yes, you can.

1472
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,510
You're almost there.

1473
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,580
I promise.

1474
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,580
Here we go again.

1475
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,210
Push.

1476
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,680
Yes.

1477
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,890
It's a girl.

1478
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,420
You got

1479
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,420
a little girl.

1480
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,130
Well, Sophia,

1481
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,130
your discharge

1482
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,130
paperwork is complete.

1483
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,730
You're free to go.

1484
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,170
Sorry.

1485
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,610
Hope this is

1486
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,610
the right room.

1487
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,680
You're Jack Dayton.

1488
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,210
You must be Sophia.

1489
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,840
Dr. Halstead here tells me

1490
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,840
you're quite the swimmer.

1491
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,440
She is.

1492
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,440
She is also

1493
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,440
a fan of yours.

1494
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,210
Well, that's very kind

1495
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,210
of you.

1496
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,520
You know, one of the perks

1497
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,520
of owning my own hospital

1498
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,320
is getting to know

1499
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,320
the patients.

1500
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,160
So I thought I'd come by

1501
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,160
and say hello.

1502
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,620
Hi.

1503
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,760
Now you love swimming,

1504
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,760
but I also hear

1505
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,270
that you have an interest

1506
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,270
in computers, right?

1507
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,530
Tell me about that.

1508
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,400
Well, I'll leave you

1509
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,400
all to talk.

1510
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,270
What are you developing?

1511
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,280
All right.

1512
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,280
We'll take it from here.

1513
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,310
Thank you.

1514
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,790
Nice work out there.

1515
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,360
Looks like Alexander

1516
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,360
and his guardian are off

1517
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,360
to a good start.

1518
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,630
Yeah, well,

1519
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,210
thank God

1520
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,210
for that anyway.

1521
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,740
Yeah.

1522
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,940
I really do appreciate

1523
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,940
you stepping in,

1524
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,940
Mr. Dayton.

1525
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,800
She's a smart girl,

1526
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,800
Sophia.

1527
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,210
Glad she changed her mind

1528
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,210
about having the procedure.

1529
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,380
Yeah, curious.

1530
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,810
What did you say

1531
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,810
to get through to her?

1532
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,810
Oh.

1533
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,820
Well, it turns out

1534
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,820
we have a lot in common.

1535
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,330
I told her how I used to be

1536
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,330
a bit of an athlete myself.

1537
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,330
Basketball was my thing.

1538
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,330
But I also loved computers.

1539
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,960
So when I messed up

1540
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,960
my back, couldn't play

1541
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,960
for a little bit,

1542
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,240
I still had this

1543
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,240
other passion. And, well,

1544
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,240
it worked out well for me.

1545
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,270
I think it gave her

1546
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,270
a whole new perspective.

1547
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,270
Okay, look, about

1548
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,270
what I said earlier...

1549
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,500
No one ever talks

1550
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,500
to me like that.

1551
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,880
I'd like to apologize.

1552
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,880
Save it.

1553
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,370
I can respect

1554
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,370
a straight shooter,

1555
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,010
especially one

1556
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,010
so committed

1557
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,010
to his patients.

1558
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,410
Glad to know I have you

1559
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,410
on my team, Dr. Halstead.

1560
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,250
Now if you'll excuse me,

1561
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,250
I have a plane to catch.

1562
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,330
You know, if this week's

1563
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,330
contrast study goes well

1564
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,360
and shows

1565
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,360
there are no leaks,

1566
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,810
Roy will get to taste

1567
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,810
food for the first time

1568
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,810
in three months.

1569
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,640
Man, he is gonna

1570
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,640
be thrilled.

1571
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,980
He has you to thank

1572
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,980
for that.

1573
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,680
No.

1574
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,410
I had already given up

1575
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,410
on this surgery.

1576
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,620
If it hadn't been

1577
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,620
for you insisting on 2.0,

1578
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,590
I don't think

1579
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,590
we'd be here

1580
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,590
right now.

1581
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,390
The AI is not perfect yet,

1582
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,390
but it's evolving.

1583
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,730
I hope I am too.

1584
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,930
That's a beautiful family.

1585
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,990
Yeah.

1586
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,060
They're so lucky

1587
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,060
they found their way

1588
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,060
back to each other.

1589
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,070
Maggie.

1590
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,680
I mean,

1591
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,680
first Vanessa left.

1592
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,840
Now Ben is gone.

1593
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,350
Oh, boy.

1594
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,430
That zrazy is spectacular.

1595
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,050
Granny knew

1596
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,050
what the heck

1597
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,050
she was doing.

1598
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,650
She did.

1599
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,860
I'm so glad

1600
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,860
you enjoyed it.

1601
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,690
Listen, Liliana,

1602
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,690
I just want to apologize

1603
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,070
if I've been

1604
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,070
a little bit

1605
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,070
glum tonight.

1606
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,070
I had a brutal day,

1607
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,070
and I happened...

1608
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,540
You help people

1609
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,540
with their problems

1610
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,540
all day long.

1611
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,040
Once in a while,

1612
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,010
one or two of these

1613
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,010
problems will follow

1614
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,010
you home.

1615
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,780
Yeah.

1616
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,050
Ah, you are my guest.

1617
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,490
You sit.

1618
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,990
Okay. Thank you.
