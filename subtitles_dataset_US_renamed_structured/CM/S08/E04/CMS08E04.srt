1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,470
Dr. Halstead, the pharmacy

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,470
won't release the medication.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,560
I've got an idea.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,140
There's

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,140
a region-wide shortage.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,210
I can't have it

7
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,210
turning into the Wild West.

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,410
I think we're already there.

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,670
I'm a recovering addict.

10
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,080
I need to earn my reputation

11
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,080
back with everyone.

12
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,550
But with you,

13
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,550
it doesn't feel like

14
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,550
that's ever gonna happen.

15
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,620
You suffered a stroke.

16
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,720
If I can't operate again,

17
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,720
what does it matter?

18
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,430
If it had been me

19
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,430
on the table,

20
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,260
I'm pretty sure you would've

21
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,260
done the same thing.

22
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,390
Hey. Sorry I'm late, Dean.

23
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,160
I don't know what was going on

24
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,160
with traffic today.

25
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,460
I got caught up

26
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,460
in it too. You know,

27
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,440
you can blame the HyperTrain

28
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,440
unveiling for that one.

29
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,010
It shut down the Red Line.

30
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,010
A lot more people on the road.

31
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,040
HyperTrain?

32
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,040
Yeah.

33
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,170
You know,

34
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,170
Jack Dayton's

35
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,170
new toy.

36
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,370
Oh, yeah.

37
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,240
Jack Dayton. Right,

38
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,240
Mr. Megabucks.

39
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,680
Yeah.

40
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,680
Yeah, sure, genius.

41
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,480
That HyperTrain is supposed

42
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,480
to revolutionize public

43
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,480
transportation

44
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,610
by moving twice

45
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,610
the speed of the L.

46
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Meanwhile, it takes us

47
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,720
schmucks in cars twice

48
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,720
as long to get to work.

49
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,660
How come Blake's

50
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,660
locker is empty?

51
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,230
You hadn't heard?

52
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,230
Blake tendered

53
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,230
her resignation.

54
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,130
She's taking a job

55
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,130
at Brigham and Women's.

56
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,290
Boston?

57
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,290
Uh-huh.

58
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,740
Guess she's good enough

59
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,740
to perform surgery again.

60
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,430
When did all this happen?

61
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,430
I don't know.

62
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,370
I got an email

63
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,370
about it last night.

64
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,170
When is she leaving?

65
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,170
She can't leave.

66
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,170
I need to talk to her.

67
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,080
You probably

68
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,080
blame yourself, huh?

69
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,240
No answer?

70
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,490
Voicemail.

71
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,490
All right. I got to go talk

72
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,490
to her. I'll be back

73
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,490
in an hour, okay?

74
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,790
All right.

75
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,790
Just don't make it

76
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,790
any more than that.

77
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,660
Hey, Candace.

78
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,660
I'm Dr. Asher.

79
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Hi.

80
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
All right.

81
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,230
Well, it says in here

82
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,230
that you are at 28 weeks.

83
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,330
So how's

84
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,330
your pregnancy been?

85
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,100
You know,

86
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,100
it was going great, um,

87
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,170
but my lower back started

88
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,170
hurting about a week ago,

89
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,170
this, uh, this sharp pain.

90
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,610
And it's only gotten worse.

91
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,610
And I called my OB

92
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,610
this morning.

93
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,340
And she told me

94
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,340
to come here right away.

95
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,080
Okay. Have you had

96
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,080
any abdominal pains,

97
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,080
any cramping?

98
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,410
No. No, just my back.

99
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,820
Okay, CBC, CMP,

100
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,820
and urine cultures, please.

101
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,820
You okay?

102
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,820
No, no, no.

103
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,190
It's good. She's, um...

104
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,190
She's kicking.

105
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,860
I'm sorry. I've had

106
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,860
three miscarriages

107
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,860
over the last six years.

108
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,730
And I'm alone right now

109
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,730
with my husband

110
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,730
away on business,

111
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,330
so I'm kind of on edge.

112
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,240
Well, that's totally

113
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,240
understandable.

114
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,540
Let's get your feet up here,

115
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,540
get you comfy.

116
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,440
We'll put you on

117
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,440
a fetal heart rate monitor

118
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,880
just to make sure

119
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,880
that that baby is

120
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,880
happy and healthy.

121
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,650
All right?

122
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,650
I'll be right back.

123
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,120
Thank you.

124
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,480
Maggie, you're back.

125
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,480
Hey.

126
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,180
Yeah.

127
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,180
How was your honeymoon?

128
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,650
It was Paris, right?

129
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,650
Mmm-hmm.

130
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,560
Mmm. Nice.

131
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,560
Oh.

132
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,830
Wait. Paris sounds

133
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,830
so great.

134
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,300
I've never been

135
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,300
anywhere.

136
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,330
I have a passport.

137
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,330
I've just never used it.

138
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,530
It'll happen.

139
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,630
Thank you.

140
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,340
Dr. Asher.

141
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,140
Just a reminder,

142
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,140
you still need to submit

143
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,140
your urine sample

144
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,470
for your weekly

145
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,470
drug test.

146
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,310
Right. Of course.

147
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,180
I've been doing it

148
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,180
the last six months now.

149
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,380
How could I forget?

150
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,390
Okay, then.

151
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,830
Nope. No pedestrian

152
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,830
access here.

153
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,730
Oh, come on, man.

154
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,730
My friend's building

155
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,730
is up on Ontario.

156
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,560
Sorry, the barricade

157
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,560
is here for a reason.

158
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,640
Jack Dayton,

159
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,640
he's showing off his new

160
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,640
HyperTrain down there.

161
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,180
What happened?

162
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,680
The train jumped the tracks!

163
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,280
Hey, come on!

164
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,280
Come on!

165
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,620
Are there more

166
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,620
people down there?

167
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,750
Come on, come on.

168
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,750
Let's go, let's go.

169
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,290
Go. Come on.

170
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,790
Hello?

171
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,790
Is anybody in there?

172
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,890
Help!

173
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,670
Hello?

174
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,400
Over here!

175
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,920
Hello?

176
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,890
Help us, please!

177
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,890
Help us!

178
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,690
Hold on! I'm coming!

179
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,660
Over here!

180
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,830
Hey!

181
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,810
Oh, thank God.

182
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,740
I tried 911, but there's

183
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,740
no service down here,

184
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,740
of course.

185
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,750
I'm Jack Dayton.

186
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,750
Yeah, I know.

187
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,310
Are you hurt?

188
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,310
I can't tell.

189
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,250
My leg's stuck.

190
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,510
Easy, easy, easy.

191
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,420
All right. Here we go.

192
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,420
One, two, three.

193
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,920
Come here. Your left knee.

194
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,920
Here, sit down. Let me

195
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,920
take a look at that knee.

196
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,470
It can wait.

197
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,470
I'm a doctor.

198
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,700
Over there in the conductor's

199
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,700
compartment. His name is

200
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,700
Nathaniel. He works for me.

201
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
He was driving the train.

202
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Come on.

203
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,600
Nathaniel,

204
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,600
can you hear me, bud?

205
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,270
Keep your weight off

206
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,270
that left knee.

207
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,500
Hey, buddy.

208
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,500
Can you hear me?

209
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,810
There you go.

210
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,640
All right. I think

211
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,640
we can pull him out.

212
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,550
I can't...

213
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,550
I can't breathe.

214
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,020
Looks like the lithium ion

215
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,020
battery got dislodged,

216
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,020
hit him in the chest.

217
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,520
Okay. All right.

218
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,520
Here we go.

219
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,720
All right, I want you

220
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,720
to, uh... I want you

221
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,720
to grab him by his ankles.

222
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,770
Nathaniel, I'm gonna bring you

223
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,770
up a little bit, okay?

224
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,770
Okay.

225
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,590
Keep going. Right here.

226
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,070
Yeah.

227
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,070
Right here.

228
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,470
Okay, okay.

229
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,310
It's gonna be all right.

230
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,940
I got you, buddy.

231
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,940
I got you.

232
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,570
There you go.

233
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,010
Okay, look at me.

234
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,420
Nathaniel, you have

235
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,420
a flailed chest

236
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,650
and likely

237
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,650
a hemopneumothorax, okay?

238
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,820
What does that mean?

239
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,450
He broke several ribs

240
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,450
on both sides,

241
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,990
which is now causing

242
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,990
a free-floating segment.

243
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,090
His lung is likely collapsed,

244
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,990
and his chest is filled

245
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,990
with blood and air.

246
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,070
Let's get him

247
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,070
out of here.

248
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,070
No, no, no, no.

249
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,740
Sounds like the tunnel

250
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,740
is still coming down

251
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,740
around us.

252
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,900
Yeah, then we better

253
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,900
move quick.

254
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,070
Come on.

255
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,070
No, no, no.

256
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,850
If we try to move him,

257
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,850
we could make it worse.

258
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,010
All right, then.

259
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,010
I'll go get

260
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,010
some help.

261
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,610
No, it's too dangerous

262
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,610
the way I came in.

263
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,480
All right?

264
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,480
So what do we do?

265
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,920
We wait until CFD

266
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,920
comes to get us out.

267
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,620
It's the safest option,

268
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,620
all right?

269
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,760
I need to get control

270
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,760
of this bleed.

271
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,770
I need to create a pressure

272
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,770
dressing for this wound.

273
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,770
Give me your tie.

274
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,500
Hang in there

275
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,500
for me, Nathaniel.

276
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,100
And you're gonna feel

277
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,100
some pressure, okay?

278
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,500
Okay.

279
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,910
Morning, Dr. Taylor.

280
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,070
Hey.

281
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,880
Rose, Emmanuel,

282
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,880
this is Dr. Halstead.

283
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,780
Hi. Sorry to hear

284
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,780
you're feeling

285
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,780
poorly, Rose.

286
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,620
Dr. Taylor thought

287
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,620
I might be able to help.

288
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,020
The more, the merrier.

289
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,020
I'm well-accustomed

290
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,020
to doctors.

291
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,760
My wife has

292
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,760
type 1 diabetes

293
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,760
and hypertension.

294
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,060
But Rose is here today

295
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,060
because of a chronic UTI.

296
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,830
Her internist prescribed

297
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,830
her several rounds

298
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,830
of antibiotics,

299
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,870
but none of them

300
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,870
have done anything.

301
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,030
So I sent

302
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,030
a urine test

303
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,030
with cultures.

304
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,130
Mmm-hmm.

305
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,100
Multi-resistant

306
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,100
fungal infection.

307
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,040
"Fungal" is such

308
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,040
an unpleasant

309
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,040
word, isn't it?

310
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,010
A lot of

311
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,010
medical words are.

312
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,910
Phlegm, discharge.

313
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,150
Rose taught

314
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,150
11th grade English

315
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,150
composition for 32 years.

316
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,580
Words are her thing.

317
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,420
Some are just

318
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,420
naturally embarrassing,

319
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,420
like having a fungus.

320
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,930
Well, no need to be

321
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,930
embarrassed here, Rose.

322
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,160
It says it's sensitive

323
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,160
to voriconazole

324
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,160
and amphotericin only.

325
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,160
So voriconazole.

326
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,160
200 milligrams. IV.

327
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,030
Um, I had the same thought,

328
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,030
but there's a problem.

329
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,860
It's on the shortage list.

330
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,860
For three weeks now.

331
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,500
What about this

332
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,500
other medication?

333
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,770
Let us talk it over.

334
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,770
We'll be right back.

335
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,740
Amphotericin B

336
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,740
is old-school.

337
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,710
They call it amphoterrible.

338
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,710
I know.

339
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,650
And Rose's kidneys

340
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,650
are already compromised

341
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,650
because of her diabetes.

342
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,910
Her creatinine

343
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,910
is 2.8 to start.

344
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,480
Ampho will knock them out

345
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,480
and put her in dialysis,

346
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,480
or worse, kill her.

347
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,080
It has to be voriconazole.

348
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,060
Let's start calling around

349
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,060
hospitals, pharmacies,

350
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,860
see if they have any.

351
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,860
No, I already did.

352
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,450
Everyone I talked to

353
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,450
in Chicago was out.

354
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,730
I'm not sure what the next

355
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,730
move is, which is why

356
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,730
I dragged you into this.

357
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,800
I mean, what do you do

358
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,800
if you can't get the only drug

359
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,800
that'll treat an infection?

360
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,630
The pain is localized

361
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,630
to her back.

362
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,610
It says here

363
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,610
her UA is dirty.

364
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,980
Yeah, that's not normal

365
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,980
for a urine dip,

366
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,050
but it also doesn't

367
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,050
scream infection either.

368
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,050
Mmm-hmm.

369
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,050
I checked the shortage list,

370
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,050
and I know that the contrast

371
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,050
dye supply is low.

372
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,780
It's currently restricted.

373
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,780
Yes.

374
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,690
But protocol also states that

375
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,690
if a patient needs a CT...

376
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,620
Okay, did you

377
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,620
ultrasound her

378
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,620
for a kidney stone?

379
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,750
No.

380
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,750
Why don't you?

381
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,890
Kidney stones usually present

382
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,890
in pregnant women

383
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,490
with peritonitis

384
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,490
or flank pain.

385
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,490
Right.

386
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,860
Candace only has

387
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,860
low back pain.

388
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,730
Sure. You can still

389
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,730
ultrasound her to check.

390
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,770
I could,

391
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,770
but as we both know,

392
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,810
ultrasound is not

393
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,810
very sensitive

394
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,810
for a stone.

395
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,270
A CT would give me

396
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,270
a much better picture

397
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,910
of what's actually

398
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,910
going on.

399
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,910
Okay.

400
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,810
So if the ultrasound doesn't

401
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,810
show anything conclusive,

402
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,540
you'll order the CT, yeah?

403
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,610
I'll do an ultrasound then.

404
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,610
Right.

405
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,190
And you might want

406
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,190
to start her on empiric

407
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,190
antibiotics too.

408
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,690
In case it's pyelonephritis,

409
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,690
you should get ahead of that.

410
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,090
I mean, like, it's perfectly

411
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,090
natural for a teenager

412
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,090
to want distance from...

413
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,030
from their parents, right?

414
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,030
But I don't know.

415
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,800
Recently, it just seems like

416
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,800
she doesn't want anything

417
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,310
to do with me

418
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,310
at all anymore.

419
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,540
That may only be temporary.

420
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,770
And it's healthy for

421
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,770
your daughter to seek out

422
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,770
this kind of independence.

423
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,900
You think that I,

424
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,900
of all people,

425
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,900
wouldn't know that?

426
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,080
But I don't know, man.

427
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,080
It's been a...

428
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,250
surprisingly difficult pill

429
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,250
to swallow, you know?

430
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,950
And that kind of dovetails

431
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,950
with this other issue

432
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,220
that I'm having

433
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,220
at work, right,

434
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,130
involving being there for

435
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,130
patients in difficult times.

436
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,790
I mean, I'm used to living

437
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,790
in those uncomfortable

438
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,790
moments, right?

439
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,920
I mean, it's what we do.

440
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,020
You know what

441
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,020
I'm talking about.

442
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,800
You've been doing

443
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,800
this a long time.

444
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,800
Mmm-hmm.

445
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,170
But recently, when, say,

446
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,230
I have to give

447
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,230
a patient, like, a really

448
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,230
tough diagnosis, right,

449
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,800
like, tell them

450
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,800
or the people

451
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,800
that they love

452
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,640
that they have

453
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,640
a lifelong mental illness...

454
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,220
Their lives are over.

455
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,750
Yeah.

456
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,190
And I've just been...

457
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,190
I've been haunted

458
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,760
by these moments, right?

459
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,760
They stick with me.

460
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,660
It's like sometimes

461
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,660
they stare back at me.

462
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,660
Sometimes they cry.

463
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,350
Sometimes they don't know

464
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,350
what to do, nor should they.

465
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,100
But you know what?

466
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,100
Maybe I should.

467
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,190
Dr. Greenwell?

468
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,860
Please, go on.

469
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,160
Are you all right?

470
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,140
My chest.

471
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,710
I think...

472
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,710
I think I might be

473
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,710
having a heart attack.

474
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,770
Dr. Greenwell! Otis!

475
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,210
Dr. Greenwell?

476
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,980
Dr. Greenwell?

477
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,750
What do we got?

478
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,750
Otis Greenwell,

479
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,750
52 years old.

480
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,350
Collapsed into

481
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,350
a glass coffee table.

482
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,350
EKG was normal.

483
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,860
Multiple lacerations

484
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,860
to the forearm.

485
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,990
We applied pressure

486
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,990
dressings en route

487
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,990
and gave him an aspirin.

488
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,120
He was having chest pains.

489
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,720
Make sure he gets

490
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,720
a complete cardiac workup.

491
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,890
Will do, Dr. Charles.

492
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,100
I'll be right out here,

493
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,100
Dr. Greenwell, okay?

494
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,190
He's a doctor?

495
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,900
Yeah. My therapist,

496
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,900
in fact. So take

497
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,900
good care of him, okay?

498
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,110
Pulse is weak.

499
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,080
He's likely in hemorrhagic

500
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,080
shock from all the blood loss.

501
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,080
Please,

502
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,080
am I going to die?

503
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,210
I'm gonna do everything

504
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,210
in my power to make sure

505
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,210
that doesn't happen, okay?

506
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,380
All right.

507
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,790
Anyone there?

508
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,790
Anyone in there?

509
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,790
Yeah, yeah! Hey, help us!

510
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,420
Hey, Severide?

511
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,390
Severide, is that you?

512
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,100
It's Crockett!

513
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,660
Crockett? Hey, what's

514
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,660
going on in there?

515
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,660
What's the situation?

516
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,430
There's three of us in here!

517
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,210
Two of us are okay,

518
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,210
but the train's conductor,

519
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,740
he's badly hurt.

520
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,940
He's pretty shocky.

521
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,410
This passageway is too narrow.

522
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,940
We'll try and widen it

523
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,940
and get a backboard through.

524
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,780
It might take a while.

525
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,780
No.

526
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,050
No, listen to me.

527
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,050
We can't wait.

528
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,020
I need you to get me

529
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,020
some supplies off the ambo,

530
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,280
and I need you to call Med.

531
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,090
I need them to

532
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,090
send some things

533
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,090
you don't have.

534
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,320
Copy that!

535
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,860
Just hold tight, Crockett!

536
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,830
Nathaniel doesn't

537
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,830
have that long.

538
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,990
If we're gonna save him,

539
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,990
we got to do it right here,

540
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,990
right now.

541
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,870
People, I don't have many

542
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,870
details, but Crockett

543
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,870
is down in the tunnel

544
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,810
trying to help those

545
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,810
who are injured.

546
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,040
I do know that he is

547
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,040
in touch with CFD

548
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,140
and appears to be

549
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,140
safe at this time.

550
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,250
And I'll update you as soon

551
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,250
as I hear anything more.

552
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,760
Thank you.

553
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,730
Jeez.

554
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,730
I hope he's okay.

555
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,730
Yeah. Come on.

556
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,770
Ms. Goodwin,

557
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,770
we were just

558
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,770
coming to find you.

559
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,210
Do you have a second?

560
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,210
Sure.

561
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,070
My patient, Rose Fremont,

562
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,170
has a serious

563
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,170
fungal infection

564
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,170
that needs treating.

565
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,270
And the only drug

566
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,270
that can help her,

567
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,410
voriconazole,

568
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,410
is unavailable

569
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,410
all throughout Chicago.

570
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,250
Well, could be just another

571
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,250
region-wide shortage.

572
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,190
I'll reach out

573
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,190
to our suppliers

574
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,190
out of state.

575
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,160
The Army, Navy,

576
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,160
and National Guard

577
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,160
might be resources as well.

578
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,260
Just do what you can

579
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,260
for her in the meantime.

580
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,270
Okay. She's gonna

581
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,270
need pressors to keep

582
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,270
her blood pressure up.

583
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,770
Speaking of the army,

584
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,770
I heard about

585
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,770
your brother.

586
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,970
Yeah, Jay needed a change.

587
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
I think it'll be

588
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
good for him.

589
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,510
Well, I know

590
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,510
you two are close.

591
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,510
I'll make those calls.

592
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,450
Adia, talk to me.

593
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,550
Trey Bruso, 22. BP 138/80.

594
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,330
Heart rate, 104.

595
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,330
Fell off a ladder

596
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,330
while painting a house.

597
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,120
I hate hospitals.

598
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,220
Okay, we won't take that

599
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,220
personally, but we'll still

600
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,220
try to get you back up

601
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,860
on that ladder soon,

602
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,860
all right?

603
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,990
Okay, everyone.

604
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,990
Let's get ready

605
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,990
for a transfer.

606
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,100
Okay, ready?

607
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,970
One, two, three.

608
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,450
No breath sounds

609
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,450
on the right side.

610
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,450
We need an X-ray!

611
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,070
I want out of here!

612
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,170
The faster we

613
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,170
can get this done,

614
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,510
the faster you can

615
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,510
leave, Trey, all right?

616
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,950
Just relax. Relax.

617
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,280
Stand back.

618
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,920
40% pneumothorax

619
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,920
to the right chest.

620
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,460
Let's get a chest tube.

621
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,460
28 French.

622
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,160
Sorry, Ethan.

623
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,160
There's a problem.

624
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,060
I sent the last Pleur-evac

625
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,060
out to the tunnel collapse.

626
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,160
Crockett requested it.

627
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,030
This is ridiculous.

628
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,030
Relax, Kai.

629
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,830
Dr. Marcel shouldn't be

630
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,830
putting a chest tube

631
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,270
in someone under those

632
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,270
conditions anyway.

633
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,100
It's not

634
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,100
a sterile environment.

635
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,100
Oh, really?

636
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,840
You think I should have

637
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,840
sent him a note

638
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,840
explaining that?

639
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,240
So now our patient

640
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,240
needs a chest tube,

641
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,140
and we can't connect it

642
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,140
to a drainage system.

643
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,550
How is that supposed to work?

644
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,310
The Helmand Province.

645
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,310
Remember?

646
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,010
Yeah. I'll hit up

647
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,010
central supply.

648
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,560
Yeah, you want help?

649
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,560
No, I'm good.

650
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,020
It's like riding a bike.

651
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,590
One of you guys want to tell

652
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,590
me what you're talking about?

653
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,990
Pay attention, Kai.

654
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,990
You might learn something.

655
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,260
Mind if I join you?

656
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,860
Candace,

657
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,860
this is Dr. Archer,

658
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,860
Chief of the ED.

659
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,170
He's been consulting

660
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,170
on your case.

661
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,240
How you doing, Candace?

662
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,240
My back really hurts.

663
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,140
Well, hopefully, that won't be

664
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,140
the case much longer,

665
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,140
so bear with us.

666
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,640
Was I right about

667
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,640
the kidney stones?

668
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,970
I'm not seeing any stone,

669
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,970
but I am seeing

670
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,970
some hydronephrosis

671
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,020
on her left kidney.

672
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,020
Ah.

673
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,110
What does that mean?

674
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,160
Your kidney is not

675
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,160
draining effectively,

676
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,160
so it's a little swollen.

677
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm concerned that it might be

678
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,560
infected, so it's a good thing

679
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,560
that Dr. Asher here

680
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,490
has already started you

681
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,490
on antibiotics.

682
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,890
Will it hurt the baby?

683
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,660
The sooner we get

684
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,660
ahead of it, the better.

685
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,520
Give her four of morphine

686
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,520
for the pain and call urology.

687
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,500
Excuse us, Candace.

688
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,000
We don't know for certain

689
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,000
that it's a kidney infection.

690
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,600
If it walks like a kidney

691
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,600
infection and talks like

692
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,600
a kidney infection...

693
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,180
Hydronephrosis is not

694
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,180
uncommon in pregnant women.

695
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,220
When a uterus gets

696
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,220
enlarged, it can cause

697
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,220
urine to back up

698
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,050
and dilate the kidneys.

699
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,050
It doesn't confirm

700
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,050
an infection.

701
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,050
I appreciate your

702
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,050
determination to get

703
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,050
a definitive diagnosis,

704
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,920
but you are

705
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,920
overthinking this one.

706
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,180
You know, I just

707
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,180
have this feeling

708
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,590
that I'm never gonna

709
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,590
pass some test of yours.

710
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,960
Oh, God.

711
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,960
All right.

712
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,000
Look, I'm getting squeezed

713
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,000
by a lot of shortages,

714
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,000
including contrast dye.

715
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,040
And if the antibiotics

716
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,040
don't work and if her

717
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,040
back pain gets worse,

718
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,300
then you can

719
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,300
send her for a CT.

720
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,640
I removed the shards,

721
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,640
redressed his wounds.

722
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,210
Did you get

723
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,210
his labs back yet?

724
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,550
Yeah, he's not having

725
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,550
an MI.

726
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,280
Though his heart rate was

727
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,280
elevated when he came in,

728
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,010
there's no sign

729
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,010
of a cardiac

730
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,010
event at all.

731
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,020
I mean, he's in

732
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,020
good health, but he said

733
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,020
he's not sleeping.

734
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,460
Huh. Um, shoot me

735
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,460
his chart.

736
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,580
Yeah.

737
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,700
Well, this is awkward.

738
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,370
Oh, come on.

739
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,170
We're both doctors, Otis.

740
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,170
Stuff happens, right?

741
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,440
But let's face it, Dan.

742
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,440
I'm supposed to be

743
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,440
taking care of you.

744
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,100
Well, you're gonna

745
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,100
have plenty of opportunity

746
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,100
to do that, all right?

747
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,240
What do, uh...

748
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,240
What do you think happened?

749
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,510
I don't know. I just...

750
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,510
I must have passed out.

751
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,580
Happen before?

752
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,580
No.

753
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,350
Dr. Hudgins said that you were

754
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,350
having a hard time sleeping.

755
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,720
Yeah. I haven't been

756
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,720
sleeping much recently, no.

757
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,620
What would you say

758
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,620
to the idea

759
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,530
that maybe what you had

760
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,530
was a little panic attack?

761
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,130
Well, let's say that

762
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,130
it was a panic attack.

763
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,000
I guess maybe it could

764
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,000
have been the result

765
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,000
of a buildup of stressors.

766
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,240
All right. All right.

767
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,240
I'm wondering what

768
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,240
those might be.

769
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,680
I mean, when it

770
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,680
happened, I was talking

771
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,680
about the difficulty

772
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,250
that I've been having

773
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,180
giving bad news

774
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,180
to patients.

775
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,680
Does that sound right?

776
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,480
I actually don't remember.

777
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,790
Look, I really

778
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,790
just want to go

779
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,790
home, okay?

780
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,120
Okay.

781
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,590
Except your heart rate

782
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,590
is going back up.

783
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,490
I'm...

784
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,490
I'm sure it'll be fine.

785
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,570
Yeah, yeah.

786
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,570
You're all right.

787
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,470
It's not a heart attack,

788
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,470
okay? Just breathe.

789
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,660
Okay.

790
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,710
The pain, it's back!

791
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,570
Five of Valium, please.

792
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,610
Look at me. Look at me.

793
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,810
In through the nose,

794
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,810
out through the mouth.

795
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,380
In through the nose.

796
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,120
Okay, secure!

797
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,290
Okay, first bag coming to ya!

798
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,090
All right!

799
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,470
Okay, got it!

800
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,250
Okay, looks good.

801
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,720
Put that over there

802
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,720
by Nathaniel.

803
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,480
Okay, will do.

804
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,580
Okay,

805
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,580
send the next one!

806
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,750
All right!

807
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,350
Pull!

808
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,600
It's stuck.

809
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,680
It's caught on something.

810
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,300
Pull harder!

811
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,150
Jack, I need you.

812
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,150
Yeah, coming.

813
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,250
Give me a hand

814
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,250
with this Pleur-evac.

815
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,620
Yeah, got it.

816
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,520
Crockett!

817
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,790
You okay?

818
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,630
I'm stuck.

819
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,500
Oh, no.

820
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,850
Okay, yes. Thank you

821
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,850
for letting me know.

822
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,280
That was CFD. There's been

823
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,280
a secondary collapse

824
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,280
in the subway tunnel.

825
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,450
They lost contact

826
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,450
with Dr. Marcel.

827
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,860
Do they know if he's okay?

828
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,450
It's unclear.

829
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,400
They said they're doing

830
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,400
everything they can

831
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,400
to tunnel him out now.

832
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,390
Okay.

833
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,270
Dr. Asher, we need you.

834
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,700
What happened?

835
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,540
She wasn't complaining

836
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,540
of nausea, and then

837
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,540
she just started vomiting.

838
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,940
Okay, let me see.

839
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,370
101.2.

840
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,450
Is this all from

841
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,450
a kidney infection?

842
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,250
Well, let's get her up

843
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,250
to radiology for a CT.

844
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,580
Thank you.

845
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
I can move my arm freely

846
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
on the other side.

847
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,830
If I could just get the right

848
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,830
angle to pull it out...

849
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,230
Nathaniel?

850
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,730
Nathaniel, can you hear me?

851
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,230
I think he's losing

852
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,230
consciousness.

853
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,240
He's gonna stop

854
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,240
protecting his airway.

855
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,430
Come on. What can I do?

856
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,270
Throw your weight against me.

857
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,270
Square in the back.

858
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,400
Give it everything you got.

859
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,540
What are you talking about?

860
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,200
You hit me just right.

861
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,680
Pop my shoulder

862
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,680
out of its socket.

863
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,940
I think I can

864
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,940
reposition myself

865
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,380
to get the leverage I need

866
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,380
to pull my arm free.

867
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,460
Come on, Nathaniel

868
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,460
doesn't have much longer.

869
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,460
I could break your arm.

870
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,460
Just do it.

871
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,960
Hold on.

872
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,400
Okay.

873
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,840
Ready?

874
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,840
Now.

875
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,940
That did it.

876
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,940
Pull my arm free.

877
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,320
Grab my wrist.

878
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,490
I want you to pull my arm

879
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,490
straight out in front of me.

880
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,590
I need to pop

881
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,590
my shoulder back

882
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,590
in the socket.

883
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,460
Go, go, go, go!

884
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,460
Go, go, go!

885
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,870
I'm good. I'm good.

886
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,870
I'm good.

887
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,530
Crockett,

888
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,530
listen, if we don't

889
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,530
get out of here fast,

890
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,410
this whole wall

891
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,410
and everything above us

892
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,940
could come crashing

893
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,940
down any second.

894
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,910
Nathaniel is the priority.

895
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,640
Come on.

896
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,640
I need your help.

897
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,480
You got

898
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,480
your phone on you?

899
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,480
Yeah.

900
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,920
All right.

901
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,920
I need some light.

902
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,890
All right, Nathaniel.

903
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,860
We're gonna get you

904
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,860
fixed up. Okay, buddy?

905
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,950
I want you to take the blood

906
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,950
out of that red bag.

907
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,730
And there should be

908
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,730
some tape in there.

909
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,770
I want you to

910
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,770
tear me a little piece.

911
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,300
And there's

912
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,300
a needle in that bag.

913
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,630
I want you to pull that out

914
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,630
and get that ready for me.

915
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,930
Got it.

916
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,770
All right, this might

917
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,770
feel a little uncomfortable.

918
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,770
Okay, buddy?

919
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,610
There you go.

920
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,550
I know, I know.

921
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,550
Easy, easy, easy.

922
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,480
He's lost a lot of blood.

923
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,350
We need to get his blood

924
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,350
pressure back up before

925
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,350
we do anything else.

926
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,820
You got that needle prepped?

927
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,910
Yeah.

928
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,560
We got to sedate him,

929
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,560
intubate him.

930
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,330
And then we're gonna

931
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,330
hook him up to that portable

932
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,330
ventilator there, okay?

933
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,560
Okay.

934
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,970
I'm gonna get you

935
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,970
out of here, okay?

936
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,040
We've got to get that

937
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,040
halfway into the chamber.

938
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,410
There we go.

939
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,840
Anything else I can do?

940
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,470
Yeah, why don't you get us

941
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,470
a little bit more light,

942
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,470
if you can?

943
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,950
You get a collapsed lung

944
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,950
to re-expand

945
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,990
by evacuating the

946
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,990
excess air in the chest

947
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,990
with a chest tube.

948
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,060
And you hook it

949
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,060
to a water seal

950
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,060
drainage system

951
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,560
to keep the air

952
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,560
from coming back

953
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,560
through the tube.

954
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,990
That's right,

955
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,990
but what if you don't have

956
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,990
a commercial drainage system?

957
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,460
You have to make one.

958
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,460
Three bottles.

959
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,060
Bottle number one is

960
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,060
the collection bottle.

961
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,100
All the fluid and air

962
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,100
that exits the chest

963
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,100
tube comes here first.

964
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,770
Now the fluid stays,

965
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,770
but the air is still

966
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,770
on the move,

967
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,040
so we have to reroute that air

968
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,040
through this tube here,

969
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,010
into bottle number two,

970
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,010
the water seal.

971
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,700
And that water

972
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,700
keeps the air

973
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,700
from heading back

974
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,440
the other way.

975
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,440
Exactly.

976
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,850
Bottle number three

977
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,850
is for suction.

978
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,610
We connect this bottle

979
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,610
to the regulator in the wall,

980
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,050
and it creates a negative

981
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,050
pressure vacuum

982
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,020
that sucks all the air

983
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,020
through all three bottles

984
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,850
but only to the level of water

985
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,850
in the suction bottle.

986
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,020
Makes sense,

987
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,020
but kind of primitive.

988
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,490
But it works.

989
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,460
Two of Versed,

990
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,460
100 fentanyl?

991
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,620
Yeah.

992
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,760
Fentanyl is in.

993
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,130
Go ahead.

994
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,130
Put it in the tube.

995
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,860
Lidocaine.

996
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,900
Scalpel.

997
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,060
And that's how you

998
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,060
DIY a drainage system.

999
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,130
Okay.

1000
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,500
Let's secure the tube.

1001
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,500
Okay.

1002
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:51,180
So there isn't any

1003
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:51,180
voriconazole anywhere because

1004
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:51,180
the FDA cited the manufacturer

1005
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,780
for workplace issues.

1006
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,950
And until that gets resolved,

1007
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,920
there will continue to be

1008
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,920
a production delay.

1009
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,760
So that's it? Rose might die

1010
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,760
because the manufacturer

1011
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,760
screwed up?

1012
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,760
Look, it infuriates me too.

1013
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,660
What can be done

1014
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,660
for Rose right now?

1015
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,500
We can try

1016
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,500
to mitigate her

1017
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,500
symptoms.

1018
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,540
But unless

1019
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,540
we treat the infection,

1020
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,540
she's going to get worse.

1021
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,970
All right. I'll keep

1022
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,970
searching on my end.

1023
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,870
And if anything comes up,

1024
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,870
I'll let you know.

1025
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,750
Look, I wouldn't mention this

1026
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,750
if we weren't desperate,

1027
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,150
but I had a friend

1028
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,150
in medical school

1029
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,780
who was able to get

1030
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,780
pharmaceutical-grade drugs.

1031
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,080
What do you mean?

1032
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,520
For students

1033
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,520
who wanted

1034
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,520
to pull all-nighters.

1035
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,960
Usually, it was like

1036
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,960
Ritalin or Adderall,

1037
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,790
but it seemed like

1038
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,790
he had access to everything.

1039
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,560
You're talking like

1040
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,560
some kind of drug dealer.

1041
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,190
It's illegal, yes,

1042
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,190
but we're out of options.

1043
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,930
How would we even know

1044
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,930
the drugs are legit?

1045
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,800
He has relationships

1046
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,800
with pharmacists.

1047
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,240
The quality of the medicine

1048
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,240
is not an issue.

1049
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,700
Vanessa, we could

1050
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,700
lose our licenses,

1051
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,700
maybe even go to jail.

1052
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,140
I want to help Rose, I do,

1053
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,840
but not that way.

1054
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,840
No, we can't.

1055
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,950
The light helps. Thanks.

1056
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,950
Yeah.

1057
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,060
Okay, Nathaniel is sedated.

1058
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,570
Hand me this tube

1059
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,570
when I ask for it, okay?

1060
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,070
Yeah.

1061
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,070
All right.

1062
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,660
Okay, intubating.

1063
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,940
Okay, tube.

1064
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,180
Okay, tube is in.

1065
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,890
Okay, we're in business.

1066
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,030
Okay.

1067
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,870
I'm still not hearing

1068
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,870
enough breath sounds

1069
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,870
in the left chest.

1070
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,340
We have to drain the blood.

1071
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,340
He needs a chest tube.

1072
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,980
Can you, uh, fetch me

1073
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,980
that jumpbag, the one

1074
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,980
with the Pleur-evac, please?

1075
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,150
Yeah.

1076
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,230
Candace's CT results.

1077
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,230
Retrocecal appendicitis.

1078
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,350
Really?

1079
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,690
Well, that's not something

1080
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,690
you see every day.

1081
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,030
No, it's not. And the fact

1082
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,030
that her appendix

1083
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,030
is angled medially

1084
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,070
explains why she only

1085
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,070
had back pain.

1086
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,070
Uh-huh.

1087
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,770
Change her antibiotics

1088
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,770
to ceftriaxone and Flagyl.

1089
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,740
Call the OR and have them

1090
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,740
open for a lap appy.

1091
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,610
I'll join you, in case

1092
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,610
anything goes wrong

1093
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,610
with the pregnancy.

1094
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,840
Mmm-hmm.

1095
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,010
My heat.

1096
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,350
She's not making any sense.

1097
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,350
Pressure is down. MAP's 45.

1098
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,880
Her septic shock

1099
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,880
is getting worse.

1100
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,160
Add vasopressin and increase

1101
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,160
the Levophed to 20 mics.

1102
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,110
My feet...

1103
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,070
are cold.

1104
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,150
Is there nothing else

1105
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,150
you can do for her?

1106
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,780
Yeah, place a foley

1107
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,780
and update me

1108
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,780
on her urine output.

1109
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,250
That's it?

1110
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,250
I'm begging you, please!

1111
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,850
I'll be right back.

1112
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,140
How are you feeling?

1113
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,180
A little sheepish.

1114
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,910
I think you might be

1115
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,910
on to something

1116
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,110
with this panic attack idea.

1117
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,950
I mean, what do

1118
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,950
you think's going on?

1119
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,290
Because at this point,

1120
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,290
it's kind of difficult

1121
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,290
to ignore the fact

1122
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,830
that in both instances,

1123
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,870
I was talking

1124
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,870
about the difficulty

1125
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,870
that I've been having

1126
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,900
giving patients bad news

1127
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,900
when you were triggered.

1128
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah.

1129
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,700
I read journals

1130
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,700
all the time

1131
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,870
to keep up, stay fresh.

1132
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,280
Uh-huh. Okay.

1133
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,250
I recently read about

1134
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,250
sporadic fatal insomnia, SFI.

1135
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,820
You heard of it?

1136
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,050
You know,

1137
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,050
I'm familiar with

1138
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,050
familial fatal insomnia.

1139
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,990
It's a genetic

1140
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,990
brain disorder, right?

1141
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:31,050
Yes. SFI is a variant.

1142
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:31,050
It's nongenetic

1143
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:31,050
and even more rare.

1144
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,830
It starts with a mild

1145
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,830
inability to sleep

1146
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,400
that progressively worsens

1147
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,000
until it robs you

1148
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,000
of your faculties

1149
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,000
and kills you.

1150
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,880
Right, and so,

1151
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,880
you're concerned

1152
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,880
that you might have this

1153
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,970
or that you're

1154
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,970
developing it?

1155
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,950
I know it's irrational,

1156
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,950
but I... I can't help it.

1157
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,950
I'm really scared.

1158
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,520
Well, I mean,

1159
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,520
have you thought

1160
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,520
about getting tested?

1161
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,120
No, I can't do that.

1162
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,090
Hey, a simple PET scan

1163
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,090
will tell you everything

1164
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,090
you need to know.

1165
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,320
But that's the problem.

1166
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,960
If I test positive,

1167
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,960
my life is over.

1168
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,060
Every last second I have

1169
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,060
will be consumed by that.

1170
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,870
I... I won't be

1171
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,870
able to function.

1172
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,070
But, I mean,

1173
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,070
aren't you kind of

1174
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,070
consumed by it already?

1175
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,970
I'm so tired.

1176
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,840
Well, I mean,

1177
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,840
of course you are.

1178
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,440
Look, have you

1179
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,440
thought about,

1180
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,440
I don't know,

1181
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,820
what clarity might

1182
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,820
bring to this scenario?

1183
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,450
Look, if you

1184
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,450
test negative,

1185
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,460
you get a good night's

1186
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,460
sleep, right?

1187
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,460
That's easy.

1188
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,330
But even if you test positive,

1189
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,330
which is unlikely,

1190
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:42,060
look, I mean, it'd be

1191
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:42,060
difficult, but wouldn't

1192
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:42,060
it also kind of,

1193
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,040
I don't know, inform how you

1194
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,040
want to spend the rest of the

1195
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,040
time you had left?

1196
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,130
People you might want

1197
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,130
to hang out with?

1198
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,970
The places you might

1199
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,970
want to go?

1200
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,980
I don't know, it just seems

1201
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,980
to me that there's an upside

1202
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,980
to clarity both ways.

1203
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,850
I'll get the scan.

1204
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,820
Voriconazole, the antifungal?

1205
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,360
Yeah, thought I'd

1206
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,360
check anyway.

1207
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,360
Thank you.

1208
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,020
Will. Uh...

1209
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,330
Voriconazole.

1210
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,330
200-milligrams.

1211
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,330
Tablets.

1212
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,100
I know it's an IV,

1213
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,100
but the bioavailability

1214
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,100
is the same.

1215
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,970
Where'd you get them?

1216
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,940
It turns out someone

1217
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,940
did have it.

1218
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,570
No.

1219
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,010
Will.

1220
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,140
These are the real deal

1221
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,140
from a pharmacy.

1222
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,510
The prescription

1223
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,510
was filled two months ago.

1224
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,520
Check the label. I've already

1225
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,520
called and verified it.

1226
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,250
And your friend

1227
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,250
just happened

1228
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,250
to have them?

1229
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,090
He said that sometimes

1230
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,090
people empty out

1231
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,090
their medicine cabinets,

1232
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,320
and they turn over

1233
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,320
the contents to him.

1234
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,060
That's how he got these.

1235
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,060
That's called diversion.

1236
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,630
It's a crime.

1237
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,530
Rose will likely die

1238
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,530
from this infection.

1239
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,530
You know that.

1240
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,000
Even if you were to give her

1241
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,000
these pills, how are you gonna

1242
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,000
explain it in her chart?

1243
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,100
I don't know.

1244
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,100
I guess we just...

1245
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,100
We wouldn't put them in?

1246
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,240
She needs

1247
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,240
these pills, Will.

1248
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,980
There's only

1249
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,980
one way to do this.

1250
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,090
No, no. You stay here.

1251
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,400
Hey, Nancy. Could you

1252
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,400
give us a moment?

1253
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,440
Sure.

1254
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,910
Thank you.

1255
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,610
Emmanuel, I found some

1256
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,610
voriconazole.

1257
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,550
Oh, thank God.

1258
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,090
But I can't

1259
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,090
give it to Rose.

1260
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,450
I don't understand.

1261
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,450
Yeah.

1262
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,690
The pills weren't acquired

1263
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,690
through the proper channels.

1264
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,960
But I assure you,

1265
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,960
this is the antifungal

1266
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,960
Rose needs.

1267
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,020
It will knock out

1268
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,020
her infection.

1269
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,020
It will save her life.

1270
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,400
I just can't legally

1271
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,400
give them to her,

1272
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,400
but you can.

1273
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,300
It's your decision.

1274
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,300
Dr. Taylor and I cannot

1275
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,300
know about this.

1276
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,510
We'll check back

1277
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,510
in a little while.

1278
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,200
You put your blood,

1279
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,200
sweat, and tears into

1280
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,200
a project like this train.

1281
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,240
You try to anticipate

1282
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,240
every potential catastrophe,

1283
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,110
only to be undone

1284
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,110
by rusty old tracks

1285
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,200
and cracked tunnel walls.

1286
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,110
So it was the tunnel's fault?

1287
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,620
It's not my train's.

1288
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,250
Let me guess,

1289
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,250
you're one of those

1290
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,090
"never explain,

1291
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,090
never complain"

1292
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,090
guys, yeah?

1293
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,250
Yeah, well, this day

1294
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,250
wasn't good for me either.

1295
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,030
What's that?

1296
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,030
Oh, the battery on the vent.

1297
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,460
It's dying.

1298
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,680
Why are you

1299
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,680
down here, Crockett?

1300
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,540
What do you mean?

1301
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,150
A train crashes,

1302
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,150
and a tunnel collapses,

1303
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,150
and you run in.

1304
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,420
Why?

1305
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
I... I just did.

1306
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,660
You want to know why

1307
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,660
I created this train?

1308
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,100
To change the world.

1309
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,110
Chicago first, but soon,

1310
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,110
every other city would

1311
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,110
see a faster, more efficient,

1312
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,080
cost-effective,

1313
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,080
environmentally-friendly

1314
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,080
mode of transportation.

1315
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,680
Jack Dayton has done it again.

1316
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,680
A brilliant innovator. A hero.

1317
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,050
That's the portrait

1318
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,050
I try to paint for

1319
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,050
the media anyway.

1320
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,490
The truth is, I developed

1321
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,490
this train to make me

1322
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,490
another fortune.

1323
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,630
Money and ego

1324
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,630
have been the motivation

1325
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,260
behind almost

1326
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,260
every decision

1327
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,260
I've ever made.

1328
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,100
Every good deed.

1329
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,600
Every good deed has

1330
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,600
really been self-serving,

1331
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,500
unlike you.

1332
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,380
No.

1333
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,740
What?

1334
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,480
Believe me, Jack, I...

1335
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,420
I am far from selfless.

1336
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,130
Crockett?

1337
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,570
Doc. Hey.

1338
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,370
Okay, so what do you guys say?

1339
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,370
Want to get out of here?

1340
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,880
My results.

1341
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,210
Negative.

1342
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,110
Oh, good God.

1343
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,890
Thank God.

1344
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,460
Hopefully, you can get

1345
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,460
a little sleep now.

1346
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,220
I can't thank you

1347
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,220
enough, Dan.

1348
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,560
Hey, I'm just really happy

1349
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,560
it turned out the way it did.

1350
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:22,280
But I think we

1351
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:22,280
should stop seeing each other

1352
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:22,280
professionally, I'm afraid.

1353
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:29,140
I'm sorry, but this has

1354
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:29,140
been a massive breach

1355
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:29,140
of therapeutic boundaries.

1356
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,440
You know what,

1357
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,440
I would actually

1358
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,440
really like

1359
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,450
to continue,

1360
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,450
if it's okay with you.

1361
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,790
You want me to stay on

1362
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,790
as your therapist after this?

1363
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,260
What, are you kidding me?

1364
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,660
I mean, all this experience

1365
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,660
has done for me today

1366
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,660
is humanize you.

1367
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,320
We might have hit the fast

1368
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,320
forward button a little bit,

1369
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,370
but, Otis, do you

1370
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,370
have any idea how

1371
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,370
difficult it is out there

1372
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,200
to find a practitioner

1373
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,200
who will just, you know,

1374
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,210
listen and talk

1375
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,210
and be present?

1376
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,210
All I saw today

1377
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,210
was the kind of,

1378
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,410
I don't know,

1379
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,410
humanity, right,

1380
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,920
that made me really want

1381
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,920
to keep working with you,

1382
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,380
if you're good with it.

1383
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,420
Sure.

1384
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,650
Good.

1385
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,830
Everyone,

1386
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,830
gather around, please.

1387
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,560
Everyone?

1388
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,560
Good news.

1389
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,460
We've just been informed

1390
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,460
that Dr. Marcel is safe,

1391
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,970
and he and his patients,

1392
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,970
including Jack Dayton,

1393
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,970
are en route.

1394
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,600
All right, everybody.

1395
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,600
Let's get back to work.

1396
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,640
So how'd it go?

1397
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,730
Good.

1398
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,970
You showed Dr. Choi

1399
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,970
how to do that thing

1400
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,970
with the bottles?

1401
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,800
Yeah, I did.

1402
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,820
Ah, in Afghanistan, we had

1403
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,820
a whole lot of GSWs without

1404
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,820
a whole lot of equipment,

1405
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,610
but we did have bottles.

1406
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,990
Cool.

1407
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,990
Yeah, it's cool.

1408
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,620
In any case,

1409
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,620
he is a good teacher.

1410
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,760
Hey, and FYI, Dr. Marcel

1411
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,760
is a pretty good teacher too.

1412
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,760
Hmm.

1413
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,460
Excuse me.

1414
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,360
Nice work today,

1415
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,360
Dr. Asher.

1416
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,240
Thank you.

1417
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,240
Yeah.

1418
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,500
Your patient got lucky.

1419
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,500
She had a good doctor.

1420
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,510
And which one of us is that?

1421
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,670
Well, we both know.

1422
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,380
Listen, your weekly drug test,

1423
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,380
we can dispense with that.

1424
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,840
Great.

1425
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,590
Pressure is stable

1426
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,590
and has been

1427
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,590
for some time now,

1428
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,990
even without the pressors.

1429
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,690
We'll have to wait

1430
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,690
for your cultures

1431
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,690
to come back,

1432
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,890
but I'd wager

1433
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,890
the infection is

1434
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,890
resolving.

1435
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
I feel...

1436
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
What's the word I'm

1437
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
looking for?

1438
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,430
Relieved?

1439
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,900
Sanguine.

1440
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,740
Good word.

1441
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,740
People don't

1442
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,740
use it enough.

1443
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,470
It certainly seems like

1444
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,470
she's getting back to normal.

1445
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,880
Well, hopefully, if this all

1446
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,880
continues, you can

1447
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,880
go home tomorrow.

1448
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,510
We can't

1449
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,510
thank you enough.

1450
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,950
It worked.

1451
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,320
Yeah, look.

1452
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,350
We did what we had

1453
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,350
to do, but no one can

1454
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,350
ever know about this.

1455
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,720
Ever.

1456
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,300
They're here!

1457
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,870
Nathaniel Perry,

1458
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,870
34 years old.

1459
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,500
Chest was crushed

1460
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,500
in a train crash.

1461
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,340
Dr. Marcel intubated him

1462
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,340
in the field and placed

1463
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,340
a chest tube.

1464
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,510
All right,

1465
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,510
I got him. All right.

1466
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,950
You're going to two.

1467
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,880
Mr. Dayton,

1468
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,880
sorry to meet you

1469
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,880
under these circumstances.

1470
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,050
Sharon Goodwin, executive

1471
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,050
director of patient services.

1472
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,590
And I'm Dr. Choi.

1473
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,590
Let's get you checked out.

1474
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,420
All right, and Crockett said

1475
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,420
I'm gonna needed an MRI.

1476
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,550
Will do.

1477
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,530
Where is Crockett?

1478
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,530
He's okay, right?

1479
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,030
Yeah, he said he

1480
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,030
had to see someone

1481
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,030
and that it couldn't wait.

1482
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,700
Pamela?

1483
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,330
Pamela, please.

1484
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,330
Pamela, please talk...

1485
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,770
Crockett, are you okay?

1486
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,400
Yeah. Where's your mom?

1487
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,910
She left for Boston this

1488
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,910
morning. I'm sending

1489
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,910
these things on to her.

1490
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,380
Oh, I need

1491
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,380
to tell her something.

1492
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,650
Yeah, she saw

1493
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,650
you called. She didn't

1494
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,650
want to talk to you.

1495
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,030
I get it.

1496
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,030
Could you tell her

1497
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,030
something for me?

1498
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,090
Just tell her I haven't been

1499
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,090
entirely honest with her.

1500
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,470
Honest with myself, really.

1501
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,470
Oh?

1502
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,110
Your mom never would

1503
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,110
have risked her ability

1504
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,110
to perform surgery.

1505
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,110
I mean,

1506
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,110
you said so yourself

1507
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,110
when she was on the table.

1508
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,540
But, uh, I made the decision

1509
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,540
I wanted anyway.

1510
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,620
It was selfish.

1511
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,960
I didn't want to lose her.

1512
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,760
But I guess

1513
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,760
I lost her anyway.

1514
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,090
I'm sorry.

1515
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,900
You take care, Ava.

1516
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,710
You, too, Crockett.
