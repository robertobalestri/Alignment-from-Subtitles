1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,500
OR 2.0 is the fruit

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,500
of years of development.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,370
Dean won't be swayed

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,370
by Dayton's new shiny toys.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,410
I don't know if we're

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,410
on a path to getting back

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,410
together or divorce.

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,610
I'm here if you ever

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,610
need to talk.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,010
I know.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,480
Liliana? I've been out to her

12
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,480
house twice for dinner now.

13
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,050
Third one's on the books.

14
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,250
That's wonderful.

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,220
I'm so happy for you.

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,350
In the OR,

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,350
you were in pain.

18
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,160
I'm fine, Dr. Asher.

19
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,290
But you have to let

20
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,290
somebody check you out.

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,460
Any nausea, vomiting?

22
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,260
Nope.

23
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,070
Trouble sleeping,

24
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,070
headaches?

25
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,140
I mean, you've met

26
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,140
my interns, right?

27
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,640
Come on, Mark. I see

28
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,640
the pulmonary edema

29
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,640
in my X-ray.

30
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,180
What's going on?

31
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,740
BUN, creatin,

32
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,740
potassium all elevated.

33
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,420
Heart rate and BP

34
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,420
are up, too.

35
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,250
Fluid retention. Crap.

36
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,010
You been staying

37
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,010
off the NSAIDs?

38
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,150
Of course.

39
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,150
Sticking to

40
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,150
the renal diet?

41
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,490
Man, I think I've maxed out

42
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,490
on the amount of cabbage

43
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,490
I can eat in one day.

44
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,160
So what now? Diuretics?

45
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,190
We'll start you

46
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,190
on low-dose Lasix,

47
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,790
see if that reduces

48
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,790
the swelling.

49
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,300
It's gonna be hard

50
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,300
to run an ED

51
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,270
when I'm in the john

52
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,270
every half hour.

53
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,400
You could always let

54
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,400
your kidneys fail

55
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,400
and kill you

56
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,640
if your interns

57
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,640
don't get you first.

58
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,580
Sweet release.

59
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,580
All right, Mark. Thanks.

60
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,810
Sure.

61
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,610
It's open mic night,

62
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,610
so there'll be more people

63
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,610
there than before.

64
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,380
I'm gonna get there

65
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,380
very early.

66
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,550
I got a seat

67
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,550
right down front,

68
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,550
right there.

69
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,820
You don't have to come

70
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,820
to every single time

71
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,820
I sing.

72
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,120
Of course I don't

73
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,120
have to come.

74
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,120
I enjoy it.

75
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,530
I enjoy

76
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,530
watching you sing.

77
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,600
Morning, Dan.

78
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,600
Peter,

79
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,600
how you doing?

80
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,760
Hey, Peter, have you...

81
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,760
Have you met

82
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,760
my friend Liliana?

83
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,460
No, I mean,

84
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,460
that is yes.

85
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,370
I've seen you around.

86
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,370
Housekeeping right?

87
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,370
Yes.

88
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,470
We met actually

89
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,470
at a nightclub where

90
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,470
Liliana was performing.

91
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,280
She is a sensational

92
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,280
opera singer.

93
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,840
I just sing for fun,

94
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,840
for myself.

95
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,220
Well, it's very nice

96
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,220
to meet you,

97
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,350
and thank you for

98
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,350
excellent work

99
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,350
around here.

100
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,480
Mmm-hmm.

101
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,830
Damn.

102
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,290
You know, I can't believe

103
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,290
this has never occurred

104
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,290
to me before, but, um...

105
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,100
But my... I have a really good

106
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,100
friend who was on the board

107
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,100
of the Lyric Opera.

108
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,760
No, no.

109
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,470
They're very nice, Daniel.

110
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,170
No, I was just

111
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,170
thinking maybe

112
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
I could find out when

113
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
the next round of auditions

114
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
are or something.

115
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,440
No, I don't think so,

116
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,440
but thank you.

117
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,310
I should get to work.

118
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,580
Okay.

119
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,850
I will, um...

120
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,560
I'll see you later.

121
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,820
Okay, thank you.

122
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,820
Thank you.

123
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,820
Maggie.

124
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,260
Sharon.

125
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,170
You're a lifesaver.

126
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,170
What happened?

127
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,670
Said it was the fan belt.

128
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,670
I don't know.

129
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,900
Oh, man.

130
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,180
You know Ben normally

131
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,180
takes care of these things,

132
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,210
but, you know,

133
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,210
I'm trying to give him

134
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,210
a little bit of space.

135
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,910
It's not easy, is it?

136
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,550
Yeah. Oh, thank you.

137
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,640
Thank you.

138
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,740
No.

139
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,910
Thank you.

140
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,780
No, I just...

141
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,780
I don't know how

142
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,780
we come back from this

143
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,190
if we don't talk.

144
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,350
Well, you know time

145
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,350
is a great healer.

146
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,450
I hope so.

147
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,370
Sorry I made you

148
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,370
late for work.

149
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,370
Oh, please.

150
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,630
With Jack Dayton in charge,

151
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,630
no one's watching me clock in.

152
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,440
Help!

153
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,440
Did you hear that?

154
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,880
Yeah, over here.

155
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,570
Help! Help.

156
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,210
She's been hit.

157
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,210
That car hit her!

158
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,870
We're nurses.

159
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,870
Let us help you.

160
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,710
That maniac

161
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,710
hit her straight on.

162
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,380
What is her name?

163
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,380
Rose Howard.

164
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,750
Rose.

165
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,750
Rose?

166
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,850
Are you okay?

167
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,480
I'm fine. I'm more worried

168
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,480
about her.

169
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,650
Please, please.

170
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,650
Okay.

171
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,630
Rose, nod if you can hear me.

172
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,260
Let me call an ambo.

173
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,890
Please, you have to

174
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,890
help her.

175
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,870
I'm gonna look

176
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,870
into your eyes, Rose.

177
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,670
There you go.

178
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,670
There you go. Yes.

179
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,500
Okay.

180
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,500
Ambo's on its way.

181
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,600
Great.

182
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,510
I'm right here.

183
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,510
Gonna keep you warm, girl.

184
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,310
There you go.

185
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,520
Here's the ambo.

186
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,760
Eyes open. You're good.

187
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,760
You're good.

188
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
Ms. Goodwin, Maggie,

189
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
what've we got?

190
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,460
Peds versus auto.

191
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,460
No loss of consciousness,

192
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,460
but she's shocky.

193
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,300
Her name

194
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,300
is Rose Howard.

195
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,590
All right,

196
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,590
we gotta move her.

197
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,300
Okay. A little help.

198
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,610
On my count,

199
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,610
one, two, three.

200
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,970
Rolling.

201
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,710
Okay, it's okay.

202
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,340
It's okay.

203
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,340
There we go.

204
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,850
I'll switch places

205
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,850
with you.

206
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,010
On my count,

207
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,010
one, two, three.

208
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,910
All right. There we go.

209
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,690
Yeah, we got

210
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,690
an ambo coming in.

211
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,690
We're trailing.

212
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,320
I'm sorry.

213
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,320
You can't ride along.

214
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,590
Rose is too unstable.

215
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,030
We'll send another ambo

216
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,030
to come check you out.

217
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,490
No, I'm fine.

218
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,490
Go on. Get her

219
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,490
to the hospital please.

220
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,700
She needs to be examined.

221
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,700
Go. We got her.

222
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
I have a first aid kit

223
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
in my car.

224
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,830
Listen, listen, we work

225
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,830
at the hospital

226
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,470
where they're

227
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,470
taking Rose.

228
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,470
Okay.

229
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,510
Maybe you can ride with us

230
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,510
and so you can stay close,

231
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,710
and then we could get

232
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,710
you checked out, okay?

233
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,870
Okay.

234
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,870
It's all good, okay.

235
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,680
Okay. Yeah, let's go.

236
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,840
Let's go.

237
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,650
All right, let's go.

238
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,650
Hey, Jack.

239
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,650
Thank you.

240
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,850
You have a moment?

241
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,850
Yeah. For you, always.

242
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,620
Oh, actually,

243
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,620
you two ought to meet.

244
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,490
Now this is

245
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,490
Dr. Grace Song.

246
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,760
She's an incredible surgeon

247
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,760
in her own right,

248
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,800
and I managed

249
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,800
to lure her away

250
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,800
to Dayton Corp.

251
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,890
Crockett Marcel.

252
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,990
Pleasure to meet you.

253
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,660
I heard you and 2.0

254
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,660
are a match made in heaven.

255
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,640
Well, it's a remarkable

256
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,640
advancement

257
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,610
and exactly what

258
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,610
I'd like to talk about.

259
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,580
Yeah.

260
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,580
So I...

261
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,700
I'd like to train

262
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,700
other surgeons on it.

263
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,840
Mmm-hmm.

264
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,840
Right now, it's just me,

265
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,840
but it would help

266
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,850
if more could

267
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,850
familiarize themselves

268
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,850
with the suite.

269
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,720
Well, 2.0 was always intended

270
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,720
to be an adaptive platform,

271
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,720
so more users,

272
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,810
more data, better outcome.

273
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,620
Yeah, bring in

274
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,620
who you want.

275
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,620
Great.

276
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,890
I'll see you around.

277
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,050
Mr. Dayton...

278
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,050
Yeah.

279
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,830
Did you get a chance

280
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,830
to read my email?

281
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,460
I saw it. I just haven't

282
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,460
opened it yet.

283
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,560
Okay, I'd really like

284
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,560
to set up a time...

285
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,690
You know, just hold that

286
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,690
thought. This may address

287
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,690
your concern.

288
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,790
Good morning, everyone.

289
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,370
Promise not to take up

290
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,370
too much of your time.

291
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,370
Now, it's become clear to me

292
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,370
over the past few weeks

293
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,910
that, well, I have a lot

294
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,910
to learn about medicine.

295
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,710
And when

296
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,710
I don't know something,

297
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,010
I like to turn to the experts,

298
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,010
and that's you,

299
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,480
which is why I asked

300
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,480
Dr. Grace Song here

301
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,610
to spend a little bit

302
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,610
more time in the ED.

303
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,780
Now she is one

304
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,780
of my top minds,

305
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,780
and I've tasked her

306
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,380
with finding ways to make

307
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,380
your jobs easier,

308
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,380
more efficient,

309
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,020
so that you can keep doing

310
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,020
your incredible work.

311
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,030
So please feel free to discuss

312
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,030
with her any areas

313
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,730
that you feel

314
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,730
can be better optimized.

315
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,530
Thank you so much.

316
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,530
I hope that helps.

317
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,630
Actually, no,

318
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,630
that doesn't help.

319
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,540
So is that your plan,

320
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,540
replace us with robots?

321
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,770
Dr. Archer.

322
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,140
Yeah, you'd get more jokes in

323
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,140
if you were actually on time.

324
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,470
Or we can program

325
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,470
the robots to be funny.

326
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,380
No one likes change,

327
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,380
and tech can feel

328
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,380
overwhelming, but I...

329
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,650
I'm not some Luddite.

330
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,490
I just don't think

331
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,490
we need to invent

332
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,490
high-tech solutions

333
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,790
for problems

334
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,790
that don't exist.

335
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,150
Totally.

336
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,150
That's part of

337
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,150
what's exciting right now.

338
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,690
We're deciding

339
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,690
how to use tech

340
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,700
so that it's empowering

341
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,700
without it making us want

342
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,700
to pull our hair out.

343
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
It works for us,

344
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
not the other

345
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
way around.

346
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,130
Couldn't have

347
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,130
said it better myself.

348
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,130
See you in a bit.

349
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,910
That's a fine sentiment,

350
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,910
Dr. Song.

351
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,940
I'm curious to see

352
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,940
how you put it into action.

353
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,170
Okay, well, take

354
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,170
Ginger Spice over there.

355
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,970
You could be verbally

356
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,970
charting directly

357
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,550
into our new EMR instead

358
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,550
of wasting time typing

359
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,450
or copy-and-pasting.

360
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,780
Typing after I see

361
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,780
a patient is how

362
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,780
I've always done it.

363
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,910
You're creating more work

364
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,910
for yourself.

365
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,890
You still have

366
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,890
to manually input your notes

367
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,960
and, in the interim,

368
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,960
hope that there's no gap

369
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,830
in communication

370
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,830
with nursing.

371
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,130
Hasn't been

372
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,130
a problem before.

373
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,000
Besides, it allows me

374
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,000
to have time

375
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,160
to wrap my head around

376
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,160
patient history, lab results,

377
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,160
before handoff.

378
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,960
Or you could be spending

379
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,960
that time with more patients.

380
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,910
With my nose buried

381
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,910
in a screen.

382
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,600
This little debate

383
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,600
is stimulating,

384
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,650
but I'm sure you'll find

385
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,650
it's also very inefficient.

386
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,010
Case waiting for you in 4,

387
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,010
Ginger Spice.

388
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,040
Thanks anyway

389
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,040
for the suggestion.

390
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,520
Here to help.

391
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,090
Mr. and Mrs. Rouse.

392
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,750
Please, Connie.

393
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,750
David. Our son Jason.

394
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,690
Hey, Jason.

395
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,900
Hey, heard you're not

396
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,900
feeling well.

397
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,100
What?

398
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,930
Where am I?

399
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,930
We're at the hospital, honey.

400
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,570
I'm gonna listen

401
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,570
to your chest, all right?

402
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,710
Leave me alone.

403
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,680
Sorry, buddy. Almost done.

404
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,550
He's been irritable,

405
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,550
confused.

406
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,990
We thought

407
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,990
he was just tired.

408
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,960
He recently joined

409
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,960
the soccer team.

410
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,820
He's crazy about it.

411
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,820
Wouldn't stop playing.

412
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,490
But then he stopped

413
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,490
eating as much

414
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,000
and didn't have

415
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,000
the energy to play.

416
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,160
Please,

417
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,160
you gotta understand...

418
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,910
Twelve years ago,

419
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,910
we lost our son Axel

420
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,910
before his first birthday.

421
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,600
First, he wouldn't

422
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,600
stop crying,

423
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,600
then he got weak,

424
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,110
and then finally seizures.

425
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,850
We had to watch our son

426
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,850
disappear right in front

427
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,850
of our eyes.

428
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,850
The doctors poked

429
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,850
and prodded him

430
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,850
with thousands of tests.

431
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,690
They even came up to our house

432
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,690
to check for lead and mold.

433
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,960
Yeah, all that and they never

434
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,960
figured out how to help.

435
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,930
I'm so sorry.

436
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,060
We've been vigilant,

437
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,060
probably paranoid,

438
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,060
ever since.

439
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,610
Every sniffle, every scrape,

440
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,610
he goes to the doctor,

441
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,610
but now this.

442
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,610
Well, without a diagnosis,

443
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,610
I don't want to speculate

444
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,010
about a possible connection.

445
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,600
I think Jason is likely

446
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,600
dealing with an infection,

447
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,680
but I'll make sure

448
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,680
we're casting a wide net.

449
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,720
Okay?

450
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,720
Yes, please, anything.

451
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,620
Hang tight.

452
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,620
We'll figure this out.

453
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,330
Dr. Asher, incoming

454
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,330
postpartum and bleeding.

455
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,290
Got it.

456
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,290
Jackie, going to 3.

457
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,000
Laurel Wilson, 26 years old,

458
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,000
G1P1 postpartum day nine.

459
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,130
Found unresponsive.

460
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,130
There was so much blood.

461
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,600
GCS 11, BP initially 90 over

462
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,600
palp with heart rate of 120.

463
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,110
Liter of saline improved her

464
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,110
to 110 over 60, rate 110.

465
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,270
Okay, how much does

466
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,270
she been bleeding?

467
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,270
I don't know. How could we?

468
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,210
That's the problem.

469
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,210
Okay, on my count.

470
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,940
Ready. One, two, three.

471
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,820
Has she passed

472
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,820
any clots?

473
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,820
Uh, yes.

474
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,250
What size?

475
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,250
Golf ball, apple?

476
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,840
Uh, golf ball, I think.

477
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,050
I told her to call 911,

478
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,050
but she was passed out

479
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,050
when I got home.

480
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,150
CBC type and cross-match,

481
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,150
CMP coags, and hang

482
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,150
two units of O neg.

483
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,320
On it.

484
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,830
What's wrong with my wife?

485
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,590
I believe she has a piece

486
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,590
of retained placenta,

487
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,600
which is why she hasn't

488
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,600
been able to stop bleeding.

489
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,140
Okay.

490
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,140
Yeah, there it is.

491
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,710
I can bring her

492
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,710
through this, but I need

493
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,180
to perform a procedure

494
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,180
to remove the tissue, okay?

495
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,340
Yeah.

496
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,210
All right,

497
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,210
open the hybrid OR

498
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,910
for an emergency D&C.

499
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,910
You got it.

500
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,390
We're going to Baghdad.

501
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,390
What do we got?

502
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,960
Rose Howard,

503
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,960
32-year-old female, MVC.

504
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,930
I gave her

505
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,930
500 normal salines

506
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,930
on the ride,

507
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,940
but her BP's

508
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,940
still hovering

509
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,940
at 88 over 56.

510
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,170
Rate's 140s.

511
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,180
Okay, two units

512
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,180
of whole blood please.

513
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,140
Pelvic fracture?

514
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,140
Yeah, Ms. Goodwin and Maggie

515
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,650
thought they felt instability,

516
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,650
so they wrapped in the field.

517
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,010
All right,

518
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,010
we need X-ray in here.

519
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,050
All right, let's get her

520
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,050
transferred.

521
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,210
Nice and easy on my count.

522
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,720
Here we go,

523
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,720
one, two, three.

524
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,960
All right, thanks,

525
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,960
Caesar, Tanya.

526
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,920
All right, X-ray chest

527
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,920
and pelvis,

528
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,390
and let's get her

529
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,390
on the rapid

530
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,390
transfusion, please.

531
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,190
Hey, Rose. I'm Dr. Marcel.

532
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,390
We got you, okay?

533
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,730
It still hurts.

534
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,860
Okay, well, let's have a look.

535
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,860
Fast scan.

536
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,740
Yeah, good amount

537
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,740
of fluid in her belly.

538
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,180
Yeah, she'll need a lap.

539
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,180
All right, let's see what

540
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,180
the X-ray shows.

541
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,870
Okay. Thank you, Kaley.

542
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,740
X-ray up.

543
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,190
Comminuted pelvic fracture

544
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,190
to the iliac wing.

545
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,450
Mediastinum's high.

546
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,090
Right, we'll deal

547
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,090
with those later.

548
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,100
The abdominal bleeding's

549
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,100
our priority.

550
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,000
All right, Rose,

551
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,000
we're gonna take you up

552
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,000
to surgery now.

553
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,760
Kizzy, yeah, call upstairs.

554
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,760
We need an OR.

555
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,170
2.0 is open.

556
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,300
Better imaging's available,

557
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,300
and we still don't know

558
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,700
the full extent

559
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,700
of her injuries.

560
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,170
And emergent trauma

561
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,170
is not the time to play

562
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,170
with your fancy toy.

563
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,300
No, we're gonna treat

564
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,300
this abdominal case

565
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,940
like all the others,

566
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,940
all right?

567
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,210
Let's go.

568
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,980
It's all my fault.

569
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,980
We were arguing.

570
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,020
She started

571
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,020
to walk away.

572
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,760
I ran after her

573
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,760
and tried to grab her,

574
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,160
and that's when the car

575
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,160
came out of nowhere.

576
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,990
If I just let her go,

577
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,990
maybe she would have...

578
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,770
No, no. It was

579
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,770
the driver's fault.

580
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,010
Paola, you okay?

581
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,210
Talk to me.

582
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,740
I can't breathe.

583
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,840
I don't know...

584
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,380
Maggie,

585
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,380
there's a stethoscope

586
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,320
in the first aid kit

587
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,320
in the back.

588
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,820
Paola, listen to me.

589
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,860
Focus on your breathing.

590
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,490
Take long, slow breaths.

591
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,020
Okay?

592
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,130
Diminished breath sounds

593
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,130
on the left.

594
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,870
Distended neck veins.

595
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,840
Tension pneumothorax.

596
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,530
What's that mean?

597
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,110
Paola, did the car

598
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,110
hit you, too?

599
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,970
Didn't think it was bad.

600
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,110
You probably have

601
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,110
a broken rib that's punctured

602
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,110
your lung.

603
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,910
That's why you're having

604
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,910
problems breathing.

605
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,280
We can't wait.

606
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,280
We have to relieve this

607
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,280
pressure on her chest.

608
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,950
Okay. There's an IV catheter

609
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,950
in the inner pocket.

610
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,260
Paola, we're gonna help you.

611
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,960
I'm gonna

612
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,960
pull down your shirt,

613
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,960
and in count of three,

614
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,290
you're gonna feel a pinch.

615
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,200
Okay.

616
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,170
One, two, three.

617
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,440
Unfortunately, I can't offer

618
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,440
any solutions yet.

619
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,080
Jason has no signs

620
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,080
of electrolyte imbalance,

621
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,250
no markers for infection,

622
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,250
or any other abnormalities.

623
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,590
By the numbers,

624
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,590
there's nothing to explain

625
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,590
his symptoms.

626
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,360
You're kidding me.

627
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,360
Look at him.

628
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,830
I know this is frustrating,

629
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,830
which is why I'd like

630
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,990
to order a few more tests.

631
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,130
There's always more tests.

632
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,100
Can you at least tell us

633
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,100
what you're looking for?

634
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,230
Of course.

635
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,230
Jason symptoms still

636
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,230
strike me as an infection,

637
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,010
but it could be hiding,

638
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,010
okay, in his spinal cord

639
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,010
or his brain,

640
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,550
which would explain

641
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,550
the lethargy, his confusion,

642
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,450
and the kind of infection

643
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,450
that wouldn't show up

644
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,450
on standard tests.

645
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,580
So I'd like to do a CT

646
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,580
of his head

647
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,350
and a lumbar puncture.

648
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,380
Basically,

649
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,380
I'd insert a needle...

650
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,460
He's seizing.

651
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,460
Jason!

652
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,260
Nancy, need a hand

653
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,260
in here.

654
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
1.5 of Ativan.

655
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,310
Okay, Ativan's in.

656
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,110
Hey, buddy.

657
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,470
Jason, can you hear me?

658
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,580
Okay, can you look at me?

659
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,880
Look at my finger.

660
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,090
That's good.

661
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,950
Good.

662
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,060
Mom, Dad?

663
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,900
It's happening again,

664
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,900
isn't it?

665
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,040
It's just like Axel.

666
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,950
Dr. Charles,

667
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,950
can I get your help?

668
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,040
What's up?

669
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,050
Patient in treatment 7

670
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,050
Richard Wyatt.

671
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,250
The guy that's...

672
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,220
That's running

673
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,220
for city council.

674
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,220
Yeah.

675
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,190
He was supposed to do

676
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,190
some interview this morning,

677
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,460
but his campaign manager

678
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,460
found him disoriented

679
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,000
and slurring his speech

680
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,000
with a small bruise on

681
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,000
his head. Brought him in.

682
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,000
Anything interesting

683
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,000
in his chart?

684
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah. Workup was negative.

685
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,200
He's fine.

686
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,670
Except for the combo

687
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,670
of alcohol and benzos.

688
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,070
Don't know if it was

689
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,070
an accident or intentional.

690
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,170
I will, um...

691
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,170
I'll go chat with him.

692
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,410
Yeah. Thank you.

693
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,210
How you doing?

694
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,210
I'm Dr. Charles.

695
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,410
I hope you come bearing

696
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,410
discharge papers.

697
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,990
Not sure that those

698
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,990
are quite ready yet.

699
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,660
Any chance we could

700
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,660
expedite them?

701
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,350
The sooner we leave,

702
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,350
the sooner I can reschedule

703
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,660
the interview with Mathews.

704
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,630
He doesn't know why

705
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,630
we're rescheduling, right?

706
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,130
You handled it?

707
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,130
Of course.

708
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,300
Do you mind if I just get

709
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,300
a quick moment with Mr. Wyatt?

710
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,400
Fine. Okay.

711
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,440
Be in the waiting room.

712
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,600
Thank you.

713
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,210
Feels like I'm in

714
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,210
the principal's office.

715
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,720
Is something wrong?

716
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,720
No.

717
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,650
Not at all.

718
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,650
I just wanted to

719
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,650
have a quick chat.

720
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,020
You know, I really need

721
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,020
to get going, all right?

722
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,020
Lots to do.

723
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,180
Completely understand.

724
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,630
You did have a mixture

725
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,630
of alcohol and benzodiazepines

726
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,220
in your system, though.

727
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,360
I know what you're thinking

728
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,360
what this might look like,

729
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,990
but it was just

730
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,990
a stupid accident.

731
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,430
Well, look,

732
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,430
that's good to hear.

733
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,100
I just want to make sure

734
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,100
your prescribing doctor

735
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,270
did make it clear

736
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,270
that it's a potentially

737
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,270
lethal combination.

738
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,540
I mean, I know you shouldn't

739
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,540
mix medication and alcohol,

740
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,010
but, you know, I defy anyone

741
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,010
to get through a fundraiser

742
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,020
without at least

743
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,020
one scotch.

744
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,280
I mean, if I'd known

745
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,280
it was that dangerous...

746
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,280
Well...

747
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,150
Your fundraisers sound

748
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,150
pretty stressful to me.

749
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,490
You think that might be

750
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,490
why you took the medication?

751
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,460
What? No.

752
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,260
No, look, I just needed

753
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,260
to take the edge off for the

754
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,260
Mathews interview, all right?

755
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,490
He's tough.

756
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,530
Do you mind me asking

757
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,530
why you were prescribed

758
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,530
benzodiazepines

759
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,690
in the first place?

760
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,500
Look, this was

761
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,500
a one-off mistake,

762
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,300
and I'd appreciate it

763
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,300
if you'd just check on

764
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,300
my discharge papers.

765
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,640
Got it.

766
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,180
I will get with

767
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,180
Dr. Jacquerie and see if

768
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,180
we can move that along.

769
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,530
Nice to meet you.

770
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,820
So what's his deal?

771
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,320
I don't think

772
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,320
this has ever

773
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,320
happened before,

774
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,450
but, you know,

775
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,450
he's definitely

776
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,450
self-medicating.

777
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,550
Depression?

778
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,250
I think it's some kind

779
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,250
of anxiety disorder,

780
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,790
but anyway,

781
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,790
he just wants

782
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,790
to get out of here.

783
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,760
I don't have a reason

784
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,760
to keep him,

785
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,730
but if he's got an issue...

786
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,730
Not enough to hold him.

787
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,170
I'll just, you know, make sure

788
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,170
he has the proper referrals

789
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,170
before he leaves.

790
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,830
Yeah. This is why

791
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,830
I like surgery.

792
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,830
Patients don't talk.

793
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,230
Hmm.

794
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,310
Saw you ordered

795
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,310
DNA sequencing on

796
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,310
your patient Jason Rose.

797
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,710
You reading my charts?

798
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,780
It's a pretty unusual test

799
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,780
to order in the ED.

800
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,780
Caught my eye.

801
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,320
Apparently no one

802
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,320
has anything

803
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,320
they wanna optimize

804
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,320
around here,

805
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,320
so I'm just twiddling

806
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,320
my thumbs.

807
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,430
Jason's brother Axel

808
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,430
died 12 years ago

809
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,160
from uncontrolled seizures,

810
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,160
no diagnosis.

811
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,860
And now that Jason's

812
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,860
had a seizure...

813
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,640
You think they're connected,

814
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,640
so you ordered the sequence.

815
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,100
And these.

816
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,140
Epileptic encephalopathy.

817
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,800
I ruled out infection,

818
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,800
environmental factors,

819
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,280
and most

820
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,280
autoimmune diseases.

821
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,820
Genetic mutation's

822
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,820
the only thing

823
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,820
that makes sense.

824
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,580
Trouble is, epileptic

825
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,580
encephalopathy

826
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,850
has link to hundreds

827
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,850
of different mutations.

828
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,620
More like 1,500.

829
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,450
And every disease path

830
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,450
has a different course

831
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,450
of treatment.

832
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,830
So it's gonna take

833
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,830
forever to narrow down

834
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,830
this differential.

835
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,330
I think I might be able

836
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,330
to do that for you.

837
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,690
I could construct a neural

838
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,690
network using existing

839
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,690
DNA databases.

840
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,360
Basically bundle them

841
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,360
all together and put

842
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,360
Jason's DNA

843
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,310
and compare it against

844
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,310
tens of thousands

845
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,310
of known mutations.

846
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,700
This neural network

847
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,700
would take a few hours

848
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,700
to code,

849
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,840
but it could give you

850
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,840
a highly probable diagnosis.

851
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,890
Assuming the mutation's

852
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,890
already in one

853
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,890
of these databases.

854
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,380
We work with what we have.

855
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,190
I appreciate

856
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,190
the offer, Dr. Song,

857
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,860
but these parents

858
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,860
are terrified and need

859
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,860
a human they can turn to.

860
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,330
So I have to figure this out

861
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,330
the best way I know how.

862
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,430
You know where to find me.

863
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,230
Yeah.

864
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,500
You know,

865
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,500
my mom said Nathan's

866
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,500
looking all around.

867
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,910
Sweet boy.

868
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,250
So, Laurel, the piece

869
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,250
of retained placenta

870
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,610
has been removed,

871
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,610
which should resolve

872
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,610
the bleeding.

873
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,680
Thank God.

874
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,420
I'll still be able to get

875
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,420
pregnant, right?

876
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,390
A big family has always

877
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,390
been the dream.

878
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,220
Infertility is an extremely

879
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,220
rare complication

880
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,220
from a D&C, so yes.

881
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,350
Then I can go home soon?

882
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,530
I'd like to continue

883
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,530
monitoring you for a while.

884
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,630
You did have

885
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,630
heavy bleeding

886
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,630
for nine days.

887
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,800
You know, we called

888
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,800
the doctor's office to try

889
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,800
to get checked out earlier,

890
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,200
and they said it was fine.

891
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,300
Yeah, I...

892
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,310
I felt like

893
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,310
something was off,

894
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,310
had no appetite,

895
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,610
and the bleeding

896
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,610
seemed heavy,

897
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,810
but I didn't know

898
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,810
if heavy to me was normal

899
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,810
to the doctors, you know.

900
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,880
Bleeding can be difficult

901
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,880
to gauge and is subjective.

902
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,780
And even harder

903
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,780
to evaluate over

904
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,780
the phone.

905
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,690
Should I still be bleeding?

906
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,400
Doris, give her a gram of TXA,

907
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,400
0.2 milligrams methergin,

908
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,840
and I'll also need

909
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,840
1,000 micrograms of Cytotec.

910
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,410
Yep.

911
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,770
Don't worry.

912
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,770
We can handle this.

913
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,750
It's okay.

914
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,680
So this is those referrals

915
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,680
that I was telling you about.

916
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,660
Top two guys

917
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,660
on the list are excellent.

918
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,660
I know them personally...

919
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,850
Dr. Charles, you know,

920
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,850
you've been very thorough,

921
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,850
but I'm all set.

922
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,020
Hey, just in case, you know.

923
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,020
And, look, good luck

924
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,020
with the election.

925
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,390
We can't

926
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,390
go out this way.

927
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,900
Mathews must have followed

928
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,900
my car here.

929
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Oh, God,

930
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
this can't happen.

931
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,400
They can't see me.

932
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,400
I have to get out of here.

933
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,810
Is there another exit

934
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,810
we could use?

935
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,350
You know, we might be able

936
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,350
to get you out through

937
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,350
the waiting room. Yeah.

938
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,640
No, there could be

939
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,640
more press out there.

940
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,640
Damn it.

941
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,510
How could you

942
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,510
let this happen, Carla?

943
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,640
Hey.

944
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,640
What am I

945
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,640
supposed to do?

946
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,850
It's okay. It's okay.

947
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,420
This could ruin me.

948
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,850
Look, you'll be all right,

949
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,850
all right.

950
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,950
Keep...

951
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,950
Oh, God,

952
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,550
Okay, breathe in

953
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,550
and out.

954
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,550
The insinuation.

955
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,290
In through the nose.

956
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,290
The rumors.

957
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,450
Oh, God.

958
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,890
Richard, you're all right.

959
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,890
Come here.

960
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,290
Come sit over here.

961
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,290
No, I can't!

962
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,660
No, no. Get over here.

963
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,290
Sit down.

964
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,290
You need to sit down.

965
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,730
Okay, look at me.

966
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,730
Look at me.

967
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,810
Look at me. Breathe in

968
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,810
through the nose

969
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,430
and out through

970
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,430
your mouth.

971
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,530
With me.

972
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,800
In through the nose.

973
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,570
There you go.

974
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,700
There you go.

975
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,700
You're fine.

976
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,310
Okay.

977
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,310
Out through the mouth.

978
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,520
Zach, Paola Rivera,

979
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,520
the other half of the MVC,

980
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,320
delayed tension

981
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,320
pneumothorax.

982
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,690
Needle decompressed her

983
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,690
in the car.

984
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,780
Aw jeez, got it.

985
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,880
Going to 2.

986
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,690
Maggie, she's okay.

987
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,590
You need a breather.

988
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,530
Yeah.

989
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,730
Good job.

990
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,430
Thank you.

991
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,980
Spleen's out.

992
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,950
Rose's bleeding

993
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,950
is under control.

994
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,350
I'll just close and move

995
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,350
to the ICU.

996
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,010
You better

997
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,010
chest X-ray.

998
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,680
Widened mediastinum

999
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,680
could mean an aortic injury.

1000
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,780
Yeah.

1001
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,620
Once she's warm,

1002
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,620
we'll get her over to CT,

1003
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,620
clearer imaging.

1004
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,660
In the meantime,

1005
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,660
we can control

1006
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,660
her blood pressure

1007
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,750
and heart rate.

1008
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,460
But if we find anything,

1009
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,460
we gotta move her again

1010
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,900
to IR in order to stent.

1011
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,900
Yep.

1012
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,400
That's protocol.

1013
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,400
Come on, let's go.

1014
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,070
Look, Dean, if it's

1015
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,070
a contained pseudoaneurysm,

1016
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,730
we're playing musical chairs

1017
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,730
with a ticking time bomb.

1018
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,870
I really think

1019
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,870
that we should

1020
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,870
take her to 2.0.

1021
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,070
All right, listen,

1022
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,070
she's still being

1023
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,070
resuscitated.

1024
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,880
I mean,

1025
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,880
who knows if she'll

1026
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,880
even be able to undergo

1027
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,970
another procedure?

1028
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,450
We have to warm her

1029
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,450
either way.

1030
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,610
Might as well do so

1031
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,610
where we can knock out all

1032
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,610
our birds with one stone.

1033
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,490
Listen, 2.0 has advanced

1034
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,490
imaging sensors.

1035
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,060
If the aortagram

1036
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,060
finds anything,

1037
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,460
we can stent right there.

1038
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,460
If Rose takes a turn,

1039
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,460
we can easily convert to open.

1040
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,860
No waiting, no scrambling.

1041
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,800
Come on. I mean,

1042
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,800
don't risk our patient where

1043
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,800
there's another way.

1044
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,440
All right,

1045
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,440
after we close,

1046
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,440
we'll get her over to 2.0,

1047
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,630
but it's still my case.

1048
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,070
Yeah, of course.

1049
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,100
Thank you.

1050
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,190
Hey, by any chance,

1051
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,190
did you build that

1052
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,190
neural whatever?

1053
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,720
Neural network? Yeah.

1054
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,160
I fooled around

1055
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,160
with it. Why?

1056
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,930
Jason had another seizure.

1057
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,090
I got him out of it,

1058
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,090
but two seizures

1059
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,090
this close together,

1060
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,860
risk of anoxia

1061
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,860
is increasing.

1062
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,630
I'm on the edge

1063
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,630
of intubating him.

1064
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,470
I'm running out

1065
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,470
of ideas.

1066
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,670
I thought it might be

1067
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,670
Tay-Sachs or Batten disease

1068
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,800
or Wernicke's,

1069
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,800
but I'm basically guessing.

1070
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,180
Can I send you Jason's DNA

1071
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,180
to run through your system?

1072
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,810
Absolutely.

1073
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,010
I pulled from every

1074
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,010
public genetic database,

1075
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,140
but they're so new,

1076
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,140
there isn't a ton of data.

1077
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,480
I think I'll need to borrow

1078
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,480
from a few private companies

1079
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,850
to expand the pool.

1080
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,020
Okay.

1081
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,490
How long do you think

1082
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,490
it'll take to get

1083
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,490
the diagnosis?

1084
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,160
An hour,

1085
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,160
maybe a little longer.

1086
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,960
I don't know if Jason

1087
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,960
has an hour.

1088
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,470
Is there any way

1089
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,470
you can buy me

1090
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,470
more time?

1091
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,010
So you wanna put

1092
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,010
my son in a coma?

1093
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,670
Temporarily, yes.

1094
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,640
The barbiturates

1095
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,640
would reduce

1096
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,640
the likelihood

1097
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,080
of another seizure,

1098
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,080
and he would be

1099
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,840
on a ventilator,

1100
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,840
which would

1101
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,840
protect his airway.

1102
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,780
So you can what,

1103
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,780
Google search

1104
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,780
his diagnosis?

1105
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,870
You can't be serious.

1106
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,880
The neural network

1107
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,880
is scanning nearly half

1108
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,880
a million patient profiles.

1109
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,080
If Jason's genetic mutation

1110
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,080
has been documented even once,

1111
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,850
we'll find it.

1112
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,720
And if it hasn't been

1113
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,720
documented?

1114
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,960
Hey, I know

1115
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,960
we're asking a lot,

1116
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,830
but this is Jason's

1117
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,830
best chance for

1118
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,830
a swift diagnosis.

1119
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,060
Okay.

1120
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,070
Do what you have to

1121
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,070
to save him.

1122
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,230
Thank you.

1123
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,100
All right,

1124
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,100
I'll page anesthesia.

1125
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,280
Dr. Asher, we need you.

1126
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,590
Shouldn't the drugs

1127
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,590
have stopped this?

1128
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,800
Laurel, I'm afraid

1129
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,800
you have what we call

1130
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,800
uterine atony.

1131
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,610
What's that mean?

1132
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,110
Your uterus can't contract

1133
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,110
enough to compress

1134
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,110
the blood vessels,

1135
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,740
so you will keep bleeding.

1136
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,680
Until what, I die?

1137
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,820
Unless we act quickly.

1138
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,790
Okay, what can we do?

1139
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,990
Well, we only have

1140
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,990
one option left:

1141
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,820
a total hysterectomy.

1142
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,600
No.

1143
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,930
No, no, no, wait.

1144
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,800
Wait, please.

1145
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,800
There must be

1146
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,800
something else.

1147
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,740
I'm so sorry, but there's not.

1148
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,740
You are decompensating

1149
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,740
too quickly.

1150
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,070
Come on.

1151
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,070
She's just 26.

1152
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,740
We just started our family.

1153
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,940
I know, and I wish

1154
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,940
that there was another way.

1155
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,580
But in my opinion,

1156
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,580
a hysterectomy

1157
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,850
is the only way I can

1158
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,850
guarantee saving your life.

1159
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,160
Just... Just do it.

1160
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,260
Get me home to my baby.

1161
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,890
I promise.

1162
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,680
Archer.

1163
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,650
Yeah.

1164
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,390
I feel like I'm operating

1165
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,390
at a freaking sports bar.

1166
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,090
All right, let's get

1167
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,090
the stent measurement.

1168
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,060
2.0 can calculate

1169
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,060
that for you.

1170
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,960
Yeah? You think it can

1171
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,960
give me the over-under

1172
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,960
on the Blackhawks?

1173
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,760
All right, we've got

1174
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,760
a 31-millimeter diameter.

1175
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,030
Calculating.

1176
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,960
Wait, wait, wait. Come on.

1177
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,960
Just keep that up there,

1178
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,960
will you?

1179
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,730
Recommend stent size,

1180
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,330
thirty-two millimeters

1181
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,330
with proximal neck

1182
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,330
of 18 millimeters.

1183
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,040
Suggest placing

1184
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,040
1 millimeter distal

1185
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,240
to the left subclavian artery.

1186
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,870
Looks good to me.

1187
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,180
Get the stent please.

1188
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,090
Don't you be smirking

1189
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,090
under that mask.

1190
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,060
Oh, I wouldn't

1191
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,060
dream of it.

1192
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,060
Yeah.

1193
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,920
Thank you.

1194
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,920
All right.

1195
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,660
All right,

1196
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,660
nice and easy.

1197
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,830
User's heart rate is elevated.

1198
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,130
Fine motor coordination

1199
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,130
may be compromised.

1200
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,670
Risk assessment increased 7%.

1201
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,110
That thing talking about me?

1202
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,940
Yeah, it says your rate's

1203
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,940
up to 110. You okay?

1204
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,870
Steady as a rock.

1205
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,980
User's heart rate is elevated.

1206
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,050
Risk of surgical error

1207
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,050
increased by 1 1%.

1208
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,780
Come on. Would you

1209
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,780
shut that thing up?

1210
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,910
Listen, I could step in,

1211
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,910
deploy the stent.

1212
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,360
Dr. Marcel, do you think

1213
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,360
I'm incapable

1214
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,690
of completing

1215
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,690
this procedure?

1216
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,690
I didn't say that.

1217
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,390
Okay, then stop trying

1218
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,390
to make friends with

1219
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,390
a machine and assist me.

1220
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,400
Heart rate is now 1 15.

1221
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,760
For Christ's sake, stop...

1222
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,270
Stop it already.

1223
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,270
What the hell?

1224
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,270
System malfunction.

1225
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,360
Dean.

1226
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,360
Error.

1227
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,940
System malfunction.

1228
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,940
Relax.

1229
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,230
We'll deal with that later.

1230
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,230
We have a patient

1231
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,230
on the table.

1232
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,470
That was unnecessary.

1233
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,270
System malfunction.

1234
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,740
Error. System malfunction.

1235
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,080
It's over.

1236
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,320
My campaign, everything

1237
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,320
I've worked towards for years,

1238
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,390
gone.

1239
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,720
You know, I'm just not

1240
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,720
so sure that that's

1241
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,720
actually the case.

1242
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,760
That kind of thinking,

1243
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,760
by the way, we call it

1244
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,760
catastrophizing

1245
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,890
'cause, you know,

1246
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,890
anxiety will do that.

1247
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,020
This is a catastrophe.

1248
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,020
Well...

1249
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,830
Did you miss my meltdown

1250
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,830
out there?

1251
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,400
You know,

1252
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,400
that wasn't my first.

1253
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,490
They keep coming.

1254
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,360
They keep getting worse.

1255
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,360
Hmm.

1256
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,970
What about if I have

1257
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,970
one in public?

1258
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,270
You think the electorate

1259
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,270
wants to see that

1260
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,940
or hear how sometimes

1261
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,940
I get so panicked that

1262
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,940
I can't think or function?

1263
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,250
Half the time,

1264
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,250
I have no clue why

1265
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,250
I'm even anxious.

1266
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,120
Yeah, you know,

1267
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,120
that sounds like

1268
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,120
a real winner.

1269
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,060
I don't think

1270
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,060
you realize

1271
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,060
how many people

1272
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,760
actually go through

1273
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,760
precisely the experience

1274
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,760
you're describing.

1275
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,060
You know, did you know

1276
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,060
that fully 20%

1277
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,060
of American adults

1278
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,360
struggle with anxiety

1279
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,360
disorders of some kind?

1280
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,990
You just confirmed it.

1281
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,200
I'm crazy.

1282
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,070
No one will elect me,

1283
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,070
the mentally ill guy.

1284
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,070
Would you?

1285
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,970
Do you mind if I tell you

1286
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,970
something personal

1287
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,970
about myself?

1288
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,410
A long time ago,

1289
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,410
I was actually diagnosed

1290
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,410
with depression,

1291
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,480
and I vividly recall

1292
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,480
what a blow that was.

1293
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:36,160
How ashamed I felt,

1294
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:36,160
like I was defective.

1295
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,100
And then a really

1296
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,100
smart person asked me

1297
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,790
if I would

1298
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,790
feel embarrassed

1299
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,930
if I'd been diagnosed

1300
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,930
with diabetes,

1301
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,340
if I had

1302
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,340
a heart condition.

1303
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,370
Of course not.

1304
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,070
Really helped me reframe

1305
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,070
my diagnosis,

1306
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,340
because that's what it was,

1307
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,340
Richard. It was a diagnosis.

1308
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,820
All of a sudden,

1309
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,820
I had a name

1310
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,820
for how I felt.

1311
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,850
Right? I had a path

1312
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,850
towards help.

1313
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,920
You are not crazy,

1314
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,920
my friend.

1315
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,830
I think you're making

1316
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,830
assumptions about what

1317
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,830
other people think

1318
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,460
and letting it influence

1319
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,460
your decisions.

1320
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,270
What is that?

1321
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,270
He's having a seizure.

1322
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,270
Another one.

1323
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,310
Give him another

1324
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,310
1.5 of Ativan.

1325
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,310
You said the coma

1326
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,310
would stop them,

1327
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,310
that this would help him.

1328
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,940
This is much less traumatic

1329
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,940
than if he were awake.

1330
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,410
Baby, it's okay.

1331
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,850
Stay with us.

1332
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,010
We love you.

1333
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,590
Now we're just

1334
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,590
watching him die.

1335
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,590
I'm not doing this again.

1336
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,880
Do something more.

1337
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,020
Autosomal recessive

1338
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,020
thiamine metabolism

1339
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,020
dysfunction, syndrome 2.

1340
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,320
What? What does

1341
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,320
that all mean?

1342
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,130
It's what's wrong with Jason,

1343
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,130
and it's treatable.

1344
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,900
It's a really rare disorder

1345
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,900
where Jason can't

1346
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,900
transmit thiamine

1347
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,130
from his blood to his brain.

1348
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,630
Yeah, thiamine

1349
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,630
helps the body produce

1350
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,630
energy from food.

1351
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,530
So we'll hit him

1352
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,530
with a heavy dose.

1353
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,050
After that, over-the-counter

1354
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,050
supplements should resolve

1355
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,050
the problem.

1356
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,880
Jason's gonna be okay.

1357
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,510
Are you sure this time?

1358
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,280
Yes.

1359
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,550
Absolutely.

1360
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,490
So I'm very interested

1361
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,490
to get your input

1362
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,490
on all this.

1363
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,570
I can see you're busy,

1364
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,570
so I'll just paraphrase

1365
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,570
my email.

1366
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,190
Dr. Asher,

1367
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,190
you can't just burst

1368
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,190
into our meeting.

1369
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,240
The Department of Public

1370
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,240
Health has a new program

1371
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,140
partnering with hospitals

1372
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,140
for in-home postpartum

1373
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,140
wellness checks

1374
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,570
on mom and baby.

1375
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,010
We need to join.

1376
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,340
Yes, I'm familiar

1377
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,340
with it.

1378
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,180
However, it requires

1379
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,180
too much in terms of cost

1380
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,180
and resources.

1381
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,380
It's pennies to you.

1382
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,180
We can revisit it

1383
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,180
once the initiative

1384
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,180
proves its worth.

1385
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,390
Mr. Dayton,

1386
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,390
it has already

1387
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,390
proven its worth.

1388
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,220
I just did a full hysterectomy

1389
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,220
on a 26-year-old.

1390
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,190
For nine days,

1391
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,190
she was bleeding so badly,

1392
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,240
she almost died,

1393
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,240
and no one knew

1394
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,240
because no one saw her.

1395
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,360
If my patient would have

1396
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,360
had that program,

1397
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,240
a nurse trained

1398
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,240
in postpartum care

1399
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,140
could have seen that

1400
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,140
that bleeding wasn't normal

1401
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,340
and gotten her help

1402
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,340
before she hemorrhaged.

1403
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,670
Instead, she has given up

1404
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,670
the chance at more children.

1405
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,710
This never had to happen.

1406
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,420
So put your money

1407
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,420
to good use and sign us up.

1408
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,520
Okay.

1409
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,620
Get us enrolled.

1410
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,620
Okay.

1411
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,370
Would you excuse me, please?

1412
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,300
Hey, hold on.

1413
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,380
How's Rose?

1414
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,010
Should be able

1415
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,010
to extubate her soon.

1416
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,090
I'll connect with ortho,

1417
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,090
schedule her pelvic

1418
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,090
fixation for tomorrow.

1419
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,450
We'll leave her

1420
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,450
wrapped up

1421
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,450
in the meantime.

1422
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,650
Paola's stable,

1423
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,650
and she's really

1424
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,650
anxious about her.

1425
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,230
She'll be able to visit

1426
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,230
with Rose shortly.

1427
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,320
Great.

1428
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,130
Thank you, doctors.

1429
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,130
Yeah.

1430
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,190
Hey, Dean, I know you

1431
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,190
didn't mean to...

1432
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,000
Here we go.

1433
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,000
No, listen.

1434
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,470
2.0 adds a lot of value

1435
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,470
to what we do.

1436
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,670
It did in seconds

1437
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,670
what usually takes

1438
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,670
us half an hour.

1439
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,300
Yeah, it's a backseat

1440
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,300
driver, man.

1441
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,570
It's a tool, just like any

1442
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,570
other instrument in the ER.

1443
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,740
Except I don't need

1444
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,740
a scalpel to tell me

1445
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,740
my heart rate is up.

1446
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,040
I know it's up, and I make

1447
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,040
the adjustment.

1448
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,180
2.0 just takes some time

1449
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,180
to get used to.

1450
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,020
Yeah, maybe that's

1451
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,020
the difference between us

1452
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,280
all right, 'cause I trust

1453
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,280
my hands and my instincts,

1454
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,520
and you've abdicated

1455
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,520
your judgment to a machine.

1456
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,490
Come on, Dean. I mean...

1457
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,430
You broke it deliberately,

1458
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,430
didn't you?

1459
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,160
Hold on. No,

1460
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,160
it was an accident.

1461
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,560
You're fired, Dr. Archer.

1462
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,300
That's not necessary.

1463
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,300
I'm not talking to you.

1464
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,430
I want you off campus

1465
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,430
in 30 minutes.

1466
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,610
I'll get my things.

1467
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,360
I can come back.

1468
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,360
No.

1469
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,730
No, no, I was actually...

1470
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,730
I was looking for you.

1471
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,600
I want to talk to you

1472
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,600
about this morning.

1473
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,400
I just felt a little...

1474
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,110
I don't know.

1475
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,110
Felt a little weird

1476
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,330
the way we

1477
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,330
left it. Yeah.

1478
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,330
Okay.

1479
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,180
Yeah. I couldn't help

1480
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,180
noticing that people were...

1481
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,840
I don't know,

1482
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,840
looking at us

1483
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,840
a little funny.

1484
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,810
Yes, I saw it, too.

1485
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,520
So I don't know.

1486
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,490
I'm just...

1487
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,490
I'm sorry if it

1488
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,490
made you uncomfortable.

1489
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,490
I think you were, too.

1490
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,120
Oh, sure.

1491
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,220
Absolutely.

1492
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,420
Is that's why you told

1493
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,420
that man I was a singer?

1494
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,730
I think I wanted him

1495
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,730
to know how...

1496
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,100
How wonderful you are.

1497
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,500
So he wouldn't just think

1498
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,500
that I was a housekeeper?

1499
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,400
What?

1500
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,340
No. No.

1501
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,710
Are you sure?

1502
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,220
Yeah, I think I'm sure.

1503
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,650
I mean, I don't know.

1504
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,650
Daniel,

1505
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,460
I will never be

1506
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,460
a true opera singer.

1507
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,750
I know my voice,

1508
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,750
and I'm happy.

1509
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,530
But I am wondering

1510
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,530
if that can be

1511
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,530
enough for you.

1512
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,750
I suddenly hear

1513
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,750
my old med school professor

1514
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,760
reminding me adherence

1515
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,760
to orthodoxy

1516
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,730
is the physician's curse.

1517
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,700
I wonder if you might train me

1518
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,700
on that new EMR program

1519
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,700
you were talking about.

1520
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,500
No, you're gonna

1521
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,500
have to wait.

1522
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,400
I wanna modify

1523
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,400
the dictation

1524
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,400
microphone

1525
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,270
so doctors don't have

1526
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,270
their noses in iPads

1527
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,270
when talking to patients.

1528
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,240
Excellent idea.

1529
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,720
We need to talk.

1530
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,700
Look, I don't have time

1531
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,700
to discuss my decision.

1532
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,460
You fired

1533
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,460
the chief of my ED.

1534
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,630
You need to make time.

1535
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,930
Your ED?

1536
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,500
Personnel decisions

1537
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,500
fall under my authority.

1538
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,930
Feel free to weigh in

1539
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,930
on his replacement.

1540
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,370
Dr. Archer is a vital part

1541
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,370
of our hospital.

1542
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,380
His knowledge,

1543
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,380
his experience,

1544
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,540
his leadership...

1545
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,840
Dr. Archer is a liability.

1546
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,320
He destroyed

1547
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,320
expensive equipment.

1548
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,450
He's antagonistic towards

1549
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,450
my staff and a general pain

1550
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,450
in my ass.

1551
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,250
Now, look, I'm happy

1552
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,250
to consult with you

1553
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,250
over matters

1554
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,560
concerning the operation

1555
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,560
of this hospital,

1556
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,930
but this decision

1557
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,930
is final.

1558
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,470
If Dr. Archer goes,

1559
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,470
then I go.

1560
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,430
Are you serious?

1561
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,640
Over Dean Archer?

1562
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,640
I am.

1563
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,650
He steps out of line again,

1564
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,650
it's on you.

1565
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,260
Hello.

1566
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,350
Brought you

1567
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,350
a visitor.

1568
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,520
Hey.

1569
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,960
How are you feeling?

1570
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,860
Like I got hit

1571
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,860
by a bus.

1572
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,460
Or a souped-up

1573
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,460
sports car,

1574
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,460
I guess.

1575
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,630
Sense of humor's intact.

1576
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,400
That's a good sign.

1577
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,400
Yeah.

1578
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,410
Maybe we should let you

1579
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,410
get some rest.

1580
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,410
No.

1581
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,840
Stay.

1582
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,440
Please stay.

1583
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,350
I'm sorry.

1584
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,530
Come on in.

1585
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,570
Hey.

1586
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,580
You're working late.

1587
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,680
Yeah.

1588
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,820
Well...

1589
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,470
Look, Ben,

1590
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,460
the longer

1591
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,460
we don't talk,

1592
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,540
it's like the bigger

1593
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,540
the divide

1594
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,540
between us becomes,

1595
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,870
and I can't stand it.

1596
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,870
You can't?

1597
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,110
Maggie, you lied to me.

1598
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,120
I'm sorry.

1599
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,090
And I know that I need

1600
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,090
to earn back your trust,

1601
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,140
but I can't let

1602
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,140
this stupid mistake ruin

1603
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,900
the best thing that's ever

1604
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,900
happened to me.

1605
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,440
I'm not gonna give up on us.

1606
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,940
Our marriage, our...

1607
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,650
Our love

1608
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,650
is stronger than this.
