1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,360
I mean, Hannah's kind

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,360
and super cute.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,340
She's a catch, no question.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,340
But you're still in recovery.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,500
But Sean,

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,500
he's a donor match

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,500
for you, Dean.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,700
We can get you in

9
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,700
for surgery next month.

10
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,540
Did you talk

11
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,540
to Sean today?

12
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,080
He's not answering his phone.

13
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,080
Didn't show up for work.

14
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,710
Try not

15
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,710
to think the worst.

16
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,550
2.0 put Med

17
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,550
on the map.

18
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,650
To show just how much

19
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,650
I believe in this OR suite,

20
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,450
I'm gonna put

21
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,450
my life in its hands.

22
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,590
2.0 hitting the stock exchange

23
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,590
benefits Dayton Corporation,

24
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,590
not Chicago Med.

25
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
The large lesion

26
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
that Crockett attempted

27
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
to ablate?

28
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,330
It's not on

29
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,330
Richard's CT.

30
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,600
2.0 created the lesion

31
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,600
on its own?

32
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,010
Crockett wasn't responsible

33
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,010
for Richard Evans' death.

34
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,300
2.0 was.

35
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,740
Hey.

36
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,210
I don't have long.

37
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,380
Got a meeting with Goodwin

38
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,380
and legal. What's up?

39
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,480
If it's about

40
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,480
Richard Evans' death,

41
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,480
cancel that meeting.

42
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,150
What?

43
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,590
You were not

44
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,590
responsible.

45
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,590
Aw, come on, Will.

46
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,160
You saw

47
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,160
the surgical record.

48
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,460
I got too close

49
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,460
to the hepatic vein.

50
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,690
I caused the clot.

51
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,130
Because you were trying

52
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,130
to ablate a large lesion.

53
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,290
Yeah, so?

54
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,290
It's still my fault.

55
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,100
No, because actually

56
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,100
that lesion wasn't there.

57
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,070
What do you mean?

58
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,070
It didn't exist.

59
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,330
Yes, it did.

60
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,170
It was clearly evident

61
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,170
in the intraoperative CT.

62
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,140
Right. 2.0's CT

63
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,140
during surgery,

64
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,770
but take a look

65
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,770
at the pre-op CT.

66
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,790
They're not there.

67
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,110
I don't understand.

68
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,420
How could what 2.0

69
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,420
showed be so different?

70
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,430
2.0 made it up.

71
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,390
During surgery,

72
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,390
you asked 2.0

73
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,390
for navigational guidance.

74
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,300
It didn't have the data

75
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,300
to give you that guidance,

76
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,340
so it created a lesion

77
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,340
that did not exist.

78
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,630
Why would it do that?

79
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,630
Unfortunately, in a way,

80
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,730
we've taught 2.0

81
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,730
to please us.

82
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,570
What it did was a misguided

83
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,570
attempt to help you.

84
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,340
We're actually seeing this

85
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,340
across various AI chat bots.

86
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,310
But in 2.0's case,

87
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,310
it's not as harmless

88
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,310
as giving you

89
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,640
the wrong

90
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,640
driving directions.

91
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,380
It can kill someone.

92
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,470
It did.

93
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,490
And until

94
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,490
we can figure out how

95
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,490
to install guardrails,

96
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,790
we've got to shut it down.

97
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,690
So, Jack launched

98
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,690
his IPO.

99
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,670
Yeah, it's a big day

100
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,670
for him.

101
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,360
And us.

102
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,500
Ah, I don't know

103
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,500
that Jack's corporate

104
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,500
business impacts us.

105
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,280
Why don't you go over

106
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,280
and say hello?

107
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,680
I got my phone

108
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,680
to keep me company.

109
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,220
Ah, I think

110
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,220
she looks busy.

111
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,810
You two having problems?

112
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,360
Kind of had a row

113
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,360
last night.

114
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,190
You know? I asked her

115
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,190
to move in with me.

116
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,310
Oh.

117
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,260
Uh, and it was a mistake,

118
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,260
I take it?

119
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,830
I guess it was.

120
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,400
I mean...

121
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,830
I don't know.

122
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,830
Maybe it was the timing.

123
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,460
Right?

124
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,430
Look, she just lost

125
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,430
her life savings

126
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,430
and her apartment.

127
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,230
That's another conversation.

128
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,570
But she's broke,

129
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,570
doesn't have a place

130
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,570
to live.

131
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,730
Oh?

132
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,730
Yeah.

133
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,770
Said I was treating her

134
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,770
like a charity case.

135
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,570
Yikes.

136
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,570
What?

137
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,370
Yeah, and why didn't I ask her

138
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,370
to move in before?

139
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,310
That's a tough one,

140
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,310
Daniel.

141
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,380
I mean, I can get how

142
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,380
she'd feel that way.

143
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,680
She seems like a pretty

144
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,680
independent woman.

145
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,810
I don't know.

146
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,790
Why didn't I

147
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,790
ask her before?

148
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,330
I don't know.

149
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,400
Is Sean here?

150
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,400
Yeah.

151
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,490
What happened?

152
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,490
He's okay, Dean.

153
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
He fell off the wagon,

154
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
passed out.

155
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,400
A friend brought him in,

156
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,400
said it was alcohol

157
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,400
and benzos.

158
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,630
We're running

159
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,630
a tox screen

160
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,630
just to make sure

161
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,640
there's nothing else.

162
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,640
How's he being treated?

163
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,240
Heavy fluids and dextrose,

164
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,240
a dose of flumazenil.

165
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,870
He's awake right now.

166
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,360
Hello, son.

167
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,650
I'm so sorry.

168
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,880
No, it's all right.

169
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,880
It's all right.

170
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,590
I let you down.

171
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,590
No.

172
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,390
It's gonna be okay.

173
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,830
We'll get past this.

174
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,830
Just rest.

175
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,980
Dr. Johnson,

176
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,980
I'm Dr. Halstead.

177
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,270
What've you got?

178
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,400
Husband and wife.

179
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,680
Fred and Janice Anderson.

180
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,580
Early 50s, MVC.

181
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,620
Car went off the road

182
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,620
into a tree.

183
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,660
Fred was trapped for several

184
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,660
minutes inside the vehicle

185
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,660
while it was on fire.

186
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,280
He was extricated

187
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,280
and intubated

188
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,280
due to stridor

189
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,380
and respiratory distress

190
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,380
from smoke inhalation.

191
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,560
Carboxyhemoglobin tested

192
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,560
in the helo was 55.

193
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,460
Janice was able

194
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,460
to self-extricate,

195
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,830
complained of chest pain.

196
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,840
Gave her 50 of fentanyl

197
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,840
en route, satting at 95,

198
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,840
GCS 15.

199
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,600
Let's go.

200
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,410
Airway's intact.

201
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,410
Bilateral breath sounds.

202
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,610
Heart rate 122.

203
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,610
BP 130/86.

204
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,010
Same as en route.

205
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,510
All right.

206
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,350
No outward signs

207
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,350
of blunt force trauma.

208
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,440
X-ray?

209
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,650
Chest first, Mike.

210
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,890
Clear.

211
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,360
That looks okay.

212
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,460
Okay, now pelvis.

213
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,390
Clear.

214
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,400
That looks good too.

215
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,500
All right.

216
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,730
All right, Nancy,

217
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,730
call over to CT.

218
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,000
Let them know

219
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,000
we're sending him

220
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,000
for a pan scan.

221
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,400
Got it.

222
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,650
Loren.

223
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,650
Maggie.

224
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,050
You're running

225
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,050
an air ambulance now?

226
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,610
Yeah, I got

227
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,610
my accreditation.

228
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,880
Guess we're seeing

229
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,880
more of you.

230
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,510
Vitals are good.

231
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,650
Satting at 95

232
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,650
on two liters

233
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,650
of oxygen.

234
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,990
C-spine?

235
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,490
Clinically clear.

236
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,690
She has a couple broken ribs,

237
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,690
minor pulmonary contusion.

238
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,990
Nothing serious.

239
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,660
Okay. Thanks, Kai.

240
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,660
Yeah.

241
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,600
Ms. Anderson,

242
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,600
are you still

243
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,600
feeling pain?

244
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,330
It's not that.

245
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,070
Can you tell me

246
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,070
what happened

247
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,070
with the accident?

248
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,480
Janice?

249
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,980
My husband...

250
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,980
Fred is stable.

251
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,890
What is it?

252
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,450
He tried to kill us.

253
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,400
He tried to kill us!

254
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,840
Hey, Jack.

255
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,580
Hey, Crockett.

256
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,820
I was just headed up

257
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,820
to pre-op,

258
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,720
see if I could find

259
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,720
a flattering gown.

260
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,820
Fat chance, huh?

261
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,820
Yeah, well, listen.

262
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,830
We can't do your

263
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,830
hernia repair in 2.0.

264
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,760
Sure we can.

265
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,760
That's the whole point.

266
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,560
No. We discovered

267
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,560
there's a serious problem

268
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,560
with the system.

269
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,660
Come on, Crockett.

270
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,100
You're not still

271
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,100
beating yourself up over

272
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,100
Richard Evans, are you?

273
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,740
I told you,

274
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,740
the entire surgery

275
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,740
was a Hail Mary.

276
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,540
He was terminal

277
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,540
to begin with.

278
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,110
Jack, the AI

279
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,110
gives bad advice.

280
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,850
Hell, it makes stuff up.

281
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,850
We got to shut it down.

282
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,110
Look, every surgeon

283
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,110
makes mistakes,

284
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,110
all right?

285
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,110
Even the best.

286
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,680
Don't blame the scalpel.

287
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,980
2.0 sent me after a lesion

288
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,980
that wasn't there.

289
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,990
It produced images

290
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,990
of a tumor

291
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,990
that did not exist.

292
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,060
The platform is defective.

293
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,060
You understand?

294
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,430
Let me show you

295
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,430
the pre-op scans

296
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,430
next to 2.0's.

297
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,060
No, no need.

298
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,830
I trust you.

299
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,900
Right, well, let me

300
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,900
figure out what to do

301
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,900
about this.

302
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,140
Thank you for bringing it

303
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,140
to my attention.

304
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,140
Yeah.

305
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,070
Yeah, of course.

306
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,580
What's up?

307
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,690
Husband and wife, possible

308
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,690
murder-suicide attempt.

309
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,850
At least that's what

310
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,850
the wife says.

311
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,750
I have to tell you,

312
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,750
I don't believe it.

313
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,950
This is Dr. Johnson.

314
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,690
He runs the medevac service

315
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,690
that flew the couple in.

316
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,780
Yeah, I've known them

317
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,780
for years.

318
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,660
The Andersons

319
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,660
are a devoted couple.

320
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,060
Fred could never

321
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,060
do anything like that.

322
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,720
Yeah. Fred's intubated

323
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,720
and currently in

324
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,720
the CT scanner.

325
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,060
Can I talk to her?

326
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,530
Yeah.

327
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,610
Mrs. Anderson,

328
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,610
how are you doing?

329
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,610
I'm Dr. Charles.

330
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,080
Psychiatry?

331
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,510
Can you, to the best

332
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,510
of your ability,

333
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,170
try and, you know,

334
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,170
just tell me what

335
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,170
happened today?

336
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,520
I was driving and

337
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,920
Fred suddenly grabbed

338
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,920
the wheel and turned us

339
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,920
off the road.

340
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,860
Oh, man.

341
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,860
That must have been...

342
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,790
That must

343
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,790
have been terrifying.

344
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,790
Yes.

345
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,760
I screamed at him

346
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,760
just to let go,

347
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,860
and he wouldn't. He...

348
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,900
Before I could brake,

349
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,900
we hit the tree.

350
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,630
Had you been quarreling

351
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,630
or anything?

352
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,770
No!

353
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,640
It's just completely

354
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,640
out of the blue.

355
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,870
Okay.

356
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,970
We've always had

357
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,970
a very happy marriage...

358
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,050
I thought.

359
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,210
So nothing out of the ordinary

360
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,210
recently relationship wise?

361
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,820
I don't know.

362
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,620
Fred has seemed

363
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,620
a little different lately.

364
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,720
Different how?

365
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,700
A little off.

366
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,560
Out of sorts, you know?

367
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,070
Really down.

368
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,000
I always ask him

369
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,000
if anything's wrong.

370
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,230
He always says he's fine.

371
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,170
I just don't understand.

372
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,150
I mean, to do something

373
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,150
like this, it's...

374
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,980
Look, I completely understand

375
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,980
how upsetting this must be,

376
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,110
but I promise you,

377
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,110
we're gonna get some clarity.

378
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,620
All right?

379
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,210
In the meantime,

380
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,210
can you try and get

381
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,210
some rest for me?

382
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,290
All right?

383
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,290
And I'll check back

384
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,290
with you in a bit.

385
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,220
Thank you.

386
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,220
Okay.

387
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,130
Hey, Dean.

388
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,130
Sean's tox screen

389
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,130
came back.

390
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,570
Hi.

391
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,930
You okay?

392
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

393
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,900
Just a headache.

394
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,910
So what about Sean?

395
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,910
Well, good news.

396
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,270
There were no other drugs

397
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,270
in his system.

398
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,600
Cold comfort.

399
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,600
All right. Thanks.

400
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,270
Never should've...

401
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,610
Never should've let him

402
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,610
give me his kidney anyway.

403
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,150
Why?

404
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,740
You think somehow

405
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,740
all this was your fault?

406
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,150
He was already fragile.

407
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,950
I just added another

408
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,950
level of stress.

409
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,750
From my experience, it's...

410
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,920
It's very hard to say

411
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,920
what factors lead to

412
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,920
anybody relapsing.

413
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,120
Well, I'm gonna remove

414
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,120
one of those factors

415
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,200
and tell him

416
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,200
that I don't want

417
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,200
his kidney.

418
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,670
No, Dean.

419
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,260
That's the last thing

420
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,260
that you should do.

421
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,900
Sean already feels terrible.

422
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,900
That'll make him feel worse.

423
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,030
It could send him

424
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,030
into a spiral.

425
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,940
Hannah, we both know

426
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,940
there's a problem with him

427
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,940
donating now anyway.

428
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,950
Yes, but we don't need

429
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,950
to tell Sean that yet.

430
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,850
Okay? Don't take this

431
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,850
away from him.

432
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,090
Dr. Archer,

433
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,090
Maggie wants you

434
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,090
in treatment six.

435
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,350
All right.

436
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,930
Sarah, sweetie?

437
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,930
This is Dr. Archer.

438
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,900
What's going on, Sarah?

439
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,700
Hurts, pretty bad.

440
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,830
Yeah? Abdomen?

441
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,830
For how long?

442
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,800
Couple of days.

443
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,800
It's getting worse.

444
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,030
Okay.

445
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,870
Vitals are normal,

446
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,870
and there's no fever.

447
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,850
Okay. Milligram for

448
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,850
hydromorphone for the pain,

449
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,380
and we're gonna

450
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,380
do an ultrasound.

451
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,880
Will that be okay?

452
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,880
Okay.

453
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,350
All right. Okay.

454
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,350
Can I take these

455
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,350
from you?

456
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,990
Yes. Yes.

457
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,660
Peanuts?

458
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,690
For the squirrels.

459
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,690
Okay.

460
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,930
Okay. It's gonna feel

461
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,930
a little cold.

462
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,230
All right?

463
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,030
I'm not seeing anything

464
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,030
out of the ordinary.

465
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,400
Have you been having

466
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,400
any other symptoms?

467
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,680
Well, I've been...

468
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,900
Constipated.

469
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,980
And that isn't usually

470
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,980
an issue?

471
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,070
Uh-uh.

472
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,070
Okay.

473
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,940
Gonna need to do a CT

474
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,940
of your belly.

475
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,040
It's kind of an X-ray

476
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,040
to help us

477
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,340
find out what's

478
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,340
going on, okay?

479
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,650
The techs will be in

480
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,650
to bring you up to radiology.

481
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,250
Thank you. Thank you both.

482
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,420
Fred's awake and extubated.

483
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,420
You can talk to him now.

484
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,060
Mr. Anderson,

485
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,060
how are you doing?

486
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,060
I'm Dr. Charles.

487
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,960
Loren, is Janice

488
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,960
all right?

489
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,400
Look, she's injured,

490
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,400
Fred, but not seriously.

491
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,970
Oh, thank God.

492
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,060
Can you remember

493
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,060
what happened

494
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,060
this morning?

495
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,230
What did Janice tell you?

496
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,230
That I grabbed the wheel?

497
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,110
Yeah, and, you know,

498
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,110
drove the car off the road.

499
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,420
I can't explain

500
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,420
what happened.

501
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
I wasn't in control.

502
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,890
How do you mean?

503
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,890
It wasn't me.

504
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,360
So... Somebody else

505
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,360
was in the car?

506
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,360
No.

507
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,260
I'm sorry. I'm just

508
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,260
not quite following.

509
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,330
It was this hand.

510
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,760
It grabbed the wheel.

511
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,760
I couldn't stop it.

512
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,790
It wouldn't let go.

513
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,950
"It wasn't me, it was

514
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,950
my hand." I gotta try

515
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,950
that one some time.

516
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,150
What do you

517
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,150
make of it?

518
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,150
I'm not quite sure yet.

519
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,750
I guess

520
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,750
we report it to CPD.

521
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,080
No, it's not

522
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,080
a CPD matter,

523
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,320
and deputies

524
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,320
from Grundy County

525
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,020
where the accident occurred

526
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,020
are investigating.

527
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,290
Okay.

528
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,490
Well, what do you want me

529
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,490
to do with this guy?

530
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,320
You want me to see

531
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,320
if psych unit has a bed?

532
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,370
Let's just hold off

533
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,370
on that for a second.

534
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,960
I'd really like to take a look

535
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,960
at these CAT scans.

536
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,470
Will you give me a shout

537
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,470
when they're up?

538
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,930
All right.

539
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,780
You're still booked

540
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,780
for surgery in 2.0.

541
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,250
Let's pick this up later.

542
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,410
Come on, Jack.

543
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,410
After what I told you?

544
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,110
Look, Crockett,

545
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,110
I appreciate the concern,

546
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,110
but there's no risk here.

547
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,120
You've done the procedure

548
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,120
a million times.

549
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,780
The platform

550
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,780
is defective, Jack.

551
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,330
Come on. Just cancel

552
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,330
the surgery or move it

553
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,330
to a regular OR.

554
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,130
I invited people

555
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,130
to observe 2.0 in action.

556
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,860
These are investors.

557
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,860
These are friends.

558
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,490
I'd look ridiculous,

559
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,490
and forget the IPO.

560
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,960
Jack, you can't promote

561
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,960
a platform that doesn't work.

562
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,130
It's actually dangerous.

563
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,130
Put off the IPO.

564
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,300
I'm not gonna start sowing

565
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,300
doubt into the reliability

566
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,300
of the system.

567
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,940
You can never

568
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,940
recover from that.

569
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,280
Okay, if you don't, I'm sorry,

570
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,280
but I won't do your surgery.

571
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,080
You can't be serious.

572
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,080
Oh, I am.

573
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,310
You know, I could easily

574
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,310
find another ten surgeons

575
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,310
to take your place,

576
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,890
who'd be happy

577
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,890
to take your place.

578
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,220
With or without you,

579
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,220
this surgery

580
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,220
is moving forward.

581
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,190
That's up to you.

582
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,890
Crockett.

583
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,890
Crockett, come on!

584
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,090
You're the face of 2.0.

585
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,090
You have been

586
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,090
from the get-go.

587
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,360
I want you to perform

588
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,360
the surgery.

589
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,940
And look, because it's you,

590
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,940
I will make this promise.

591
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,530
Once the IPO is launched,

592
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,530
I will sideline the platform

593
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,270
until every last bug

594
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,270
is worked out.

595
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,570
Now, how does

596
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,570
that sound? Huh?

597
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,810
Come on, man.

598
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,810
I'm your patient.

599
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,980
That's gotta mean

600
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,980
something to you.

601
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,050
He won't budge.

602
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,520
He's gonna move forward

603
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,520
with the surgery

604
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,520
with or without me.

605
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,220
Then we've gotta go public

606
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,220
with the scans.

607
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,820
Come on, Will.

608
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,820
Forget the legal nightmare.

609
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,820
It won't work.

610
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,420
How can we prove

611
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,420
the veracity

612
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,420
of the scans?

613
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,500
2.0 can make them up.

614
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,500
So can we.

615
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,970
He'll likely accuse me

616
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,970
of trying to cover up

617
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,970
my mistakes.

618
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,900
He's right. Even if

619
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,900
we went down that road

620
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,140
and didn't get hauled

621
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,140
in front of a medical board,

622
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,140
it could take years.

623
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,300
It certainly wouldn't stop

624
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,300
today's surgery.

625
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,040
So? What are you gonna do?

626
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,910
I'm gonna do

627
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,910
the hernia repair.

628
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,420
Why?

629
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,490
If 2.0 does deliver

630
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,490
incorrect scans

631
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,490
or recommendations,

632
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,990
I can't have some novice there

633
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,990
who's gonna get thrown.

634
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,150
I have to protect Jack.

635
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,590
Crockett, listen to me.

636
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,230
Jack promised after the IPO

637
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,230
he'd sideline 2.0 and fix it.

638
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,300
Okay?

639
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,300
And you believe him?

640
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,930
Well, I don't see

641
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,930
as I have a choice.

642
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,210
Hey. Sarah's CT scan

643
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,210
came back.

644
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,380
It's a bowel obstruction

645
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,380
from a sigmoid volvulus.

646
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,580
Her intestine

647
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,580
is twisted on itself.

648
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,450
So let the OR know

649
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,450
we're coming up.

650
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,390
No, we can't have

651
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,390
surgery here.

652
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,250
She has terrible insurance.

653
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,390
Registration just called

654
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,390
and said that Med is not

655
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,390
even in her network.

656
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,190
They won't approve

657
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,190
an operation.

658
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,930
So, obviously, she can't

659
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,930
afford to be out of pocket

660
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,930
for the surgery.

661
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,970
So I just need to transfer her

662
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,970
to a hospital in her network.

663
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,230
That's all.

664
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,230
Yeah.

665
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,310
Hey, Dean.

666
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,310
I'm discharging Sean.

667
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,470
Thanks.

668
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,110
All right.

669
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,110
Sign right here.

670
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,410
Hey.

671
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,910
How you feeling? Huh?

672
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,610
Well, other than

673
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,610
screwing up?

674
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,620
But I am feeling good

675
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,620
about one thing.

676
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,250
I got a message

677
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,250
from Dr. Cameron.

678
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,450
Turns out I'm a match

679
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,450
to donate.

680
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
Pretty great, right?

681
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.

682
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

683
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,690
Look, um,

684
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,690
I know it's no excuse,

685
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,330
but I know why

686
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,330
I fell off the wagon,

687
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,570
and I promise

688
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,570
it won't happen again.

689
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,100
Um...

690
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,610
You guys don't have to hide

691
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,610
your relationship anymore.

692
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,680
I'm okay with it.

693
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,180
Uh...

694
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,310
What?

695
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,310
I don't understand.

696
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,350
I'm gonna be honest.

697
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,620
I have feelings for you.

698
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,460
So when I saw you

699
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,460
and Dad together,

700
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,620
I guess it hit me

701
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,620
pretty hard...

702
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,390
No, hold on. I'm sorry.

703
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,430
What do you mean you

704
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,430
saw us together?

705
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,300
In the doctors' lounge.

706
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,300
Well...

707
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,700
I don't know what

708
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,700
you think you saw.

709
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,730
Whatever it was,

710
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,730
you misinterpreted it.

711
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,200
Dr. Asher and I

712
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,200
are just good friends.

713
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,740
Really?

714
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,740
Absolutely.

715
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
I mean, this?

716
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
No way.

717
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,170
I mean, no way.

718
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,170
Yeah, yeah...

719
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,650
That...

720
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,650
Yeah, okay.

721
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,050
He's got the idea.

722
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,280
Okay.

723
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,520
Sean, I...

724
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,690
I mean, I'm...

725
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,230
I'm touched

726
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,230
by your feelings

727
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,230
for me.

728
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,450
Wow.

729
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,530
I feel pretty stupid.

730
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,500
But, um, like I said,

731
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,500
I'm over it.

732
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,590
I'm just glad

733
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,590
that I'm a match.

734
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,730
Yeah, well,

735
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,730
we're not there yet.

736
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,370
So, you know,

737
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,370
why don't you

738
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,370
just head upstairs,

739
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,640
hang out and grab a bite,

740
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,370
and I'll give you a lift

741
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,370
at the end of my shift?

742
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,780
All right?

743
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,780
Yeah.

744
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,100
All right.

745
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,650
Come in.

746
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,150
Ms. Goodwin,

747
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,150
you have to stop

748
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,150
Jack Dayton's surgery.

749
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,560
That's Dr. Marcel's case.

750
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,460
Why is it your concern?

751
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,600
2.0 is responsible

752
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,600
for the death of my

753
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,600
patient, Richard Evans.

754
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,570
What? How?

755
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,400
Its AI produced

756
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,400
a phantom lesion

757
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,530
that led Crockett to make

758
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,530
a fatal surgical error.

759
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,740
That thing killed

760
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,740
my patient.

761
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,780
That's a very serious

762
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,780
charge, Dr. Halstead.

763
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,350
Does Dayton know this?

764
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,780
Yes, but he's insisting on

765
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,780
going ahead with the surgery

766
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,680
to promote the platform

767
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,680
for his IPO.

768
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,090
And where's

769
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,090
Dr. Marcel in this?

770
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,180
He's stuck.

771
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,280
He won't abandon his patient,

772
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,280
especially because the AI

773
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,280
is unreliable.

774
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,300
Ms. Goodwin,

775
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,300
you are the only person

776
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,300
who can do something.

777
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,700
If Dayton were risking

778
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,700
his life, I could get a court

779
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,700
order to stop it.

780
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,290
But no judge is going to rule

781
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,290
an elective hernia repair

782
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,270
a life-threatening

783
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,270
procedure.

784
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,530
So there's gotta be

785
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,530
another way.

786
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,670
Dr. Halstead,

787
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,270
Chicago Med is now

788
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,270
a for-profit private hospital.

789
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,150
Jack Dayton

790
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,150
basically owns it.

791
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,580
So if he wants a surgery,

792
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,520
I no longer have

793
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,520
the authority to stop it.

794
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,420
I can't stand what

795
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,420
this place has become.

796
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,300
Dr. Charles, there's a couple

797
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,300
deputies here investigating

798
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,300
the accident.

799
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,740
They wanna question

800
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,740
Fred and Janice.

801
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,140
Okay. Well,

802
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,140
take a look at this.

803
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,110
His head CT

804
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,110
came back.

805
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,800
Right here.

806
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,470
Calcification.

807
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,710
Atrophy in

808
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,710
the frontal lobe.

809
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,150
Looks like it happened

810
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,150
a while ago.

811
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,610
Yeah.

812
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,740
I would tell our visitors

813
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,740
to hold off for a bit.

814
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,420
Highly unlikely a crime

815
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,420
was committed here.

816
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,530
So you, Mr. Anderson,

817
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,530
have had a stroke.

818
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,800
A stroke?

819
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,370
A small one,

820
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,370
some time ago.

821
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,200
See right here?

822
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,830
Frontal lobe?

823
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,640
A stroke?

824
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,880
You recall recently

825
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,880
having any headaches,

826
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,880
dizziness, weakness

827
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,880
on one side of the body

828
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,880
or the other?

829
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

830
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,350
Bad headaches,

831
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,350
right before Easter.

832
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,720
Huh.

833
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,660
You know, that would

834
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,660
time out just about right.

835
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,520
How about since then?

836
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,230
I feel weak at times.

837
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,460
I forget things.

838
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,540
I thought that

839
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,540
was just age, maybe.

840
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,900
I've got a hunch

841
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,900
that you have

842
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,900
a very rare neurological

843
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,900
condition called,

844
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,910
believe it or not,

845
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,910
alien hand syndrome.

846
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,770
Can absolutely be

847
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,770
brought on by a stroke

848
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,710
disrupting blood flow

849
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,710
to the primary motor cortex

850
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,910
and causing

851
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,910
involuntary grasping,

852
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,910
difficulty releasing objects.

853
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,420
That's why I grabbed

854
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,420
the steering wheel.

855
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,420
Yeah.

856
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,290
I couldn't let go.

857
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,380
Exactly.

858
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,480
Oh, my God.

859
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,830
I know it's a lot to take in,

860
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,920
but, look, there are

861
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,920
treatment options.

862
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,290
There are.

863
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
We'll need a neurologist

864
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
to confirm, of course,

865
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,240
but the first thing

866
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,240
that I'd like to do is I'd

867
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,240
like to bring your wife

868
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,200
into the conversation.

869
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,200
Would that be all right?

870
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,710
Yeah, please.

871
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,830
Thank you so much.

872
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,780
Okay. I'm about to start

873
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,780
Mr. Dayton's hernia repair.

874
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,410
A hernia is a hole

875
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,410
in the abdominal wall.

876
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,220
For you all to get

877
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,220
a little bit more

878
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,220
about the procedure,

879
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,520
2.0 shows

880
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,520
the patient's anatomy

881
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,520
in three dimensions.

882
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,890
Loading.

883
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,490
First I will open

884
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,490
the skin.

885
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,930
Then I will dissect

886
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,930
the tissues

887
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,900
to define the borders

888
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,900
of the hernia.

889
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,300
Once I have this completed,

890
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,300
then I'll close it primarily

891
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,840
or use a piece of mesh

892
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,840
to bridge the gap.

893
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,670
So how about let's say

894
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,670
we do the real thing?

895
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,800
Dr. Song?

896
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,680
You're good to go.

897
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,680
Great.

898
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,910
Okay. 2.0, what is

899
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,910
the optimal location

900
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,910
to make the incision?

901
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,990
One centimeter cranial

902
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,310
and one centimeter

903
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,310
caudal to the umbilicus.

904
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,520
Okay, very good.

905
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,520
Thank you, Carmela.

906
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,390
Making the incision.

907
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,890
I'm so,

908
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,890
so sorry, Fred.

909
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
Oh, God.

910
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
Are you kidding me?

911
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,430
I don't blame you

912
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,430
at all, sweetie.

913
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,630
What can we do for him?

914
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,470
Well, there's no cure,

915
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,470
per se,

916
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,440
but the condition

917
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,440
is treatable.

918
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,340
There are

919
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,340
several modalities,

920
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,750
visual spatial coaching,

921
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,750
cognitive behavioral therapy.

922
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,950
Um, there are medications.

923
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,280
Oh.

924
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,620
I'm sorry. I have to

925
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,620
make a call.

926
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,630
Woah, Janice, let me

927
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,630
get somebody to...

928
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,320
I'm all right. Really.

929
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,760
I won't be long.

930
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,960
Oh, my God.

931
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,800
Oh, my God.

932
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,800
It's true. I knew it.

933
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,530
Knew what?

934
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,630
She's having an affair.

935
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,330
Having an affair?

936
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,670
You saw how

937
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,670
she left the room

938
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,670
to take a phone call.

939
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,970
I mean,

940
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,970
it's not the first time.

941
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,840
She's been

942
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,840
so secretive,

943
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,840
so distant.

944
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,780
Doesn't necessarily mean

945
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,780
she's having an affair.

946
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,510
Dr. Charles,

947
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,510
what if when

948
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,510
I grabbed the wheel

949
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,780
it was some kind

950
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,780
of a subconscious thing?

951
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,490
Like, you know,

952
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,490
maybe deep down I wanted...

953
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,820
I can assure you, Fred,

954
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,820
that your condition

955
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,520
is entirely neurological.

956
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,520
Okay?

957
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,620
No psychological element.

958
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,620
Nothing subconscious

959
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,620
about it.

960
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,400
End of story.

961
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,560
Okay.

962
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,010
We're still waiting

963
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,010
on the ambulance

964
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,010
to transfer you.

965
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,770
I just put another call in.

966
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,970
Thank you.

967
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,480
Is the pain

968
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,480
getting worse?

969
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,350
Yes. Terrible.

970
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,010
Why don't you lie

971
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,010
on your back and let me

972
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,010
check your stomach?

973
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,950
Okay.

974
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,090
Okay.

975
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,120
Okay. Ready?

976
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,700
Okay. Okay.

977
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,660
You're not going anywhere.

978
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,660
I'll be right back.

979
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,030
Okay.

980
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,940
Dr. Archer?

981
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,940
Yeah?

982
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,980
Sarah Malone,

983
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,980
she's febrile,

984
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,980
she's vomiting,

985
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,640
and her BP's soft.

986
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,110
Most likely fully torsed.

987
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,750
She needs an operation

988
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,750
now before her intestine

989
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,750
becomes necrotic.

990
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,620
By the time the ambulance

991
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,620
gets here and she's

992
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,620
transferred, admitted...

993
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,880
She could die.

994
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,480
Not gonna wait.

995
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,760
All right. We'll have

996
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,760
the operation here.

997
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,420
Okay. But what about

998
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,420
her insurance?

999
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,120
She could be in debt

1000
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,120
for the rest of her life.

1001
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,730
Unless we do the surgery

1002
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,730
off the books.

1003
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,770
Of course, that means

1004
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,770
Jack Dayton's for-profit

1005
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,770
hospital won't be reimbursed.

1006
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,100
Can't say I have

1007
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,100
a problem with that.

1008
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,640
Okay, but how? How?

1009
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,900
We can't take her

1010
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,900
to the main OR.

1011
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,410
I'll just do it

1012
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,410
in her treatment room.

1013
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,140
That's all. Okay?

1014
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,110
Now you use your renowned

1015
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,110
powers of persuasion.

1016
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,080
Get me an anesthesiologist.

1017
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,080
Okay?

1018
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,920
Thank you, Dr. Archer.

1019
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,920
Just the anesthesiologist.

1020
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,150
Come on.

1021
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,150
Okay.

1022
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,620
Okay.

1023
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,600
I'm now freeing up the bowel

1024
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,600
from the hernia sac.

1025
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,930
Warning.

1026
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,730
There has been

1027
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,730
a full thickness

1028
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,730
small bowel enterotomy.

1029
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,870
2.0, I have not

1030
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,870
injured the intestine.

1031
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,200
Please reevaluate.

1032
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,070
Protect the field

1033
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,070
from gross contamination.

1034
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,210
Assess damage and decide

1035
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,210
between primary repair

1036
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,210
versus resection.

1037
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,040
No, that image

1038
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,040
is not correct.

1039
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,780
2.0, I repeat,

1040
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,780
I have not cut

1041
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,780
into the intestine.

1042
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,010
The bowel is intact.

1043
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,890
If you do not address

1044
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,890
perforation,

1045
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,160
there is a 100% chance

1046
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,160
patient will become septic.

1047
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,590
Okay, everyone.

1048
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,190
There is no perforation

1049
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,190
of the bowel.

1050
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,160
No complications

1051
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,160
of any kind.

1052
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,460
2.0 is either off-target

1053
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,460
or its sensors

1054
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,460
are malfunctioning.

1055
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,600
Dr. Song, would you

1056
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,600
please show the gallery

1057
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,830
direct view of the field?

1058
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,030
Coming up.

1059
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,110
Okay.

1060
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,940
As you all can see,

1061
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,020
there is no perforation

1062
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,020
of the bowel whatsoever.

1063
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,050
Repair bowel

1064
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,050
perforation immediately.

1065
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,590
Dr. Marcel, should I

1066
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,590
shut it down?

1067
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,680
Yes.

1068
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,680
Chance of mortality, 90%.

1069
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,130
Ladies and gentlemen,

1070
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,130
I can assure you all,

1071
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,130
Mr. Dayton is not at risk.

1072
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,160
This is a procedure

1073
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,160
I've performed

1074
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,160
hundreds of times.

1075
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,790
I can easily proceed

1076
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,790
without 2.0.

1077
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,930
Continuing to reduce

1078
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,930
the hernia.

1079
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,510
Great, there you are.

1080
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,510
What's up?

1081
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,910
Uh...

1082
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,990
I wondered if you'd come

1083
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,990
spot me in a surgery.

1084
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,610
Laparotomy.

1085
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,780
Spot you?

1086
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,910
Yeah.

1087
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,990
I'm feeling

1088
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,990
a little wobbly.

1089
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,950
I'm an OB, remember?

1090
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,190
Don't you want

1091
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,190
a surgical resident?

1092
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,130
No. See, the circumstances

1093
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,130
are unusual.

1094
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,690
If admin were to find out

1095
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,690
about this, we'd probably

1096
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,690
get fired.

1097
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,230
Ooh.

1098
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,140
What an incentive.

1099
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,110
I take it that

1100
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,110
this is important.

1101
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,810
It would save

1102
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,810
the patient's life.

1103
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,650
Kinda why

1104
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,650
we're here, right?

1105
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,790
It's definitely

1106
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,790
sigmoid volvulus.

1107
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,890
Alpha retractor.

1108
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,730
All right.

1109
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,670
Help me untwist

1110
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,670
the sigmoid.

1111
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,040
There we go.

1112
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,010
Got it?

1113
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,010
Yeah.

1114
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,240
That looks viable.

1115
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,350
Yeah, but the sigmoid

1116
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,350
is really floppy.

1117
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,820
Yeah, it just needs

1118
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,820
to be resected, and...

1119
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,900
And re-anastomosed.

1120
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,330
Uh...

1121
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,830
Dr. Archer?

1122
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,830
Yeah.

1123
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,770
No, I just... For a second,

1124
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,770
let me sit down, will you?

1125
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,900
Uh...

1126
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,900
Okay.

1127
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,940
Thanks. Hannah, you good

1128
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,940
to take over?

1129
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,800
Absolutely.

1130
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,800
All right.

1131
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,340
Marty, how's the patient?

1132
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,770
She was bone dry,

1133
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,770
but after two liters

1134
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,770
of Ringer's

1135
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,210
and one of albumin,

1136
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,210
she's making

1137
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,210
adequate urine.

1138
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,340
Okay, great.

1139
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,050
Let's get this

1140
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,050
sigmoid resected.

1141
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,030
Janice.

1142
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,220
Dr. Charles.

1143
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,230
I'm sorry that I ran out

1144
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,230
like that.

1145
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,800
Is everything okay?

1146
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,960
Actually, I just spoke

1147
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,960
to my doctor,

1148
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,400
and I got some

1149
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,400
very good news.

1150
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,070
Oh, that's who

1151
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,070
texted you?

1152
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,660
Yes.

1153
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,870
I had a biopsy

1154
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,870
a couple of weeks ago,

1155
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,410
and I just found out

1156
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,410
that it's negative.

1157
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,370
Congratulations.

1158
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,370
That's very good news.

1159
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,080
Does your husband

1160
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,080
know about this?

1161
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,950
No. I never told him.

1162
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,350
Like I said, Fred seemed

1163
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,350
to be struggling

1164
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,350
with something.

1165
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,790
I guess it was the stroke,

1166
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,790
but I didn't know it.

1167
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,120
And... Anyway, I didn't want

1168
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,120
to add to his problems.

1169
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,060
I didn't want him

1170
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,060
to worry.

1171
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,400
If I may, I think it might

1172
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,400
be a good time to fill him in.

1173
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,330
I just... I think

1174
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,330
there could be a...

1175
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,410
A pretty serious

1176
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,410
misunderstanding

1177
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,410
brewing here.

1178
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,270
Oh?

1179
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,270
Yeah.

1180
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,340
And, you know,

1181
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,340
maybe the sooner,

1182
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,340
the better.

1183
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,440
Okay.

1184
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,050
Hey, Sarah.

1185
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,810
Uh, you know

1186
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,810
where you are?

1187
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,150
Hospital.

1188
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,920
Okay. Can you press

1189
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,920
against my hand?

1190
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,990
Mmm.

1191
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,990
Okay, great.

1192
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,760
And again.

1193
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,190
Good.

1194
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,300
Sarah.

1195
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,960
You're gonna be

1196
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,960
just fine.

1197
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,940
Mmm. Thank you.

1198
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,010
You are welcome.

1199
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,380
I thought

1200
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,380
you'd be dropping by.

1201
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,780
2.0 is not

1202
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,780
ready to be put

1203
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,780
on the market.

1204
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,290
Not without verification

1205
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,290
of its data set.

1206
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,980
Right now we don't know

1207
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,980
the data sources.

1208
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,030
It could be biased

1209
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,030
or false.

1210
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,890
And not only that.

1211
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,370
In the wrong hands,

1212
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,370
the data could

1213
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,370
be manipulated.

1214
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,340
As you and your

1215
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,340
friend demonstrated.

1216
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,030
Friend? No.

1217
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,160
It was just me.

1218
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,940
Just you?

1219
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,940
Yes.

1220
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,040
I couldn't risk

1221
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,040
2.0 killing anyone else.

1222
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,210
I appreciate your passion,

1223
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,210
Dr. Halstead,

1224
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,940
but I don't believe

1225
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,940
for a minute

1226
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,920
you have the technical

1227
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,920
wherewithal to pull that off.

1228
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,860
I suspect Dr. Song

1229
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,860
had a hand in it.

1230
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,310
My letter of resignation.

1231
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,210
If Dayton comes looking

1232
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,210
for a culprit, you have one.

1233
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,450
So your plan

1234
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,450
is to take the blame?

1235
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,820
Let's just say

1236
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,820
I hope it ends

1237
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,820
the matter.

1238
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,420
You realize I have

1239
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,420
no choice but to accept

1240
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,420
your resignation?

1241
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,440
And I hope you also realize

1242
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,440
that I don't want to.

1243
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,800
It's not gonna be easy

1244
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,800
for you out there,

1245
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,800
Dr. Halstead.

1246
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,430
I can't give you

1247
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,430
a reference,

1248
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,040
and Jack Dayton

1249
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,040
has been known

1250
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,040
to be vindictive.

1251
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,180
Where I grew up,

1252
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,180
everyone I knew

1253
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,180
was vindictive.

1254
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,850
Will Halstead...

1255
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,580
What are we gonna do

1256
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,580
without you?

1257
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,850
You have been

1258
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,850
a constant source

1259
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,850
of irritation

1260
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,920
and a constant source

1261
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,920
of inspiration.

1262
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,370
Your leaving

1263
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,370
will be a great

1264
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,370
loss to us.

1265
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,010
A great loss to me.

1266
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,520
You had no right.

1267
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,020
I'm just as much

1268
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,020
to blame as you are.

1269
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,290
No, I put you up to it.

1270
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,890
I'm the one

1271
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,890
who hacked

1272
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,890
the system!

1273
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,590
At my insistence.

1274
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,590
Will!

1275
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,060
Grace, you're

1276
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,060
a brilliant doctor.

1277
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,300
If you destroy your career,

1278
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,300
I'd never forgive myself.

1279
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,170
It's over.

1280
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,040
It's done. Let it go.

1281
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,570
He resigned?

1282
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,570
I know.

1283
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,510
Over 2.0?

1284
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,510
The malfunction?

1285
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,240
Talk to him.

1286
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,450
Are you kidding me,

1287
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,450
Halstead?

1288
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,540
Why didn't you

1289
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,540
read me in?

1290
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,910
I didn't see

1291
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,910
a reason to.

1292
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,510
What?

1293
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,510
To protect me?

1294
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,490
Or did you think

1295
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,490
I wouldn't go along?

1296
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,530
Does it matter?

1297
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,530
Yes, it matters.

1298
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,330
And for the record,

1299
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,330
I wouldn't have.

1300
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,420
Damn it, man.

1301
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,000
I disagree with Jack

1302
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,000
and his IPO,

1303
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,130
but I never would have

1304
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,130
gone this route.

1305
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,570
Come on.

1306
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,570
You said it yourself.

1307
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,370
2.0 wasn't ready.

1308
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,370
It needed to be sidelined.

1309
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,640
Sidelined, yes.

1310
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,640
Blown up, no.

1311
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,970
Whatever its faults,

1312
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,970
2.0 has been an incredibly

1313
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,970
valuable tool,

1314
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,510
and now no one's ever

1315
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,510
gonna wanna use it.

1316
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,310
Crockett,

1317
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,310
it was the only way.

1318
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,440
It had to be done,

1319
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,440
and you know it.

1320
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,150
You're still here.

1321
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,090
So is 2.0.

1322
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,020
Fix it.

1323
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,000
I guess they both made

1324
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,000
some pretty wild assumptions

1325
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,000
about each other.

1326
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,400
Yeah. Even after

1327
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,400
so many years together.

1328
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,600
You know, it seems

1329
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,600
like they both feared

1330
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,370
there wasn't enough love

1331
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,370
there to fully trust.

1332
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,670
Amazing, right?

1333
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,470
Human beings' capacity

1334
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,470
to doubt each other,

1335
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,410
doubt ourselves.

1336
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,540
Yeah.

1337
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,150
Hey.

1338
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,620
I was glad to hear

1339
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,620
your surgery went well.

1340
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,700
That's debatable.

1341
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,660
I'm alive,

1342
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,660
which I'm grateful for.

1343
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,070
Well, from what

1344
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,070
I understand,

1345
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,070
your recovery time

1346
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,070
should be minimal.

1347
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,640
Yeah.

1348
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,510
Only one hitch, though.

1349
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,210
2.0?

1350
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,150
IPO is dead.

1351
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,440
Yeah.

1352
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,750
Some of your doctors

1353
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,750
were against putting

1354
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,750
this platform on the market.

1355
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,420
They'll be happy now.

1356
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,510
It's an amazing

1357
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,510
innovation, Jack.

1358
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,560
It just needs more time

1359
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,560
and development.

1360
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,630
Right, and who exactly

1361
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,630
is gonna fund that?

1362
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,170
What do you mean?

1363
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,390
I'm ruined, Sharon.

1364
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,660
I put all my eggs

1365
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,660
in that basket.

1366
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,200
I leveraged everything.

1367
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm sorry

1368
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,040
to hear that, Jack.

1369
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,470
Yeah, well, listen,

1370
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,470
it's not the first

1371
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,470
fortune I lost,

1372
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,770
so I'll survive.

1373
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,070
Not sure

1374
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,070
about all of you.

1375
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,310
I don't understand.

1376
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,350
I have no other recourse

1377
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,350
but to sell the hospital.

1378
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,090
What are you doing?

1379
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,330
I am... I'm writing

1380
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,330
a letter to...

1381
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,660
To you.

1382
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,260
Can I read it?

1383
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,060
Sure.

1384
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,470
"Dear Liliana."

1385
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,240
That's all I got so far.

1386
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:54,590
Daniel, the problem

1387
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:54,590
isn't just about me

1388
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:54,590
moving in with you.

1389
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,420
People are always

1390
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,420
noticing our differences.

1391
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,220
You are the big

1392
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,220
important doctor.

1393
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,160
I'm just the janitor.

1394
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,320
Lili, I gotta be

1395
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,320
honest with you.

1396
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,800
You sound an awful lot

1397
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,800
like your brother.

1398
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,500
Didn't we already

1399
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,500
handle this stuff?

1400
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,690
You don't feel

1401
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,690
sorry for me?

1402
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,270
You don't think

1403
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,270
that I'm a charity case?

1404
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,310
I can't feel

1405
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,310
a little bit sorry

1406
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,310
for you?

1407
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,740
You lost

1408
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,740
your frickin' house.

1409
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,370
But a charity case?

1410
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,500
Are you kidding me?

1411
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,100
I look at you

1412
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,100
and I see this strong,

1413
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,100
independent woman.

1414
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,840
You know, if anything,

1415
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,840
I spend, you know,

1416
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,850
a fair amount of time

1417
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,850
thinking that I might not

1418
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,850
be worthy of you.

1419
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,450
What do you mean?

1420
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,450
Look, just because

1421
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,450
I have a fancy title,

1422
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,860
it doesn't mean

1423
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,860
I don't wake up

1424
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,860
with the same

1425
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,690
doubts and insecurities

1426
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,690
as everybody else.

1427
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,270
I mean, you wanna

1428
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,270
know why

1429
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,860
I didn't ask you

1430
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,860
to move in

1431
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,860
with me earlier?

1432
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,330
I was terrified

1433
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,330
you'd say no.

1434
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,740
Look.

1435
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,770
You

1436
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,820
are the best thing

1437
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,820
that's happened to me

1438
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,820
in a long, long time,

1439
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,880
and I probably

1440
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,880
could have told you

1441
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,880
that earlier too.

1442
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,390
So let me just be

1443
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,390
crystal clear

1444
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,390
about something.

1445
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,460
Okay?

1446
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,430
I am in love

1447
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,430
with you, Liliana.

1448
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,670
There you have it.

1449
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,240
Then I owe you

1450
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,240
an apology, Daniel.

1451
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,500
I misunderstood.

1452
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:30,520
It's very hard for me

1453
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:30,520
to feel dependent

1454
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:30,520
on someone,

1455
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,520
even if I love

1456
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,520
that person.

1457
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,690
Hey! Happy couple.

1458
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,780
How nice.

1459
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,920
Let's go. I parked the car

1460
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,920
in the loading zone.

1461
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,840
Hey. Has Dr. Cameron

1462
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,840
come in?

1463
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,770
Yeah.

1464
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,370
Antibiotics?

1465
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,840
You're septic?

1466
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,810
Let me see.

1467
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,220
Let me guess.

1468
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,620
Bacterial peritonitis

1469
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,620
from your dialysis catheter.

1470
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,350
Right. Right.

1471
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,350
Did you hear

1472
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,350
about Will?

1473
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,220
I did, but we're still

1474
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,220
talking about you, Dean.

1475
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,490
This is your third infection.

1476
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,190
Enough DIY.

1477
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,230
You need to be on hemodialysis

1478
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,230
in a proper clinical setting.

1479
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,860
Three times a week

1480
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,860
for four hours?

1481
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,370
Yes.

1482
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,370
No, not for me.

1483
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,770
Thank you. No way.

1484
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,810
Dad.

1485
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,810
Sean, hey.

1486
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,500
What's going on?

1487
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,500
What's the matter?

1488
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,980
It's just a little infection.

1489
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,540
Your father needs

1490
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,540
to switch to

1491
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,540
a different type

1492
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,640
of dialysis.

1493
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,640
Hannah, come on.

1494
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,940
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

1495
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,940
Why do that?

1496
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,340
I'm here. I'm ready.

1497
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,340
Let's do the transplant.

1498
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,720
What?

1499
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,850
They won't let you.

1500
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,890
Why? I'm a match.

1501
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,890
There's a rule.

1502
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,960
You need to be at least

1503
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,960
six-months sober

1504
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,960
in order to donate.

1505
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,700
What have I done?

1506
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,700
No, no, no.

1507
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,360
It's not a big deal.

1508
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,910
I'll just go on hemodialysis,

1509
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,910
like Hannah says.

1510
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,270
Dad.

1511
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,270
Sean, come on.

1512
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,810
Please. It's just six months.

1513
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,850
Don't worry about it.

1514
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,690
Will?

1515
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,860
No.

1516
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,510
You can't go.

1517
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,400
I have to, Maggie.

1518
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,340
I have to.

1519
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,930
I'm sorry

1520
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,930
I have to say goodbye.

1521
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,600
This is not easy.

1522
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,470
You've been my family

1523
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,470
for so many years.

1524
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,310
I'll never forget you.

1525
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,810
You will always

1526
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,810
be a part of me,

1527
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,420
and I'll always be grateful

1528
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,420
for the time we had together.

1529
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,560
I know we all want to wish

1530
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,560
Dr. Halstead the very best.

1531
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,510
Thank you.

1532
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,510
Will!

1533
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,410
Will!

1534
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,820
Hey, buddy.

1535
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,950
Man, look how big

1536
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,950
you got.

1537
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,390
Mom, he's here!

1538
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,690
Hey.

1539
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,600
Hey.

1540
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,440
Is that all

1541
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,440
you brought?

1542
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,140
I didn't know how long

1543
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,140
you'd want me to stay.

1544
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,010
I'm never gonna let you go.
