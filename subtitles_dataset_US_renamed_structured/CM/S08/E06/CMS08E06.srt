1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,270
Dr. Marcel,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,270
you saved Nathaniel's life

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,270
in spectacular fashion.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,400
Got 30 million social media

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,400
followers waiting to hear how

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,400
this story ends.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,310
Get ready for what comes next.

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,430
What's that?

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,040
Fame.

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,410
What the hell is going on?

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,210
Will and Vanessa bought

12
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,210
meds off a drug dealer.

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,680
It's a little more

14
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,680
complicated than that.

15
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,620
You want to risk your own

16
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,620
career, that's fine.

17
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,450
Don't risk Vanessa's.

18
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,540
April?

19
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,280
Are you back in Chicago?

20
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,280
Yeah.

21
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,290
You didn't get married

22
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,290
or anything, did you?

23
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,420
No.

24
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,260
Well,

25
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,260
I'll see you around.

26
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,080
Did you really ask Jack

27
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,080
to dislocate your shoulder?

28
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,550
Didn't have much

29
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,550
of a choice, really.

30
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,680
I couldn't believe it.

31
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,160
Didn't even hesitate.

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,560
Well, my arm was trapped

33
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,560
at the time.

34
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,360
I felt it was the best way

35
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,360
to continue treating

36
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,360
Mr. Perry.

37
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,130
Well, no wonder people

38
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,130
are calling you a hero.

39
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,570
But is that how you would

40
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,570
characterize yourself?

41
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,530
Did you know that

42
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,530
he jerry-rigged

43
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,530
a lung transplant

44
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,130
just days after

45
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,130
the incident? Yes.

46
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,710
Confident, creative,

47
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,710
future of medicine, this guy.

48
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,340
It was a team effort.

49
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,280
Look, I'm sure you'd rather

50
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,280
talk to Mr. Dayton here.

51
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,440
And my shift is

52
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,440
starting soon, so...

53
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,820
Dr. Marcel exemplifies

54
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,450
the kind of

55
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,450
selfless dedication

56
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,490
we here at Gaffney

57
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,490
pride ourselves on,

58
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,260
and it's what has attracted

59
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,260
a new crop of generous

60
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,260
donations to this institution.

61
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,770
Dr. Marcel's heroics

62
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,770
that day saved way more

63
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,770
than just one life.

64
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,060
That's very generous.

65
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,540
Thank you.

66
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,540
And we're cut.

67
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,700
Hey.

68
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,700
Yeah?

69
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,570
So I got you lined up

70
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,570
for a few phoners

71
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,140
later in the day.

72
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,140
Uh-huh.

73
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,730
And then we got Today Show

74
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,730
end of the week, okay?

75
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,110
Friday, we're gonna

76
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,110
try to do that.

77
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,250
Morning, Mags.

78
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,160
How's it going?

79
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,160
It's going.

80
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,350
I have a twisted ankle

81
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,350
for you in 5.

82
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,620
Be there in a minute.

83
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,860
You're still mad at him?

84
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,660
CPD and the hospital

85
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,660
cleared us both. They're

86
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,660
letting it go. Why can't you?

87
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,570
Because you brought drugs

88
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,570
into the hospital, Vanessa.

89
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,410
It was irresponsible.

90
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,410
It was dangerous.

91
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,600
We were out of options,

92
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,600
and it saved our patient.

93
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,310
I expect that kind of

94
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,310
foolishness from Will,

95
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,440
but he should have

96
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,440
known better than

97
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,570
to drag you down with him.

98
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,570
No, no.

99
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,740
Will didn't drag me

100
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,740
into anything.

101
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,480
It was my call.

102
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,480
You don't have to defend him.

103
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,220
I get it,

104
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,220
the Halstead School

105
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,220
of Medicine has its appeal,

106
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,480
but it's not who you are.

107
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,850
What is that

108
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,850
supposed to mean?

109
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,590
It means you're not reckless.

110
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,590
You're smarter than that.

111
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,690
And you don't have to be

112
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,690
a cowboy to be a good doctor.

113
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,390
Hey, Dean.

114
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,390
How you doing?

115
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,370
Well, I thought

116
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,370
a patient's bowel

117
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,370
was nicked

118
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,730
during surgery, but it was

119
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,730
just a flatulent intern,

120
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,430
so I'm excellent.

121
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,200
Great, but I meant

122
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,200
how are your injuries?

123
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,200
You're looking a little stiff.

124
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,510
I've had worse.

125
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,710
Than being brutally

126
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,710
attacked by a patient on

127
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,710
PCP-laced cocaine?

128
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,840
I need to hear

129
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,840
your life story.

130
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,470
Another time.

131
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,750
I seem to remember

132
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,750
being in considerable pain

133
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,410
when you patched me up.

134
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,420
So if I do need anything,

135
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,420
I'll be looking elsewhere.

136
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,250
Well, lucky me,

137
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,250
seeing as doctors,

138
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,230
especially surgeons

139
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,230
with God complexes,

140
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,230
make the worst patients.

141
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,320
Help! Someone, please!

142
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,700
Please, I need help!

143
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,700
Okay, what happened?

144
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,700
Please, take him!

145
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,290
Tell me what's wrong.

146
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,430
It's me. I'm what's wrong.

147
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,500
I'm gonna hurt him.

148
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,420
I'll be right back.

149
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,960
Her son, Edison, is in

150
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,960
Treatment 2. He shows no

151
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,960
signs of abuse or neglect.

152
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,230
He's an entirely

153
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,230
healthy newborn.

154
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,240
That's a relief.

155
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,310
Penelope, however,

156
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,310
is not in great shape.

157
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,860
She's dehydrated, anemic,

158
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,860
and is low in vitamin D.

159
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,470
It certainly doesn't look

160
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,470
like she's been taking

161
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,670
very good care of herself.

162
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,510
Well, that's not

163
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,510
unusual for a new mother,

164
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,670
but it could mean she doesn't

165
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,670
have much of a support system.

166
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,580
Yeah.

167
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,580
Listen,

168
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,880
I don't want to call DCFS,

169
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,550
but she did say that

170
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,550
she was gonna hurt her baby.

171
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,590
Are you guys comfortable

172
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,590
holding off for now?

173
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,420
Absolutely,

174
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,420
that's a drastic step

175
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,420
for something

176
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,360
that just might be postpartum

177
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,360
depression and treatable.

178
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,360
Yeah, we're not there yet,

179
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,360
but I should have

180
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,800
a little chat

181
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,800
with her, though.

182
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,270
Yeah.

183
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,340
Halstead! Incoming.

184
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,340
Going to Baghdad.

185
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,430
Says she doesn't want

186
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,430
any doc but you.

187
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,840
Okay.

188
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,270
Seventy-six-year-old female.

189
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,320
Tell the whole world,

190
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,320
madonna.

191
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,280
Maria. What happened?

192
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,980
Crush injury

193
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,980
to the right upper arm.

194
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,980
Lacerations above the elbow.

195
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,520
Denied pain meds on the ride.

196
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,350
I was just moving the stove.

197
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,860
What, Anthony

198
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,860
couldn't move it?

199
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,450
He's useless.

200
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,860
Okay, in we go.

201
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,860
On my count.

202
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,290
I can do it myself!

203
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,700
Please lie still, okay?

204
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,030
Okay. One, two, three.

205
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,770
I need an X-ray!

206
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,000
All this fussing,

207
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,000
Guglielmo. Basta.

208
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,300
All right, I'm sorry.

209
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,600
So you two know

210
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,600
each other?

211
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,410
Maria owns Marguerite's.

212
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,410
Taylor Street institution.

213
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,020
When my folks were alive,

214
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,020
we'd go there every Sunday

215
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,020
for dinner.

216
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,980
Not so much recently, huh?

217
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,980
You look skinny.

218
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,390
Diminished right radial pulse.

219
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,390
Any numbness, tingling?

220
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,890
Mmm-mmm.

221
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,890
Good. Let's get a CT angio.

222
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,730
X-ray up.

223
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,400
Hey, no fractures,

224
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,400
but those lacerations

225
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,400
still need to be repaired.

226
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,500
Let me get you

227
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,500
some pain meds.

228
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,770
So I go to sleep?

229
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,540
No, I have

230
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,540
a dinner service tonight.

231
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,410
Maria, I'm sorry,

232
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,410
but I doubt that's

233
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,410
gonna be possible.

234
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,640
We'll know more once

235
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,640
we get better imaging,

236
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,410
but I'm gonna call

237
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,410
a surgical consult.

238
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,450
Surgery? No, no, no.

239
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,580
If you think Antonio

240
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,580
can run Marguerite's...

241
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,990
Let's worry about that later.

242
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,990
You just relax.

243
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,050
Hey, I'm gonna

244
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,050
take care of you.

245
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,690
Hi, Caitlin. I'm Dr. Asher.

246
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,830
Hi.

247
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,830
Hey.

248
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,060
This is my husband, Steve.

249
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,060
How are you?

250
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,430
Hi, Steve. Okay. So Caitlin,

251
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,430
I saw that you're

252
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,430
nine weeks pregnant

253
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,800
and experiencing spotting?

254
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,800
Yes.

255
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,540
It just started a day ago,

256
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,540
but it hasn't

257
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,540
been super heavy.

258
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,440
Okay. Any pain or cramping?

259
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,440
Nope.

260
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,710
I read it could be normal

261
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,710
this early, right?

262
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,810
It doesn't necessarily

263
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,810
mean that something's

264
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,810
wrong?

265
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,780
That's true,

266
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,780
but it is wise to

267
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,780
get checked out.

268
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,690
So let's get

269
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,690
a type and screen,

270
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,690
a CBC, and a quantitative HCG.

271
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,120
It's taken us some time

272
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,120
for us to get pregnant,

273
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,620
so we're probably

274
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,620
a little more neurotic

275
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,630
than most first-time parents.

276
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,460
Okay, so Caitlin,

277
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,460
I'd like to do an ultrasound.

278
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,470
It'll have to be

279
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,470
transvaginal this early.

280
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,400
Yes. The joys

281
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,400
of being a woman.

282
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,560
Yes.

283
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,770
Okay, let's

284
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,770
get you set up.

285
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,940
Here we go.

286
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,540
A little bit of pressure.

287
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,980
Mmm-hmm.

288
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,780
Let's see.

289
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,950
What? What is it?

290
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,630
I'm very sorry,

291
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,630
but it's an ectopic pregnancy.

292
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,700
The embryo has implanted

293
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,700
in your fallopian tube.

294
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,960
What does that mean?

295
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,040
Won't it move

296
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,040
to the uterus?

297
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,040
No.

298
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,800
No, it's not even viable.

299
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,630
Unfortunately,

300
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,630
that's correct.

301
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,500
We need to remove the ectopic

302
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,940
before it can rupture the

303
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,940
fallopian tube,

304
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,100
which would be fatal

305
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,100
for Caitlin.

306
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,650
Okay, so, what...

307
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,650
What do I have to do?

308
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,880
Well, we have

309
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,880
two different options.

310
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,960
The first is a chemo drug

311
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,960
called methotrexate.

312
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,430
It stops the cells

313
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,430
from rapidly dividing

314
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,430
and ends the pregnancy.

315
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,090
The embryo ultimately

316
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,090
reabsorbs back in the body,

317
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,430
and it successfully

318
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,430
treats about 90%

319
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,430
of ectopic pregnancies.

320
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,660
And how do you get that?

321
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,640
It's an intramuscular shot,

322
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,640
typically in the buttock

323
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,640
or the thigh.

324
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,000
What are your other options?

325
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,630
We would operate to remove

326
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,630
the embryo and,

327
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,630
if necessary,

328
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,900
the entire fallopian tube.

329
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,810
The shot.

330
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,810
Please, no surgery.

331
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,850
We're hourly workers

332
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,850
at a bookstore.

333
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,850
We don't get sick days.

334
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,110
I understand.

335
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,690
We'll just have to do

336
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,690
some additional labs,

337
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,550
and then we'll go

338
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,550
from there, okay?

339
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,120
Try and get some rest.

340
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,120
Thank you.

341
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,690
Hey. Hey, hey,

342
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,690
hey, hey, hey, hey.

343
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm sorry.

344
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,900
It'll be okay,

345
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,900
all right?

346
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,900
Look at me.

347
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,470
Penelope?

348
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,470
How's Edison?

349
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,470
Is he okay?

350
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,770
Oh, he's fine.

351
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,570
He's just next door.

352
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,810
Does he need breast milk?

353
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,810
I express him.

354
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,580
He's not always great

355
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,580
about waking up to eat,

356
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,980
even if it's been two hours.

357
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,780
You know what?

358
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,780
I'll tell the nurses.

359
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,080
I'm Dr. Charles.

360
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,620
Psychiatry.

361
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,060
Maybe I have

362
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,060
postpartum depression?

363
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,220
You know, I don't know.

364
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,220
Tell me what's been going on.

365
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,730
How you been feeling?

366
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,690
Um...

367
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,100
I'm not like myself.

368
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,100
Okay.

369
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,570
I cry so easily.

370
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,110
My moods are all over

371
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,110
the place, and...

372
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,740
And I have this ringing

373
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,740
in my ears,

374
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,870
but my OB says it's all part

375
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,870
of the recovery process.

376
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,540
Hmm.

377
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,540
But Edison was crying

378
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,540
so loudly, and I was...

379
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,560
I was so tired.

380
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,560
And it's not an excuse,

381
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,560
I know, but...

382
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,020
I thought about...

383
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,590
Uh...

384
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,530
God... I thought about

385
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,530
throwing him against the wall.

386
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,900
Okay. Well, it was just

387
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,900
a thought, though.

388
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,130
Right?

389
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,130
Mmm-hmm.

390
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,140
Has Edison's dad

391
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,140
been around to help out?

392
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,970
Turns out he wasn't

393
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,970
ready for a kid.

394
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,570
Well, gosh, I mean,

395
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,570
that's got to be so hard,

396
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,740
facing a life-changing

397
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,740
situation like this

398
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,740
all by yourself.

399
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,890
My mom came out

400
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,890
for the first week, but she

401
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,890
had to get back to Ohio.

402
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,220
How's it been

403
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,220
since she left?

404
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,920
Um...

405
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,660
Hard. My job doesn't have

406
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,660
paid maternity leave,

407
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,320
so I've been working

408
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,320
from home, you know,

409
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,330
juggling phone calls while

410
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,330
I breastfeed every two hours.

411
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,070
And there are no breaks

412
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,070
and there's no time to,

413
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,070
like, turn off.

414
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,580
And his cry,

415
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,580
like a screech, it...

416
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,580
It's just...

417
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,650
It's too much. I can't.

418
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,950
I know it's his only way

419
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,950
to communicate,

420
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,920
but it sets my teeth on edge,

421
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,920
and I feel like I'm losing it.

422
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,960
So I just...

423
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,850
I'm sorry.

424
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,950
Can you please

425
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,950
just tell me what...

426
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,290
You know what?

427
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,760
We're gonna get

428
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,760
to the bottom

429
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,760
of this, okay?

430
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,960
I promise you, we will.

431
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,200
Thank you.

432
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,140
No, no, I will make

433
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,140
that flight, and I'm fine.

434
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,050
My doctor just

435
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,050
walked in, okay?

436
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,690
It's good to

437
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,690
see you, Samir.

438
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,690
You too.

439
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,990
Mr. Baqri,

440
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,990
I'm Dr. Taylor.

441
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,660
Yeah. So sorry about that.

442
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,660
My work never stops.

443
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,360
And please,

444
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,360
call me Samir.

445
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,660
What seems to be

446
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,660
the problem?

447
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,670
Lethargy, myalgia.

448
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,670
It's hard to pin down.

449
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,100
You're a physician.

450
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,830
Oh, no.

451
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,830
I work with them.

452
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,930
Samir runs

453
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,930
the Hazma Community

454
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,930
Health Foundation,

455
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,340
sets up clinics

456
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,340
all around the world.

457
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,680
I get your fundraising emails.

458
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,250
Wow. Hopefully, not too many.

459
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,370
I haven't unsubscribed yet.

460
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,420
Okay, let's check

461
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,420
this out.

462
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,910
Open up.

463
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,690
You know, your polio

464
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,690
vaccination program

465
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,690
in Pakistan, incredible.

466
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,280
I was obsessed with

467
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,280
infectious disease

468
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,730
in med school, but they would

469
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,730
always talk about polio

470
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,990
in the past tense,

471
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,990
and I wanted to shout

472
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,990
at my professors that...

473
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,260
We were still

474
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,260
fighting it, right.

475
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,830
You know,

476
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,830
we almost had it beat,

477
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,830
but then the world

478
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,230
took its foot off the gas,

479
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,230
started reallocating funding,

480
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,310
and now it's back,

481
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,310
and well, you know,

482
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,710
we are struggling to get

483
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,710
buy-in from our partners.

484
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,150
It's just... I'm sorry. I will

485
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,150
step off of my soapbox now.

486
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,270
No, do not apologize.

487
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,270
You're doing something.

488
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,910
I wish I knew how to help.

489
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,680
It's the entire reason

490
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,680
that I got into medicine.

491
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,250
But instead, I just turn

492
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,250
off the news, and I eat

493
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,250
a sleeve of Oreos.

494
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,830
But you know what?

495
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,830
At least now

496
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,830
I can help the helper.

497
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,830
Right.

498
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,020
So how long have

499
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,020
you felt this way?

500
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,260
A couple of weeks.

501
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,030
I've been traveling

502
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,030
for work a lot recently...

503
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,070
Indonesia, Pakistan,

504
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,070
Sierra Leone.

505
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,800
I leave for the Philippines

506
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,800
on Friday. I'm opening

507
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,800
up a new clinic.

508
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,280
Well, the most exotic place

509
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,280
I've ever been is San Antonio,

510
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,010
and that was for a conference.

511
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,010
So no interest in travel?

512
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,010
No, I'd love to.

513
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,180
But between school

514
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,180
and residency, it's just...

515
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,050
Well, let me tell you,

516
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,050
it's not always

517
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,050
so glamorous.

518
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,380
I'm glued to my phone,

519
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,380
and I survive

520
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,460
off of peanut butter

521
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,460
protein bars and coffee.

522
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,850
Temp's normal.

523
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,290
Well, you know,

524
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,290
I'm not seeing any

525
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,290
obvious signs of infection,

526
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,390
but given

527
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,390
your travel history,

528
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,390
I just want to cast

529
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,730
a bit of a wide net

530
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,730
with your bloodwork,

531
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,000
if that's okay.

532
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah.

533
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,470
Anything that gets me

534
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,470
on a flight, I'm good.

535
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,930
CBC, CMP, bacterial

536
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,930
and viral cultures,

537
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,100
O&P, and a sputum.

538
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,230
On it.

539
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,170
I don't understand.

540
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
You said that most people

541
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
can do the drug option.

542
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,380
Unfortunately, your liver

543
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,380
function tests were

544
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,380
a little too elevated,

545
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,040
so you are not a candidate

546
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,040
for methotrexate.

547
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,780
Is there something you can do

548
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,780
so that I can get the shot?

549
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,080
I can't do a big surgery.

550
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,490
It'll put me out of work

551
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,490
for weeks.

552
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,860
If we were to fully open up

553
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,860
your abdomen, yes,

554
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,020
the healing time would

555
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,020
take a lot longer.

556
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,100
Fortunately,

557
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,100
this procedure

558
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,100
is laparoscopic,

559
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,390
minimally invasive,

560
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,390
meaning we could likely

561
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,800
send you home tonight

562
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,800
and have you back at work

563
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,100
in a day or two.

564
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,470
Okay. I guess I can do

565
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,470
a day or two.

566
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,410
Okay. I'll see you soon.

567
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,240
Thanks.

568
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,240
Thank you.

569
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,150
Hey. How'd it go?

570
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,030
A couple of red flags

571
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,030
for postpartum,

572
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,030
but I'm not convinced yet.

573
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,500
You know, she was talking

574
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,500
about this ringing

575
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,500
she had in her ears.

576
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,430
Well, tinnitus

577
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,430
could be caused

578
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,430
by multiple things.

579
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,370
It could be idiopathic,

580
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,370
medications,

581
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,960
hypo or hyperthyroidism.

582
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,300
You know, I can work

583
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,300
all of those up,

584
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,140
but what do you want

585
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,140
to do in the meantime?

586
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,900
Honestly, I want

587
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,900
to see her with her kid.

588
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,520
Wait, Dr. Charles.

589
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,520
You didn't see her

590
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,520
when she came in.

591
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,980
She was frantic.

592
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,950
And we can't be sure

593
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,950
how she'll react to him,

594
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,020
especially without

595
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,020
a definitive diagnosis.

596
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,950
Absolutely gonna make sure

597
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,950
the kid is safe, okay?

598
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,150
It's just that I can learn

599
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,150
so much from watching

600
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,150
them interact, right?

601
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,490
How are they bonding?

602
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,490
Any warning signs

603
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,490
of a lack of connection?

604
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,030
And if it is postpartum,

605
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,030
it sort of helps me

606
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,570
gauge the severity, you know?

607
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,500
While I understand

608
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,500
your concerns, Dr. Choi,

609
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,270
since Dr. Charles

610
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,270
will be there and Penelope

611
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,510
had the wherewithal

612
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,510
to ask for help before

613
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,510
anything happened,

614
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,050
I think we should proceed.

615
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,950
Also, I'd like

616
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,950
to be present.

617
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,980
All right.

618
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,980
Hey, thank you.

619
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,090
Hey, Archer!

620
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,090
Yeah?

621
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,560
Nursing said there's

622
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,560
no fiber optic cables

623
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,030
for the laparoscopic tower.

624
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,030
Where'd they all go

625
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,460
I've got to do

626
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,460
an urgent ectopic.

627
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,470
I know we're down two.

628
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,470
Supply chain issue

629
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,470
strike again.

630
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,900
Can't you just open?

631
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,370
No, it's explicitly

632
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,370
against my patient's

633
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,370
wishes.

634
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,230
She needs it to be

635
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,230
laparoscopic.

636
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,580
So both options are bad.

637
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,580
Either wait it out,

638
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,580
running the risk

639
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,010
it ruptures and kills her,

640
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,010
or turf it to

641
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,010
another hospital.

642
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,050
Or you can go old school

643
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,050
without video

644
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,580
and just look

645
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,580
straight down

646
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,580
into the scope.

647
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,650
No one's learned how to do it

648
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,650
that way since the Stone Age.

649
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,620
That's like performing

650
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,620
surgery with one hand tied

651
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,620
behind your back.

652
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,290
Yeah. I'm ancient

653
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,290
enough, all right?

654
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,290
It's how I was trained.

655
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,020
Well, this doesn't

656
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,020
do me any good.

657
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,900
Hi. Hey. So,

658
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,900
what's the good news?

659
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,440
We're not seeing any signs

660
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,440
of infection, though

661
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,440
you are slightly anemic.

662
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,910
Which would explain

663
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,910
your lethargy.

664
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,500
Excellent, so I guess

665
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,500
I can just take a couple

666
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,240
of iron supplements,

667
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,240
be on my way?

668
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm actually not comfortable

669
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,040
discharging you quite yet.

670
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,240
You just said

671
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,240
I'm not infectious.

672
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,510
That's true,

673
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,510
as far as I can tell.

674
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,180
But without an explanation

675
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,180
for why you're deficient,

676
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,520
I'd just like to run

677
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,520
a couple more tests.

678
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,390
No, look, if I'm not sick,

679
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,390
I really got to get going.

680
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,580
I've got, like,

681
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,580
1,000 planning calls to make.

682
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,130
And not to mention,

683
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,130
I think there's people

684
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,630
who need this bed

685
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,630
more than I do, so I think...

686
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,630
Samir...

687
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,330
You all right?

688
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,330
Yeah, I'm fine.

689
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,530
I'm not...

690
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,530
Let's get back

691
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,530
on the bed.

692
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,330
I'm fine.

693
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,330
Both legs, please.

694
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,310
Dr. Taylor?

695
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,500
It's both legs.

696
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,010
Do you know how long

697
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,010
you've had this?

698
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,140
I don't know.

699
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,140
I thought it was a heat rash.

700
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,220
This is not from

701
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,220
the anemia, is it?

702
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,720
I don't know.

703
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,390
Look, don't BS me.

704
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,390
I know what bad news

705
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,390
looks like.

706
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,720
What is it?

707
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,550
These are petechiae,

708
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,550
a breakdown

709
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,550
of red blood cells.

710
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,430
It's usually associated

711
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,430
with a bleeding disorder.

712
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,020
But it could be any

713
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,020
number of things.

714
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,360
So what are we looking at?

715
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,460
I mean, is it an autoimmune

716
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,460
disease or leukemia? What?

717
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,040
We don't know until we do

718
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,040
further workup.

719
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,630
Um, Maggie, let's get

720
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,630
a lupus panel, an ANA,

721
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,270
and an X-ray.

722
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,270
On it.

723
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,070
Thank you.

724
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,210
Maria.

725
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,440
This is Dr. Marcel.

726
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,350
Apologies for the wait,

727
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,350
Ms. Piscotta.

728
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,320
You didn't tell me the

729
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,320
handsome doctor from

730
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,320
the news was coming.

731
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,360
I look a mess.

732
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,360
No, please.

733
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,690
Apparently,

734
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,690
I'm addressing royalty.

735
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
The doctor also tells me

736
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
you're the queen of pasta.

737
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,130
Only woman in America

738
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,130
who can make the threads

739
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,130
of God.

740
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,220
Oh!

741
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,330
It's all done by feel.

742
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,330
You have to have the touch.

743
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,540
Well, I look forward

744
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,540
to stopping by once

745
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,540
we get you patched up.

746
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,010
So your angiogram revealed an

747
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,010
injury to the brachial artery,

748
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,740
a pseudoaneurysm like

749
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,740
a balloon pushing out

750
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,740
from the vessel.

751
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,450
What does that mean?

752
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,390
Well, unfortunately,

753
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,390
you'll need

754
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,390
a surgical repair.

755
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,720
But it'll remove

756
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,720
the risk of rupture

757
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,550
while preserving healthy

758
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,550
blood flow to your arm.

759
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,760
Now, Maria, there are

760
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,760
non-surgical options

761
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,760
like stenting.

762
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,330
It's less invasive.

763
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,460
Let Dr. Handsome finish.

764
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,430
My opinion,

765
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,430
surgery would offer

766
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,430
the best long-term results.

767
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,740
I know it seems like a lot,

768
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,740
but it's standard procedure.

769
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,780
And if we did

770
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,780
the repair today,

771
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,780
we can send you home tomorrow.

772
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,810
And you will do the surgery?

773
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,240
I would.

774
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,080
If that's what you think

775
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,080
is best, andiamo.

776
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,390
Okay. I'll make the call.

777
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,430
You have a visitor.

778
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,790
There's my boy.

779
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,300
Sit.

780
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,570
Hi.

781
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,840
Oh, no, Eddie,

782
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,840
it's okay.

783
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,740
It's okay. Come on.

784
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,740
Don't cry.

785
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,440
It's okay.

786
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,320
Please, Eddie, please.

787
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,720
Okay.

788
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,420
You see what I mean

789
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,420
about this cry?

790
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,090
It's like a...

791
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,090
It's like a drill

792
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,090
in my head.

793
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,140
Okay.

794
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,140
Stop, baby.

795
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,570
Stop, baby. Please, stop.

796
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,570
Quiet, please.

797
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,370
Penelope, take a deep breath.

798
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,370
You got this.

799
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,670
You got this. You got this.

800
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,810
I'm sorry. Can you

801
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,810
please take him out?

802
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,280
I can't stand it.

803
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,280
I've got it. I've got it.

804
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,450
It's okay. It's okay.

805
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,650
Penelope?

806
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,900
What's happening?

807
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,900
Penelope? Penelope?

808
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,600
What's happening to me?

809
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,600
Okay.

810
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,600
Help me.

811
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,600
Okay, all right.

812
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,260
Look at me. Look at me.

813
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,430
We got you.

814
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,430
Look at me.

815
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,730
Look at me. Look at me.

816
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,860
Okay, can you smile?

817
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,400
Try to smile. Okay.

818
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,880
Trigger the stroke alert!

819
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,880
Little help in here!

820
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,640
We got you. We got you.

821
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,640
We got you.

822
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,320
What the...

823
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,320
Hey, where's Maria?

824
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,400
They just took her

825
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,400
to pre-op.

826
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,590
Look, I've been

827
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,590
thinking about it.

828
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,690
We should hold off

829
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,690
on surgery.

830
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,320
I want to pitch her

831
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,320
the stent one more time.

832
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,800
Come on, Will.

833
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,800
We both know that's not

834
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,800
a long-term solution.

835
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,670
No, but given her age and her

836
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,670
livelihood, we shouldn't be

837
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,670
so eager to flay her arm,

838
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,600
risk nerve injury,

839
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,600
put her through

840
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,600
extensive rehab.

841
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,300
No, no. Her hands

842
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,300
are her life. We cannot

843
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,300
take that from her.

844
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,610
All the more reason

845
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,610
to stick with

846
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,610
a vascular repair.

847
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,210
Deal with the pseudoaneurysm

848
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,210
with a stitch and keep

849
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,210
her off anti-platelets.

850
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,950
And besides,

851
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,950
she's already consented.

852
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,250
That's because

853
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,250
she saw you on TV.

854
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,480
She's star struck

855
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,480
being treated by the hotshot

856
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,480
doctor from the news.

857
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,970
Hey, you called me,

858
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,970
remember?

859
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,400
You don't think all that

860
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,400
influenced her decision?

861
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,300
I don't know, but maybe your

862
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,300
connection with the patient

863
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,300
is influencing yours.

864
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,850
Hey, Will?

865
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,910
I'm gonna take good

866
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,910
care of her, okay?

867
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,290
Thank you.

868
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,420
You got it.

869
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,430
Hey, Dr. Asher?

870
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,370
I think something

871
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,370
might be wrong.

872
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,600
Okay.

873
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,970
Hey, Caitlin.

874
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,970
Are you in pain?

875
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,470
It's... It's not super bad,

876
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,470
but, yeah, it hurts.

877
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,810
Yeah, heart rate's

878
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,810
in the low hundreds.

879
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,580
All right, I want to do

880
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,580
a quick ultrasound.

881
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,580
Do you mind?

882
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Can you lift up, please?

883
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Sure.

884
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,520
Here we go.

885
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,520
It's gonna be

886
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,520
a little cold.

887
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,820
All right.

888
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,950
There we go.

889
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,930
Okay, Caitlin,

890
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,930
your fallopian tube

891
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,930
is ruptured,

892
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,430
and there's blood

893
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,430
in your belly.

894
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,550
Oh, my God.

895
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,550
Is she gonna be okay?

896
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,830
Yes, but we need

897
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,830
to operate now.

898
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,370
And I need to open

899
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,370
your abdomen.

900
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,630
No, no, you said that

901
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,630
you could do it the other way.

902
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,970
I can't be out of work.

903
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,440
I understand, but we don't

904
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,440
have fiber optic cables.

905
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,570
But we do have a camera scope,

906
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,570
so we're still able to

907
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,570
operate laparoscopically,

908
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,370
just in a different way,

909
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,370
if you're good with that?

910
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,670
Um...

911
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,620
Yeah, okay.

912
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,810
Yes.

913
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,450
Can you open

914
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,450
the hybrid OR, please?

915
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,750
What do you think

916
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,750
you're doing?

917
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,690
You jump in like that

918
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,690
without consulting me?

919
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,630
I'm sorry, but we don't

920
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,630
have time for niceties.

921
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,990
You said yourself

922
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,990
it was emergent,

923
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,500
and this way,

924
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,500
we don't have to

925
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,500
open her up.

926
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,360
So now it's we?

927
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,360
This is my patient.

928
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,630
This is her wish.

929
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,370
Your way, she'd be in

930
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,370
for a lot more pain and

931
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,370
a much longer recovery.

932
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,500
Come on, you'll see.

933
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,500
We'll make a good team.

934
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,740
Come on.

935
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,380
Okay. Clamps are off.

936
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,740
Check the flow.

937
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,350
Triphasic flow is good.

938
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,790
Nice work.

939
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,660
You almost finished in there?

940
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,890
Yeah. Just about

941
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,890
to close.

942
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,970
Good, because

943
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,970
the lieutenant governor

944
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,630
is here with cholecystitis,

945
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,630
and she's requested

946
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,000
you perform the surgery.

947
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,000
Big time.

948
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,770
Oh, ush.

949
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,710
Okay, give me 30 minutes.

950
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,710
I'll be right there.

951
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,540
Come on.

952
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,540
It's the lieutenant

953
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,540
governor.

954
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,480
Dr. Tanaka-Reed can close.

955
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,810
You good?

956
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,810
Yes, sir. I got it.

957
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,080
Minimum two layers

958
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,080
plus skin, all right?

959
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,080
Mmm-hmm.

960
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,720
All right,

961
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,720
I'll be right there.

962
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,790
Penelope's MRI

963
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,790
and CT are clean.

964
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,760
Thank goodness,

965
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,760
that wasn't a stroke.

966
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,560
Yeah. No tumors,

967
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,560
either.

968
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,000
Taken all together,

969
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,000
her symptoms add up

970
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,830
to one thing.

971
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,830
Bell's palsy.

972
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,530
Tinnitus. Of course.

973
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,940
Edison's cries

974
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,940
must have been

975
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,940
excruciating.

976
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,670
Yeah, it's why

977
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,670
she's having

978
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,670
such a hard time

979
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,470
when Eddie was acting up.

980
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,810
And it's no wonder

981
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,810
she was at the end

982
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,810
of her rope.

983
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,750
On top of everything,

984
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,750
she was in pain

985
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,650
and told it was

986
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,650
completely normal.

987
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,950
How'd her OB miss this

988
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,950
when she complained

989
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,950
about her symptoms?

990
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,080
Well, unfortunately,

991
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,080
many women are failed

992
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,080
by postpartum care.

993
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,460
And in American medicine,

994
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,460
the mother is the wrapper,

995
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,090
the baby, the candy.

996
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,930
At least this case

997
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,930
has a happy ending.

998
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,020
We can treat

999
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,020
Penelope's symptoms

1000
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,760
and reunite her

1001
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,760
with her baby.

1002
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,740
You know, I'd say this

1003
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,740
is an important first step

1004
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,770
in her mental recovery,

1005
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,770
but I don't know.

1006
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,580
We're not out

1007
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,580
of the woods yet.

1008
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,940
Samir's labs are in.

1009
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,140
No signs of

1010
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,140
autoimmune disease

1011
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,140
or cancer.

1012
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,510
Small victories.

1013
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,050
But severe osteopenia?

1014
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,750
He has the bones

1015
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,750
of a man twice his age.

1016
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,580
None of this

1017
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,580
makes any sense.

1018
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,720
What happened?

1019
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,100
I don't know.

1020
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,840
Where'd that laceration

1021
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,840
come from?

1022
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,880
Micro stitch?

1023
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,880
No.

1024
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,610
Grab me a heat cautery

1025
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,610
and lidocaine 1%.

1026
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,740
You got it.

1027
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,740
It's okay.

1028
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,970
Just slow breaths, okay?

1029
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,810
In through your nose.

1030
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,720
Out through your mouth.

1031
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,720
Yes. Good job. Good job.

1032
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,580
So what,

1033
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,580
did you cut yourself?

1034
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,160
No.

1035
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,220
Any injuries that

1036
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,220
you forgot to

1037
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,220
tell me about?

1038
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,960
No, no, nothing.

1039
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,960
What is happening to me?

1040
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,790
I don't know yet,

1041
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,790
but we're gonna figure

1042
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,790
this out, okay?

1043
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,590
Just... Just focus on me.

1044
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,070
Maggie, what does this

1045
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,070
look like to you?

1046
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,830
An appendectomy scar.

1047
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,530
Yeah.

1048
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,700
We're gonna

1049
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,700
figure this out.

1050
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,880
A bulge on

1051
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,880
the left fallopian.

1052
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,880
Let me see?

1053
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,650
That's the

1054
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,650
ectopic pregnancy.

1055
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,650
Yeah, that was clear to me.

1056
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,730
Okay, so grasp

1057
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,730
the fallopian tubes.

1058
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,730
Put them on tension,

1059
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,890
and then take your

1060
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,890
needlepoint cautery.

1061
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,860
Thank you.

1062
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,860
Will you help me, please?

1063
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,570
You all right?

1064
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,770
I'm fine.

1065
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,240
Okay. Now, make a longitudinal

1066
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,240
incision over the bulge.

1067
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,870
What?

1068
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,580
Step in.

1069
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,850
Step in?

1070
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,150
What are you talking about?

1071
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,810
You're the only person here

1072
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,810
who knows how to perform

1073
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,810
surgery this way.

1074
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,020
Well, you're about

1075
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,020
to learn it now.

1076
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,820
If you knew you were

1077
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,820
in pain, you never

1078
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,820
should have started this.

1079
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,020
I'm just respecting

1080
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,020
your patient's needs.

1081
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,620
Now, stop it. Come on now.

1082
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,620
Just take it. Go.

1083
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,310
It's not gonna magically

1084
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,310
appear on the monitor.

1085
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,650
All right,

1086
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,650
just put your eye

1087
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,650
back on the scope.

1088
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,020
Come on.

1089
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,100
This would go faster

1090
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,100
if I could just open.

1091
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,870
You can do this, all right?

1092
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,840
Use your assistant, me.

1093
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,840
I will guide you.

1094
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,840
I will help you.

1095
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,050
Come on.

1096
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,350
I can't get the angle.

1097
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,850
All right, so come in

1098
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,850
through the other side.

1099
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,150
Just tell me where

1100
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,150
the tube needs to be,

1101
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,620
and I will hold it.

1102
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,620
Okay, hold this.

1103
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,060
I got it.

1104
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,360
I'm going after the tube.

1105
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,360
Give me the ligature.

1106
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,740
All right. Got it?

1107
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,740
There you go.

1108
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,240
Okay.

1109
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,340
Yeah.

1110
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,010
Okay.

1111
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,030
Got it.

1112
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,100
All right. Wrap this up.

1113
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,810
How's Samir?

1114
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,280
His wound looks good,

1115
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,280
but he's understandably eager

1116
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,740
to find out why

1117
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,740
his scar opened up.

1118
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,210
I have a hunch,

1119
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,210
but I feel crazy

1120
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,210
even saying it.

1121
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,340
I want to run

1122
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,340
one more test.

1123
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,340
Okay.

1124
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,290
So fortunately, with time and

1125
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,290
steroids, your Bell's palsy

1126
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,290
should fully resolve.

1127
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,760
But what about

1128
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,760
my terrible thoughts?

1129
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,330
Well, you know,

1130
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,330
there's actually

1131
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,330
a name for those?

1132
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,300
They're called

1133
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,300
intrusive thoughts.

1134
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,430
They're involuntary, violent,

1135
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,430
often self-destructive.

1136
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,360
You ever been standing,

1137
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,360
say, on a balcony,

1138
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,360
on a tall building,

1139
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,000
and you look over the edge,

1140
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,000
and you go "What would

1141
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,000
happen if I jumped off?"

1142
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,880
I mean,

1143
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,880
you don't do it, but it's...

1144
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,880
It's disturbing, right?

1145
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,310
I have friends with kids,

1146
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,310
and none of them

1147
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,820
ever mentioned having

1148
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,820
a thought like I did.

1149
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,280
Well, I mean,

1150
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,280
it's not exactly

1151
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,180
the easiest thing to bring up.

1152
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,260
And it's a problem because

1153
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,260
that means that people just

1154
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,260
don't talk about it.

1155
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,290
Don't you understand that

1156
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,290
a good mother, regardless

1157
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,290
of Bell's palsy or anything,

1158
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,060
would never think of

1159
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,060
harming her own baby?

1160
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,130
No, you sought help.

1161
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,000
There's proof

1162
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,000
you're a good mom.

1163
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,690
No!

1164
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,070
God, you have to understand.

1165
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,070
I could see myself

1166
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,070
throwing him.

1167
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,170
This wasn't some fleeting,

1168
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,170
vague idea.

1169
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,440
I actually thought about

1170
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,440
him hitting the wall.

1171
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,710
It felt so horrifically real.

1172
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,370
This is not gonna be

1173
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,370
my last stressful week,

1174
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,150
so I can never trust

1175
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,150
myself with him.

1176
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,380
Look, we get it, okay? We do.

1177
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,420
We understand, and we're gonna

1178
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,420
keep on working on this.

1179
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,890
As a matter of fact,

1180
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,890
Dr. Choi and I

1181
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,020
are just gonna step outside

1182
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,020
for a second, all right?

1183
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,120
Hey, we'll be right back.

1184
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,070
I get it. She's scared.

1185
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,070
But separating her

1186
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,070
from her baby?

1187
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,440
They should be together.

1188
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,440
I completely agree.

1189
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,910
I mean, look, we can try

1190
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,910
and normalize her fears

1191
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,210
until we're blue

1192
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,210
in the face,

1193
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,840
but I think she needs

1194
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,840
to hear about it from

1195
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,840
a different kind of expert.

1196
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,810
There aren't many reasons

1197
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,810
a surgical scar can reopen,

1198
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,080
especially an older one

1199
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,080
like an appendectomy.

1200
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,920
So on a hunch,

1201
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,920
I ran one more

1202
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,920
blood test.

1203
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,790
So have you figured out

1204
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,790
what's happening to me?

1205
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,450
Hypovitaminosis C.

1206
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,190
Better known as scurvy.

1207
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,300
You've got to be joking.

1208
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,230
Like old timey,

1209
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,230
sailor scurvy?

1210
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,230
People still get that?

1211
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,070
It's rare,

1212
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,070
but you mentioned

1213
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,070
having a limited diet.

1214
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,470
Peanut butter, protein bars,

1215
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,470
coffee, they all

1216
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,470
lack vitamin C.

1217
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,530
And without that, your body

1218
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,530
can't maintain the collagen,

1219
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,530
the connective tissue,

1220
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,180
it needs in order

1221
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,180
to function.

1222
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,480
Which would explain

1223
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,480
your low bone density

1224
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,480
and your petechiae.

1225
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,070
But this is

1226
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,070
all treatable, right?

1227
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
I mean, what,

1228
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
eat a couple slices

1229
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
of oranges,

1230
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,250
and I'll be fine?

1231
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,250
Pretty much.

1232
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,820
We're gonna set you up

1233
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,820
on an infusion.

1234
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,790
And then after that,

1235
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,790
we'll get you on an oral,

1236
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,050
high-dose multivitamin.

1237
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,320
You should start feeling

1238
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,320
better in about 48 hours.

1239
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,360
You know, I have been

1240
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,360
in some hairy situations

1241
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,360
in my career,

1242
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,200
but this scared

1243
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,200
the crap out of me.

1244
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,270
And you were so calm.

1245
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,500
Like I said,

1246
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,500
got to help the helpers.

1247
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,110
Dr. Taylor?

1248
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,880
Could I trouble you

1249
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,880
for another moment?

1250
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,150
Yeah, sure.

1251
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,380
I'll get the pharmacy to start

1252
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,380
working on your infusion.

1253
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,150
Lieutenant governor

1254
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,150
did great.

1255
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,390
Surgery went perfectly.

1256
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,590
Fantastic.

1257
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,590
Yeah.

1258
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,200
I'll let her chief

1259
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,200
of staff know

1260
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,200
he can release the statement.

1261
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,200
Okay.

1262
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,200
Hey, nice having Gaffney

1263
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,200
and you name-dropped

1264
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,600
by the people

1265
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,600
in Springfield.

1266
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,960
Well, that's cool.

1267
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,570
Uh... Excuse me.

1268
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,900
Yeah.

1269
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,440
Where've you been?

1270
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,440
What happened?

1271
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,490
Arm's cold and dusky.

1272
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,490
Doppler.

1273
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,050
No blood flow

1274
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,050
below the repair.

1275
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,050
Must have thrombosed.

1276
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,920
How?

1277
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,920
This soon after surgery?

1278
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,330
It's got to be

1279
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,330
a technical error.

1280
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,330
No way the repair went down.

1281
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,590
It was in good shape

1282
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,590
when you scrubbed out.

1283
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,370
You left the OR before

1284
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,370
the surgery was finished?

1285
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,900
No. Repair was complete.

1286
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,330
Clearly, it wasn't.

1287
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,130
You should have been there.

1288
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,330
She should have been

1289
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,330
your priority.

1290
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,910
We got to get her

1291
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,910
back into the OR.

1292
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,910
Kai, let's go. Come on.

1293
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,170
Excuse me.

1294
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,640
Let's go.

1295
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,140
Easy, easy!

1296
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,050
Penelope?

1297
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,960
May I come in?

1298
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,930
How's Edison?

1299
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,930
Is he okay?

1300
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,130
He's wonderful.

1301
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,130
Has the nurses all wrapped

1302
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,130
around his little fingers.

1303
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,530
I could bring him in,

1304
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,530
if you'd like.

1305
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,140
You're worried

1306
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,140
about your thoughts.

1307
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,940
How could I not be?

1308
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,350
No one seems to understand

1309
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,350
how real it felt.

1310
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,040
May I?

1311
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,490
Look at that.

1312
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,060
He's so cute.

1313
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,000
And he's perfect.

1314
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,000
You know that, right?

1315
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,460
Do you have kids?

1316
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,590
I do.

1317
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,600
Two boys

1318
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,600
and a girl, all grown.

1319
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,400
Tara was about Edison's age.

1320
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,100
She had the worst colic,

1321
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,510
I mean,

1322
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,510
screaming for hours.

1323
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,210
Sleeping longer than an hour

1324
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,210
felt like a vacation.

1325
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,230
One morning about 3:00 a.m.,

1326
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,230
I had been pacing the hallway,

1327
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,020
trying to soothe her.

1328
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:26,190
My baby was suffering,

1329
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:26,190
and I couldn't fix it.

1330
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,030
And I was bone tired.

1331
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,270
I felt alone.

1332
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,270
I felt like I was the only

1333
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,270
person awake in the world.

1334
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,430
And I just

1335
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,710
was desperate for quiet.

1336
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,050
And out of nowhere,

1337
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:51,420
I had this thought

1338
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:51,420
to just toss her out

1339
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:51,420
of the second-floor window.

1340
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,100
It really frightened me,

1341
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,430
and I questioned whether

1342
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,430
I could be a good parent.

1343
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,730
And when I finally worked

1344
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,730
up the courage

1345
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:14,170
to mention it to a friend

1346
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:14,170
who I thought was like

1347
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:14,170
super mother...

1348
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,750
I was stunned when she told me

1349
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,750
she had had similar thoughts

1350
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,750
with her babies.

1351
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,390
And when I went to see

1352
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,390
the pediatrician,

1353
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,190
he reassured me

1354
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,190
that it was normal.

1355
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,330
All anyone ever

1356
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,330
talks about is the joy

1357
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,810
and the love and

1358
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,810
the happiness, and...

1359
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,570
I felt all that too.

1360
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,210
But listen, have you ever

1361
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,210
really listened to the

1362
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,210
lyrics of a lullaby?

1363
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,190
Singing about dropping cradles

1364
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,190
from treetops

1365
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,420
and feeding crying babies

1366
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,420
to crabs and monsters?

1367
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,560
But it's proof that parenthood

1368
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,560
throughout time

1369
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,070
and the world over is hard.

1370
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,640
And it is also true

1371
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,260
that it takes a village

1372
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,260
to raise a child.

1373
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,430
And there are mother groups

1374
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,710
that have great resources

1375
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,710
for making friends,

1376
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:26,120
finding support,

1377
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:26,120
asking questions.

1378
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,280
I can connect you with one,

1379
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,280
if you'd like.

1380
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,190
I'd love that.

1381
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,530
And here.

1382
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,760
You listen to me, Penelope.

1383
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,100
You did not have

1384
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,100
an easy start...

1385
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,770
But I have

1386
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,770
no concerns about you.

1387
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,430
You hear me?

1388
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,780
Edison is a lucky, lucky boy.

1389
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,280
Thanks.

1390
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,310
Maybe you'd like to

1391
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,310
see him after all?

1392
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,420
Yes, please.

1393
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,620
Okay.

1394
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,330
Bring him in.

1395
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,130
Hi, sweet boy.

1396
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,380
Thank you.

1397
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:28,350
Hi. Mama is here.

1398
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:28,350
Mama's here.

1399
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,420
It was something

1400
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,420
we call a vasospasm,

1401
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,290
random constriction

1402
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,290
of the blood vessel,

1403
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,260
totally unrelated

1404
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,260
to the surgery.

1405
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,190
That said, your repair

1406
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,190
was in good shape.

1407
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,460
This old bird still

1408
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,460
got her wing.

1409
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,160
She sure does.

1410
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,600
But, uh, maybe

1411
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,600
just take it easy

1412
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,600
on the pasta roller

1413
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,200
while you heal up, okay?

1414
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,330
We need to get your picture

1415
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,330
on our famosi wall.

1416
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,930
Getting to eat your pasta's

1417
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,930
reward enough.

1418
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,540
Ah, Guglielmo.

1419
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,340
Thank you for getting

1420
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,340
Dr. Handsome to help me.

1421
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,820
You bring him with you,

1422
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,820
I'll make you two

1423
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,820
squid ink pasta.

1424
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,790
Wow. She swore

1425
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,790
she'd only ever

1426
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,790
make that for the Pope.

1427
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,250
Oh!

1428
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,460
You got it.

1429
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,830
I'm gonna let you

1430
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,830
get some rest.

1431
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,490
Okay.

1432
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,200
Thanks.

1433
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,640
Hey, Will, look,

1434
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,640
about the surgery, I...

1435
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,370
It wasn't your fault.

1436
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,370
I was out of line.

1437
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,410
No, you had a point.

1438
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,410
I got wrapped up

1439
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,410
in all the attention.

1440
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,370
Okay, that's true.

1441
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,610
You're a good

1442
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,610
surgeon, Crockett.

1443
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,980
Just not sure you deserve

1444
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,980
her squid ink pasta.

1445
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,280
Touché.

1446
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,800
So while the bleeding

1447
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,800
necessitated our removal

1448
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,630
of your fallopian tube,

1449
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,630
this will not prevent you

1450
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,500
from becoming pregnant

1451
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,500
again and carrying

1452
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,500
a healthy baby to term.

1453
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,470
Thank you, Dr. Asher.

1454
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,470
Thank you both.

1455
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,000
Hannah and Dean,

1456
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,000
good baby names.

1457
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,640
We'll have to remember that.

1458
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,870
Actually, I never liked Dean.

1459
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,870
I think you can do better.

1460
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,950
Oh, yeah?

1461
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,450
Okay, we'll get you

1462
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,450
a diet ordered,

1463
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,850
and if you do okay,

1464
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,850
we'll send you home tonight.

1465
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,610
Thank you.

1466
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,610
Sure.

1467
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,020
Hey, I wanted

1468
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,020
to say thank you.

1469
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,350
I'm relieved we could

1470
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,350
respect Caitlin's wishes,

1471
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,290
and I'm lucky

1472
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,290
I had your help.

1473
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,890
Well, you did good

1474
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,890
for a mere mortal.

1475
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
Hey, Dean?

1476
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,030
In the OR,

1477
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,030
you were in pain.

1478
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,510
Please. It's a... It's a...

1479
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,510
It's a hard angle to hold

1480
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,440
with ribs that are

1481
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,440
still healing.

1482
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,810
Yeah.

1483
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,710
Don't kid a kidder.

1484
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,980
Look, you don't want

1485
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,980
my help, that's fine,

1486
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,680
but you have to let

1487
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,680
somebody check you out.

1488
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,550
Hey, I'm fine, Dr. Asher.

1489
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,320
Yeah.

1490
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,660
Okay.

1491
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,660
All right.

1492
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,690
What's this?

1493
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,320
Recommended

1494
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,320
travel vaccinations.

1495
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,560
I thought you could give me

1496
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,560
a hand scheduling them.

1497
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,800
I didn't know you

1498
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,800
were going on vacation.

1499
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,900
Samir offered me

1500
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,900
a spot on his team.

1501
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,840
He thought

1502
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,840
I'd be a great fit.

1503
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,780
In the Philippines?

1504
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,710
I said yes.

1505
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,650
Wait, wait. You can't

1506
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,650
just up and leave.

1507
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,650
What about your residency?

1508
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,920
I'll talk to my

1509
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,920
program director

1510
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,920
and Ms. Goodwin.

1511
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,510
I'll defer finishing for now,

1512
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,510
but they'll understand.

1513
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,820
But I don't.

1514
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,820
Where's this coming from?

1515
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,860
From me, Maggie.

1516
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,500
Listen, you were upset,

1517
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,500
and rightly so, when I bought

1518
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,500
those drugs off the street.

1519
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,370
But what I didn't say

1520
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,370
to you earlier that I should

1521
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,370
have is that I was...

1522
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,970
I was actually inspired.

1523
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,880
I mean, despite the risk,

1524
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,880
I helped my patient.

1525
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,080
I was resourceful.

1526
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,080
I mean, I was a good doctor.

1527
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,420
That's the kind of person

1528
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,420
that I want to be.

1529
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,550
And you can't be

1530
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,550
that person here?

1531
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,920
Maybe.

1532
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,090
But I know that this

1533
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,090
opportunity will allow me

1534
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,720
to be the kind of doctor

1535
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,720
that I want to be,

1536
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,930
doing the work

1537
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,930
that I love. I...

1538
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,560
This is my calling.

1539
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,800
Why don't you just take

1540
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,800
some time and think about it?

1541
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,640
I don't want to.

1542
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,640
But...

1543
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,770
I just want to close my eyes

1544
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,770
and take the leap.

1545
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,780
Okay.
