1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,600
I heard you and 2.0

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,600
are a match made in heaven.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,500
Well, it's a remarkable

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,500
advancement.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,730
We need an OR.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,340
2.0 is open.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,700
Better imaging's available.

8
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,270
Emergent trauma

9
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,270
is not the time to play

10
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,270
with your fancy toy.

11
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,710
Things haven't

12
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,710
been great between Ben and I.

13
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,650
I know it must be hard

14
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,650
not having him around.

15
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,050
Ben?

16
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,380
Sorry it took me

17
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,380
so long.

18
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,160
I probably shot up,

19
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,390
like, a half dozen times

20
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,390
during my first trimester.

21
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,330
Going cold turkey

22
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,330
is really hard.

23
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,160
I don't want anyone

24
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,160
taking my baby away.

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,440
Hello?

26
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,350
Hey. No, no, no, no.

27
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,610
Hey. What did I tell you?

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,410
Day or night.

29
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,410
Doesn't matter.

30
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,540
What's going on?

31
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,790
You're... you're having

32
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,790
an urge to use?

33
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,480
Uh-huh.

34
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,460
Okay. Can you

35
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,460
get yourself to Med?

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,550
I can pick you up.

37
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,660
Okay, great.

38
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,360
Okay. I'll meet you

39
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,360
in the ED.

40
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,640
Wow. So Ben moved

41
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,640
back home?

42
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,670
End of last week.

43
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,770
Wow. I'm so glad

44
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,770
to hear that.

45
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,780
It was like

46
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,780
this huge cloud

47
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,780
has just lifted.

48
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,070
I'll bet.

49
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,150
Thanks for being

50
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,150
a shoulder throughout

51
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,150
all this, Sharon.

52
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,280
Always.

53
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,050
The result of over

54
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,050
a decade's worth

55
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,090
of testing and research,

56
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,660
here at Gaffney Chicago

57
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,660
Medical Center.

58
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,620
They're doing

59
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,620
infomercials

60
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,620
for 2.0 now?

61
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,130
Jack Dayton insisted.

62
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,130
But I have

63
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,130
a budget meeting

64
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,130
to get to,

65
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,430
so enjoy the show.

66
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,760
I will.

67
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,430
Predict complications

68
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,430
before they happen,

69
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,370
generate highly accurate

70
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,370
imaging in real time.

71
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,570
The OR 2.0 is to surgery

72
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,570
what GPS was to travel.

73
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,570
Nitrazine swab.

74
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,480
I've noticed

75
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,480
more discharge.

76
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,610
And the baby doesn't

77
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,610
seem to be moving

78
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,610
around as much.

79
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,190
She usually

80
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,190
kicks up a storm.

81
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,730
I told Hannah

82
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,730
that she's gonna be

83
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,730
a flamenco dancer.

84
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,850
So you two

85
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,850
know each other?

86
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,690
Yeah, we go

87
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,690
to the same gym.

88
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,660
Okay.

89
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,600
So your water broke, Liza.

90
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,600
What?

91
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,230
But I'm not due for,

92
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,230
like, another week.

93
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,500
You see this?

94
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,100
When this touches

95
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,100
amniotic fluid,

96
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,100
it turns blue.

97
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,350
That also explains

98
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,350
why you stopped feeling

99
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,350
much movement.

100
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,580
After your water breaks,

101
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,280
the baby has less room

102
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,280
to wiggle around.

103
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,880
Is she gonna be okay?

104
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,880
Yes.

105
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,220
This just means we need

106
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,220
to get you upstairs

107
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,690
and give you medicine

108
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,690
to induce labor.

109
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,420
Can you let L&D

110
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,420
know Liza's coming up

111
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,420
and page Dr. Patchefsky?

112
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,860
Sure thing.

113
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,860
Thanks.

114
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,500
Dr. Patchefsky?

115
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
Mm-hmm

116
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
No, no, no.

117
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
I want you.

118
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,500
Well, Liza, I'm sorry,

119
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,770
but unfortunately,

120
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,770
I need to stay in the ED.

121
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,710
But hey, Dr. Patchefsky's

122
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,710
gonna take great care

123
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,710
of you and the baby.

124
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,750
You know me, Hannah.

125
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,750
You know my history.

126
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,250
I don't feel comfortable

127
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,250
with anybody else.

128
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,850
Please.

129
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,850
I can't do this

130
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,850
without you.

131
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,250
Okay.

132
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,750
Let me see

133
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,750
what I can figure out.

134
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,860
Dr. Marcel?

135
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,860
Yeah?

136
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,730
There's the movie star.

137
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,330
Oh, come on now.

138
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,770
Oh, can I get

139
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,770
your autograph?

140
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,740
Jack roped me into it.

141
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,740
Sure he did.

142
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,310
Need some help

143
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,310
over here!

144
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,740
Hey. What happened?

145
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,540
Rob here, he was working

146
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,540
a circular saw, and...

147
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,210
He was slicing

148
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,210
some sheet metal.

149
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,540
He cut himself.

150
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,540
Follow me.

151
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,350
Number three's open.

152
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,940
How long ago

153
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,940
did this happen?

154
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,940
Not exactly sure.

155
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,490
I found Rob by the machine

156
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,490
about 20 minutes ago.

157
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,650
He was just lying

158
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,650
in a pool

159
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,190
of his own blood.

160
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,190
Let's get him up.

161
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,960
We were working

162
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,960
at a job site

163
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,960
around the corner.

164
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,920
We just thought

165
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,920
it'd be fastest

166
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,920
to bring him ourselves.

167
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,490
Okay. Mag?

168
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,490
Yes.

169
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,490
Gentlemen.

170
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,900
Why don't I show you

171
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,900
where the waiting room is at?

172
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,520
Dr. Marcel will update you

173
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,520
as soon as possible.

174
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,400
Wait, wait.

175
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,400
What do I do

176
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,400
with this?

177
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,700
Dr. Marcel?

178
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,700
Yeah?

179
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,300
We do the right thing?

180
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,440
Thought you're supposed

181
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,440
to put it on ice.

182
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,570
Yes, you did

183
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,570
the right thing.

184
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,210
Thank you.

185
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,480
Thank you, gentlemen.

186
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,680
It's okay.

187
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,680
I got you, bud.

188
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,930
Well, Liza doesn't

189
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,930
have a primary OB,

190
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,940
but I've seen her in the ED

191
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,940
throughout her pregnancy

192
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,940
for various complaints.

193
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,470
Uh, Doris, room seven.

194
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,600
There's a hypochondriac

195
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,600
with a hangnail.

196
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,370
So get an intern on it?

197
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,370
Yeah, read my mind.

198
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,510
Dr. Hudgins,

199
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,510
you're needed in

200
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,510
treatment seven.

201
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,780
I'm sorry.

202
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,780
You were saying?

203
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,850
My patient, Liza Martin,

204
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,850
doesn't have a primary OB.

205
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,650
Okay. Yeah,

206
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,650
I heard all this.

207
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,650
What's the ask?

208
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,550
I'd like to follow her

209
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,550
upstairs and deliver her.

210
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,420
You're my only OB

211
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,420
in the ED.

212
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,690
I can come back and forth

213
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,690
while she's in early labor.

214
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,660
And I'm also just

215
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,660
an elevator ride away

216
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,920
in case something urgent

217
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,920
comes up.

218
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,520
But I'm Liza's

219
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,520
only continuity, so...

220
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,660
You know,

221
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,660
she's comfortable

222
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,660
with me.

223
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,830
We go back a ways.

224
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,990
Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

225
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,470
Really?

226
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,470
Yeah, just don't

227
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,470
dillydally.

228
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,570
Yes, sir.

229
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,770
As you know, we have

230
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,770
a seat opening up

231
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,770
on the board.

232
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,940
Oh, did you get

233
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,940
a chance to review

234
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,940
my nominee?

235
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,950
I sent her CV around.

236
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,810
Sorry. Remind me

237
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,810
the candidate's...

238
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,440
Gloria Jeffers.

239
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,620
She's chaired

240
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,620
the fundraising committee

241
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,620
for eight years.

242
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,750
She volunteers

243
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,750
here regularly.

244
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,060
She brings a lot

245
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,060
of donors to Med.

246
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,730
Well, sounds like

247
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,730
a strong candidate.

248
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,730
She is.

249
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,530
Now, are you familiar

250
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,530
with Dr. George Thomas?

251
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,330
Well, the name

252
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,330
rings a bell,

253
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
but I'm not placing it

254
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
right offhand.

255
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,970
Well, George

256
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,970
is a close friend,

257
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,670
a renowned urologist,

258
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,670
and a former Wisconsin

259
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,670
state legislator.

260
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,080
Now, he's mostly retired

261
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,910
but still lobbies for some

262
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,910
biotech companies part-time.

263
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,020
I think that

264
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,020
his connections could be

265
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,020
very advantageous for us.

266
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,750
While my nominee

267
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,750
is just simply

268
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,750
a devoted volunteer?

269
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,350
Look, Sharon,

270
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,350
I'm not gonna try to make

271
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,350
you into a turncoat,

272
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,560
but take a lunch

273
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,560
with George?

274
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,960
Of course.

275
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,460
Just give his information

276
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,460
to my assistant,

277
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,060
and we'll get something

278
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,060
on the books.

279
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,040
Well, I hope you don't mind,

280
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,040
but I already took the liberty

281
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,740
of talking

282
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,740
with your assistant,

283
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
and it turns out

284
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
you're free

285
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
for lunch today.

286
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,540
What are you saying?

287
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,710
And as luck

288
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,710
would have it,

289
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,710
so is George.

290
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,880
Is that right?

291
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,880
Hmm.

292
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,850
1:00 in the executive

293
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,850
dining room?

294
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,850
And I assume

295
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,850
you'll be joining us?

296
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,360
Oh, listen, I wish I could,

297
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,360
but I am slammed

298
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,360
with meetings today.

299
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,490
Hmm.

300
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,490
I'll be sure to check in

301
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,490
afterwards, though.

302
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,690
You know, Sharon,

303
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,860
I really think you two

304
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,860
are gonna hit it off.

305
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,660
You just hang in there.

306
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,470
And I'll get you

307
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,470
an update soon, okay?

308
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,560
All right.

309
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,080
That was

310
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,080
Rob's wife, Louisa.

311
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,710
Was getting her

312
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,710
up to speed.

313
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,510
What are the odds

314
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,510
that he'll keep his hand?

315
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,950
Not good.

316
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,610
Immediate replantation

317
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,610
is impossible.

318
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,990
Too much contamination?

319
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,790
Yeah, well,

320
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,790
the proximal stump's

321
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,800
gonna need at least

322
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,800
a week of daily debridement

323
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,800
just to get it cleaned up.

324
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,060
Real shame too.

325
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,060
What do you mean?

326
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,470
'Cause the hand's

327
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,470
actually in good shape,

328
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,470
all things considered.

329
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,800
I'll bet it's salvageable.

330
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,100
Maximum six hours

331
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,100
without blood flow, and...

332
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,640
Hand's gonna die.

333
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,640
Yeah.

334
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,510
But what about

335
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,510
putting it on

336
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,510
a perfusion pump,

337
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,710
like you would with

338
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,710
a heart and lungs?

339
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,720
Well, it's a good thought,

340
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,720
but...

341
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,680
That won't buy us

342
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,680
more than a day.

343
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,450
If only we could find a way

344
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,450
to perfuse the hand long-term.

345
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,930
Well, but like you said,

346
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,930
it's a shame.

347
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,790
Jackie, going to

348
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,790
treatment four.

349
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,600
Got it. This is

350
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,600
Isaac Collins.

351
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,860
53-year-old male.

352
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,860
Motor vehicle collision.

353
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,870
Ambulatory at the scene,

354
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,870
refused board and collar.

355
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,840
He was rear-ended.

356
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,840
My fault, though.

357
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,100
Facial bruising's

358
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,100
from the airbag.

359
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,010
I switched lanes

360
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,010
without signaling,

361
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,140
then jammed on the brakes

362
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,140
to make a turn.

363
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,550
It was a bonehead move.

364
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,880
Luckily, the other guy's

365
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,880
all right.

366
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,950
Glad to hear it.

367
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,950
I'm Dr. Halstead,

368
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,950
by the way. Vitals?

369
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,220
Blood pressure's

370
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,220
a little high, 150/97.

371
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,980
I'm always hypertensive,

372
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,980
especially when I'm due

373
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,980
for dialysis.

374
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,090
I've got end-stage

375
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,090
renal disease.

376
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,720
I appreciate you

377
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,720
letting me know.

378
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,730
On my count, folks.

379
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,730
One, two, three.

380
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,860
Thanks, guys.

381
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,970
I see you've got a fistula.

382
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,970
Yeah, I've been through

383
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,970
a few of 'em.

384
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,540
Going on five years

385
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,540
of dialysis.

386
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,670
Dr. Cuevas.

387
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,670
Isaac.

388
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,940
Dr. Jones told me

389
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,940
the good news.

390
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,110
I was hoping

391
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,110
I would see you today,

392
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,110
but not in the ED.

393
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,480
What happened?

394
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,750
She's my shrink.

395
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,780
I'm actually not, Isaac.

396
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,690
Do you mind if I disclose

397
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,690
to Dr. Halstead how

398
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,690
we know each other?

399
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,160
My wife, Samantha,

400
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,160
and I attend Dr. Cuevas's

401
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,160
support group.

402
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,730
For patients and families

403
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,730
living with chronic illness.

404
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,030
Which, by tomorrow,

405
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,030
won't be us anymore,

406
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,040
which leads me as to why

407
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,040
I was driving like a maniac.

408
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,240
I got the call.

409
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,770
I'm getting a new kidney.

410
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,280
Congratulations.

411
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,170
Anyways, you can see

412
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,170
I couldn't wait to get

413
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,170
to the hospital fast enough.

414
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,000
But I'm... I'm fine.

415
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,950
Like I told the paramedics,

416
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,950
nothing feels broken.

417
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,750
Now, when you say

418
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,750
nothing feels broken,

419
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,790
anything feel tender?

420
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,550
No, I'm good, really.

421
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,890
You know, Isaac,

422
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,890
when I spoke to Dr. Jones,

423
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,020
he said that the organ

424
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,020
wouldn't even be here

425
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,260
for several hours.

426
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,820
There's no rush.

427
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,660
Why don't you

428
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,660
let Dr. Halstead

429
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,660
check you out properly?

430
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,240
Neck and back's

431
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,240
a little sore, I guess,

432
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,740
but it's really

433
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,740
not that bad.

434
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,710
I just don't want anything

435
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,710
to mess up the surgery.

436
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,650
Well, even if you have

437
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,650
a sprain or a minor fracture,

438
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,310
it shouldn't postpone

439
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,310
the transplant.

440
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,310
But better Dr. Jones

441
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,310
and his surgical team know.

442
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,320
That way, they can

443
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,320
avoid aggravating

444
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,320
any injury further.

445
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,090
All right.

446
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,090
Yeah, makes sense.

447
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,830
Let's get a CT

448
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,830
of the CTLS spine.

449
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,870
Sorry I keep you waiting.

450
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,870
Mmm.

451
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,870
I was talking

452
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,870
with my friend.

453
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,870
No prob.

454
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,600
Chamomile tea,

455
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,600
blueberry muffin,

456
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,600
chocolate croissant.

457
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,270
You're very sweet,

458
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,270
but I can't eat.

459
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,110
My stomach is in knots.

460
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,680
What's up?

461
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,910
My friend thinks we may

462
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,910
be out of work very soon.

463
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,010
What?

464
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,680
Is this about your

465
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,680
union's renegotiation

466
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,850
with the hospital?

467
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,850
Yeah.

468
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,220
Well, I knew they were

469
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,220
trying to iron out

470
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,800
a new contract,

471
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,800
but I mean, honestly,

472
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,060
I haven't been paying

473
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,060
that close attention.

474
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,030
She says talks

475
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,030
are breaking down,

476
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,830
that neither side

477
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,830
will budge,

478
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,130
and the union

479
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,130
may ask for a vote.

480
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,800
A strike

481
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,800
authorization vote?

482
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,280
If I miss work for weeks,

483
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,280
even for days,

484
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,370
this is not good.

485
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,700
I send money

486
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,700
home to my parents.

487
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,610
But I mean,

488
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,610
even if a vote passes,

489
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,310
that doesn't mean

490
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,310
they're gonna strike.

491
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,310
It's just...

492
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,680
It just gives them more

493
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,680
ammunition when they

494
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,680
go back to the table.

495
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,350
These things, you know,

496
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,350
tend to take time.

497
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,150
You've got to

498
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,150
let it play out.

499
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,860
I'm guessing they're gonna

500
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,860
make a deal.

501
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,920
I think

502
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,920
it's gonna be okay.

503
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,640
She just started having

504
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,640
fetal heart rate decelerations

505
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,300
with tetanic contractions.

506
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,400
I turned down the Pit.

507
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,870
Hannah,

508
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,870
it hurts so much.

509
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,110
Okay, stop the Pitocin.

510
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,080
Liza, we're gonna

511
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,080
see if it's time

512
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,080
to push yet, okay?

513
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,810
Can you bend

514
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,810
your knees for me?

515
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,810
I'm gonna check you out.

516
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,660
Okay, you're only about

517
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,660
six centimeters dilated.

518
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,920
What?

519
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,920
We need to get you

520
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,430
onto your hands and knees

521
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,430
to let us help you

522
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,990
turn you over, okay?

523
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,990
What's going on?

524
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,190
What's wrong?

525
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,160
Your umbilical cord is

526
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,160
being squeezed somewhere.

527
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,170
That's what's causing

528
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,170
the baby's heart rate

529
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,170
to drop.

530
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,000
Moving positions can help

531
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,000
relieve the compression.

532
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,270
I know. I know.

533
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,140
All right. I'm gonna

534
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,140
check you out.

535
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,080
Uterus is still rock hard.

536
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,910
Let's give her 0.25

537
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,910
of terbutaline, sub-q.

538
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,040
Liza, you can lie

539
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,040
back down now, okay?

540
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,350
Gently.

541
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,350
Gentle.

542
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,810
We're trying

543
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,810
a uterine relaxant.

544
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,850
Now, if this doesn't work,

545
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,450
we're gonna need to deliver

546
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,450
your baby via C-section.

547
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,960
Let's get an OR ready.

548
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,960
No, I don't want that.

549
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,460
It's okay. Just one

550
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,460
step at a time.

551
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,960
Let's first see

552
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,960
if this medicine works, okay?

553
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,830
Baby's heart rate's

554
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,830
coming up.

555
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,200
That's really good.

556
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,140
Give it about

557
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,140
a half hour,

558
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,150
and restart

559
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,150
the Pitocin slowly.

560
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,150
Mm-hmm.

561
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,480
But let's keep

562
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,480
an OR ready.

563
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,480
If the baby's heart rate

564
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,480
drops like that, I'm doing

565
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,480
an emergency C-section.

566
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,290
So you want to surgically

567
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,290
attach Rob's hand

568
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,830
to the back of his leg?

569
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,800
It's called ectopic banking.

570
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,000
You see, what the hand

571
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,000
needs in order to survive

572
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,370
is adequate blood flow.

573
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,410
And his leg

574
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,410
can provide that?

575
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,280
The posterior tibial artery,

576
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,280
to be exact.

577
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,320
The PTA, it runs along

578
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,320
the back of the lower leg.

579
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,790
So you'd bank my hand

580
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,790
on my leg for a week or so?

581
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,360
That's right.

582
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,150
And then

583
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,150
you'll reattach it

584
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,150
to my arm, right?

585
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,790
More than just

586
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,790
reattach it.

587
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,060
Using the OR 2.0,

588
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,060
I believe that

589
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,060
we can restore

590
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,000
a remarkable amount

591
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,000
of function and feeling.

592
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,900
So I can keep working

593
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,900
construction?

594
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,130
Yeah.

595
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,830
I gotta be able to feel,

596
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,830
or I'm a liability on

597
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,830
a construction site.

598
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah, of course.

599
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,240
Okay, so, uh...

600
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,440
Well, 2.0's predictive

601
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,440
modeling estimated a...

602
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,150
85% likelihood of regaining

603
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,150
some or more sensation

604
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,150
in the hand.

605
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,930
And that's after many,

606
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,930
many months of physical

607
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,930
therapy and rehab.

608
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,360
Right, Dr. Marcel?

609
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,830
Maggie's correct.

610
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, it's gonna be

611
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,200
a long road ahead, for sure.

612
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,200
And that's if you decide

613
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,200
to go with the surgery.

614
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,400
There's other options,

615
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,400
of course.

616
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,170
There's been incredible

617
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,170
advancements in prosthetics.

618
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,470
And that's if this

619
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,470
banking thing doesn't work?

620
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,110
Then we can

621
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,110
talk prosthetics.

622
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,250
But I want

623
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,250
to give this a shot.

624
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,550
You've got this, Liza.

625
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,550
Keep going.

626
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,360
Why isn't she coming?

627
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,060
Just do the C-section.

628
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,400
It's too late for that.

629
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,400
Please.

630
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,130
I know you're exhausted,

631
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,130
but you've got this, Liza.

632
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,830
So when I count to three,

633
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,830
I need you to give me

634
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,830
everything you've got, okay?

635
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,210
This is it. Look at me.

636
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,010
One, two, three.

637
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Yes! Yes!

638
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,320
You did it, Liza!

639
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,250
Is she okay?

640
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,520
Yes.

641
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,190
Oh, hi.

642
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,530
Isn't she beautiful?

643
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,070
She's perfect.

644
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,600
I think

645
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,600
she needs something.

646
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,400
Can you check her again?

647
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,640
No, she's fine.

648
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,870
It's okay.

649
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,380
Crying helps the fluid

650
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,380
get out of her lungs.

651
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
But she won't stop.

652
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
It's okay.

653
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,250
The longer

654
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,250
she's on your chest,

655
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,250
the more she'll calm down.

656
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,120
Please, just take her.

657
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,120
It's a really

658
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,120
good idea... Okay.

659
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,120
Please just take her!

660
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,950
Here we go. Okay.

661
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,400
Shh...

662
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,930
I'm sorry.

663
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,140
I'm just...

664
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,140
I'm so tired.

665
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,430
Of course. You just

666
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,430
ran a marathon.

667
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,680
Okay. We'll get the baby

668
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,680
up to the nursery and let you

669
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,680
sleep a bit, okay?

670
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,470
It's okay, baby girl.

671
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,580
Just rest, okay?

672
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,290
Got Isaac's CT back.

673
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,090
He's got a compression

674
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,090
fracture at L2.

675
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,130
Well, that's unfortunate.

676
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,290
But like you said, it won't

677
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,290
delay the transplant, right?

678
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,560
Well, take a look.

679
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,370
I could be wrong,

680
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,370
but the bone

681
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,030
around the fracture

682
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,030
has a lytic appearance

683
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,030
to me.

684
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,630
Do you think Isaac

685
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,630
has cancer?

686
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,230
I think

687
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,230
there's a possibility.

688
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,250
Lytic lesions are commonly

689
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,250
associated with metastases.

690
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,180
And if the bone

691
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,180
was already damaged

692
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,180
from cancer,

693
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,310
well, even a minor trauma

694
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,310
could cause a fracture.

695
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,580
Okay, but you're not sure

696
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,580
that it's lytic, right?

697
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,160
There's still a chance

698
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,160
it could just be a traumatic

699
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,160
compression fracture?

700
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,590
Which is why I want

701
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,590
to get an MRI.

702
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,060
It'll show us if there are

703
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,060
other lesions and just

704
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,060
give us a better idea

705
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
if it's traumatic

706
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
or pathological.

707
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,330
And if it is pathological,

708
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,330
that means a biopsy.

709
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,030
And Isaac is definitely

710
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,030
not getting a kidney today.

711
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,200
No.

712
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,450
I wish Samantha was here,

713
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,450
his wife.

714
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,170
Where is she?

715
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,220
On a flight to Seattle

716
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,220
for their granddaughter's

717
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,220
first birthday.

718
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,490
Isaac got tired

719
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,490
of both of them missing out

720
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,490
on milestones.

721
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:12,030
But one time she goes out

722
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:12,030
of town, he gets the call.

723
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,120
You mind delivering

724
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,120
the news with me?

725
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,160
In her absence,

726
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,160
I think a familiar face

727
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,160
might be comforting.

728
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,430
Yeah, of course.

729
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,430
All right.

730
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,340
Hey.

731
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,770
You got a second?

732
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,040
Yep.

733
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,040
Uh, okay...

734
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,150
Is this operation

735
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,150
really worth the risk?

736
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,020
If anything

737
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,020
compromises blood flow

738
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,020
to the hand or the foot,

739
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,020
Rob could develop

740
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,020
an infection

741
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,020
and become septic.

742
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,750
The 2.0 will be

743
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,750
assessing blood flow

744
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,250
every step of the surgery

745
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,250
as well as predicting

746
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,450
if perfusion can be

747
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,450
maintained post-op.

748
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,590
Okay, clearly, you know

749
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,590
this technology

750
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,590
inside and out,

751
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,290
but it's also never been used

752
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,290
for this type of procedure.

753
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,500
So what are you saying?

754
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,130
What, I oversold Rob?

755
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,200
No, but I think

756
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,200
that you've got

757
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,200
a lot invested in 2.0,

758
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,610
and maybe you feel

759
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,610
a certain pressure

760
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,610
to use it.

761
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,410
I'm not gonna gamble

762
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,410
with a patient's life

763
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,510
just so I can show off

764
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,510
my shiny, new toy, Maggie.

765
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,610
Of course not.

766
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,550
I'm just saying that...

767
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,550
Crockett!

768
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,050
Here's the man

769
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,050
I'm looking for.

770
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,750
Anything else?

771
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,750
I didn't mean to chase

772
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,750
Nurse Lockwood away.

773
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,390
No, she had to get back

774
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,390
to the ED. What's up?

775
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
Dr. Song briefed me

776
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
on the ectopic banking case.

777
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,500
Very impressive.

778
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,500
Yeah.

779
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
And my videographer's

780
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
gonna film it.

781
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,470
We'll want to document it

782
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,470
and get as much

783
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,470
press as possible.

784
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,600
Jack, I don't want anybody

785
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,600
in there taking pictures

786
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,300
while I'm in the middle

787
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,300
of a complex surgery.

788
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,710
You won't even know

789
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,710
he's there.

790
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,240
I'll keep him out

791
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,240
of your way, I promise.

792
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,690
See you

793
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,690
in the amphitheater?

794
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,760
Yeah, right behind you.

795
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,760
Okay.

796
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,350
Hey.

797
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,730
Hey. Hope you're not

798
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,730
in any kind of hurry.

799
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,270
Elevators taking

800
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,270
their sweet time today.

801
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,360
I am fine.

802
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,840
I'm not exactly anxious

803
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,840
to get where I'm going.

804
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,840
Meeting with a friend

805
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,840
of Jack's

806
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,800
whose seat on the board

807
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,800
is all but assured.

808
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,340
Man, hospital politics.

809
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,310
Yikes!

810
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,310
Mm-hmm.

811
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,180
Speaking of which,

812
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,180
what are you hearing

813
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,610
about what's going on

814
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,610
with the negotiations

815
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,240
with the custodial

816
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,240
workers' union?

817
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,550
Liliana seems to think

818
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,550
they're getting all tense.

819
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,520
Between us, I don't...

820
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,520
I don't foresee a strike.

821
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,820
That's what I told her.

822
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,820
Yeah.

823
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,380
A strike would wreak havoc

824
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,380
on the hospital system.

825
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,160
I gotta say, though,

826
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,160
it does make me wonder

827
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,200
why we can't give

828
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,200
our lowest paid employees,

829
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,270
I mean, even a 6% raise.

830
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,230
Well, it would be

831
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,230
setting a precedent

832
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,540
that we can't afford to make

833
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,540
with the other unions, Daniel.

834
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,740
I mean, once we finish

835
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,740
with these negotiations,

836
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,680
we go into talks

837
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,680
with the nurses' union.

838
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,810
And then,

839
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,810
it's the plumbers' union.

840
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,620
I mean, you get

841
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,620
the picture, right?

842
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,890
If I had just checked

843
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,890
my blind spot,

844
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,670
we wouldn't be talking

845
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,670
about an MRI right now.

846
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,300
I'd be upstairs

847
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,300
getting prepped for surgery

848
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,300
tonight, right?

849
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,510
And that still might happen.

850
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,510
Yeah, I'm sorry, Isaac.

851
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,210
I could not have predicted

852
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,210
the CT would reveal this.

853
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,690
Dr. Halstead,

854
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,690
I've waited five hellish

855
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,690
years for a kidney.

856
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,950
I've blown out

857
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,950
so many veins,

858
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,950
they're running out

859
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,750
of access sites

860
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,750
to even deliver my dialysis.

861
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,890
If the fracture looks like

862
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,890
it's just from the accident...

863
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,490
Well, that's still

864
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,490
a possibility, but...

865
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,630
Then that's good enough

866
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,630
for me.

867
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,570
I'm not gonna fault you

868
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,570
for not running

869
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,570
any more tests.

870
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,230
And no one else

871
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,230
will either.

872
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,770
Please, I'm begging you.

873
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,540
Hey. I thought

874
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,540
you delivered

875
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,540
your patient.

876
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,850
I did, yes.

877
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,850
Well, why are you

878
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,850
still up here?

879
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,510
We need an OB consult

880
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,510
in the ED.

881
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,960
Okay, I can head back down

882
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,960
with you right now.

883
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,520
Just give me one sec

884
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,520
to let Liza know.

885
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,860
Okay.

886
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,430
Oh, hey.

887
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,230
Where's Liza?

888
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,240
Yeah, she... She, uh,

889
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,240
she had to use the bathroom.

890
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,710
I'm Mike.

891
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,710
I'm her boyfriend.

892
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,340
It's not safe for her

893
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,340
to use the restroom alone.

894
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,910
She seemed

895
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,910
all right to me.

896
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,780
Hey, Liza, it's Hannah.

897
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,780
Are you okay?

898
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,650
Give her a minute,

899
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,650
will you?

900
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,650
Get your hands off of me.

901
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,810
Get your hands off me!

902
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,910
Hey, you heard her!

903
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,720
Liza.

904
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,000
Help me get her

905
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,000
back into bed.

906
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,280
Okay. Watch her neck.

907
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,910
Support her head.

908
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,910
Yeah, we got her.

909
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,450
You have no idea how hard

910
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,450
Liza worked to stay sober.

911
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,960
You have no idea.

912
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,960
Well, I don't doubt that.

913
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,550
But we just found her

914
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,550
strung out on heroin.

915
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,990
She was overwhelmed

916
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,990
and exhausted

917
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,360
after a grueling labor

918
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,360
and had a serious

919
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,360
lapse of judgment,

920
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,330
but I know

921
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,330
that she could

922
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,330
get back on track.

923
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,560
Hold it. Wait, you're not

924
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,560
actually suggesting

925
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,690
that we send a baby home

926
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,690
with that woman?

927
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,790
No, of course not.

928
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,670
I want to find a sober

929
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,670
living situation for Liza,

930
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,800
a facility where she could

931
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,800
still receive treatment

932
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,970
while still caring

933
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,970
for her baby.

934
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,980
You are swerving

935
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,980
so far out of your lane,

936
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,980
not to mention

937
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,980
that you are mandated

938
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,980
to report this...

939
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,070
No, not until...

940
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,070
To, yes,

941
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,080
the appropriate

942
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,080
department.

943
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,080
Not until I figure out

944
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,850
a way to keep Liza

945
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,850
and her baby together.

946
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,980
Then you let DCFS

947
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,980
take care of it.

948
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,820
They're far

949
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,820
better equipped.

950
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,820
What if they can't, huh?

951
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,620
Liza doesn't have family

952
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,620
in the area. Who's gonna

953
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,620
take the baby?

954
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,920
Obviously, you care

955
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,920
a great deal about her.

956
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,430
Because I am her.

957
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,430
I have been her.

958
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,060
And the only reason

959
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,060
that I'm standing here

960
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,060
right now

961
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,740
is because people

962
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,740
didn't give up on me.

963
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,400
So I am not giving up

964
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,400
on Liza.

965
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,740
You have till

966
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,740
the end of the day.

967
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,900
Okay.

968
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,020
Dr. Song,

969
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,020
what's the recommendation

970
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,020
for anastomosis?

971
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,650
Any deviations

972
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,650
from the plan?

973
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,090
End to end ulnar

974
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,800
to posterior tibial artery

975
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,800
anastomosis.

976
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,130
Okay. What's the venous

977
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,130
drainage?

978
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,800
Anastomose the main dorsal

979
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,800
vein to the saphenous vein.

980
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,890
Okay, great.

981
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,670
Whoever that belongs to,

982
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,670
turn it off right now.

983
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,410
Sorry, that's me.

984
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,410
It's my next meeting.

985
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,880
This is Jack Dayton.

986
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,880
Great. Well...

987
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,820
Do you mind moving

988
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,820
to the right just a hair?

989
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,510
It'll give me

990
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,510
a much cleaner shot.

991
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,990
No, that's where

992
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,990
he needs to stand.

993
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,680
Let's keep noise down

994
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,680
to a minimum

995
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,120
from here on out, folks.

996
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,420
In terms of speed

997
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,420
and efficiency,

998
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,120
you're already performing

999
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,120
above and beyond

1000
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,120
2.0's predictions.

1001
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,760
We're on a good trajectory.

1002
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,930
All right.

1003
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,870
Let's say we forgo the MRI.

1004
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,870
He gets the transplant.

1005
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,000
If it turns out

1006
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,000
he does have cancer,

1007
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,480
the immunosuppressants

1008
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,480
he'll be on could interfere

1009
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,480
with his cancer treatment.

1010
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,480
And the treatment itself

1011
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,480
could destroy his new kidney.

1012
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,610
Valid concerns, yes.

1013
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,120
But a malignancy of any kind

1014
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,120
is a contraindication

1015
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,120
for transplantation.

1016
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,690
He'll be taken off

1017
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,690
the transplant list.

1018
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,990
Right, which is...

1019
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,460
All the more reason

1020
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,460
to look the other way?

1021
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,000
I have an ethical

1022
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,000
and legal obligation

1023
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,470
to disclose this finding.

1024
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,600
I fail to do that,

1025
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,600
it could compromise

1026
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,600
our status

1027
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,940
as a high volume

1028
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,940
transplant center.

1029
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,910
I know it's a risk,

1030
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,970
but, Will,

1031
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,810
this could be Isaac's

1032
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,810
only shot at a kidney.

1033
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,780
I hear you. I know.

1034
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,220
But it'd be irresponsible

1035
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,890
to let the transplant proceed

1036
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,890
until we know more.

1037
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,090
I'm sorry, Nellie.

1038
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,970
What, did Jack steamroll you

1039
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,970
into having lunch with me?

1040
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,130
What? Uh, no.

1041
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,130
No, not at all.

1042
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,140
Jack's a good friend,

1043
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,140
but when he wants something,

1044
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,080
he can be like a dog

1045
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,080
after a bone.

1046
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,670
Yeah, well, that has been

1047
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,670
my impression as well.

1048
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,080
Yeah, but in his defense,

1049
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,080
he's trying to do me a solid

1050
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,620
'cause he knows

1051
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,620
how eager

1052
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,950
I want to be a part

1053
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,950
of Med's board.

1054
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,490
Well, I'm curious.

1055
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,930
How did a former legislator

1056
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,930
turned lobbyist become...

1057
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,020
Girl, what did he do,

1058
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,020
tell you about

1059
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,020
my whole side hustle?

1060
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,570
Look.

1061
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,160
That's what my daughter

1062
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,160
calls it.

1063
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,160
Mmm.

1064
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,860
Listen.

1065
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,260
I'm not trying to be

1066
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,260
a part of your board

1067
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,270
so I can be

1068
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,270
a mouthpiece for some

1069
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,270
special interest groups.

1070
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,670
So why do you want

1071
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,670
to be on the board?

1072
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,010
To start with,

1073
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,810
I was born

1074
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,810
in this hospital.

1075
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,610
Get out. You're kidding.

1076
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,610
No, ma'am.

1077
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,750
I'ma be honest with you,

1078
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,750
my very first broken arm

1079
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,020
was fixed right

1080
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,020
within these walls.

1081
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,060
So this is a homecoming

1082
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,060
of sorts?

1083
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,100
Well, my ex-wife

1084
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,100
was a professor

1085
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,100
at UW Milwaukee.

1086
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,660
We raised

1087
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,660
the family there.

1088
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,300
But Chicago's home.

1089
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,040
And this hospital

1090
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,040
has always held a very

1091
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,040
special place in my heart.

1092
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,580
I'd love to be a part

1093
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,580
of its future.

1094
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,780
But I should warn you,

1095
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,220
I'm not one of those

1096
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,220
board members

1097
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,950
that's only gonna show up

1098
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,950
at special fancy parties,

1099
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,620
cut a check, and is

1100
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,620
never heard from again.

1101
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,820
Yes, I know

1102
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,820
that type as well.

1103
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,130
I got a lot of time

1104
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,130
on my hands.

1105
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,270
And I also

1106
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,270
have a lot of ideas.

1107
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,330
I'm all ears.

1108
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,810
Oh, hey, Hannah.

1109
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,810
I'm glad I caught you.

1110
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,810
Would you mind pointing me

1111
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,810
to one of your patients?

1112
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,080
It's a Liza... Sorry.

1113
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,980
Uh, I think that

1114
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,980
there's been a mix-up.

1115
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,890
I didn't make

1116
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,890
a call to DCFS.

1117
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,360
Well, I actually wasn't told

1118
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,360
who made the call,

1119
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,290
just that an eval

1120
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,290
was requested.

1121
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,860
Well, that's definitely

1122
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,860
an error.

1123
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,830
Oh, uh, okay.

1124
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,190
I'm sorry

1125
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,190
you had to come down.

1126
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,660
I'm the treating physician,

1127
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,670
and that patient

1128
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,670
doesn't need an evaluation.

1129
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,760
Uh, okay.

1130
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,810
Well, in that case,

1131
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,810
I guess I'll just head

1132
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,810
back up to my office.

1133
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,900
Yeah.

1134
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,680
What were the patient's

1135
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,680
vitals on intake?

1136
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,770
Let me check.

1137
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,220
Well, you should

1138
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,220
have this on the tip

1139
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,220
of your tongue.

1140
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,720
Hey, I told you

1141
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,720
I was working on it.

1142
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,790
You had no right

1143
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,790
to make that call.

1144
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,020
Give us the room, please.

1145
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,220
I'll check back

1146
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,220
later, yeah.

1147
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,930
Okay, you do not

1148
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,930
dress me down ever,

1149
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,800
and definitely not

1150
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,800
in front of a resident.

1151
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,200
I repeat, you had no right

1152
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,200
to make that call.

1153
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,900
The hell are you

1154
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,900
talking about?

1155
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,900
You called DCFS on Liza.

1156
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,840
No, I did not.

1157
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,270
Hannah, I'm serious!

1158
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,410
Well, then who did?

1159
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,650
Okay.

1160
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,650
I'm gonna remove

1161
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,650
the clamp.

1162
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,160
Nice and easy. Okay.

1163
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,250
Lap pad.

1164
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,200
Yeah, the ulnar side's

1165
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,200
showing some good perfusion.

1166
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,670
But yeah, there's not

1167
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,670
enough circulation

1168
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,100
through the palmar arch.

1169
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,800
And the radial side's

1170
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,800
looking dusky to me.

1171
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,280
Could we hook in

1172
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,280
the radial artery

1173
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,280
to something,

1174
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,070
give it

1175
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,070
independent inflow?

1176
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,380
I'll have 2.0 run

1177
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,380
through the iterations.

1178
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,680
It's assessing a number

1179
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,680
of variables.

1180
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,020
It probably just

1181
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,020
needs a minute.

1182
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,390
Not enough information.

1183
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,050
Confidence interval

1184
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,050
is too low.

1185
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,430
I think it just needs better

1186
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,430
mapping of the radial artery

1187
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,890
in the palmar arch.

1188
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,300
Let me see if I can

1189
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,300
recalibrate imaging.

1190
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,170
Not enough information.

1191
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,330
Confidence interval

1192
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,330
is too low.

1193
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,000
Unfortunately,

1194
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,000
the real-time data

1195
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,000
is insufficient.

1196
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,710
And the pre-op imaging

1197
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,710
is inadequate.

1198
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,180
What other artery

1199
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,180
am I gonna use

1200
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,180
to plug into the radial?

1201
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,810
Without adequate blood flow,

1202
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,810
the hand's not gonna survive.

1203
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,860
I'm afraid 2.0 doesn't

1204
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,860
have enough data

1205
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,980
to offer recommendation.

1206
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,320
There's just not enough

1207
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,320
published literature

1208
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,320
to draw from.

1209
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,860
So what am I supposed

1210
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,860
to do here?

1211
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,860
Use your best

1212
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,860
critical judgment.

1213
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,770
Oh. Of course.

1214
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm not getting the MRI,

1215
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,270
not till after

1216
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,270
the transplant.

1217
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,180
How about that?

1218
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,180
I refuse.

1219
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,920
Dr. Jones won't proceed

1220
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,920
with the surgery until he sees

1221
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,920
the results of an MRI.

1222
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,510
You had no right

1223
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,510
to tell him anything.

1224
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,190
Isaac, I had

1225
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,190
an ethical duty

1226
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,330
to notify your

1227
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,330
transplant surgeon...

1228
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,830
I should have just

1229
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,830
stuck to my story

1230
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,420
and told you I felt fine.

1231
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,060
Never should have

1232
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,060
mentioned any pain.

1233
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,000
Isaac, I know

1234
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,000
this is upsetting...

1235
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,300
Just do the damn

1236
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,300
MRI already!

1237
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,900
Get me Dr. Jones!

1238
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,410
Okay, he'll be

1239
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,410
here shortly.

1240
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,870
I'll put in the order.

1241
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,290
So you requested DCFS

1242
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,290
be called?

1243
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,550
Liza, why?

1244
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,440
When I held my little girl

1245
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,440
for the first time,

1246
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,980
I could feel her

1247
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,980
depending on me,

1248
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,150
needing me

1249
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,150
for everything.

1250
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,150
I couldn't take it.

1251
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,310
I broke.

1252
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,820
Liza...

1253
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,920
These last few months

1254
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,920
have been the hardest

1255
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,920
of my life.

1256
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,560
And it took everything

1257
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,560
in me to stay sober,

1258
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,830
but I did it for her.

1259
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,370
And now, I just...

1260
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,070
I can't muscle my way

1261
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,070
through this.

1262
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,210
Okay, I've been there.

1263
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,540
Every time I got sober

1264
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,540
for someone else,

1265
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,020
a family member,

1266
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,020
a partner,

1267
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,020
it lasted a year

1268
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,020
at the most.

1269
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,520
Every time, I'd relapse.

1270
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,560
It finally stuck

1271
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,560
when I got sober

1272
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,560
for myself.

1273
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,880
Care for dessert?

1274
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,320
Coffee or espresso?

1275
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,320
No, thanks.

1276
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,890
None for me.

1277
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,890
Thank you.

1278
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,890
Oh, my goodness.

1279
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,890
It's almost 3:00.

1280
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,160
I really hate

1281
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,160
to cut this off,

1282
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,160
but unfortunately...

1283
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,030
The place

1284
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,030
won't run itself.

1285
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,300
Uh, not yet, although Jack

1286
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,300
is working on it.

1287
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,030
Yeah, I imagine

1288
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,030
he would be.

1289
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,440
Well, this has been quite

1290
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,440
a productive conversation.

1291
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,210
Well, you know,

1292
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,210
we can always continue

1293
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,210
the conversation.

1294
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,220
Should you join the board?

1295
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,220
Thank you.

1296
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,480
Is that your

1297
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,480
more subtle way

1298
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,150
of asking if I'm gonna

1299
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,150
support your nomination?

1300
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,250
No, ma'am.

1301
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,420
That's my very

1302
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,420
unsubtle way

1303
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,420
of asking you

1304
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,520
if you'll join me

1305
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,520
for drinks tonight.

1306
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,620
Oh.

1307
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,260
Well, that's a very

1308
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,260
tempting idea,

1309
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,360
but, um,

1310
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,360
I'm gonna have to...

1311
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,000
Politely decline.

1312
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,070
Politely.

1313
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,240
Well, I appreciate you

1314
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,240
considering it.

1315
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,110
I hope the rest of your day

1316
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,110
goes easy on you.

1317
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,080
And the same for you,

1318
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,080
Dr. Thomas.

1319
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,950
Ah. George.

1320
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,390
Sharon.

1321
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,130
You're back.

1322
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,130
I am.

1323
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,430
And I could use

1324
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,430
your expertise.

1325
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,430
Tell me.

1326
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,440
How do you calm

1327
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,440
your nerves

1328
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,100
when your heart

1329
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,100
is beating very fast?

1330
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,410
Well, um, the first thing

1331
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,410
you do is you sit down.

1332
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:45,050
And, um, just take

1333
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:45,050
a couple deep breaths,

1334
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,680
and well, tell me

1335
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,680
what's going on.

1336
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,690
I'm nervous because

1337
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,690
I'm going to speak

1338
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,230
with a reporter

1339
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,230
from Tribune tomorrow.

1340
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,090
Our union boss, Mr. Wilson,

1341
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,090
he's meeting me to prepare.

1342
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,690
Wow. How did

1343
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,690
that come about?

1344
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,330
You remember my friend

1345
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,330
I was telling you about

1346
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,400
from this morning?

1347
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,400
Yeah.

1348
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,570
She's told Mr. Wilson

1349
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,570
about me.

1350
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,010
And he asked me

1351
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,010
to go on record

1352
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,200
for a story the newspaper

1353
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,200
is writing

1354
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,080
about the negotiations,

1355
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,080
what's at stake for us.

1356
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,210
I wonder if that's really

1357
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,210
the best tactic

1358
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,650
for the union

1359
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,650
to take right now,

1360
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,690
to talk to the press

1361
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,690
while negotiations

1362
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,690
are still ongoing.

1363
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,280
I mean, it could be seen

1364
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,280
as a bad faith move.

1365
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,560
And honestly, Liliana,

1366
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,560
I would be worried

1367
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,360
about possible

1368
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,360
personal repercussions

1369
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,360
for you.

1370
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,490
Yeah, that's what

1371
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,490
I thought first too,

1372
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,400
that it would fan flames,

1373
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,530
cause more harm

1374
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,530
than good.

1375
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,530
Exactly.

1376
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,070
But my friend, she tells me

1377
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,070
Mr. Wilson tells her this:

1378
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,540
the hospital

1379
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,540
is flying in workers

1380
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
from all over

1381
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
to replace us.

1382
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,270
They're flying in scabs?

1383
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,780
They're putting them

1384
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,780
in hotels and everything.

1385
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,610
That's why I said

1386
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,610
I would go on record.

1387
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,260
Hey, Sharon.

1388
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,260
Yeah?

1389
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,460
George has been

1390
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,460
blowing up my phone.

1391
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,830
He was eager before,

1392
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,830
but now he's ready

1393
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,470
to go to the mat

1394
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,470
for this board seat.

1395
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,630
Well, I will say

1396
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,630
he's a very

1397
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,630
appealing candidate.

1398
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,700
I still think Gloria Jeffers

1399
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,700
would make an exceptional

1400
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,700
board member,

1401
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,640
but I'm glad you brought

1402
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,640
Dr. Thomas to my attention.

1403
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,410
So you'll support

1404
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,410
his candidacy?

1405
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,210
I won't challenge it.

1406
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,210
Hmm.

1407
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,740
You know, not to gloat,

1408
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,740
but, I told you, didn't I?

1409
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,520
Sounds like

1410
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,520
gloating to me.

1411
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,500
Sharon, hospital's

1412
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,500
negotiating with

1413
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,500
scare tactics now?

1414
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,300
They're flying in scabs?

1415
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,300
Yeah.

1416
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,600
I... I don't like it either,

1417
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,670
but it's also

1418
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,670
a necessary precaution.

1419
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,180
Did you know about this

1420
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,180
when we were talking

1421
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,180
this morning?

1422
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,640
I mean, I thought you

1423
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,640
told me that the negotiation

1424
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,640
was going well.

1425
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,810
No, what I said

1426
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,810
was that I didn't

1427
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,810
foresee a strike.

1428
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,480
But look, we still

1429
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,480
have to be prepared

1430
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,210
for the possibility

1431
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,210
of a work stoppage, Daniel.

1432
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,880
I mean, anything less

1433
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,880
is negligence.

1434
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,820
What I'd say to the board

1435
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,820
is I'd say, look, isn't a 6%

1436
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,820
bump for a custodian

1437
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,290
a fraction of what

1438
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,290
it would be for a nurses?

1439
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,560
Daniel, I don't ever tell you

1440
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,560
how to do your job.

1441
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,230
And I'm not telling you

1442
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,230
how to do yours.

1443
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,390
I'm telling you people

1444
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,390
are scared

1445
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,560
'cause they can't afford

1446
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,560
to miss a paycheck.

1447
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,370
Yeah, and that's

1448
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,370
the last thing I want.

1449
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,840
That's why I'm trying

1450
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,840
to do everything in my power

1451
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,530
to avert a strike.

1452
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,370
I can't give you all

1453
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,370
of the details.

1454
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,750
I expect you,

1455
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,750
of all people,

1456
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,750
to trust that.

1457
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,920
Get the MRI back?

1458
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,790
Yes, and it showed evidence

1459
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,790
of a pathological fracture.

1460
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,500
When are they doing

1461
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,500
the biopsy?

1462
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,630
Tomorrow morning,

1463
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,630
but Dr. Jones

1464
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,630
ordered an SPEP

1465
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,600
and a UPEP after

1466
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,600
he saw the MRI,

1467
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,400
and both blood tests

1468
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,400
came back positive.

1469
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,870
Multiple myeloma.

1470
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,570
In all likelihood, yes.

1471
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,710
Isaac hasn't been told yet.

1472
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,410
Dr. Jones wanted to wait

1473
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,540
until it was confirmed

1474
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,540
by the biopsy.

1475
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,950
Just this morning,

1476
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,950
Isaac thought his luck

1477
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,950
was changing,

1478
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,660
he was finally getting

1479
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,660
a new kidney.

1480
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,750
And now,

1481
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,720
he's potentially facing

1482
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,720
a terminal cancer.

1483
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,600
Or maybe not.

1484
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,700
Maybe, thanks to

1485
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,700
your diligence,

1486
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,700
we caught it early.

1487
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,800
Maybe that MRI

1488
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,800
just saved his life.

1489
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,220
Hey.

1490
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,220
I spoke to Dr. Song.

1491
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,790
She said the surgery

1492
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,790
went well

1493
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,320
and Rob's hand has

1494
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,320
excellent blood flow

1495
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,320
and venous return.

1496
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,650
Yeah, things are looking

1497
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,650
all right.

1498
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,760
I had a moment in there.

1499
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,430
It's like I didn't know

1500
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,430
how to trust my own judgment,

1501
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,860
mostly 'cause I haven't

1502
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,860
needed to in some time.

1503
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,740
I'd just ask 2.0.

1504
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,280
That's the price we pay

1505
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,280
for ease and convenience.

1506
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,840
I suppose.

1507
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,560
Marilyn has been

1508
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,560
fostering newborns

1509
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,290
for over five years,

1510
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,290
ever since she retired.

1511
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,990
So you have a lot

1512
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,990
of experience then?

1513
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,360
I do.

1514
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,660
And, Liza,

1515
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,660
like we talked about,

1516
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,800
the goal is

1517
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,800
reunification, always,

1518
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,470
so soon as you finish

1519
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,470
the treatment program,

1520
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,710
we'll reassess things.

1521
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,840
All right.

1522
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,880
Okay.

1523
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,880
Do you have a name

1524
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,880
picked out?

1525
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,790
Yeah, it's Hannah.

1526
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,070
Hey, Dr. Song.

1527
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,700
Glad I caught you.

1528
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,610
I wanted to let you know

1529
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,610
you can sleep in tomorrow.

1530
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,510
What happened

1531
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,510
to the exploratory lab

1532
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,640
we had scheduled

1533
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,640
for 8:00 a.m.?

1534
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,310
Yeah, it's still on

1535
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,310
the docket. I just

1536
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,310
moved it to a normal OR.

1537
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,580
If this is about

1538
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,580
what happened today...

1539
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,850
It's not. I mean, it is,

1540
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,950
but not because

1541
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,950
I lost any confidence

1542
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,950
in 2.0.

1543
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,580
Okay.

1544
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,620
Um, you ever turn off the GPS

1545
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,620
while you're driving

1546
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,100
just to see

1547
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,100
if you still know

1548
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,100
the roads?

1549
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,530
No, never.

1550
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,790
Fair enough.

1551
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,470
Me, I need to do that

1552
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,470
from time to time.

1553
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,730
For my own confidence.

1554
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,770
If you change your mind,

1555
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,810
it takes a double shot

1556
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,810
of espresso, and I am up.

1557
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,440
Good to know.

1558
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,580
Good night.

1559
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,960
Daniel, wait.

1560
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,080
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1561
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,420
No, I didn't want

1562
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,420
to interrupt.

1563
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,430
No. No, no, no, it's okay.

1564
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,430
Good you're here, actually.

1565
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,500
How's the, uh...

1566
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,500
How's the prep going?

1567
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,630
Okay, I think.

1568
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,670
Mr. Wilson was asking

1569
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,670
if I know any doctors

1570
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,670
at hospital

1571
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,640
who would be willing

1572
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,640
to speak out.

1573
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,610
How do you mean?

1574
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,980
Uh, for newspaper article.

1575
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,570
Talk to reporters,

1576
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,570
share why you support us,

1577
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,570
our demands.

1578
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,990
Because for me,

1579
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,990
that would be a violation

1580
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,380
of my employment contract.

1581
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,890
I'm not allowed to...

1582
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,050
To speak to the media without

1583
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,050
talking to the hospital first.

1584
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,430
Mr. Wilson said you don't

1585
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,430
have to go on record.

1586
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,400
Um, you would just...

1587
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,090
We'd just say

1588
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,090
your department.

1589
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,100
No names.

1590
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,400
Liliana, I would love to help,

1591
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,170
but I mean, I just think

1592
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,170
that people would...

1593
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,000
You know, they'd connect

1594
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,000
the dots pretty quickly.

1595
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,470
Don't you think?

1596
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,470
I understand. It's okay.

1597
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,170
Really?

1598
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,950
You know how much

1599
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,950
I support you.

1600
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,710
You don't have to explain.

1601
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,680
I'll, uh, call you later?

1602
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,150
Sure. Okay.
