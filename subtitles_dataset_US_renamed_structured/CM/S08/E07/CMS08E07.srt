1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,260
Dr. Marcel exemplifies

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,260
the selfless dedication

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,240
we here at Gaffney pride

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,240
ourselves on.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,430
Confident, creative,

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,430
future of medicine, this guy.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,270
Do you ever wonder

8
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,270
what it would have been like

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,350
if they hadn't made us

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,350
put Vanessa up for adoption?

11
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,640
I made it

12
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,640
very clear to Grant

13
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,120
that I am not interested

14
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,120
in reconnecting with him.

15
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,380
You felt the need

16
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,380
to tell him that?

17
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,280
I didn't want there

18
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,280
to be any confusion.

19
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,050
Samir offered me

20
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,050
a spot on his team.

21
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,180
In the Philippines?

22
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,420
This is my calling.

23
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,400
It's been a while.

24
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,400
15 years.

25
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,330
If you have anything

26
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,330
that you want to say to me

27
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,330
after all this time...

28
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,660
I'd like to try

29
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,660
my best to listen.

30
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,700
No, problem.

31
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,700
Come on.

32
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,140
That's what

33
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,140
I'm talking about.

34
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,730
Morning, Ethan.

35
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,730
Morning, Hannah.

36
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,530
Hey, I'm gonna

37
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,530
hit the showers.

38
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,740
I'll grab you a juice.

39
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,210
Thanks.

40
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,180
You two seem to be

41
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,180
getting along.

42
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,150
It's not like that.

43
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,150
We're just friends.

44
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,550
If you say so.

45
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,750
What about you?

46
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,150
How are things with April?

47
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,450
Mmm, to be honest,

48
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,290
it's much easier

49
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,290
the second time around.

50
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,060
It's like we got all the big

51
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,060
arguments out of the way.

52
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,160
That's great.

53
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,160
Yeah.

54
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,200
You know, it turns out,

55
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,200
we were walking down

56
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,360
the same path this entire time

57
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,360
and just didn't know it.

58
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,040
I think with Hannah and I,

59
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,040
our... our paths diverged

60
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,040
a long time ago.

61
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,340
Well, at least you got someone

62
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,340
to spot you in the gym.

63
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,220
Zach, you've got incoming.

64
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,220
You're going to

65
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,220
treatment three.

66
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,310
Okay.

67
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,780
Dr. Charles,

68
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,150
I don't seem to

69
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,150
have an attending

70
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,150
at the moment.

71
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,720
Do you mind looking

72
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,720
after Zach?

73
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,050
Uh, sure.

74
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,280
Cesar, talk to me.

75
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,280
You're going to three.

76
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,520
Renee Chapman, 50 years old.

77
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,520
Neighbors called it in.

78
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,190
Said she fell trying

79
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,190
to scale a fence.

80
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,190
Husband's on his way.

81
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,200
BP 120/80, heart rate 72.

82
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,670
She's experiencing

83
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,670
some mild confusion.

84
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,260
GCS 14 with

85
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,260
a possible head injury.

86
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,700
Whoa, what is this?

87
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,700
Not my fault.

88
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,410
Talk to whoever's

89
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,410
in charge of scrubs.

90
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,540
Zach.

91
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,480
There are no scrubs here.

92
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,480
We're completely wiped out.

93
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,850
At least we still have

94
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,850
patient gowns.

95
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,650
Well, what are we supposed

96
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,650
to do about surgeries?

97
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,820
There's no way to maintain

98
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,360
a sterile environment

99
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,360
in street clothes.

100
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,660
Well, Goodwin's

101
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,660
working on it.

102
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,090
Meanwhile, we're gonna

103
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,090
have to make do

104
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
with what we've got.

105
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
What about us?

106
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,360
I can't see patients

107
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,360
dressed like this.

108
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,700
Mags, this isn't gonna cut it.

109
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
What do you want me to do,

110
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
knit you a sweater?

111
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,200
Maybe I've got

112
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,200
a change of clothes in my car.

113
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,570
Actually, why don't we hit

114
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,570
the hospital thrift store?

115
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,140
Maybe we'll find something

116
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,140
presentable.

117
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,610
That's fine, but make it fast.

118
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,150
I want the rest of you

119
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,150
back in the ED now.

120
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,810
Seriously?

121
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,810
Yes, and no complaints.

122
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,110
I'm already short a doctor

123
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,110
with Vanessa gone.

124
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,560
Okay, Ms. Chapman.

125
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,120
Good news is,

126
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,120
your chest X-ray

127
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,120
looks clear.

128
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,750
No rib fractures.

129
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,830
If it's okay with you, I would

130
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,830
like to send you for a head CT

131
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,330
just to be

132
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,330
on the safe side.

133
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,900
Would you mind calling

134
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,900
Radiology to let them

135
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,900
know we're on our way?

136
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,560
I want it out of me.

137
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,470
You want what out of you?

138
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,800
Where's Dr. Blake?

139
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,770
You know, Dr. Blake doesn't

140
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,770
actually work here anymore--

141
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,900
I want it out of me!

142
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,610
What do you want out of you?

143
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,700
It's not mine. Get it...

144
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, God.

145
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

146
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,240
A little help here?

147
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,240
Get it out of me!

148
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,290
Get it out of me!

149
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,250
Hank, 5 of Haldol now.

150
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,580
Now.

151
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,320
Get it out!

152
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,360
Here, you can see the areas

153
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,360
of white starting to clear.

154
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,530
I take it that's a good thing?

155
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,700
I'd still like to do

156
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,700
a follow-up chest CT,

157
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,940
but I think your body is

158
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,940
taking well to the new lungs.

159
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,740
Any questions?

160
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,740
Yeah.

161
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,440
What is going on here?

162
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,280
What do you mean?

163
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,450
Well, you're dressed

164
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,450
like one of my engineers.

165
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,350
Believe it or not,

166
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,350
we're out of scrubs.

167
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,550
So, uh... what,

168
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,550
somebody screwed up?

169
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,620
Laundry issue. Every time you

170
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,620
think it can't get worse.

171
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,260
I'm sorry, they need me

172
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,260
downstairs in the ED.

173
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,390
I'll check back

174
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,390
soon, okay?

175
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,830
Thank you, Dr. Marcel.

176
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,830
You bet.

177
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,930
Jack. Okay.

178
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,300
Crockett.

179
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,300
Yeah.

180
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,960
We need to talk

181
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,960
about Baltimore.

182
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,400
Baltimore?

183
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,980
Wait, the transplant

184
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,980
conference?

185
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,980
Mmm-hmm.

186
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
They had a keynote drop.

187
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,610
You might want to throw

188
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,610
together some slides.

189
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,980
What's the topic?

190
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,980
Ischemic preconditioning.

191
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,750
Wait, that's--

192
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,750
Pamela Blake.

193
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,450
Apparently,

194
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,450
she had a setback.

195
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,790
Took a leave so she

196
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,790
could return to rehab.

197
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,490
Lucky you.

198
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,230
How come I don't

199
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,230
see any scrubs

200
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,230
coming off this truck?

201
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,460
There was

202
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,460
an electrical short

203
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,660
in the Cicero plant

204
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,660
last night.

205
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,260
Took out a whole

206
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,260
bank of dryers.

207
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,770
But I thought we had backups

208
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,770
in the warehouse.

209
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't have

210
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,000
any drivers

211
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,000
available.

212
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,780
You know something?

213
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,910
You are a veritable

214
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,910
laundry list

215
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,910
of excuses today, Harry.

216
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,880
I know that we are

217
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,880
in the process

218
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,880
of negotiating

219
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,010
our new service contract,

220
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,010
but please,

221
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,020
please tell me you're not

222
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,020
holding my scrubs hostage.

223
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,550
Ms. Goodwin,

224
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,860
maybe you should

225
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,860
go talk to your CFO.

226
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,730
For a thrift store,

227
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,730
I didn't do so bad.

228
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,310
I don't know.

229
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,310
I feel like

230
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,310
a bank teller.

231
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,810
No.

232
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,430
I'd say more like a

233
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,430
substitute teacher.

234
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,430
Oh!

235
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,640
Okay, this is ridiculous.

236
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,970
I'm changing back into

237
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,970
my workout clothes.

238
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,450
Help! Help!

239
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,810
What's going on?

240
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,810
We're doctors.

241
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,510
She's having a baby.

242
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,380
Hey,

243
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,380
what's your name?

244
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,890
Maya Safro.

245
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,620
Hi, I'm Dr. Halstead.

246
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,020
Is it okay

247
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,020
if I remove this?

248
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,730
Okay, mind if

249
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,730
I check you out?

250
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,800
Okay, what's your

251
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,800
due date, Maya?

252
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,630
Two weeks around Thanksgiving.

253
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,830
This is your first baby?

254
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,490
Yes. Oh...

255
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,870
Deep breaths.

256
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,800
We'll get you inside so we

257
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,800
can take a look at you.

258
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,570
Are you the father?

259
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,570
I'm her neighbor.

260
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,700
She called me for a ride

261
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,700
when her water broke.

262
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,000
Here we go.

263
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,000
Let me help.

264
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,440
She stabbed herself?

265
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,440
Oh, my God.

266
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,850
Fortunately, we were

267
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,850
able to restrain her

268
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,650
before she did

269
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,650
any real damage.

270
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,810
Mr. Chapman.

271
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,720
Dr. Marcel.

272
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,920
I assisted Dr. Blake

273
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,920
on Renee's kidney transplant.

274
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,590
Oh, of course. I remember.

275
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,590
Where's Dr. Blake?

276
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,360
Unfortunately, she's moved on,

277
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,360
taken a... a new position.

278
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,660
What do we know?

279
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,000
Seems like Renee experienced

280
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,070
some kind of

281
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,070
paranoid delirium.

282
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,340
What, like a, uh,

283
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,340
a psychosis?

284
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,630
Of sorts. Yeah.

285
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,970
Well, this is not

286
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,970
like her at all.

287
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,600
I mean, you can

288
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,600
ask Dr. Marcel.

289
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,080
She has such

290
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,080
an ordered mind.

291
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,870
Mathematician, right?

292
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,010
Yeah, top of her field,

293
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,010
fluids and mechanics.

294
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,780
In fact, she's being

295
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,780
awarded the Abel Prize

296
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,780
in Oslo next month.

297
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,360
Wow.

298
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,090
Seth, can you think of

299
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,090
any changes to her behavior

300
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,090
in the last few months?

301
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,590
Yeah.

302
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,920
It started, like,

303
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,920
about a month ago.

304
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,790
She was confused,

305
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,790
agitated.

306
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,890
Huh.

307
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,990
Hey, Zach.

308
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,970
Did you include

309
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,970
a complete metabolic panel?

310
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,040
Let's also make sure

311
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,040
we get that head CT too.

312
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,510
Yes, sir.

313
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,040
Hey, she's gonna be

314
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,040
all right, right?

315
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,810
Look, we're absolutely

316
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,810
gonna get to the bottom

317
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,810
of this, all right?

318
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,110
Probably just a good idea

319
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,610
to wait for some

320
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,610
of these test results

321
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,620
before we start looking

322
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,620
at next steps.

323
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,150
Any pregnancy complications

324
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,150
we should know about?

325
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,790
Besides some

326
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,790
bizarre cravings,

327
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,160
it's been relatively smooth,

328
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,160
but I just have to say,

329
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,860
I'm, like, itching

330
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,860
like crazy today.

331
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,590
I'd be worried

332
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,590
if you weren't.

333
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,130
At this stage,

334
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,130
your hormones

335
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,130
are running wild,

336
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,160
and itching is totally normal

337
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,160
in a full term pregnancy.

338
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,400
Hey, are you the guy

339
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,400
that brought her in?

340
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,800
Security is about

341
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,800
to tow your van.

342
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,800
What?

343
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,840
Hey, Gus, sorry!

344
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,840
Uh, thanks again!

345
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,430
All right.

346
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,840
I'd like to do

347
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,840
an exam.

348
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,170
Hey, Maya, anyone

349
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,170
you'd like us to call?

350
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,980
Unfortunately not.

351
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,650
I moved down here

352
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,650
for school in the spring,

353
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,690
and all my family's

354
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,690
up in New York.

355
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,090
And the baby's father?

356
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,890
Not in the picture.

357
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,890
Okay.

358
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,590
Aw, I love your socks.

359
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,890
Thank you.

360
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,520
Could you put

361
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,520
your heels more

362
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,520
in the stirrups?

363
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,190
Yes.

364
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,190
All right.

365
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,100
You know, I was gonna hold off

366
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,100
on the sex of the baby,

367
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,200
but I only made it

368
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,200
to week 15.

369
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,840
I just couldn't wait

370
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,840
to meet her.

371
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,970
Well, I've got

372
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,970
good news for you, Maya.

373
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,970
Your wait is over.

374
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,980
You're about six

375
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,980
centimeters dilated,

376
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,780
which means

377
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,780
this little girl

378
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,780
is coming today.

379
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,980
Oh, my God!

380
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,890
Congrats, Maya.

381
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,120
All right, now I'm

382
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,120
gonna do an ultrasound

383
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,120
to check on the baby.

384
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,450
Okay?

385
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,650
Okay.

386
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,760
So Maya, it appears

387
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,760
your baby's breech.

388
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,600
What does...

389
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,600
What does that mean?

390
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,470
It just means that

391
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,470
her head's facing

392
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,470
the wrong direction.

393
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,660
Well, she's gonna

394
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,660
be okay, right?

395
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,040
Oh, yes.

396
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,040
It's very common.

397
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,130
It just means we need

398
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,130
to deliver via C-section.

399
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,970
You mean like surgery?

400
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,970
Yes, but don't worry.

401
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,210
It is totally safe.

402
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,210
And you can be

403
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,210
with us and awake

404
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,980
the entire time

405
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,980
if you want.

406
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,780
Okay. Okay.

407
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,880
Okay. Hey, Doris.

408
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,880
Yeah.

409
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,510
Can we open up

410
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,510
the hybrid OR?

411
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,850
Yeah.

412
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,650
Hey.

413
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,160
Where'd you

414
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,160
get the scrubs?

415
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,160
I do my own laundry.

416
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,630
Every night?

417
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,070
Every night

418
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,070
for precisely

419
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,070
this reason.

420
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,660
Is that some kind

421
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,660
of navy thing,

422
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,030
the way

423
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,030
you were trained?

424
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,770
Flanked by a bunch

425
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,770
of Dudley Do-Rights.

426
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,500
Awesome.

427
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,840
Ethan, Kai, incoming.

428
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,280
Courtney,

429
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,280
you're going

430
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,280
to Baghdad.

431
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,250
Talk to me, Court.

432
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,680
36-year-old inmate stabbed

433
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,680
in the anterior lateral

434
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,090
right neck in County.

435
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,890
Bleeding stopped

436
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,890
with direct pressure.

437
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,050
Intubated en route with sux

438
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,050
and etomidate, GCS 3.

439
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,960
All right, looks like

440
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,960
there's no active bleeding.

441
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,620
Let's get him ready

442
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,620
for a transfer.

443
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,970
Everybody ready?

444
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,970
Ready, one, two, three.

445
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,310
Heart rate 94,

446
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,310
BP 130/87.

447
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,700
Sats 100%.

448
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,110
Breath sounds are bilateral.

449
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,110
Let's get him on a ventilator.

450
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,980
Uh, did I hear something

451
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,980
about an inmate coming in

452
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,980
from Cook County?

453
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,280
Someone get me an X-ray.

454
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,180
Yeah, shanked in the neck.

455
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,850
Oh, you'll love

456
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,850
this coincidence.

457
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,750
His last name is Archer.

458
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,980
Sean Archer.

459
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,990
Yeah, it's a small world.

460
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,990
Yeah.

461
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,690
Wonder who

462
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,690
this guy pissed off.

463
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,060
No active bleeding.

464
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,730
A big old hematoma

465
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,730
in the neck, though.

466
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,140
Here, let me

467
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,140
look at that.

468
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,040
X-ray's here.

469
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,270
Hold.

470
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,240
Hold on. I'm feeling

471
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,240
something in here.

472
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,080
Let's get a neck

473
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,080
X-ray as well.

474
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,280
Make sure there's no

475
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,280
retained foreign body.

476
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,820
Hey, D.

477
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,820
Not now. Not now.

478
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,030
Renee's test results.

479
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,070
Thyroid function is good.

480
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,070
No endocrine problem.

481
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,300
CT head is clean.

482
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,340
Yeah, no family history

483
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,340
of mental illness either.

484
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,940
No?

485
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,940
No.

486
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,300
So far, anyway,

487
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,740
no organic explanation

488
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,740
for Renee's psychosis.

489
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,180
So where does

490
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,180
that leave us?

491
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,780
Wait.

492
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,080
What immunosuppressant

493
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,080
is she on?

494
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,780
Tacrolimus.

495
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,780
Oh, crap.

496
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,290
What?

497
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,290
Cyclosporine wouldn't work?

498
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,620
Well, we tried that

499
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,620
pre-transplant,

500
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,750
but Renee was allergic

501
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,750
to everything in that class.

502
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,160
The tacrolimus

503
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,160
was our last option.

504
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,660
Why do you ask?

505
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,730
We suspect that Renee's

506
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,730
psychosis is being caused

507
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,360
by the immunosuppressant

508
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,360
that she's been taking

509
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,940
to protect her new kidney.

510
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,870
Her tacrolimus?

511
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,870
Are you sure?

512
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,970
We've just about ruled out

513
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,970
every other possibility.

514
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,910
But the surgery

515
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,910
was ten months ago.

516
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,310
As strange

517
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,310
as it might sound,

518
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,650
reactions like this

519
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,720
can occur even...

520
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,720
even years after surgery.

521
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,650
So we should just take her

522
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,650
off her meds then, right?

523
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,820
I wish it were

524
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,820
that easy, Seth.

525
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,660
But without the

526
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,660
immunosuppressants,

527
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,820
Renee's body will reject

528
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,820
the new kidney.

529
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,230
After all this time?

530
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,100
Unfortunately, yes.

531
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,400
So what are we

532
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,400
supposed to do?

533
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,040
Well, the next step would be

534
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,040
to try an antipsychotic.

535
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,230
There's a drug

536
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,230
called olanzapine.

537
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,240
We would like to start her

538
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,240
on a small dose of it

539
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,240
and see if that helps.

540
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,240
Hey, Seth. Don't worry.

541
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,980
We're gonna get this

542
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,980
under control, okay?

543
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,160
Damn.

544
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,130
Looks like the shank

545
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,130
must have broken off

546
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,130
in his neck.

547
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,160
Right, can we get him

548
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,160
up to the OR, please?

549
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,760
What are you standing

550
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,760
around here for?

551
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,760
Just do it.

552
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,830
Tell the OR that

553
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,830
I'm bringing up

554
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,830
the neck exploration, okay?

555
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,100
D.

556
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,100
Yeah, one second.

557
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,170
Sorry, can we get

558
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,170
the shackles off him?

559
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,300
He's not going

560
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,300
anywhere, all right?

561
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,210
Dean, Dean, Dean.

562
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,210
Hey, Dean.

563
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,210
What is it?

564
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,780
Sean's in jail?

565
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,310
Last time I asked,

566
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,310
you said he was out west.

567
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,750
What's going on?

568
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,450
It's a long story.

569
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,450
Okay, I promise I will

570
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,450
get you caught up.

571
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,740
I promise.

572
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,740
Okay.

573
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,020
But I got to go scrub now.

574
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,020
I cannot stand here.

575
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,180
Neil's on call

576
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,180
in trauma today.

577
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,230
Let's let him operate.

578
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,230
He's as good as it gets.

579
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,090
This is my son, Ethan.

580
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,930
Exactly why you shouldn't

581
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,930
be doing the surgery.

582
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,120
Come on, man.

583
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,120
You know I'm right.

584
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,370
All right, hey,

585
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,370
don't worry.

586
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll stay with Sean

587
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,000
the whole time, all right?

588
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,370
Yeah.

589
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,370
All right.

590
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,520
I do think

591
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,520
we have room

592
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,520
in the budget for that.

593
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,910
So if you take a look at...

594
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,420
I'm sorry, Sharon.

595
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,750
Uh, excuse me, Sharon?

596
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,090
Fred's on a call

597
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,090
with the board

598
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,090
for the next hour or so.

599
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,820
Is there something

600
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,820
I can help you with?

601
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,390
Well, I don't know

602
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,390
if Mr. Meacham

603
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,390
has heard or not,

604
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,490
but we didn't get our

605
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,490
delivery of scrubs today.

606
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,360
Fred is aware, yes.

607
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,530
Maybe you should

608
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,530
ask him to come out.

609
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,070
Is this really

610
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,070
an emergency?

611
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,170
Young man,

612
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,300
scrubs are critical

613
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,300
in maintaining

614
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,940
the integrity of our

615
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,940
operating rooms.

616
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,080
We still have

617
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,080
surgical gowns,

618
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,080
correct?

619
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,420
And what do you

620
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,420
expect them to wear

621
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,420
underneath? Uh...

622
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,010
He should know that

623
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,010
besides putting our staff

624
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,960
and patients at risk,

625
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,960
we're opening ourselves up

626
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,390
for potential lawsuits.

627
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,200
We should cancel

628
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,200
all elective surgeries

629
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,200
until we iron this out.

630
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,200
That would be a big hit

631
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,200
to the P&L.

632
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,170
That's why

633
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,170
I'm here to see

634
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,170
Mr. Meacham.

635
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,970
I'll call your office

636
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,970
as soon as this breaks up,

637
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,270
Ms. Goodwin.

638
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,400
Thank you.

639
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,840
Ta-da.

640
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,540
Trail mix.

641
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,540
Vanessa's favorite.

642
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,340
The kind

643
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,340
with dried pineapple

644
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,340
and chocolate in it.

645
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,960
And I wrote her

646
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,960
a little note too.

647
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,960
Aw.

648
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,890
I hope she knows

649
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,890
how much we all miss her.

650
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,860
If she doesn't,

651
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,190
she will by the time

652
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,190
she gets this package.

653
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,190
Hmm.

654
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,260
Hey, sweetie.

655
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,100
Hey, Ben.

656
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,100
What are you

657
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,100
doing here?

658
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,570
Student of mine fell off

659
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,570
the jungle gym.

660
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,170
Ambo said they were

661
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,170
taking her here.

662
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,210
Name's Mira Holloway.

663
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,210
Oh.

664
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,370
Yeah, she's in treatment 4.

665
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,370
Come on.

666
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,910
Doctor looks

667
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,910
no older than Mira.

668
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,480
Aw, she's in good hands.

669
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,480
Don't worry.

670
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,150
Ms. Goodwin,

671
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,150
is this really all we got?

672
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,890
I'm sorry.

673
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,890
Yes, it's the best we have.

674
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,620
It's kind of itchy.

675
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,490
Yeah, they're fine.

676
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,490
We'll make do.

677
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,970
Why are you looking

678
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,970
at me like that?

679
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,110
It's okay. I was

680
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,110
just worried about you.

681
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,200
Renee,

682
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,200
how are you doing?

683
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,180
Can you, uh...

684
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,180
Can you tell me how

685
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,180
you're feeling right now?

686
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,010
How long have I been here?

687
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,050
Since this morning.

688
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,050
You had a fall.

689
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,350
You had the Zoom with Oslo,

690
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,350
but I had it all rescheduled.

691
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,480
Oslo.

692
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,110
The Abel prize.

693
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,590
They're handing it out

694
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,590
next month?

695
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,350
That's nice.

696
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,050
You know what?

697
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,890
Seth, I think we should

698
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,890
let your wife rest

699
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,890
for a little bit.

700
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,970
Renee, we'll be back

701
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,970
in just a few minutes, okay?

702
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,190
Okay.

703
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,070
What's wrong with her?

704
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,100
Well,

705
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,100
the olanzapine has pretty

706
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,100
severely obtunded her.

707
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,610
Obtunded?

708
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,610
I'm sorry.

709
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,410
It just means

710
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,410
that she's slower

711
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,410
to react to stimuli.

712
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,310
It's not an uncommon

713
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,310
side effect.

714
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,910
This is gonna

715
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,910
wear off, right?

716
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,550
The thing is, Seth,

717
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,550
is that when the tacrolimus

718
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,960
is in play, like it is

719
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,960
with this side effect,

720
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,650
that the pharmacology just

721
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,650
becomes a lot more delicate.

722
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,360
But we can

723
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,360
lower the dose.

724
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,330
She's already had

725
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,330
the lowest dose.

726
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,390
And frankly, her affect

727
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,390
is just extremely

728
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,390
pronounced already.

729
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,600
Did I read somewhere

730
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,600
that aripiprazole

731
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,330
has a less sedative effect?

732
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,330
Would that work better?

733
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,270
You know, at this point,

734
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,270
it's worth a try.

735
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,350
So why don't we

736
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,350
let the olanzapine

737
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,350
clear her system

738
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,970
and then give her

739
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,970
some aripiprazole

740
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,950
and see if we get

741
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,950
to a better place?

742
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,950
This suit is

743
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,950
driving me nuts.

744
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,290
Tell me about it.

745
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,290
I'm schvitzing

746
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,290
like crazy.

747
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,200
Okay, I can see the baby.

748
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,200
Almost there, Maya.

749
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,330
The baby flipped

750
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,330
to transverse back down.

751
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,560
What does that mean?

752
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,400
Just means she's

753
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,400
a little stuck.

754
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,000
It's gonna take

755
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,000
a bit longer.

756
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,170
Grab the bandage scissors

757
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,170
and extend the

758
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,170
uterine incision.

759
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,300
Mmm-hmm.

760
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,270
Hey, Dean.

761
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,270
Yeah?

762
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,680
It looks like we got

763
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,680
another prisoner coming in.

764
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,010
What?

765
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,450
Baghdad!

766
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,450
Deke Niemann,

767
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,450
37-year-old male

768
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,030
blunt trauma to the chest,

769
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,030
abdomen, and back.

770
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,360
Ended up in a physical

771
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,360
confrontation with

772
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,360
a correction officer.

773
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,330
Bastard got me

774
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,330
with a baton.

775
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,330
Cermak transferred

776
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,330
this one over.

777
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,130
Here is the X-rays they took.

778
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,130
I'll pull these up.

779
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,710
On my count, one, two.

780
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,150
Easy, man!

781
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,150
That hurts.

782
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,310
Hold on,

783
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,310
we have to recuff him.

784
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,350
X-ray's up.

785
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,390
Hemopneumothorax

786
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,390
on the left.

787
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,320
Get a chest tube tray.

788
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,320
Prep and drape.

789
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,190
Push 100 of fentanyl,

790
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,190
2 of Versed.

791
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,530
One of your coworkers

792
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,530
trucked this guy

793
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,530
up pretty good.

794
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,730
Totally justified.

795
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,200
He had a weapon in his hand,

796
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,200
was considered

797
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,200
armed and dangerous.

798
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,470
A weapon?

799
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,570
Was this the guy who--

800
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,470
Shanked the other guy, yeah.

801
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,440
We're ready for you, doctor.

802
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,620
Help me, doc.

803
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,620
I can't breathe.

804
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,090
I can push

805
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,090
the chest tube

806
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,090
if you want.

807
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,220
No.

808
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,060
I got it.

809
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,070
Renee.

810
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,340
Renee.

811
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,540
Honey!

812
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,670
What... What's

813
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,670
wrong with her?

814
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,770
I mean, she's...

815
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,770
she's catatonic.

816
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,560
Waxy rigidity.

817
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,560
I don't understand.

818
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,120
She's having an even

819
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,120
more extreme reaction

820
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,120
to the aripiprazole.

821
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,320
Will it get better?

822
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,420
Unfortunately,

823
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,420
it's this class

824
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,420
of drugs, right?

825
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,830
These anti-psychotics

826
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,830
that typically

827
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,690
mitigate this very unfortunate

828
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,690
side effect of tacrolimus.

829
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,830
And sometimes they work,

830
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,830
sometimes they don't.

831
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,130
So she's never gonna

832
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,130
get back to her normal self?

833
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,640
As long as she's taking

834
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,640
this immunosuppressant,

835
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,640
it's unlikely.

836
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,370
I can't believe this.

837
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,540
Getting this new kidney

838
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,540
was supposed to give

839
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,540
Renee her life back.

840
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,710
And now today...

841
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,340
I cannot watch my wife

842
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,340
suffer like this anymore.

843
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,750
I want to take her off

844
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,750
the immunosuppressant drugs

845
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,850
once and for all.

846
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,650
Uh... Seth. Seth, come on.

847
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,650
Uh, we talked about this.

848
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,260
Her kidney won't survive.

849
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,260
I don't care.

850
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,200
Think about everything

851
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,200
Renee went through.

852
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,730
All those years on dialysis,

853
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,730
you really think

854
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,200
she wants to get

855
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,200
back to that?

856
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,770
I know my wife.

857
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,710
If she had to choose between

858
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,710
her body and her mind,

859
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,610
it's not even close.

860
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,770
You're serious about this?

861
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,250
Renee waited six years

862
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,250
for someone

863
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,280
to give her that kidney,

864
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,280
and you just want to...

865
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,440
What, you want to kill it?

866
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,660
Okay, okay, so what if

867
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,660
we remove it and put it

868
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,660
back into the donor pool?

869
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,160
Is that possible?

870
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,360
Well, I mean,

871
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,360
that would be

872
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,360
unprecedented.

873
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,600
We'd have to go

874
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,600
to the ethics committee

875
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,600
with that.

876
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,770
Seth, I really think

877
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,770
we need to slow down here,

878
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,930
and at the very least,

879
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,930
give Renee a chance

880
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,930
to weigh in for herself.

881
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,510
Look at her!

882
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,510
She cannot make

883
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,510
this decision.

884
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,720
I have her advance directive.

885
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,720
It's my choice, right?

886
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,480
She is certainly impaired,

887
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,480
and if you have

888
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,480
the advance directive--

889
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,520
Uh-uh. No.

890
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,520
This is what

891
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,520
she would want.

892
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,390
Remove the kidney.

893
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,390
Give it to someone else.

894
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,790
Sorry, you're

895
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,790
going to have to find

896
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,790
another surgeon.

897
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,360
I don't want anything

898
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,360
to do with this, okay?

899
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,800
No, no, no, I'll tell her.

900
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,500
Okay. Sharon,

901
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,500
it's Cheryl.

902
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,500
Hmm.

903
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,940
Says that you're all set

904
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,940
for tomorrow at 10:45 a.m.

905
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,940
with Meacham.

906
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,740
No, no, no. Uh-uh.

907
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,270
Hey.

908
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,810
Tomorrow?

909
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,750
Doesn't Fred realize

910
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,750
this can't wait?

911
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,690
You're kidding.

912
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,330
No, no. That's all.

913
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,330
Thank you.

914
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,990
So?

915
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Evidently, he has

916
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,700
a 2:00 tee time.

917
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,940
Hey.

918
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,840
Good news.

919
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,840
They get the blade out?

920
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,410
Yeah, tied off the

921
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,410
external jugular,

922
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,780
and Neil's confident

923
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,780
it missed his esophagus.

924
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,470
Sean's gonna be okay.

925
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,680
Thank you. Thanks.

926
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,560
How's Mira doing?

927
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,000
Evidently, her X-rays

928
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,000
look good.

929
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,270
Zach's talking about

930
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,270
possibly running some

931
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,270
more tests, though.

932
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,360
Oh.

933
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,600
There's a whole lot

934
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,600
of trail mix in there.

935
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,760
Yeah, it was kind

936
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,760
of Vanessa's thing.

937
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,710
It's gonna cost a fortune

938
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,710
shipping it to the

939
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,710
Philippines, though.

940
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,770
Hey, Maggie.

941
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,410
Oh, good,

942
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,410
I see you haven't

943
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,410
sent that box off yet.

944
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,350
I just found the perfect thing

945
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,350
in the back of my closet.

946
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,850
Vanessa's gonna love it.

947
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,850
My old varsity jacket.

948
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,790
Oh.

949
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,790
Of course, you always

950
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,790
wore it more than me,

951
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,620
but hey, you also looked

952
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,620
better in it, too, so.

953
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,750
Hey.

954
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,690
Hey.

955
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,800
Um...

956
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,860
This is my husband, Ben.

957
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,530
Ben, this is Vanessa's

958
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,530
biological father,

959
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,730
Grant Young.

960
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, it's a pleasure

961
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,000
to meet you finally.

962
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,370
Likewise.

963
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,980
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

964
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,980
Where are you taking him?

965
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,390
CT scan.

966
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,390
On whose orders?

967
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,680
Dr. Choi.

968
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,960
Hey.

969
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,060
Hey, what's, uh...

970
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,060
What's with the chest CT?

971
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,700
I'm looking at the

972
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,700
post-insertion X-ray.

973
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm concerned there's

974
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,600
still a hemothorax.

975
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,070
I placed that chest tube.

976
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,930
It's fine.

977
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,930
I'm sure you're right,

978
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,510
but there could be

979
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,510
a retained clot.

980
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,640
A CT will give us a better

981
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,640
image of the damage.

982
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,370
Oh, you didn't think about

983
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,370
running it by me first?

984
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,850
We both know you can't

985
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,850
be the doctor of record

986
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,070
on this patient, Dean.

987
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,070
Come on.

988
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,580
Look, if anything

989
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,580
were to happen--

990
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,450
What are you saying,

991
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,450
that I can't remain objective?

992
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,420
I know I couldn't

993
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,420
if I were in your shoes.

994
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,920
Look, man, maybe you're

995
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,920
a better man than me,

996
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,420
but why put yourself

997
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,420
in that position?

998
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,960
It's a good thing you're not

999
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,960
wearing my shoes then.

1000
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,090
If you can't stand down,

1001
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,090
I'll have to take this up

1002
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,090
with Goodwin.

1003
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,800
Please don't make me

1004
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,800
do that.

1005
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,810
Here she comes.

1006
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,470
Oh. Got her.

1007
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,410
Oh, hey.

1008
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,420
What a sweet baby.

1009
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,650
Yes, she is.

1010
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,990
We'll get her cleaned up.

1011
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,860
You okay?

1012
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,940
Yeah, it's just this suit.

1013
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,410
Say hi to Mama.

1014
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,480
Maya?

1015
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,600
Maya.

1016
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,150
Maya! Maya!

1017
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,920
Bag her!

1018
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,540
She was fine

1019
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,540
a second ago.

1020
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,750
Heart rate's

1021
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,750
down to 60.

1022
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,920
Amniotic fluid embolism?

1023
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,490
She's not coagulopathic.

1024
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,760
I mean, it could be,

1025
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,760
but it's not a classic AFE.

1026
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,990
Hold on.

1027
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,430
Snoring respirations.

1028
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,570
Check her pupils.

1029
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,630
Pinpoint.

1030
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,040
I think she might

1031
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,040
be OD'ing.

1032
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,040
An overdose?

1033
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,040
How is that possible?

1034
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,980
I don't know,

1035
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,980
but we need to

1036
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,980
get Narcan now.

1037
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,740
Now!

1038
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,520
Maya?

1039
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,990
Are you with us?

1040
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,790
Yeah. Yes.

1041
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,760
What happened? What happened?

1042
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,000
So you're really

1043
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,000
heading to the links?

1044
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,240
Aetna's senior VP

1045
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,240
is in town.

1046
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,940
Said we've got

1047
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,940
a pressing matter.

1048
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,070
But we've got

1049
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,070
pressing matters

1050
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,070
here as well.

1051
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,840
The surgical scrubs, right?

1052
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,080
I was told

1053
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,080
we found a solution.

1054
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,180
Hazmat suits?

1055
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,780
More of a Band-Aid

1056
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,780
than a solution.

1057
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,080
Yeah, whatever you call it,

1058
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,080
it'll do for now.

1059
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,750
Fred,

1060
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,750
I don't know

1061
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,750
if you're aware,

1062
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,890
but the hospital's kind of

1063
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,890
falling apart lately.

1064
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,200
And it's not a good look

1065
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,200
when the guy who's supposed

1066
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,200
to be holding the glue

1067
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,570
is off working

1068
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,570
on his handicap

1069
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,570
on a weekday.

1070
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,730
Lakeview Linens is trying

1071
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,730
to jam a 30% increase

1072
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,500
down my throat, Sharon.

1073
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,170
The hospital just can't

1074
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,170
roll over and accept

1075
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,170
terms like that,

1076
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,250
not if you want to keep

1077
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,250
the doors open.

1078
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,240
Scrubs are something

1079
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,240
we can do without for a bit

1080
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,080
if we need to.

1081
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,080
You're wrong.

1082
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,750
Besides maintaining

1083
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,750
a clean and safe

1084
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,750
environment in the OR,

1085
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,290
they give our people

1086
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,290
a sense of purpose,

1087
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,790
instill our patients

1088
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,790
with the confidence

1089
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,830
that we know

1090
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,830
what we're doing.

1091
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,590
That lowly piece

1092
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,590
of clothing

1093
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,070
has an incalculable effect

1094
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,070
on the healing process.

1095
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,230
I can't work with

1096
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,230
incalculable, Sharon.

1097
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,230
I need a number.

1098
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,740
You know, I don't have

1099
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,740
any good options here.

1100
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,780
So I'm gonna recommend

1101
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,780
that we postpone

1102
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,580
all elective surgeries

1103
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,580
until this thing is resolved.

1104
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,310
Forty-eight hours. Please.

1105
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,310
I know they'll cave.

1106
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm sorry, Fred.

1107
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,680
I don't have a choice.

1108
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,020
I swear, I've never done

1109
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,020
a drug in my life.

1110
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,000
And of course, I would

1111
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,000
never do anything

1112
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,000
to harm my baby.

1113
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,900
I'm not here to make

1114
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,900
any accusations.

1115
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,630
I promise.

1116
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,630
We just have to do

1117
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,630
our due diligence.

1118
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,000
Is this gonna keep me

1119
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,000
from taking my baby home?

1120
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,600
We're gonna

1121
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,600
do everything

1122
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,600
we can to try

1123
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,180
and stop that

1124
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,180
from happening.

1125
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,180
Yeah.

1126
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,970
Let's start by running

1127
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,970
a few tests,

1128
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,340
and we can take it

1129
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,340
from there, okay?

1130
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,920
Look, Maya, you have been

1131
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,920
through so much today.

1132
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,180
Just try and rest.

1133
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,780
We'll be back to check

1134
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,780
on you soon, okay?

1135
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,790
So?

1136
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,060
If I had to say,

1137
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,060
she's telling the truth.

1138
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,900
So no need

1139
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,900
to call DCFS?

1140
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,330
Not yet, anyway.

1141
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,830
She consented to testing,

1142
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,170
so we can run a hair sample,

1143
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,170
which will tell us

1144
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,970
if this really was a one-off.

1145
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,270
I'll report back.

1146
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,270
All right.

1147
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,280
Thanks, Nellie.

1148
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,280
Yeah.

1149
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,900
I just don't get it.

1150
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,610
How can she

1151
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,610
be fine one minute

1152
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,610
and OD'ing the next?

1153
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,690
I mean, there was probably

1154
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,690
a certain amount of adrenaline

1155
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,350
that kept her alert,

1156
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,350
and then baby came,

1157
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,180
and the effects

1158
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,180
of the drugs hit her.

1159
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,690
Yeah, but what drugs?

1160
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,850
That's the million dollar

1161
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,850
question.

1162
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,360
Yeah.

1163
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,360
You've still got that rash?

1164
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,290
It's like they sewed those

1165
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,290
suits out of poison ivy.

1166
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,870
Try popping

1167
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,870
an antihistamine.

1168
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,200
I'm gonna go check

1169
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,200
on the baby.

1170
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,930
So the, uh,

1171
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,930
the ethics committee

1172
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,930
is mulling it over.

1173
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,670
And get this:

1174
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,300
Organ Donors of America

1175
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,300
already found an HLA match

1176
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,080
for Renee's kidney.

1177
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,250
So it's happening.

1178
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,250
Well, who knows?

1179
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,910
I mean, you know,

1180
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,910
ethics committee

1181
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,320
tends to bog down

1182
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,320
when the surgeon of record

1183
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,980
goes missing, you know?

1184
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,390
Won't weigh in.

1185
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm guessing from

1186
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,700
your tone, you, uh...

1187
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,730
You think this is

1188
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,730
the right thing to do?

1189
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,200
I think it's better

1190
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,200
than the alternative.

1191
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,000
If Renee goes off the

1192
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,000
immunosuppressants,

1193
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,800
her kidney

1194
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,800
won't survive, right?

1195
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,040
At least this way,

1196
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,040
somebody else

1197
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,040
might really benefit.

1198
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,910
You know, Renee's transplant

1199
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,910
was the first time

1200
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,310
Pamela showed me

1201
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,310
how to resize a renal artery.

1202
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,410
She had this great cheat

1203
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,410
where she would split

1204
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,120
the artery to match the size.

1205
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,280
Mechanical genius.

1206
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,080
Always was

1207
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,080
a brilliant surgeon.

1208
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,160
Who may never

1209
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,160
operate again.

1210
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,860
I made a decision for her,

1211
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,860
and look what happened.

1212
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,760
I know this is complicated

1213
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,760
for you, okay?

1214
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,420
But you cannot

1215
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,420
let what happened

1216
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,420
with Pamela

1217
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,430
affect how you

1218
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,430
approach this case.

1219
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,800
But from where I'm sitting,

1220
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,800
Seth's a good man.

1221
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Got his wife's

1222
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
best interests at heart,

1223
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,700
and most important of all,

1224
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,700
he knows her mind.

1225
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,310
And what if he's wrong?

1226
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,850
Buddy, I just don't

1227
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,850
really think that it's

1228
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,850
our place to judge that.

1229
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,390
Hey.

1230
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,020
Chest scan came back

1231
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,020
for our friend over there.

1232
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,120
Confirms a whole bunch of

1233
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,120
rib fractures and a retained

1234
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,120
hemopneumothorax.

1235
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,750
Yeah, with the

1236
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,750
mild right shift,

1237
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,090
looks like his chest

1238
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,090
is still under tension

1239
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,090
even with the chest tube.

1240
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,460
Was the tube

1241
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,460
placed properly?

1242
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,400
Yeah, but it's clotted off.

1243
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,060
Not tidaling.

1244
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,060
We need to replace it.

1245
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,770
Heart rate's in the 40s.

1246
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,000
He's bradying down.

1247
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,000
Start bagging.

1248
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,070
Check for pulse.

1249
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,470
No, I don't feel one.

1250
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,940
All right, tension

1251
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,940
pneumothorax.

1252
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,940
Start CPR.

1253
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,250
Thoracotomy tray.

1254
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,160
All right,

1255
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,160
hold for a second.

1256
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,830
Whoa! Feel that rush of air?

1257
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,970
Still no pulse.

1258
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,080
He's fibrillating.

1259
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,380
Give me

1260
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,380
the internal paddles.

1261
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,150
Charge to 50.

1262
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,390
All charged.

1263
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,520
All right.

1264
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,050
Clear.

1265
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,560
I got a rhythm.

1266
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,300
Pulse is back.

1267
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,470
That was fricking

1268
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,470
insane.

1269
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,870
Call the OR.

1270
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,920
Zach's saying

1271
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,920
he won't discharge Mira

1272
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,920
until she gets an MRI.

1273
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,890
Well, he's just

1274
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,890
dotting his I's

1275
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,890
and crossing his T's.

1276
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,520
It doesn't mean that

1277
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,520
she's not doing okay.

1278
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,530
Yeah, well, it's causing

1279
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,530
Mira's mom a little anxiety.

1280
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,500
And why is it

1281
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,500
taking him so long?

1282
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,070
Well, Ben, you do know

1283
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,070
that we're short staffed.

1284
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,160
Right?

1285
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,070
I'm sure that Radiology

1286
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,070
will get to Mira

1287
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,070
as soon as they can.

1288
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,540
You know, if I knew

1289
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,540
this place was gonna be

1290
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,370
this unresponsive,

1291
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,370
I would have told the ambo

1292
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,940
to take her to

1293
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,940
another hospital.

1294
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,910
Wait, am I sensing

1295
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,910
a bit of a hostility here?

1296
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,410
Does this have to do

1297
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,410
with Grant bringing in

1298
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,410
that jacket in today?

1299
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,920
Not at all.

1300
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,080
Why would I be

1301
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,080
bothered by that?

1302
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,350
You shouldn't be.

1303
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,610
Really?

1304
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,530
I do seem to remember

1305
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,530
you telling me

1306
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,290
that you weren't

1307
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,290
gonna have anything

1308
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,290
to do with him.

1309
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,160
Ben, this isn't about me.

1310
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,160
It's about Vanessa.

1311
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,250
Yeah.

1312
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,000
It's always

1313
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,000
about Vanessa.

1314
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,600
Hey, Maggie.

1315
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,600
Sorry to bother you.

1316
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,600
You got a second?

1317
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,100
Yeah, she's free.

1318
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,340
Yeah, Joe.

1319
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,480
Hey, your C-section, Maya.

1320
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,950
You got a tox back?

1321
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,950
No, not yet. Why?

1322
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,540
Well, get this,

1323
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,540
I was talking

1324
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,540
to security,

1325
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,320
that guy who

1326
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,320
brought her in.

1327
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,650
When they were towing his van,

1328
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,650
they got a hit on his tags.

1329
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,390
PD took him into custody.

1330
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,460
Turns out he was

1331
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,460
transporting carfentanil.

1332
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,050
Maybe Maya

1333
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,050
got exposed.

1334
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,900
Well, maybe we all did.

1335
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,090
We went into that car

1336
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,090
to pull her out.

1337
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,430
It could be why

1338
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,430
you were itchy all day.

1339
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,240
Nothing to do

1340
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,240
with the hazmat suits.

1341
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,640
We need to get you

1342
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,640
into decon.

1343
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,640
Where's Will?

1344
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,080
Will?

1345
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,080
I'll get the Narcan.

1346
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,680
Hey, hey, no, no, no,

1347
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,680
no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

1348
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,920
Will, Will, Will...

1349
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,920
Stay with me.

1350
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,920
Come on.

1351
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,160
It's on his shirt.

1352
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,390
Here you go.

1353
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,390
Hey, come on.

1354
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,530
You okay?

1355
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,440
Shh. Stay down.

1356
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,440
Stay down.

1357
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,130
Mmm-hmm.

1358
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,530
We need to

1359
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,530
decontaminate now.

1360
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,270
Yeah.

1361
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,270
Okay, come on.

1362
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,510
Hey, you okay?

1363
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,990
Yeah, I think so.

1364
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,450
The first half hour

1365
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,450
is when you

1366
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,450
feel it the most,

1367
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,680
but after that,

1368
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,680
the drug should

1369
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,680
clear your system.

1370
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,720
Yeah. You should

1371
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,720
probably go first.

1372
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,050
I'm not letting you

1373
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,050
out of my sight.

1374
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,720
Oh, come on.

1375
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,720
What's the big deal?

1376
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,730
How many times have we

1377
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,730
seen each other naked?

1378
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,410
Hey.

1379
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,060
Thanks.

1380
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,260
It's crazy.

1381
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,160
We're right back

1382
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,160
where we started.

1383
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,360
What do you mean?

1384
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,630
Well, when we first met,

1385
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,630
you were Narcanning me.

1386
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,300
I guess we're even.

1387
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,040
There's no need

1388
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,040
to keep score.

1389
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,150
Here you go.

1390
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,620
A recipient giving up

1391
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,620
a perfectly healthy kidney.

1392
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,630
Twenty years in this biz,

1393
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,630
and I've never seen

1394
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,630
anything like this.

1395
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,320
Yeah.

1396
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,660
Thanks, Crockett.

1397
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,660
Yeah.

1398
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,770
Dr. Hutchins, thank you

1399
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,770
for taking such good care

1400
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,230
of my Mira today.

1401
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,770
And you, Mr. Campbell.

1402
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,480
Your husband's a saint.

1403
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,380
Thank you.

1404
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,080
That's what they tell me.

1405
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,420
Yeah.

1406
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,060
Ben, listen.

1407
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,150
I got to run...

1408
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,150
But--

1409
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,230
If I'm gonna make

1410
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,230
bowling league.

1411
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,230
I'll try not to wake you

1412
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,230
when I come in.

1413
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,710
Prepare to be excited.

1414
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,070
Come on.

1415
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,370
That's all of 'em. We'll have

1416
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,370
the rest here tomorrow.

1417
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,810
Thanks, Harry.

1418
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,720
I thought you said that

1419
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,720
you struck out with Fred.

1420
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,310
I thought I did.

1421
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,790
Oh, man.

1422
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,790
So what happened?

1423
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,420
They got here sooner

1424
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,420
than I wanted.

1425
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,090
I was hoping to be here

1426
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,090
for the big surprise.

1427
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,630
So this is all your doing.

1428
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,490
So it turns out these guys

1429
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,490
are in discussion with us

1430
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,470
about upgrading their fleet.

1431
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,560
I, uh,

1432
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,560
spoke to the president,

1433
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,560
made it clear

1434
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,640
that I wouldn't

1435
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,640
feel good doing

1436
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,640
business with a company

1437
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,470
that's trying to chisel

1438
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,470
a civic institution

1439
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,470
like Chicago Med.

1440
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,210
And they promised

1441
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,210
that they wouldn't raise

1442
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,210
their prices anytime soon.

1443
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,540
Oh, that's very nice.

1444
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,480
Thanks, Jack.

1445
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,480
Just trying to help.

1446
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,320
Oh, hey, let's get a shot

1447
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,320
with these scrubs, yeah?

1448
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,180
It'd be good for your

1449
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,180
social media feed.

1450
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,350
Ready?

1451
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,260
It's nice to have

1452
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,260
a guardian angel.

1453
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,270
Yeah, but not really

1454
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,270
a viable business strategy

1455
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,390
for the long run, is it?

1456
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,390
No.

1457
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:22,710
So if I'm hearing correctly,

1458
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:22,710
I was experiencing psychosis

1459
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,370
due to the immunosuppressants,

1460
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,740
but the antipsychotic

1461
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,740
had a dulling effect.

1462
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,210
That's right.

1463
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,650
And you decided

1464
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,650
that removing my kidney

1465
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,650
was the best solution?

1466
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,920
Honey, I didn't know

1467
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,920
what else to do.

1468
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,260
My mind to me an empire is.

1469
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,800
I would have

1470
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,800
done the same thing.

1471
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,430
God, I--

1472
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,530
Though I guess

1473
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,530
we have to get used

1474
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,530
to all of this again.

1475
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,370
We'll get

1476
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,370
through it together.

1477
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,570
Thank you for taking

1478
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,570
such good care of me.

1479
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,180
I love you.

1480
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,420
So the drugs

1481
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,420
were on my socks?

1482
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,290
Yeah, we think that

1483
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,290
they were slowly

1484
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,290
leaching carfentanil

1485
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,390
into your skin all day,

1486
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,260
which is what

1487
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,260
caused you to overdose.

1488
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,490
I just can't believe this.

1489
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,940
You know,

1490
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,940
Gus dealing drugs,

1491
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,940
I had no idea.

1492
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,800
What about the baby?

1493
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,930
Thankfully,

1494
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,930
she was not exposed.

1495
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,710
We know that this might

1496
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,710
not have been the birth

1497
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,580
you had planned for,

1498
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,580
but the good news is that

1499
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,480
you and baby

1500
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,480
are healthy and safe.

1501
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,520
Thank you.

1502
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,520
Thank you both.

1503
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,560
I never thought I'd be

1504
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,560
so relieved to pull on

1505
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,560
a pair of scrubs.

1506
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,830
Are you hungry?

1507
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,530
There's this great new

1508
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,530
burrito stand over on Lake.

1509
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,540
I think I'm gonna

1510
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,540
try to hit a meeting

1511
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,540
on the way home,

1512
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,840
just be on

1513
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,840
the safe side.

1514
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,880
You are welcome

1515
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,880
to join if you want.

1516
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,580
Ah, that's okay.

1517
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,680
After today,

1518
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,690
I'm pretty sure

1519
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,690
I'm never gonna touch

1520
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,690
this stuff again.

1521
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,820
See you tomorrow?

1522
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,590
Good night.

1523
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,820
Okay.

1524
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,910
Guy get out

1525
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,910
of surgery yet?

1526
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,310
Yeah.

1527
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,840
He'll be kept in the ICU

1528
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,840
a couple of days

1529
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,840
before they, uh--

1530
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,580
Discharge back

1531
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,580
into custody.

1532
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,480
Yeah.

1533
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,550
Boy, some father

1534
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,550
I turned out to be, huh?

1535
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,960
Let my son drop

1536
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,960
out of my life

1537
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,960
for 15 years,

1538
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,590
let him drop into addiction,

1539
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,730
prison.

1540
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,330
And just today,

1541
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,330
I helped save

1542
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,330
the life of a guy

1543
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,640
who tried to kill him

1544
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,810
and who very well

1545
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,810
may try to kill him again.

1546
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
Yeah?

1547
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,480
I mean, I had...

1548
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,480
I had exactly one job...

1549
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,790
Protect my boy.

1550
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,720
And I failed.

1551
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,890
I could tell you that...

1552
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,420
That you didn't have a choice,

1553
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,590
that we took an oath.

1554
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,500
But I don't think

1555
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,500
that'd be much comfort.

1556
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,030
How come you

1557
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,030
didn't let me know

1558
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,730
what's going on with Sean?

1559
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,670
I was ashamed.

1560
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,440
Yeah.

1561
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,540
Okay.

1562
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,680
Hey. Hey, Dean.

1563
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,850
Yeah.

1564
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,720
It's Sean.

1565
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,370
Come on.

1566
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,000
All right.

1567
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,000
He's ready to extubate.

1568
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,400
Kai, I can do that.

1569
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,070
It's all right. I got it.

1570
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,070
Please.

1571
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,410
This is my son.

1572
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,710
Oh...

1573
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,100
Where am I?

1574
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,660
You're in the hospital, Sean.

1575
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,470
You just got

1576
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,470
out of surgery.

1577
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,600
Dad.

1578
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,780
It's gonna be okay,

1579
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,780
my boy.

1580
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,850
You're gonna be okay.

1581
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,990
It's gonna be okay.
