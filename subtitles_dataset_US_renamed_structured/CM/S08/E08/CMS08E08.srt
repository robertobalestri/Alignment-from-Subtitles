1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,640
Hey, Dean.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,640
How you doing?

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,370
I've had worse.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,170
Hey, Maggie.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,700
I just found

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,700
my old varsity jacket.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,980
Of course, you always

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,980
wore it more than me.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,740
This is my husband, Ben.

10
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,740
Hey.

11
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,610
I do seem to remember you

12
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,610
telling me

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,350
that you weren't

14
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,350
gonna have anything

15
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,350
to do with him.

16
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,080
What is going on here?

17
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,380
You're dressed like

18
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,380
one of my engineers.

19
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,150
Believe it or not,

20
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,150
we're out of scrubs.

21
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,230
So this is all your doing.

22
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,460
Just trying to help.

23
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,620
It's nice to have

24
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,620
a guardian angel.

25
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,010
You're here early.

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,210
Alarm mishap.

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,260
I'm gonna try to

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,260
grab some shut-eye

29
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,720
before my shift starts.

30
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,050
Got an empty bed?

31
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,020
Two's open.

32
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,020
I should warn you, though.

33
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,100
Drunk teenager vomited

34
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,100
all over that room last night.

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,460
But it's been cleaned.

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,460
Yeah.

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,500
Then I won't be surprised

38
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,500
by a pungent whiff.

39
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,190
Thanks for the heads-up.

40
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,460
Dr. Halstead, Maggie,

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,500
meet our newest member

42
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,500
of Emergency Medicine.

43
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,660
Justin Lieu.

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,660
Hello.

45
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,330
Hello.

46
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,330
Hi. A new attending.

47
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,670
Terrific. Welcome.

48
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,140
Actually, Dr. Lieu

49
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,140
is a first-year resident.

50
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,640
Ah! My mistake.

51
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,840
Listen, I'd like him

52
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,840
to join your service today.

53
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,510
Sure.

54
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,510
I'll let you get settled.

55
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,380
Thanks, Ms. Goodwin.

56
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,580
Wondering why I'm so

57
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,580
late to the party?

58
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,660
I know I've got some years

59
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,660
on the typical first-year.

60
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,520
I spent a decade doing search

61
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,520
and rescue

62
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,120
before deciding

63
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,120
on med school.

64
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,520
Very cool.

65
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,650
Is this guy

66
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,650
bothering you?

67
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,490
What are you doing here?

68
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,590
I just remembered

69
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,590
it was your first day,

70
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,360
and I was, you know,

71
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,360
I was in the neighborhood.

72
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,490
What's up, Gallo?

73
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,130
Clearly, you two

74
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,130
know each other.

75
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,470
We have ambo coming in.

76
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,840
Dr. Halstead,

77
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,840
you're going to five.

78
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,640
Ready to get

79
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,640
your hands dirty?

80
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,300
Yeah. Catch you later?

81
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,300
Yeah, go.

82
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,540
Go on. Be useful.

83
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,270
Courtney, going to five.

84
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,270
What do we got?

85
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,850
Lydia Shaw.

86
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,850
15-year-old female.

87
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,640
Disoriented and confused.

88
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,480
GCS 13, BP 90/56.

89
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,490
Sinus tach in the 110s.

90
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,490
Afebrile.

91
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,620
Wait. Where am I?

92
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,320
She woke up this morning,

93
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,320
she couldn't tell me her name,

94
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,550
what day of the week

95
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,550
it was. Nothing.

96
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,630
Are you Lydia's mom?

97
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,630
Yes.

98
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,720
Danielle.

99
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,200
On my count.

100
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,200
One, two, three.

101
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,130
She's been complaining

102
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,130
of exhaustion and nausea

103
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,130
for weeks.

104
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,300
Okay, we got her.

105
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,170
Lydia, you're at the hospital.

106
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,170
I'm gonna listen

107
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,170
to your lungs.

108
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,510
Okay.

109
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,280
Lungs are clear bilaterally.

110
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,220
Danielle, does Lydia

111
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,220
have any conditions

112
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,220
we should know about?

113
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,290
Any medications she's on?

114
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,290
None.

115
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,790
She's never even

116
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,790
had the flu.

117
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,790
Dr. Halstead?

118
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,190
Okay, pitting edema

119
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,190
to the lower extremities.

120
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,530
What's that?

121
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,530
Just means

122
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,530
there's some swelling.

123
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,790
Stop it!

124
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,300
Why are you doing that?

125
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm sorry, Lydia.

126
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm just checking your eyes.

127
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,270
Almost done.

128
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,560
Sclera is jaundiced.

129
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,330
Dr. Lieu, how does

130
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,330
the liver feel?

131
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,670
Liver edge extends

132
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,670
past the costal margin.

133
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,240
I know.

134
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,240
All right. All done.

135
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,780
Let's get a CBC, CMP, coags,

136
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,780
LFT, chest X-ray,

137
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,780
ammonia level, UA,

138
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,360
and a right

139
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,360
upper quadrant ultrasound.

140
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,520
Okay, we'll be back

141
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,520
the minute we have an update.

142
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,390
What are you thinking?

143
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,360
Hepatic encephalopathy.

144
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,460
What, didn't

145
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,460
expect the intern

146
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,460
to know the answer?

147
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,340
I was second oldest

148
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,340
in my med school class.

149
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,960
It might have given me

150
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,960
a bit of a complex.

151
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,500
Yeah, well, I think

152
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,500
you're absolutely right.

153
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,310
All clinical signs point

154
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,310
to advanced liver disease

155
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,740
as the cause

156
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,740
of her altered

157
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,740
mental state.

158
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,210
But what would cause

159
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,550
an otherwise healthy

160
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,550
15-year-old's liver to fail?

161
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,280
Grabbed this from your locker

162
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,280
for you. You'll never guess

163
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,280
what's inside.

164
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,360
Tampering with

165
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,360
someone else's mail

166
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,360
is a federal offense, Doris.

167
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,860
Just open it, Maggie.

168
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,500
No!

169
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,770
Is he there?

170
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,250
Are you serious?

171
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,550
I can't believe April

172
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,550
kept it from me.

173
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,250
Surprised?

174
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,690
Thrilled.

175
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,690
I'm so happy for you guys.

176
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,320
Thanks, Mags.

177
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,570
Come in.

178
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,310
Uh-oh.

179
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,610
See, now why does my mere

180
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,610
presence elicit that

181
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,610
response in your doctors?

182
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,280
Take a wild guess.

183
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,320
Have a seat, Dr. Marcel.

184
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,550
You're not in any trouble.

185
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,550
Oh, good.

186
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,750
Listen, I'm sure you know

187
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,750
the board wanted

188
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,660
to update the OR suites

189
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,660
this year with MRI machines.

190
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,060
Yeah, it'd be

191
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,060
a real gamechanger

192
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,030
to have high-resolution

193
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,030
imaging available

194
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,030
during surgery.

195
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,460
Unfortunately, the supply

196
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,460
chain crisis took precedence

197
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,460
over fundraising efforts.

198
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,910
And now we are

199
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,910
fast approaching

200
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,910
the end of the fiscal year

201
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,740
and still

202
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,740
woefully short on funds.

203
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,970
A big-ticket item, for sure.

204
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,480
So we're hoping Jack Dayton

205
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,480
might consider contributing

206
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,480
the remainder.

207
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,850
Roughly $10 million.

208
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,850
Okay.

209
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,690
We have invited him to dinner

210
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,690
at the hospital tonight,

211
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,380
and it'd be great if you

212
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,380
could join us, Dr. Marcel,

213
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,930
given your close

214
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,930
personal relationship

215
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,020
with the entrepreneur.

216
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,430
I don't know

217
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,430
if I'd call us close.

218
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,470
Not like I socialize

219
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,470
with the guy.

220
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, but you'd be able to

221
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,000
explain to him

222
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,560
the benefits of the technology

223
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,560
from a surgical perspective.

224
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,940
We know it's

225
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,940
last minute, but...

226
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,880
Asking Dayton for

227
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,880
$10 million right after

228
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,880
I helped rescue him?

229
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,450
Kind of feels like

230
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,450
a quid pro quo.

231
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,520
Exactly.

232
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,520
He is indebted to you.

233
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,020
Well, that's not

234
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,020
the way I see it.

235
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,060
My patients

236
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,060
don't owe me anything.

237
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,350
Look, I think it's great

238
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,350
you're approaching Jack,

239
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,660
and I hope he goes for it.

240
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,460
I'm just...

241
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,460
I'm not comfortable

242
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,460
making the ask.

243
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,630
We understand, and this was

244
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,630
by no means mandatory.

245
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,600
Okay.

246
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,570
But if you change your mind,

247
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,110
dinner's at 7:30

248
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,110
in the executive dining room.

249
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,110
All right.

250
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,150
What?

251
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,580
Hey, I need a second opinion

252
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,580
on a patient's

253
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,580
renal ultrasound.

254
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,850
And good morning to you.

255
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,150
Does this look like

256
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,150
renal artery stenosis

257
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,150
to you?

258
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,950
Did you forget

259
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,950
I'm an obstetrician?

260
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,460
I don't normally look

261
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,460
at these kinds of scans.

262
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,960
Just tell me what you see.

263
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,970
Okay. Velocities are higher

264
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,970
than they should be, I think.

265
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,970
And yeah, could be stenotic,

266
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,970
but it's hard to say,

267
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,510
seeing especially since,

268
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,510
as we established,

269
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm not a nephrologist.

270
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,870
Okay, thanks.

271
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,850
How bad would it be if I got

272
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,850
a candy bar for breakfast?

273
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,690
No worse than

274
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,690
the decaf frappe

275
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,780
with whipped cream

276
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,780
that I just downed.

277
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,560
Please, can I just speak

278
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,560
with a doctor?

279
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,690
Please, it won't take long.

280
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,530
I'm afraid that's not

281
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,530
how it works.

282
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,900
First fill out these forms.

283
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,590
And I'm gonna need your ID

284
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,590
and insurance card

285
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,860
if you have it.

286
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,860
Forget it.

287
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,030
Hey there.

288
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,510
Is there something

289
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,510
we can do for you?

290
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,510
How do you...

291
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,950
How do you know

292
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,950
if something happened to you?

293
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,980
Do you think something

294
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,980
might have happened to you?

295
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,550
Let's take a seat.

296
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,550
What's your name?

297
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,720
I don't want my name

298
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,720
recorded anywhere.

299
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,820
Like, in your system.

300
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,820
No, just between us.

301
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,800
Gloria.

302
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,800
Hi, Gloria.

303
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,230
I'm Nellie.

304
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,230
This is Hannah.

305
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,160
Just talk to us like we're

306
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,160
one of your girlfriends, okay?

307
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,870
Tell us what happened.

308
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,100
Last night,

309
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,100
I went to this party.

310
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,980
It was at a big warehouse

311
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,980
in Pilsen.

312
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,550
I was supposed to meet

313
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,550
my cousin there,

314
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,550
but I couldn't find her.

315
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,780
There were just

316
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,780
so many people.

317
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,060
And then?

318
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,820
I don't remember.

319
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,920
I had a drink,

320
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,920
just one drink,

321
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,530
and that's the last

322
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,530
thing I remember.

323
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,870
When I woke up this morning,

324
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,870
I was still there,

325
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,870
at the warehouse,

326
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,280
in this room

327
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,280
I didn't recognize.

328
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,650
Was there anyone

329
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,650
there with you?

330
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,250
But my underwear was gone.

331
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,960
I don't know what happened.

332
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,580
We're gonna figure this

333
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,580
out together.

334
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,530
Come with us, okay?

335
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,070
So Lydia has

336
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,070
an autoimmune disease called

337
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,070
primary biliary cholangitis.

338
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,200
The disease, it destroys

339
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,200
the bile ducts and can

340
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,200
lead to liver failure,

341
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,970
which unfortunately is what

342
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,970
we're seeing in Lydia's case.

343
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,610
She's 15!

344
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,610
She doesn't even drive yet!

345
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,710
It is rare to see PBC

346
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,710
in adolescents,

347
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,650
although there have

348
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,650
been reported cases

349
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,650
of pediatric onset.

350
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,750
If her liver is the problem,

351
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,750
why is her brain

352
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,750
being affected?

353
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,690
When the liver

354
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,690
isn't functioning

355
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,690
how it's supposed to,

356
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,660
it stops filtering toxins

357
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,660
from the bloodstream.

358
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,330
And then these toxins

359
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,330
build up and travel

360
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,330
to the brain.

361
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,660
But the condition

362
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,660
is only temporary.

363
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,800
And with medication,

364
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,800
her cognitive function

365
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,800
will return to normal.

366
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,870
What about her liver?

367
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,270
Lydia is going to need

368
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,270
a liver transplant.

369
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,290
So how do we do that?

370
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,150
How do we find her

371
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,150
a new liver?

372
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,020
We'll get Lydia evaluated

373
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,150
for the transplant list,

374
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,150
the national registry,

375
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,920
but her fastest bet

376
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,920
would be a living donor.

377
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,890
What's pretty cool about

378
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,890
the liver is it regenerates.

379
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,020
So you can give someone

380
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,020
a portion of your liver,

381
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,200
and it grows back

382
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,200
to its original size

383
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,200
after the transplant.

384
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,300
I would give her mine

385
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,300
in a heartbeat,

386
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,710
but I'm a recovering

387
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,710
alcoholic.

388
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,840
As long as you've been sober

389
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,840
for six months,

390
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,250
that's not an exclusionary

391
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,250
criterion, okay?

392
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,910
We will want to run some tests

393
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,910
to check your liver function.

394
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,380
Of course.

395
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,380
Whatever you need to do.

396
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,880
I would give anything

397
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,880
to help my daughter.

398
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,790
Maggie.

399
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,790
This better be good.

400
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,890
Showing up at my job

401
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,890
unannounced is quite

402
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,890
the overstep.

403
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,230
Didn't you get my text?

404
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,800
No, my phone's been on the

405
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,800
charger all morning.

406
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,800
What is it?

407
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,000
I got to show you

408
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,000
something outside.

409
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,000
I can't, Grant.

410
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm working.

411
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,370
Just five minutes.

412
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,370
That's all I'm asking.

413
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,940
I don't want to be a bother,

414
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,940
but you're the only person

415
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,940
who will understand.

416
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,340
Give me 20 minutes.

417
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,340
I'll take my lunch

418
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,340
break early.

419
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,640
Meet you out front.

420
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,640
Okay.

421
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,640
Congrats on

422
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,640
your big news, buddy.

423
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,640
Mazel tov.

424
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,380
Thank you.

425
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,380
I'm pretty excited.

426
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,390
Could have given me

427
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,390
a little more time to dust off

428
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,390
the old tux, though.

429
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,850
Damn.

430
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,850
Sorry about that.

431
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,330
You know, my dad's passing

432
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,330
crystallized a lot for me

433
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,190
about the man I want to be,

434
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,190
the life I want to have,

435
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,140
and an urgency

436
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,140
to get those changes now.

437
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,400
Makes sense.

438
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,870
It's probably why things

439
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,870
are so easy with April

440
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,870
this time around.

441
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,940
I guess I got

442
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,940
closer to the guy

443
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,940
she was holding out for.

444
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,820
Nice.

445
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,810
Hey, I need some help.

446
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,810
I got a guy in trouble

447
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,810
a few blocks away.

448
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,750
Hey, I'm Dr. Choi.

449
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,750
What's going on?

450
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,190
There's this

451
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,190
homeless guy, Buddy.

452
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,320
He kind of lives

453
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,320
behind my apartment building.

454
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,190
Something's wrong with him.

455
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,190
I called 911.

456
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,230
But they said the ambulance

457
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,230
is gonna take,

458
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,230
like, 20 minutes.

459
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,230
I don't know.

460
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,230
He doesn't look so good.

461
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,360
Can you take us to him?

462
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,360
Yeah, follow me.

463
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,330
Buddy!

464
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,930
Buddy. Hey, Buddy.

465
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,400
He's breathing, right?

466
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,710
Respirations are shallow,

467
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,710
but yeah, he's breathing.

468
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,770
How long has

469
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,770
he been here for?

470
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,910
Buddy's been a fixture

471
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,910
since I moved in,

472
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,910
so at least four years.

473
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,710
You notice any changes

474
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,710
in his behavior recently?

475
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,990
Buddy disappeared

476
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,990
for a couple nights,

477
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,990
maybe about a month ago.

478
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,890
I don't know where he went,

479
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,890
but when he came back,

480
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,890
he wasn't moving

481
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,890
around as well.

482
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,120
He just seemed

483
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,120
more out of it

484
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,120
than usual.

485
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,040
My name won't be on the...

486
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,940
It won't be attached

487
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,940
to anything?

488
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,450
It can all be

489
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,450
processed anonymously.

490
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,920
And you won't release

491
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,920
any of my information

492
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,920
to the police, right?

493
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,150
Mmm-mmm.

494
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,150
Not without your permission.

495
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,850
I forgot to ask.

496
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,850
How much is it gonna cost?

497
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,320
I don't have insurance or

498
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,320
anything, so...

499
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,950
Nothing. There's no patient

500
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,950
responsibility.

501
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,060
And we'll give you

502
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,060
a voucher for any

503
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,060
additional follow-up costs.

504
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,930
Would you like a Valium?

505
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,930
It can help calm your nerves.

506
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,060
No, no, no, I don't want

507
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,060
to black out again.

508
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,940
It's actually just

509
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,940
a mild sedative.

510
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,340
No!

511
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,430
Thanks, but no.

512
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,970
Okay.

513
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,510
We're ready to begin the exam.

514
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,510
Okay, Gloria?

515
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,520
Okay, so sit back a little,

516
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,520
put your feet in the stirrups.

517
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,480
And if at any point

518
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,480
you need me to stop,

519
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,850
if you need to take a break,

520
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,850
you just let me know, okay?

521
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,090
All right,

522
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,090
I'm putting my hand

523
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,090
on the inside of your thigh.

524
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,290
Next, I'm gonna

525
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,290
take a quick look at

526
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,290
the outside area first.

527
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,870
Here.

528
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,370
Squeeze as hard

529
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,370
as you need.

530
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,100
Okay.

531
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,300
Now you're gonna feel

532
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,300
the tip of the speculum.

533
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,440
You're doing really great.

534
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,280
So what do you think?

535
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,280
I know her liver's

536
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,280
on the cusp, but...

537
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,850
I've got to disagree

538
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,850
with you there, Will.

539
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,890
It's not on the cusp.

540
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,890
Not even close.

541
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,520
Well, what do you mean?

542
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,520
Danielle's liver function

543
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,520
is solid.

544
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,250
Yeah, now,

545
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,250
but the damage is done.

546
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,380
The liver's fibrotic.

547
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,380
Mildly.

548
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,150
It won't tolerate

549
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,150
a partial resection.

550
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,920
Well, that's a prediction,

551
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,920
not a fact.

552
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,120
A good chance

553
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,120
it'll fail to regenerate.

554
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,890
And then Mom will need

555
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,890
a liver transplant.

556
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,870
Maybe that's a risk

557
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,870
Danielle's willing to take.

558
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,230
But if Danielle ended up

559
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,230
needing a new liver

560
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,000
after we allowed

561
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,000
her to donate,

562
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,300
that's the kind of

563
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,300
bad outcome

564
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,570
that could get

565
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,570
a transplant program

566
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,570
shut down.

567
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,870
I'm sorry, man.

568
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,250
My, my, my.

569
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,620
My goodness.

570
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,330
Is that...

571
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,330
It is.

572
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,430
No!

573
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,330
What happened to

574
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,330
the peeling vinyl top that

575
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,330
used to flap in the wind?

576
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,900
Gone. That and

577
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,900
the cracked window.

578
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,870
Got the heating

579
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,870
and air fixed too.

580
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,030
Oh, my word.

581
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,300
You know,

582
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,300
I love this car.

583
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,610
It's the only reason I gave

584
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,610
you the time of day

585
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,610
in high school.

586
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,170
I've been restoring it

587
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,170
for years now.

588
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,510
You did

589
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,510
all this yourself?

590
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,020
For the most part.

591
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,090
Just got the leather seats

592
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,090
reupholstered.

593
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,090
The finishing touch.

594
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,510
Wow.

595
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,510
What do you say?

596
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,120
A spin around the block,

597
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,120
for old time's sake?

598
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,320
Oh...

599
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,420
Come on.

600
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,930
A quick spin.

601
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,160
My break's over in 30.

602
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,360
Yes, ma'am.

603
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,010
Do you happen to know

604
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,010
his full name?

605
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,400
Everyone just

606
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,400
calls him Buddy.

607
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,500
He's a friendly guy

608
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,500
but not all there.

609
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,670
How so?

610
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,910
Sometimes I'll see him

611
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,910
talking to no one,

612
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,510
and he repeats himself a lot.

613
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,380
It just seems like his

614
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,380
processing is kind of delayed.

615
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,190
Hey, I'm really sorry,

616
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,190
but I'm super late for work.

617
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,950
Look, we really appreciate you

618
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,950
hanging around while we got

619
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,950
him situated, okay?

620
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,430
Thank you very much.

621
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,660
So I found a partially healed

622
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,660
puncture site in his groin.

623
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,160
It looks like he developed

624
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,160
a postprocedural abscess.

625
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,130
I'm gonna drain it

626
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,130
and start antibiotics.

627
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,400
Wonder what the procedure

628
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,400
was for.

629
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,560
Or where it was done.

630
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,570
Hawley Community Hospital.

631
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,010
It's still in pretty

632
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,010
good shape,

633
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,510
so it must have been

634
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,510
a fairly recent visit.

635
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,100
Is there a name

636
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,100
on that bracelet?

637
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,140
William "Buddy" Foster.

638
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,680
Clip that off for me,

639
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,680
will you, Doris?

640
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,610
I'm gonna look up

641
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,610
that hospital

642
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,610
and then give them a call.

643
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,150
Hawley?

644
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,480
I mean, it kind of

645
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,480
rings a bell,

646
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,420
but I'm pretty sure

647
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,420
it's outside of Chicago.

648
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,620
I wonder how he

649
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,620
ended up there.

650
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,960
Any other family members

651
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,960
that might be willing

652
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,960
to get evaluated?

653
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,500
See if they're a match

654
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,500
for Lydia?

655
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,000
No, she's...

656
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,000
She's an only child.

657
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,400
Her father also had problems

658
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,400
with alcohol.

659
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,170
Smashed his car

660
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,170
into a tree two years ago

661
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,170
and died on impact.

662
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,250
We're so sorry.

663
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,470
With the transplant list,

664
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,450
how long do you think

665
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,450
Lydia will have to wait?

666
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,520
It is impossible to predict.

667
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,090
It can take just a few weeks,

668
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,090
or it can take months.

669
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,720
Years sometimes.

670
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,430
So just prepare myself

671
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,430
for anything?

672
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,470
Yeah. We'll check on Lydia

673
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,470
in a bit, okay?

674
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,140
Man, that's rough.

675
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,440
Worst feeling in the world,

676
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,440
I imagine.

677
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,150
Doing search and rescue,

678
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,150
you meet these parents

679
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,740
who are just

680
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,740
so desperate to help.

681
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,020
It's heartbreaking

682
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,020
telling them they can't.

683
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,150
Yeah, only adds salt that

684
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,150
Danielle's past

685
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,310
is what's preventing her

686
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,310
from donating.

687
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,790
Talk about a cruel twist, huh?

688
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,360
If it was any other organ.

689
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,260
I mean, her kidneys are

690
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,260
perfectly healthy.

691
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,430
Dr. Halstead?

692
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,340
Her kidneys are healthy.

693
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,340
I think you're

694
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,340
on to something.

695
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,580
You're staring.

696
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,580
I'm sorry.

697
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,320
I just never thought

698
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,320
you'd be riding shotgun

699
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,320
in this car again.

700
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,550
Well...

701
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,060
It used to give me

702
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,060
such a rush back in the day,

703
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,220
looking over and seeing

704
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,220
you next to me.

705
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,500
Still does.

706
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,730
Grant.

707
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,140
No.

708
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,480
Grant!

709
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,720
You're talking about

710
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,720
a paired exchange, right?

711
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,820
It won't work.

712
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,600
Both the donors need

713
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,600
to have healthy livers.

714
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,330
Well, not exactly.

715
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,330
It's called a trans-organ

716
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,330
paired exchange.

717
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,270
Oh, yeah.

718
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,270
I heard it discussed

719
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,270
at a conference.

720
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,600
Pretty new concept, right?

721
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,870
Only a couple have

722
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,870
been performed in the U.S.

723
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,540
It's rare, but this

724
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,540
kind of swap

725
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,840
is allowed under the

726
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,840
National Organ Transplant Act.

727
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,580
Uh-huh. Thank you.

728
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,580
So you're suggesting

729
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,580
that Danielle

730
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,580
donate her kidney

731
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,310
to someone on

732
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,310
the transplant list...

733
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,850
Someone already with

734
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,850
a willing donor

735
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,180
who was ruled out

736
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,180
for a kidney-specific reason.

737
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,190
And then they would donate

738
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,190
their liver to Lydia?

739
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,320
Like a paired exchange,

740
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,320
except with different organs.

741
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,660
Well, it's not exactly

742
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,660
like for like.

743
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
A liver transplant exposes

744
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
the donor to greater risk.

745
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,790
But if we can identify

746
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,790
a potential donor

747
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,790
recipient match,

748
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,330
walk them through

749
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,330
the added risk factors...

750
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,770
And we have to loop in legal.

751
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,600
The whole nine yards.

752
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,600
Of course.

753
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm not trying to do anything

754
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,640
below board.

755
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,570
Okay, I think I have an idea

756
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,570
for a second donor.

757
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,540
Frank Sheraton. Late 40s.

758
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,170
He's in good health,

759
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,170
but due to a mild reduction

760
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,170
in GFR,

761
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,310
he couldn't donate his kidney

762
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,310
to his wife, Roberta.

763
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,610
She's been on

764
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,610
the transplant list

765
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,610
for three years.

766
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,780
Before we get

767
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,780
anyone's hopes up,

768
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,410
let's make sure Frank's

769
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,410
a match for Lydia,

770
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,620
Danielle for Roberta.

771
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,710
I'll pull up their charts.

772
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,350
Dr. Lieu, you want to

773
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,350
give me a hand?

774
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,450
Happy to.

775
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,450
All right.

776
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,260
We'll circle back in a bit.

777
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,260
Great.

778
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,300
Dr. Halstead, there you are.

779
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,300
What's wrong?

780
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,270
Maggie and a friend

781
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,270
were in a car accident.

782
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,700
The ambulance is en route.

783
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,270
Maggie, you should be

784
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,270
on a gurney.

785
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,470
I'm fine.

786
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,670
That's what I said,

787
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,670
but she refused.

788
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,770
Going to Baghdad.

789
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,770
Matt, talk to me.

790
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,510
Grant Young. 44-year-old male.

791
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,510
High-speed motor

792
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,510
vehicle crash.

793
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,950
GCS 15, BP 120/72.

794
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,950
Heart rate 110.

795
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,290
Large laceration on the...

796
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,290
To the left calf.

797
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,790
Active bleeding for

798
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,790
almost four minutes.

799
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,420
I initially tried

800
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,420
to control it

801
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,420
with pressure.

802
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,690
Hey, Grant.

803
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,690
I'm Dr. Halstead.

804
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,350
A piece of shrapnel

805
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,350
or something from the door

806
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,450
sliced the leg.

807
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,860
It looks arterial.

808
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,730
Thank you, Maggie.

809
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,730
I got it from here.

810
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,600
Come on, Maggie.

811
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,600
Let me look you over.

812
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,760
Come.

813
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,800
Gloria.

814
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,500
Hey.

815
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,800
You want to have a seat?

816
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,710
That's okay.

817
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,710
I prefer to stand.

818
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,610
Okay, sure.

819
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,850
So your labs came back

820
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,850
positive for GHB.

821
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,650
It's what's commonly known

822
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,650
as a date rape drug.

823
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,520
And while we can't make

824
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,520
any definitive conclusions

825
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,990
until your kit is tested,

826
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,350
there was evidence

827
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,350
that you sustained injuries

828
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,830
from a sexual assault.

829
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,690
What kind of evidence?

830
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Bruising in your genital area,

831
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
a possible

832
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
fingerprint pattern.

833
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,710
What about STDs?

834
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,780
Your HIV, gonorrhea,

835
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,780
and chlamydia tests

836
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,440
all came back negative,

837
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,780
but you'll need to follow up

838
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,410
to do retesting in two

839
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,410
to three weeks.

840
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,960
Is it too early to know if...

841
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,420
If I'm pregnant?

842
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,790
Your pregnancy test

843
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,790
came back negative,

844
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,370
but you'll want to retest

845
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,370
in two weeks.

846
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,360
Is that it?

847
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,360
Is that everything?

848
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,570
Can I go home now?

849
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,300
Well, first we wanted

850
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,300
to talk with you

851
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,710
about some of the counseling

852
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,750
and mental health

853
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,750
services available.

854
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,750
All free of charge.

855
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,850
I really want to go home.

856
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,510
Forget it ever happened.

857
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,480
If you do

858
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,480
change your mind,

859
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,650
all of the information

860
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,650
and the phone numbers

861
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,650
are in here.

862
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,520
Both of ours included.

863
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,690
Thanks.

864
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,560
Gloria, you said initially

865
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,070
that you didn't want

866
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,070
to involve the police.

867
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,670
I don't.

868
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,670
Okay.

869
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,430
You do understand, though,

870
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,430
that without a report,

871
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,910
they're not able

872
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,910
to open an investigation,

873
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,640
so they're not able

874
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,640
to find the person

875
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,640
who did this to you.

876
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,650
It's not like I'd press

877
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,650
charges anyway.

878
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,750
I just...

879
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,680
I needed to know

880
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,680
what happened

881
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,680
for myself.

882
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,520
That's it.

883
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,520
That's enough.

884
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,990
No one else can know.

885
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,390
Gloria, I understand,

886
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,390
right now, this is

887
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,390
very traumatizing...

888
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,930
Okay, Gloria.

889
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,500
We hear you.

890
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,430
We'll get your discharge

891
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,430
paperwork started.

892
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,810
Hey. That's it?

893
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,440
I feel like we should

894
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,440
be having a more

895
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,440
substantial conversation

896
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,350
with her about reporting.

897
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,350
No.

898
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,480
Her unwillingness to show ID,

899
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,550
lack of insurance,

900
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,550
fear of the police.

901
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,990
I suspect that Gloria

902
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,990
might be undocumented.

903
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,990
Let's not push too hard, okay?

904
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,900
But I believe there are

905
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,900
legal protections for

906
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,900
undocumented immigrants

907
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,660
that report crimes

908
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,660
like sexual assault.

909
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,900
And while you may believe

910
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,900
in those protections, Hannah,

911
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,730
Gloria might not,

912
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,730
and we have to respect that.

913
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,140
Buddy, what we're trying

914
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,140
to figure out

915
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,780
is if you can remember going

916
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,780
to a hospital recently.

917
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,540
Yeah.

918
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,950
Yeah, I went

919
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,950
to the hospital before.

920
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,040
That's right.

921
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,890
And how'd you get there?

922
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,760
Real nice lady drove me.

923
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,460
She bought me dinner too.

924
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,960
Were you hurt?

925
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,060
No. Don't think so. No.

926
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,170
I wonder why she,

927
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,000
she took you

928
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,000
to the hospital, then.

929
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,910
Guess I needed to go.

930
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,430
A real nice lady.

931
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,640
She bought me dinner.

932
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,640
Okay.

933
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,840
Um, you know what?

934
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,890
We're gonna step out

935
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,890
for a second

936
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,890
and be right back.

937
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,980
Sure.

938
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,980
Yeah, all right.

939
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,490
Sit tight.

940
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,490
Sure.

941
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,190
All right, so I got

942
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,190
in touch with Hawley

943
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,190
Community Hospital.

944
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,130
It's about two hours north of

945
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,130
the city, in Wisconsin, right?

946
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,200
Buddy was there

947
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,200
a month ago.

948
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,540
Two-night stay for

949
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,540
a left atrial appendage

950
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,540
occlusion procedure.

951
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,800
Aren't LA occlusions done

952
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,070
to prevent stroke in patients

953
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,070
with a-fib?

954
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,040
Buddy hasn't flipped into

955
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,040
a-fib once since he got here.

956
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,610
It's an elective procedure

957
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,880
on an unhoused patient

958
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,880
in a different state.

959
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,120
How'd they expect him

960
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,120
to get back for his

961
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,120
follow-up stuff?

962
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,820
Or keep his

963
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,820
surgical site clean?

964
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,790
It's no wonder he ended up

965
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,790
with an infection.

966
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,790
At best, I think we're

967
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,790
looking at extreme negligence.

968
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,880
I think it's worse.

969
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,650
Buddy mentioned a lady

970
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,650
picking him up

971
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,660
and driving him

972
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,660
to the hospital.

973
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,000
Ugh!

974
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,000
A recruiter.

975
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,700
Probably gets a kickback

976
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,700
for every patient she finds.

977
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,500
Oh, my gosh.

978
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,630
I think we're looking at

979
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,630
Medicaid fraud.

980
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,470
It's not what

981
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,470
it looks like, Sharon.

982
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,640
Who said

983
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,640
it looked like anything?

984
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,170
No one's judging you.

985
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,610
Hey, I just wanted

986
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,610
to let you know

987
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,610
I sent Grant to angio

988
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,520
to see if there's

989
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,520
any vessel damage to his leg.

990
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,720
Thanks for the update, Will.

991
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,850
Of course.

992
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,990
How's your patient,

993
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,990
Ms. Goodwin?

994
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,120
Stubborn with a chance

995
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,120
of just fine.

996
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,900
Maggie, you want me

997
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,900
to call Ben for you?

998
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,900
No, no, no. That's okay.

999
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,170
Ben's away at a teacher's

1000
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,170
conference in Florida.

1001
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,940
I'll let him know

1002
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,940
when he comes home on Friday.

1003
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,210
Sure.

1004
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,880
Hannah.

1005
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,250
Hey, do you have a minute?

1006
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,850
Yeah, of course.

1007
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,850
What's up?

1008
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,750
Her name is Chelsea.

1009
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,830
She walked into the district

1010
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,830
this morning to report

1011
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,830
a possible rape.

1012
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,260
A possible rape?

1013
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,760
Blacked out at

1014
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,760
a warehouse party last night.

1015
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,960
She thinks someone

1016
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,960
slipped something

1017
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,960
in her drink.

1018
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,570
Was it in Pilsen?

1019
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,870
Yeah. How did you know that?

1020
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,170
So I donate a lobe of

1021
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,170
my liver to this young woman,

1022
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,610
and the girl's mother

1023
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,610
would give her kidney

1024
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
to Roberta?

1025
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
Exactly.

1026
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,990
We've done the legwork,

1027
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,990
and you're a compatible donor.

1028
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,920
And the mother is a match

1029
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,920
for you, Roberta.

1030
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,090
Well then, yeah.

1031
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,090
Absolutely. I'm in.

1032
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,660
How soon can they operate?

1033
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,660
Frank, hold on a second.

1034
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,290
I think we have to ask

1035
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,290
a few more questions.

1036
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,670
We learned all about

1037
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,670
kidney donation

1038
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,900
when Frank was evaluated

1039
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,900
to be a donor for me.

1040
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,200
Donating the liver,

1041
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,200
is this a similar undertaking?

1042
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,680
Well, to be completely honest,

1043
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,800
it's a bigger undertaking.

1044
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,820
It's an open surgery with

1045
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,820
a large abdominal incision.

1046
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,110
And because of

1047
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,110
the incision,

1048
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,020
it is a harder recovery

1049
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,020
than kidney donation.

1050
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,590
Usually about twice as long.

1051
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,020
Oh, then no.

1052
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,110
Babe.

1053
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,110
No.

1054
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,210
We have to think

1055
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,210
about the kids.

1056
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,730
I am.

1057
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,090
They need their mom.

1058
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,290
We all need you.

1059
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,860
Hey, remember,

1060
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,090
I survived five skydives

1061
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,090
and three bungee jumps.

1062
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,300
You think I'm gonna let

1063
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,300
a little surgery take me out?

1064
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,710
Surgery is probably

1065
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,710
the safest place for me.

1066
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,680
And the fact that

1067
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,680
this is gonna

1068
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,680
help someone else out too?

1069
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,640
Even better.

1070
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,770
Let me do this.

1071
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,680
Is this a yes?

1072
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,950
Okay.

1073
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,890
Great.

1074
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,360
Great.

1075
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,930
I understand that

1076
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,930
the evidence

1077
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,930
from Gloria's exam

1078
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,900
would strengthen any future

1079
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,900
case against the assailant,

1080
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,770
but I really don't think

1081
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,770
revisiting the topic

1082
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,310
is going to change

1083
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,310
her mind.

1084
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,930
Well, I think we should try.

1085
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,680
So you want her

1086
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,680
to risk her future,

1087
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,010
or her family's future,

1088
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,010
for someone

1089
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,010
she doesn't even know?

1090
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,110
No, I'm not saying that.

1091
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,190
Because that's

1092
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,190
her dilemma, Hannah.

1093
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,250
And you can promise her

1094
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,250
till you're blue in the face

1095
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,860
that the system

1096
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,860
will protect her

1097
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,080
and fight for her rights

1098
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,080
just like they

1099
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,080
fight for yours,

1100
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,320
but I bet she's seen enough

1101
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,320
evidence to the contrary

1102
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,420
to know better.

1103
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,870
I'm not suggesting that Gloria

1104
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,870
do this for someone else.

1105
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,400
I'm thinking of Gloria

1106
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,400
and how it's gonna feel

1107
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,040
to carry this trauma

1108
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,040
for the rest of her life.

1109
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,170
My college roommate, Annie,

1110
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,170
was raped at a frat party.

1111
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,980
She didn't know who did it.

1112
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,980
Didn't report it to anyone.

1113
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,310
And she said exactly

1114
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,310
what Gloria said.

1115
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,720
She just wanted to forget

1116
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,720
it ever happened.

1117
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,340
And so,

1118
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,340
she put all her energy

1119
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,220
into pretending like

1120
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,220
it didn't matter,

1121
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,420
like holding someone

1122
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,420
accountable didn't matter.

1123
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,960
And somewhere along the way,

1124
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,960
I think she began to believe

1125
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,030
it didn't matter.

1126
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,130
That she didn't matter.

1127
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,730
And she carried that feeling

1128
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,730
as long as she could

1129
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,930
before taking her own life.

1130
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,100
Oh... Hannah.

1131
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,040
I'm so sorry.

1132
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,910
So no, I'm not,

1133
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,850
I'm not insensitive

1134
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,850
to the enormity

1135
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,010
of what we are potentially

1136
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,010
asking Gloria to do.

1137
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,350
It's just I have seen

1138
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,350
the other side of it.

1139
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,320
The consequence of sweeping

1140
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,320
a trauma under the rug.

1141
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,030
Dr. Martin Grainer,

1142
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,770
the interventional

1143
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,770
cardiologist who did

1144
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,770
Buddy's procedure.

1145
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,500
I noticed that he was moving

1146
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,500
around a lot,

1147
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,470
so I started calling

1148
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,470
some of these hospitals.

1149
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,140
Yeah?

1150
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,140
Lost privileges

1151
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,510
in pretty much every

1152
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,510
single one of them.

1153
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,150
I mean, how the hell is

1154
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,150
this guy still practicing?

1155
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,980
You all right?

1156
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,980
Yeah.

1157
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,420
I slept funny. That's all.

1158
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,150
They didn't feel like

1159
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,150
they could prove

1160
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,950
that he was fabricating

1161
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,950
indications for procedures.

1162
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,050
Hey.

1163
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,520
That's the doctor

1164
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,520
who treated Buddy.

1165
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,420
Dr. Martin Grainer.

1166
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,020
So Buddy's labs came back,

1167
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,160
and his PSA

1168
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,160
was through the roof.

1169
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,460
Sent him for imaging,

1170
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,160
and he has advanced stage

1171
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,160
prostate cancer.

1172
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,970
It's all over his body,

1173
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,970
in his brain, his spine.

1174
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,770
Nothing we could do

1175
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,770
for him at this point.

1176
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,400
So while this sorry

1177
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,400
excuse for a doctor

1178
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,210
is making up all

1179
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,210
these bogus

1180
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,210
medical problems...

1181
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,310
He could have been treating

1182
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,310
him for something very real.

1183
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,910
See that?

1184
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,890
You have a small

1185
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,890
pseudo-aneurysm

1186
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,930
of the posterior

1187
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,930
tibial artery.

1188
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,260
That sounds ominous.

1189
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,090
It's not as

1190
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,090
scary as it sounds.

1191
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,960
It's a small pressurized

1192
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,960
pool of blood

1193
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,560
that can form following

1194
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,560
injury to the wall

1195
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,560
of the blood vessel.

1196
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,270
That will likely resolve

1197
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,270
on its own

1198
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,840
without any need

1199
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,840
for surgical intervention.

1200
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,200
We'll just want you back

1201
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,200
next week for an ultrasound.

1202
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,540
That's a relief.

1203
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,540
Definitely.

1204
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,110
If you'll excuse me, I have

1205
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,110
to check on another patient.

1206
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,950
Thanks, Will.

1207
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,950
Well, that's good news.

1208
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,420
Yes, it is.

1209
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,590
Look, I've just been lying

1210
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,590
here, doing a lot of thinking,

1211
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,360
and I crossed the line.

1212
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,360
Plain and simple.

1213
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,370
I'm really sorry, Maggie.

1214
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,470
Riding around in that

1215
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,470
old Monte Carlo,

1216
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,010
I think we just both

1217
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,010
forgot ourselves for a moment.

1218
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,980
I guess I thought maybe

1219
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,980
we could be friends, but...

1220
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,980
There's just too much history.

1221
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,980
Yeah.

1222
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,520
I know that now.

1223
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,890
I do.

1224
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,240
Gloria, you are so brave

1225
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,240
to come here.

1226
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,340
And if you need

1227
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,340
anything at all,

1228
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,320
you've got both

1229
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,320
of our numbers.

1230
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,980
And I really hope

1231
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,980
you consider attending

1232
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,980
one of those support groups.

1233
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,030
Yeah, I'll think about it.

1234
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,290
Dr. Cuevas.

1235
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,120
Nellie, I mean.

1236
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,360
I was hoping I'd see you

1237
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,360
before I left.

1238
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,960
Before you go, Gloria,

1239
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,510
I wanted to share

1240
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,510
something with you.

1241
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,400
It's not something

1242
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,400
a lot of my colleagues know.

1243
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,910
Something Dr. Asher

1244
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,910
doesn't know.

1245
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,380
I'm, um...

1246
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm undocumented.

1247
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,300
My family

1248
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,300
immigrated to the U.S.

1249
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,300
before I could walk.

1250
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,070
And as a DACA recipient,

1251
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,110
I'm legally allowed

1252
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,110
to work and live here,

1253
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,140
but I still keep

1254
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,140
my immigration

1255
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,140
status close to the vest.

1256
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,440
But I'm telling you

1257
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,440
because I trust you.

1258
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,550
And I trust Dr. Asher.

1259
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,090
So if you ever want

1260
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,090
to report what happened,

1261
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,530
now or at some point

1262
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,530
in the future,

1263
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,470
Dr. Asher and I know someone

1264
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,470
who will have your back.

1265
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,160
Someone you can trust.

1266
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,720
Roberta, Frank,

1267
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,720
this is Lydia

1268
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,720
and her mom, Danielle.

1269
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,720
I don't know

1270
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,720
how to thank you

1271
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,720
both enough.

1272
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,530
I should be thanking you.

1273
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,220
You don't even know me,

1274
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,220
and you're giving me...

1275
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,060
Can I hug you?

1276
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,060
Yes.

1277
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,100
We'll give you all some time

1278
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,100
to get acquainted.

1279
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,240
I hope trans-organ exchanges

1280
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,240
become more commonplace.

1281
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,440
It would increase

1282
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,440
the number of potential

1283
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,440
donors significantly.

1284
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,310
Yeah, and would allow

1285
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,310
donors who were

1286
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,310
previously ruled out

1287
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,040
to still help

1288
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,040
their loved ones.

1289
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,310
Quid pro quo.

1290
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,360
Yeah, and everybody wins.

1291
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,530
Well, hey, if you guys

1292
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,530
aren't above

1293
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,560
grabbing a beer

1294
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,560
with an intern,

1295
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,560
first round's on me.

1296
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,360
Definitely not above

1297
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,360
a free beer.

1298
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,430
What do you say, Crockett?

1299
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,430
I'm gonna have to join

1300
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,430
you fellas another time.

1301
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,070
Cheers.

1302
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,070
Hey, Gloria.

1303
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,470
This is Detective Upton.

1304
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,270
You can call me Hailey.

1305
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,270
We can talk here,

1306
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,270
if you want.

1307
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,040
We can go outside for a walk,

1308
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,040
get some air.

1309
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,450
Up to you.

1310
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,570
Here is fine.

1311
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,570
Okay.

1312
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,050
We'll check back on you soon.

1313
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,150
I just hope they find

1314
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,150
who did this before any

1315
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,150
other women are harmed.

1316
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,820
Gloria's statement,

1317
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,820
the evidence from her exam.

1318
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,100
They're gonna help CPD's

1319
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,100
investigation tremendously.

1320
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,500
Hannah, like I said

1321
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,500
to Gloria,

1322
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,470
I don't advertise my status.

1323
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,600
It's your business,

1324
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,600
nobody else's.

1325
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,080
I won't tell anyone.

1326
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,080
Thank you.

1327
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,140
It is incredible,

1328
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,140
what you've accomplished.

1329
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,620
Going to med school,

1330
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,620
becoming a doctor.

1331
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,120
It hasn't been easy.

1332
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,590
And with legal challenges

1333
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,590
constantly on the horizon,

1334
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,220
DACA's future and my future

1335
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,220
always feels a bit precarious.

1336
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,460
But surrounding myself

1337
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,460
with good people really helps.

1338
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,260
People I can trust.

1339
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,810
Oh, Maggie. Come on in.

1340
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,640
I have to head to this dinner,

1341
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,640
but I'm glad you stopped by.

1342
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,740
Okay.

1343
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,650
So how are you feeling?

1344
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,550
Okay.

1345
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,130
I've decided to

1346
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,260
not tell Ben

1347
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,260
about the accident.

1348
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,530
For the time being, or...

1349
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,430
Ever.

1350
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,330
Are you sure that's what

1351
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,330
you want to do?

1352
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,900
There's just no benefit

1353
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,900
to him knowing.

1354
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,340
Well, I think Ben might

1355
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,340
beg to differ.

1356
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,680
Grant has just caused so

1357
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,680
many problems in my marriage.

1358
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,580
I just... I don't want

1359
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,580
to make it any worse.

1360
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,250
Well, I get it,

1361
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,250
but I'm just...

1362
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,760
I'm just wondering

1363
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,760
how you'd feel if

1364
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,760
the roles were reversed

1365
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:45,260
and Ben didn't tell you

1366
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:45,260
that he was in a car accident.

1367
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,200
Sharon, it's just that,

1368
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,700
I can't.

1369
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,900
I can't.

1370
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,900
Look.

1371
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,510
Look, give it a little time.

1372
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,580
You had a terrible scare

1373
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,580
today, Maggie.

1374
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,480
You don't have to

1375
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,480
decide this minute.

1376
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,850
Look, I have to go,

1377
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,850
but you stay as long

1378
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,850
as you need.

1379
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,450
All right.

1380
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,860
Hello, everyone.

1381
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,700
Jack, great to see you again.

1382
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,360
Glad you could join us.

1383
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,360
Yeah.

1384
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,910
Kathleen, Dennis.

1385
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,370
Hey.

1386
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,540
So what changed your mind?

1387
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,380
Well, I...

1388
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,850
I might have been

1389
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,850
a little overly concerned

1390
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,850
with the optics.

1391
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,980
This money could benefit

1392
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,980
a lot of people.

1393
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,950
Good to see you guys.

1394
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,950
How are you?

1395
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,350
Thank you.

1396
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,360
Well, why don't you

1397
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,360
make your ask now?

1398
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
I just think we can get

1399
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
the business talk

1400
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
out of the way

1401
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,700
so we can enjoy our dinner,

1402
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,330
which looks delicious,

1403
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,330
by the way.

1404
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,930
So what's the ask?

1405
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,900
Well, our surgical center

1406
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,530
is ranked among

1407
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,530
the top ten in the U.S.

1408
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,240
Thank you.

1409
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,240
We want it in the top five.

1410
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,010
We have the best surgeons

1411
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,010
in the country,

1412
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,780
Dr. Marcel among them,

1413
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,480
and what they've been

1414
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,480
telling us they need

1415
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,550
is updated technology,

1416
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,620
starting with intraoperative

1417
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,620
MRI machines.

1418
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,020
Being able to take imaging

1419
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,020
in the middle of a surgery

1420
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,790
would allow us to constantly

1421
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,790
recalibrate our approach.

1422
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,920
It'd be the difference

1423
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,730
between being able

1424
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,730
to resect 50% of a tumor

1425
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,770
and being able to resect

1426
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,770
the whole thing.

1427
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,430
How much capital

1428
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,430
are you looking for?

1429
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,500
Ten million dollars.

1430
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,940
But of course,

1431
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,940
we would welcome

1432
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,940
a donation of any amount.

1433
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,510
No, I think you're

1434
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,510
setting your sights too low.

1435
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,280
I'm gonna do something

1436
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,280
even better for Chicago Med.

1437
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,760
Please.

1438
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,360
What's all that?

1439
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,410
Buddy's belongings.

1440
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,310
The guy he came in with

1441
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,310
dropped off a bag.

1442
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,070
Stuff he gathered

1443
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,070
from the spot

1444
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,070
where Buddy camped out.

1445
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,350
Was this him when

1446
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,350
he was a kid?

1447
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,480
It looks

1448
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,480
like him, right?

1449
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,480
Yeah.

1450
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,820
And that apartment

1451
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,820
building in

1452
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,820
the photo,

1453
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,550
that's where we

1454
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,550
found Buddy this

1455
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,550
morning.

1456
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,920
He was camping out

1457
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,920
in the alley behind it.

1458
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,690
I'll be damned.

1459
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,990
Figure it's where

1460
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,990
he grew up?

1461
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah.

1462
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,040
Maybe I shouldn't have

1463
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,040
unpacked everything.

1464
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,070
He's only here

1465
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,070
to make a move

1466
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,070
into hospice.

1467
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,710
Were you able to track

1468
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,710
down any family?

1469
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,900
No.

1470
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,550
You know, I'd love

1471
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,550
to put the blame solely

1472
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,550
on Dr. Grainer,

1473
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,110
but more than one bad actor

1474
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,110
failed Buddy.

1475
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,720
What do you mean?

1476
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,730
He's gonna die

1477
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,730
from one of the most

1478
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,730
survivable cancers.

1479
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,630
With early intervention,

1480
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,630
this was treatable.

1481
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,630
It shouldn't be killing him.

1482
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,370
Our system failed Buddy,

1483
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,440
and it fails people

1484
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,440
just like him every day,

1485
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,670
because the people

1486
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,670
who need us

1487
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,670
the most

1488
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,870
never even make it

1489
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,870
through our doors.

1490
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,870
Until it's too late.

1491
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,540
When did we

1492
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,540
decide that's okay?

1493
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,980
That that's just

1494
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,980
the way it is?

1495
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,620
It can't be.

1496
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm not gonna let it.
