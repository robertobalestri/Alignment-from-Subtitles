1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,600
Told him I needed dialysis.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,600
Left it pretty vague.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a good thing you

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,000
told him, though.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,000
Not just for his sake.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,600
Hey, Grace. Over here.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,300
Word is she's single.

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,380
Maybe I could buy you

9
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,380
a cup of coffee.

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,710
What about a drink instead?

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,310
We can help a lot more people

12
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,680
with Jack's vision

13
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,680
and money in our corner.

14
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,150
Dayton says from now on, 2.0

15
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,150
is for paying customers only.

16
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,250
When Jack wants something,

17
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,250
he can be like a dog

18
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,250
after a bone.

19
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,520
Yeah, well, that has

20
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,520
been my impression as well.

21
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,220
Ooh!

22
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,560
Who are the flowers from?

23
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,600
Guess.

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,740
Your not-so-secret admirer,

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,740
Dr. George Thomas.

26
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,550
Oh, orchids.

27
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,050
The man's refined.

28
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,050
No.

29
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,350
The man is persistent.

30
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,520
Come on. Tell me you're not

31
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,520
a little bit flattered.

32
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,560
Well, it's a bit much,

33
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,560
don't you think?

34
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,030
I think George has a crush.

35
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,260
Well, I think he needs

36
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,260
to take a hint.

37
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,130
He's asked me out

38
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,130
for drinks again.

39
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,690
Why won't you go?

40
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,690
He's on the board, Maggie.

41
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,260
You work here every day.

42
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,260
Where else you supposed

43
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,260
to meet somebody?

44
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,670
Well, I just think

45
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,670
it's not a good idea

46
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,510
to mix business with pleasure.

47
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,710
Fine. Sure, but when has that

48
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,710
ever worked for anyone?

49
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,610
I mean, take the ED,

50
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,610
for example.

51
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,690
You've got Ethan and April.

52
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,690
You've got Will and Natalie.

53
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,450
You've got Will and Hannah.

54
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,750
You got Will and--

55
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,750
Okay, all right.

56
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,120
Spare me the update

57
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,120
on Dr. Halstead's love life.

58
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,420
There could be...

59
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,420
Go to work.

60
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,290
Goodwin and--

61
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,290
Bye.

62
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,170
I'm surprised you've got

63
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,170
the guts to show your face

64
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,170
this morning,

65
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,070
305 to 146.

66
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,610
Glad to see last night's win

67
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,610
didn't go to your head.

68
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,140
Did you memorize

69
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,140
our Scrabble scores?

70
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,580
Do you think

71
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,580
it's some kind of record?

72
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,410
Largest spread ever recorded.

73
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,540
Well, someone's extra snarky

74
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,540
this morning.

75
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,240
What's in that thermos?

76
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,750
Well, there were four shots of

77
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,750
espresso. It's empty now.

78
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,520
Whoa!

79
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,520
Where's the fire?

80
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,650
My pilot program

81
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,650
launches today.

82
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,460
That's right. I totally forgot

83
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,460
about the big day.

84
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,320
The ED gets

85
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,320
a technological facelift.

86
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,090
New software,

87
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,090
diagnostic tools,

88
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,790
system upgrades.

89
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,170
Be honest.

90
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,170
People are not gonna

91
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,170
like all the changes, right?

92
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,370
They'll be resistant.

93
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,370
Of course they will be.

94
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,780
At first, but once

95
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,780
they give it a shot...

96
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,610
They're gonna see

97
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,610
the tech is gonna help them

98
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,610
with their work

99
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,380
and work better and work

100
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,380
for them and not against them.

101
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,540
And you can tell I've had

102
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,540
four shots of espresso

103
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,540
on an empty stomach.

104
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,380
Yes. Let's get you a muffin.

105
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,380
Yes, let's.

106
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,290
A blueberry muffin,

107
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,290
chai latte.

108
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,720
Okay. Yeah, sure.

109
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,420
Grace?

110
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,420
Mmm-hmm.

111
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,550
Grace.

112
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,550
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

113
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,860
Thanks. Come here.

114
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,430
Hey, look.

115
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,800
You've been helping me do my

116
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,800
job better since you got here.

117
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,530
Today's gonna go great.

118
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,640
Thank you.

119
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,480
I...

120
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,280
couldn't help it.

121
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,750
No need to help it.

122
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,820
That was a close one.

123
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,820
Thank you so much.

124
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,330
I appreciate it. Lifesaver.

125
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,330
Have a good day.

126
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,490
Hey, got your own

127
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,490
personal valet now, hotshot?

128
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,760
Your son is a lifesaver.

129
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,760
Apparently, my car

130
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,760
was about to be towed,

131
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,600
and he offered

132
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,600
to move it for me.

133
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,600
That's the least he could do.

134
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,830
What do you mean?

135
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,570
You've take him

136
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,570
under your wing.

137
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,570
You set him up with a sponsor.

138
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,370
You sent that valet gig

139
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,370
his way.

140
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,880
You've been

141
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,880
a really positive influence.

142
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,880
And now that

143
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,880
I've laid it on thick,

144
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,240
can I ask a favor?

145
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,510
Should've seen that coming.

146
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,610
I need an attending

147
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,610
to cover for me next week

148
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,610
at a department meeting,

149
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,380
and you're the only one

150
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,380
around here I trust.

151
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,350
What's going on?

152
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,720
So I'm being evaluated

153
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,720
for the transplant list.

154
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,630
Dr. Cameron feels it's time

155
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,630
seeing as I'm officially

156
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,930
in end stage renal disease.

157
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,970
Dean, I'm sorry.

158
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,430
And the kicker is,

159
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,430
even if I get on the list,

160
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,410
it might not be an easy match.

161
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,410
I've got this high CPRA.

162
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,720
What about Sean?

163
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,720
Isn't he getting tested?

164
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,310
No, that's not an option.

165
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,610
But he would be

166
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,610
your best possible

167
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,610
donor match.

168
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,780
Yeah, Sean needs to focus

169
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,780
on his own health now,

170
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,780
not mine.

171
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,830
Sean's coming up

172
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,830
on one year of being sober.

173
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,390
He's in a really good place.

174
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,260
Donating could be a really

175
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,260
positive experience for him.

176
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,960
I'm not taking

177
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,960
my son's kidney, Hannah.

178
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,790
Dean--

179
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,790
Incoming!

180
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,700
Dr. Archer, you're with me.

181
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,700
Yeah.

182
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,700
I'm right there.

183
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,700
It's your son.

184
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,330
He should be given

185
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,330
the opportunity to help

186
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,330
if he wants to.

187
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,340
I don't mean

188
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,340
to be patronizing, but

189
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,680
you'll get it

190
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,680
when you have a kid.

191
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,270
Going to T3.

192
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,350
Kurt Leger. 36-year-old male.

193
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,610
Was ejected

194
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,610
from his wheelchair.

195
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,880
Fell down a flight of stairs.

196
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,880
Vitals are stable.

197
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,550
My wheel got caught

198
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,550
in an uneven tile.

199
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,720
And I went flying.

200
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm okay, though, really.

201
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,520
Just knocked

202
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,520
the wind out of me.

203
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,360
How long you been

204
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,360
in a wheelchair?

205
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,360
Huh?

206
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,400
How long have you been

207
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,400
in a wheelchair?

208
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,560
Told us he's got

209
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,560
a T-10 spinal cord injury.

210
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,260
Got bucked off a horse

211
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,260
in high school.

212
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,030
Is this a complete injury,

213
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,030
Kurt, or is this paralysis

214
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,030
from the waist down?

215
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,670
Waist down, yeah.

216
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,670
Okay.

217
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,740
On my count. One, two, three.

218
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, God. Okay.

219
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,610
Okay.

220
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,680
Okay, breath sounds clear

221
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,680
bilaterally.

222
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,920
Okay.

223
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,920
Let's take this board out.

224
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,590
Kurt, we're gonna roll you

225
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,590
over for just a moment, okay?

226
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,790
Okay.

227
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,960
All right.

228
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,930
Ow!

229
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,970
All right, let's hold off

230
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,970
on clearing C-spine just yet.

231
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,700
Give him 100 of fentanyl.

232
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,700
That'll help take

233
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,700
the edge off.

234
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,470
Okay. And we'll

235
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,470
be back shortly.

236
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,380
You were pressing

237
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,380
way below T-10.

238
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,710
How could he feel that?

239
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,790
Well, no clue.

240
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,790
Could be referred pain.

241
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,750
We'll know more

242
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,750
once we see imaging.

243
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,760
Has trauma ever reversed

244
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,760
permanent paralysis?

245
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,990
What, from a complete

246
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,990
spinal cord injury?

247
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,990
No. No, never. No.

248
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,470
Hello. Good morning.

249
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,840
Hey there.

250
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,840
Hi.

251
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,510
Please sit.

252
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,850
Sit.

253
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,850
Okay.

254
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,480
I have news. Big news.

255
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,850
Ooh! How exciting.

256
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,560
My coworker, Vanna...

257
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,360
She's moving to Florida

258
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,360
to live with her daughter.

259
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,790
Yeah, you remember. Good.

260
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,790
Yeah.

261
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,590
Well, I might buy her house.

262
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,530
Wow.

263
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,870
Yeah.

264
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,870
Okay.

265
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,800
It is small, but it's just me.

266
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,770
So it will be perfect.

267
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,080
And, I mean, that's great.

268
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,080
Yeah.

269
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,810
And you can afford it,

270
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,810
I mean, obviously.

271
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,380
Well, I will have to use

272
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,380
all of my savings

273
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,380
for the downpayment

274
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,550
and take out a mortgage,

275
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,550
but I can do it.

276
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,920
And Vanna is offering it

277
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,920
to me off market

278
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,920
for a very fair price.

279
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,520
Well, that's so exciting.

280
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,100
You know

281
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,100
it's a fair price because

282
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,530
you looked at some comps

283
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,530
in the neighborhood?

284
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,730
Comps?

285
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,730
Comparable properties.

286
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,800
Comps, yes. Well, no.

287
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,100
I haven't yet, but I will.

288
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,100
No, not yet.

289
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,800
Yeah.

290
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,800
And I trust Vanna.

291
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,670
Yeah.

292
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,510
You don't think this is

293
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,510
a good idea.

294
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,940
Oh, gosh, I don't mean

295
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,940
to give that impression

296
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,940
at all.

297
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,180
I don't.

298
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,180
Okay.

299
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,180
I just think, you know,

300
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,180
you have to be...

301
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,920
I don't know, always when you

302
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,920
make a big move like this,

303
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,890
you gotta ask the question,

304
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,890
is now the best time to buy?

305
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,690
You know, and if you're

306
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,690
gonna wipe out your savings

307
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,420
for the downpayment,

308
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,420
I mean, maintenance issues

309
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,420
will come along.

310
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,520
You might want

311
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,520
to do a renovation.

312
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,520
You just gotta make sure...

313
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,030
Hey, look, I really--

314
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,830
I don't mean to be a downer

315
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,830
about this at all.

316
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,430
I really don't.

317
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,430
No, it's okay.

318
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,130
There's a lot to think about.

319
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,500
I'm still thinking about it.

320
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,500
Okay.

321
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,040
You want to go somewhere

322
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,040
and talk about it some more?

323
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,670
Get a cup of coffee

324
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,670
or something?

325
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,180
I can't. I have errands

326
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,180
to run. And I will

327
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,180
see you later, Daniel.

328
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,610
Okay.

329
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,480
Hey, congrats.

330
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,850
Congrats.

331
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,460
The new system automatically

332
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,460
updates room availability

333
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,620
and displays room assignments

334
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,620
on all the monitors.

335
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,130
Maggie, now you won't have

336
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,130
someone asking you

337
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,130
every two minutes,

338
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,220
"Where am I going?"

339
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,220
No, that'll still happen.

340
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,630
Okay, everybody.

341
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,630
Let's get back to work.

342
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,630
Thank you very much.

343
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,070
No, no, it won't happen

344
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,070
because now they can just

345
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,070
look at the monitors--

346
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,500
I understand that they can,

347
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,500
but will they?

348
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,580
These folks are creatures

349
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,580
of habit.

350
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,510
Well, it'll become habit

351
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,510
over time.

352
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,810
Okay, well tell me more

353
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,810
about these lights.

354
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,250
Are they part of

355
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,250
a room triage system?

356
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,110
So no, these

357
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,110
are actually noise sensors.

358
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,120
They monitor volume levels

359
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,120
throughout the ED.

360
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,920
When it gets too loud,

361
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,920
they start flashing.

362
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,050
What happens when they do?

363
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,130
Noise police just pops out?

364
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,130
Oh.

365
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,720
Well, no. Hopefully

366
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,720
it's a gentle reminder

367
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,560
to anyone in the vicinity

368
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,560
to lower their voice.

369
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, I'm--

370
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,000
Research shows

371
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,600
that excessive noise

372
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,600
in the emergency room

373
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,770
increases patients'

374
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,770
stress and anxiety,

375
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,770
raises their cortisol levels.

376
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,180
Well, I'm for the reminder

377
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,180
to the staff

378
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,270
that they must keep

379
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,270
unnecessary noise

380
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,270
at a minimum.

381
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,150
I mean, it's what

382
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,150
I do every day.

383
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,280
Which you shouldn't have to.

384
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,280
You got enough

385
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,280
on your plate, Maggie.

386
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,250
Adults should be able to

387
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,250
self-monitor with a simple

388
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,250
visual cue, right?

389
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,250
I guess, Grace. We'll see.

390
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,230
Hello, Ms. Palmer.

391
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,230
It's Alicia.

392
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,630
Hi, Alicia. I'm Dr. Halstead.

393
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,100
I see you've been experiencing

394
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,100
frequent headaches lately.

395
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,170
Yeah, two to three a week

396
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,170
for the last month.

397
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,870
The one I'm currently having

398
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,870
is the longest so far.

399
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,310
Going on 29 hours.

400
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,300
This should all be

401
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,300
in my chart.

402
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,080
I gave the nurse

403
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,080
a record of my attacks.

404
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,170
Yes, I'm seeing that here.

405
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,220
And a list of conditions

406
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,220
and diseases that include

407
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,220
my symptoms.

408
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,810
I'm obviously not a doctor.

409
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm not trying

410
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,720
to insult your intelligence.

411
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,120
No offense taken.

412
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,990
I just read that people get

413
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,990
misdiagnosed in the emergency

414
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,990
room every year.

415
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,690
Well, I can tell you

416
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,690
a misdiagnosis tends to happen

417
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,100
when a patient's presentation

418
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,100
is atypical.

419
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,100
Yes, that is

420
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,100
what the article said.

421
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,670
But here at Med,

422
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,670
we've actually got a new--

423
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,760
well, really new, like,

424
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,760
as of today--

425
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,760
AI-based diagnostic tool

426
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,710
that helps us make sure

427
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,710
we don't miss anything.

428
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,570
There's a lot more to it,

429
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,570
but the gist is

430
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,200
it creates a differential

431
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,200
for the doctor to compare

432
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,200
against their own.

433
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,680
Differential. That's the list

434
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,680
of things that could be

435
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,680
wrong with me, right?

436
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,690
So it's like having

437
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,690
a colleague

438
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,690
double-check your work.

439
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,090
A colleague that scans

440
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,090
every medical database

441
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,090
and journal in an instant.

442
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,920
Okay, yeah. Let's

443
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,920
definitely use the robot.

444
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,030
Well, because we're

445
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,030
in the pilot phase still,

446
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,600
I'm gonna need you

447
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,600
to sign a consent form.

448
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,730
I'll grab it

449
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,730
and be right back.

450
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,730
Thanks.

451
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,940
I'm sorry

452
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,940
I didn't put on the gown.

453
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,940
I know I'm supposed to,

454
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,980
but it would take me forever

455
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,980
at the moment.

456
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,010
I'll cut you some slack.

457
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,740
I'm also kind of hoping

458
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,740
this won't take long.

459
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,820
Ryan has had

460
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,820
perfect attendance all year.

461
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,080
Well as an alumna of

462
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,080
the perfect attendance club,

463
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,810
I will do my best

464
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,810
to get you both out the door.

465
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,290
So, Sarah, you got dizzy

466
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,290
driving to school today?

467
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,880
For, like, a few seconds.

468
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,880
Yeah, I pulled over

469
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,790
to study myself for a moment.

470
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,790
And then I felt fine.

471
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,030
But my worrywart over here

472
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,190
begged me to turn around

473
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,190
and come here.

474
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,630
She gets dizzy a lot.

475
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,360
Sometimes she has trouble

476
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,360
catching her breath.

477
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,300
I have to park on the street.

478
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,280
I get a little winded

479
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,280
sometimes walking from

480
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,280
our apartment to the car.

481
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,810
Every day?

482
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,750
I tried to explain

483
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,750
to Ryan it's normal.

484
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,710
Well, your ankles are swollen.

485
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,220
And your breathing still seems

486
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,220
a bit labored, even at rest.

487
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,220
Yeah, I had swollen ankles

488
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,220
and I was panting all the time

489
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,850
when I was this big with Ryan

490
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,850
too. Just ask my ex.

491
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,050
Oh, wait. He's nowhere

492
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,050
to be found.

493
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,330
Well, these all could be

494
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,330
symptoms of third trimester

495
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,330
pregnancy, I agree,

496
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,330
but I'd still like to do

497
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,330
a full workup just to be safe.

498
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,770
I've got an appointment

499
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,770
with by OB on Monday.

500
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,900
I'd really prefer if we

501
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,900
could just check you out now.

502
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,070
Mom, look at this text

503
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,070
you got from Ms. Goto.

504
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,800
It says as long as I get back

505
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,800
before lunch is over,

506
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,380
it won't mess up my record.

507
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,080
So let the doctor

508
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,080
run tests and stuff, please.

509
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,020
Okay, okay. Yes, run

510
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,020
all the tests and stuff.

511
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,390
Hey, I'm just fine.

512
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,890
We'll make sure

513
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,890
your baby sister

514
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,890
is feeling good, okay?

515
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,360
Dr. Archer,

516
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,360
Kurt Leger's scans are up.

517
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,760
Okay.

518
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,300
Yeah, unstable burst fracture

519
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,300
at T-12 from the fall today.

520
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,370
What?

521
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,810
Well, it isn't

522
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,810
a medical miracle

523
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,810
he's got feeling below T-10.

524
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,210
What do you mean?

525
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,080
Well, no evidence of

526
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,080
prior trauma at the vertebrae.

527
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,820
Yeah, this guy's

528
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,820
not paralyzed.

529
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,720
Kurt.

530
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,390
Wanted to review your imaging.

531
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,960
To start with,

532
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,940
you don't have an injury

533
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,940
at T-10.

534
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,780
I'm guessing

535
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,780
this isn't news to you.

536
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,240
Do I need to repeat that?

537
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,320
I didn't think

538
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,320
the scans would--

539
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,320
What, blow your cover?

540
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,420
Okay, but what's really

541
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,420
pressing--

542
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,450
I'm not trying

543
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,450
to get disability benefits

544
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,450
or better parking.

545
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,990
That's not why.

546
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,990
Sure, sure.

547
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,920
Of course, yeah.

548
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,920
I don't want you to think--

549
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,290
Hey, it really doesn't matter

550
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,290
what I think.

551
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,090
What does matter:

552
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,090
your tumble today

553
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,260
caused an unstable

554
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,260
burst fracture

555
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,260
in your T-12 vertebrae,

556
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,170
and that's gonna

557
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,170
require surgery to fix.

558
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,970
And without surgery?

559
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,230
There really is

560
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,230
not another option.

561
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,970
If your fracture was stable,

562
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,770
I would say

563
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,770
you can try a brace.

564
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,970
No, no, I'm not asking

565
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,970
about other options.

566
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,510
If I don't treat this,

567
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,510
what will happen?

568
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,110
You're gonna end up

569
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,110
actually needing a wheelchair.

570
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,250
You're gonna be looking

571
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,250
at weeks in bed.

572
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,420
Chronic back pain.

573
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,420
Weakness in

574
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,420
one or both of your legs.

575
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,520
Numbness.

576
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,390
Even paralysis.

577
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,400
I don't want the surgery.

578
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,450
So I really appreciate you

579
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,450
giving me access to your

580
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,450
psychiatric records.

581
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,040
It's very helpful.

582
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,040
Of course.

583
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,410
How about I just, you know,

584
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,410
give you my understanding

585
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,410
of what I read,

586
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,080
and then you let me know

587
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,080
if I missed anything.

588
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,280
Does that sound okay?

589
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,890
All right,

590
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,890
so you were diagnosed

591
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,090
with body integrity identity

592
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,090
disorder eight years ago

593
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,950
but experienced symptoms

594
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,950
from early childhood.

595
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,000
Since I was

596
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,000
at least five, yeah.

597
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,930
And for you,

598
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,930
BIID presents itself

599
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,100
in the form of a very strong

600
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,100
desire to be paralyzed?

601
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,300
It's all I think about.

602
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,240
It dominates

603
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,240
every aspect of my life.

604
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,470
But it seems like

605
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,420
a wheelchair gave you

606
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,420
some relief.

607
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,950
Some, but I can

608
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,950
still feel my legs.

609
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,420
And for reasons

610
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,420
I can't explain,

611
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,510
that's an extremely

612
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,510
distressing feeling.

613
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,900
I've had therapists tell me

614
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,900
it's due to repressed

615
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,900
childhood trauma,

616
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,400
neurologists who think

617
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,400
it's a glitch

618
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,400
in my cerebral cortex.

619
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,300
A psychic told me

620
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,300
it was linked to a past life.

621
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,130
Right. Yeah, I mean,

622
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,130
I can see that you've tried

623
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,370
a number of different

624
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,370
therapeutic approaches here--

625
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,100
you know,

626
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,100
kind of behavioral therapy,

627
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,480
antidepressants,

628
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,480
muscle relaxants.

629
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,550
Even hypnosis.

630
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,310
Nothing's worked.

631
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,410
I wish I had something

632
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,410
special in my toolkit for you,

633
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,250
but, I mean, frankly,

634
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,250
these are all the therapies

635
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,220
I would recommend myself.

636
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,220
Must be very frustrating

637
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,220
for you.

638
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,090
Yeah.

639
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,620
And honestly,

640
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,530
today's the most hopeful

641
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,530
I've felt

642
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,530
in a really long time.

643
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,200
I want the tests.

644
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,080
Okay.

645
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,140
Hey, Grace, you got a sec?

646
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,140
Hey.

647
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,180
So I don't know if there's,

648
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,180
like, a formal suggestion box

649
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,350
during this pilot phase.

650
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,360
I'm the suggestion box.

651
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,360
What's up?

652
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,960
New software.

653
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,120
It included

654
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,120
giant cell arteritis

655
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,120
in my patient's differential.

656
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,290
Your patient

657
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,290
with the headaches.

658
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,490
Exactly.

659
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,490
GCA's pretty rare.

660
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,540
It presents in five

661
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,540
out of every

662
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,540
10,000 people, I think.

663
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,000
And testing for it requires

664
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,000
a number of expensive labs.

665
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,440
The patient's insurance

666
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,440
is gonna cover it,

667
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,100
but I don't like

668
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,100
ordering unnecessary tests.

669
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,270
I prefer to rule out horses

670
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,270
before chasing zebras.

671
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,350
Of course, but you

672
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,350
don't have to order the labs.

673
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,640
A doctor can override

674
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,640
any suggestion

675
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,640
on the differential.

676
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,010
Right, but before

677
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,010
the doctor can do that,

678
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,950
the differential's

679
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,950
automatically uploaded

680
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,950
to the patient's chart.

681
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,350
Which the patient

682
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,350
can view in real time

683
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,120
by logging in

684
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,120
to the online portal.

685
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,290
Which my patient did.

686
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,450
And now, she's insisting

687
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,450
I order all these

688
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,450
unnecessary labs.

689
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,400
So your suggestion is

690
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,400
to lose automatic upload,

691
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,660
which we can't because

692
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,660
when the patient signs

693
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,660
the consent form,

694
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,700
they're guaranteed access

695
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,700
to the full results.

696
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,040
Ah, I see.

697
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,540
Well, you know what?

698
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,540
Better safe than sorry.

699
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,110
Right?

700
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,110
Yeah.

701
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,120
Absolutely, and it'll ease

702
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,120
the patient's mind too.

703
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,620
Well, let me know

704
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,620
how it turns out.

705
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,320
Hello, Baylin.

706
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,320
Remember me, Maggie?

707
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,520
Baylin drove himself to

708
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,520
the ED because he feels

709
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,520
like his heart is pounding.

710
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,620
I'm sorry to hear that.

711
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,290
You want to take

712
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,290
a walk with me, okay?

713
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,730
We're going right down here

714
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,730
to three.

715
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,160
Thanks, Leah.

716
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,530
Is the CIA following me?

717
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,400
I think I saw one of them

718
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,400
in the waiting area.

719
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,100
But I can't be sure.

720
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,100
He's always changing

721
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,100
his appearance.

722
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,610
All right, I won't let anyone

723
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,610
come into your room

724
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,610
without your permission.

725
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,610
Trini here is gonna help you

726
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,610
get situated.

727
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,770
Hi, Baylin.

728
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,280
Why don't you take a seat

729
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,280
on the bed? I'll grab a gown.

730
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,220
Trini.

731
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,220
Yeah?

732
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,490
Baylin's a frequent flier

733
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,490
with schizophrenia

734
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,750
with a complex PTSD,

735
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,530
- and psych's backed up.

736
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,530
- Got it.

737
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
Do you mind keeping

738
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
him company for a bit?

739
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,600
Not at all.

740
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,600
Thank you.

741
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,160
Hi.

742
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,330
Hi, Sarah.

743
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,330
This is Dr. Marcel.

744
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,430
Hi.

745
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,430
Hey, Sarah.

746
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,370
Um, I see surgery

747
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,370
on your scrubs,

748
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,370
Dr. Marcel,

749
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,210
and it's making me nervous.

750
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,040
Well, I tend to have

751
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,040
that effect on people.

752
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,810
Well, Sarah, before we

753
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,810
go over your results,

754
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,380
we were gonna see if Ryan here

755
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,380
wanted to go to the rec room.

756
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,390
There's all kinds

757
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,390
of video games

758
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,390
and snacks down there.

759
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,720
Yeah, that's a great idea.

760
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,720
Why don't you

761
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,720
check it out, kiddo?

762
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,590
No, I'm staying with you.

763
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,490
Ryan, this is a conversation

764
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,490
between grown-ups.

765
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,160
I'll be quiet. I promise.

766
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,270
It's just us two.

767
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,270
There's no keeping

768
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,270
anything from him anyway.

769
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,500
Go ahead.

770
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,540
Okay, so I asked Dr. Marcel

771
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,540
to consult

772
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,310
because your echocardiogram

773
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,310
revealed you have a condition

774
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,410
called peripartum

775
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,410
cardiomyopathy, or PPCM.

776
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,210
It's often missed,

777
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,210
because as you experienced,

778
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,290
it mimics the symptoms

779
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,290
of pregnancy.

780
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,480
So, Ryan, it's really good

781
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,480
that you brought

782
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,480
your mom in today.

783
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,650
Great job, buddy.

784
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,750
That's heart disease,

785
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,750
isn't it?

786
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,760
It is.

787
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,760
Yours is a very rare form

788
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,560
that can occur

789
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,560
at the end of pregnancy

790
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,300
or shortly after giving birth.

791
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,500
Now, I reviewed your echo

792
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,500
with Dr. Asher,

793
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,370
and we can treat you

794
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,370
with medicine.

795
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,700
Oh, thank goodness.

796
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,640
We will have to

797
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,640
admit you overnight.

798
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,410
Wait. To the hospital?

799
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,740
We'll start you

800
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,740
on medications to help

801
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,740
your heart function better

802
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,210
and get rid of any fluid

803
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,210
that's causing discomfort.

804
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,790
If I'm just taking medication,

805
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,790
why can't I do that at home?

806
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,750
Well, it's recommended

807
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,750
that you stay in the hospital

808
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,750
for monitoring

809
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,120
and so you can rest,

810
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,190
at least until the acute

811
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,190
symptoms subside.

812
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,550
I can't.

813
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,150
I don't have anyone

814
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,150
to watch Ryan, and...

815
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,230
I really can't afford

816
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,230
a hospital stay right now.

817
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,860
I'm saving up to send Ryan

818
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,860
to private school next year.

819
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,690
Speaking of, kiddo,

820
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,690
we gotta get you to school.

821
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,640
Lunch period

822
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,640
is gonna be over soon.

823
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,870
Mom, I don't care.

824
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,540
What do you mean

825
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,540
you don't care?

826
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,200
This kid

827
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,200
has perfect attendance.

828
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,200
And if he keeps it up,

829
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,250
he is gonna get an award

830
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,250
at the end of the year.

831
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,540
Stop it, Mom! I don't care

832
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,540
about the stupid award!

833
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,640
Hey, you don't speak

834
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,640
to me like that.

835
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,550
Just get me the prescription

836
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,550
so I can leave.

837
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
I really can't recommend that.

838
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
I understand.

839
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,790
Please get me

840
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,790
the prescriptions.

841
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,490
I know we've had disagreements

842
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,490
in the past

843
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,940
around this topic,

844
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,940
but this is a no-brainer.

845
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,730
This guy

846
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,730
wants to be paralyzed.

847
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,540
How can he have

848
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,540
decisional capacity?

849
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,910
Well, because like a vast

850
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,910
majority of people with BIID,

851
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,910
he's aware

852
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,910
and oriented, right?

853
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,450
He understands

854
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,450
the risks of the surgery

855
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,450
as well as the alternatives.

856
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,380
You know, he's of sound mind.

857
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,380
Sound mind?

858
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,510
What about the fact

859
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,510
that he flung himself

860
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,510
down the stairs?

861
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,950
No evidence that the fall

862
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,950
was intentional.

863
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,950
Come on, man.

864
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,950
How could there not be?

865
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,290
Well, according

866
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,290
to the paramedics,

867
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,290
there were several witnesses

868
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,660
who confirmed it was an

869
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,660
accident. Not to mention,

870
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,390
no history of self-harm

871
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,390
or reckless behavior.

872
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,590
Actually was able

873
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,590
to get ahold of his shrink

874
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,730
who assured me

875
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,730
he never even considered

876
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,930
trying to paralyze himself.

877
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,760
Well, maybe he just never

878
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,760
discussed it.

879
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,970
Dean.

880
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,970
Yeah?

881
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,340
Even if the fall were

882
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,340
intentional, we still can't

883
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,340
force a surgery on him.

884
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,850
No, but a court order could.

885
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,940
But we don't have the grounds

886
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,940
to petition a judge, right?

887
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,480
Because he competent.

888
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,950
I don't like it either, okay?

889
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,280
But he has the right

890
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,280
to refuse the surgery.

891
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,450
Okay, all right.

892
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,450
And once again,

893
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,450
you're keeping my patients

894
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,220
from getting the care

895
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,220
they need.

896
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,760
Hey, so what gives?

897
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,800
What are you talking about?

898
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,630
You didn't see

899
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,630
this impromptu board meeting

900
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,290
added to your calendar?

901
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,370
I mean, do you have any idea

902
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,370
what this is about?

903
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,870
I didn't even know

904
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,870
it was happening.

905
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,910
Okay, well, it's an impromptu

906
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,910
meeting with the entire board,

907
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,910
plus C-suite, okay?

908
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,310
I mean, that can't be good.

909
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,680
Look, I don't like

910
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,680
being blindsided either,

911
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,010
but don't get all fatalistic.

912
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,980
Yeah, well, when I talked

913
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,980
to Jack about it,

914
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,810
he wouldn't share any details,

915
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,810
and he told me not to worry.

916
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,910
That makes me worry.

917
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,980
Well, you're in fairly

918
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,980
regular contact with

919
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,980
his lawyers, aren't you?

920
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,560
Well, see if he has any

921
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,560
significant filings in motion,

922
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,460
and I'll put a call out

923
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,460
to George.

924
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,330
Maybe he has some intel.

925
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,600
George?

926
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, Dr. Thomas,

927
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,000
our newest board member.

928
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,370
Yeah, I didn't realize

929
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,370
that you and George

930
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,370
were getting so chummy.

931
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,380
I'll go find

932
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,380
some other business

933
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,380
to stick my nose into.

934
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,420
Red light.

935
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,590
Red light! The CIA's found me!

936
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,590
The signals are moving!

937
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,820
They're gonna be here

938
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,820
any minute.

939
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,420
Let's get back in bed, okay?

940
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,420
No.

941
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,690
They flash the red lights

942
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,690
when they got you cornered

943
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,690
like a rat.

944
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,070
That's their signal

945
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,070
to move in!

946
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,070
Maggie, I could use a hand.

947
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,900
No, no, no, no.

948
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,900
Baylin. Baylin,

949
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,900
I need you to calm down.

950
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,030
Breathe. Breathe.

951
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,030
I need you to breathe.

952
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,330
These lights, I'm turning

953
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,330
them off right now.

954
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,570
I'm turning them off.

955
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,570
Yeah, I'm sorry!

956
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,810
I have to go!

957
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,810
Baylin.

958
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,010
Baylin. Baylin. Security,

959
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,010
They're gonna kill me!

960
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,950
stop him from leaving

961
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,950
right now.

962
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,480
Page Dr. Charles.

963
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,450
Let me go! Let me go!

964
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,890
I gotta go, please.

965
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,090
Looks like our old buddy,

966
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,090
Baylin, went off his meds

967
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,090
a couple weeks ago.

968
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,530
Good news, he's agreed

969
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,530
to check into the psych ward

970
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,660
for a couple of days

971
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,660
until he gets back on regimen.

972
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,740
Great.

973
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,740
So these are what set him off?

974
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,630
And why were

975
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,630
they installed again?

976
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,330
To make patients

977
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,330
more comfortable.

978
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,500
The genius of Jack Dayton.

979
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,500
They got to go.

980
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,650
Mmm-hmm.

981
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,910
Maggie, I heard what happened.

982
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,640
So you'll understand

983
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,640
why I want the lights removed.

984
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,090
Red was a poor color choice.

985
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,520
I'll reprogram the lights

986
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,520
to something

987
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,520
more neutral tonight.

988
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,980
I want them gone,

989
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,980
please, Grace.

990
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,460
Not reprogrammed. Just gone.

991
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,790
You agreed that monitoring

992
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,790
noise levels in the ED

993
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,130
is important for patient care.

994
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,730
And I do

995
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,730
a damn good job of it.

996
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,740
I'm not suggesting

997
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,740
that you're not.

998
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,740
I don't need any assistance.

999
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,630
So good news.

1000
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,630
All your labs

1001
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,630
came back normal.

1002
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,470
Your ESR was mildly elevated,

1003
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,380
but that's nothing to be

1004
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,380
concerned about.

1005
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,780
What is ESR?

1006
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,780
What does it test for?

1007
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,780
Erythrocyte

1008
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,780
sedimentation rate.

1009
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,380
It measures inflammatory

1010
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,380
activity in the body.

1011
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,720
And mine's elevated?

1012
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,720
Mildly.

1013
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,790
And it can be elevated

1014
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,790
for a number of reasons.

1015
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,480
I mean, something like

1016
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,480
stubbing your toe will do it.

1017
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,430
What if you have--

1018
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,430
what is it called--

1019
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,590
giant cell...

1020
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,590
Arteritis.

1021
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,130
Right. Would your ESR

1022
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,130
be elevated then?

1023
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,030
Yes, but much higher

1024
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,030
than yours.

1025
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,430
How much higher?

1026
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,160
Off the top of my head,

1027
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,160
I believe,

1028
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,770
typically 50 or above.

1029
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,710
And mine was 31.

1030
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,710
Correct.

1031
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,540
And you never see GCA

1032
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,540
in a patient with an ESR

1033
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,540
below 50?

1034
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,910
There have been cases,

1035
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,910
similar ones,

1036
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,810
but those patients all had

1037
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,810
symptoms of the condition

1038
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,810
you do not have.

1039
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,010
It's far more likely

1040
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,010
you have a headache disorder.

1041
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,920
I suspect migraines

1042
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,920
or cluster headaches.

1043
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,510
I'd like to refer you

1044
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,510
to a specialist--

1045
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1046
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,820
Your system says here,

1047
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,820
if it is GCA,

1048
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,920
it should be treated

1049
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,920
right away to prevent...

1050
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,930
vision loss or a stroke?

1051
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,560
It could be weeks

1052
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,560
before I see a specialist.

1053
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,160
Alicia, the gold standard

1054
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,160
for diagnosing GCA

1055
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,130
is a temporal artery biopsy.

1056
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,430
Neurosurgeon makes an incision

1057
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,430
above your temple

1058
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,030
and removes a piece

1059
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,030
of your blood vessel.

1060
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,030
A surgeon?

1061
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,440
Yes, we're talking

1062
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,440
about an actual procedure.

1063
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,110
But I'd be out

1064
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,110
for the whole thing.

1065
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,110
They put me to sleep, right?

1066
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,510
No, it's only used

1067
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,510
with light sedation

1068
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,510
under local anesthetic.

1069
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,850
You'd be awake the whole time.

1070
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,850
Look, I know headaches

1071
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,850
are extremely frustrating

1072
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,750
and you want answers,

1073
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,750
but let's start with giving

1074
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,750
you some relief.

1075
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,020
I'm gonna put you on triptan.

1076
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,020
It's a class of drug used--

1077
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,790
I'm not gonna feel any relief

1078
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,590
until I know definitively

1079
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,590
this isn't GCA.

1080
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,930
Alicia, it's just you have

1081
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,930
so few of the symptoms--

1082
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,800
You said misdiagnoses

1083
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,800
happen when a patient's

1084
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,800
presentation is atypical.

1085
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,700
I want the biopsy.

1086
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,910
Sarah, I really wish

1087
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,910
you'd reconsider staying.

1088
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,110
Just let me get him to school.

1089
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,180
If I have another spell,

1090
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,180
I'll come right back.

1091
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,510
Oh!

1092
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,250
Wait. Did my water just break?

1093
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,580
Let me check.

1094
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,560
Yes, it did.

1095
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,560
Okay, it is time.

1096
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,250
What? But it's so early.

1097
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,250
You're 38 weeks.

1098
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,960
Yeah. Ryan was two weeks late.

1099
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,530
Every baby comes

1100
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,530
on their own timeline.

1101
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,830
Let's get you up to labor

1102
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,830
and delivery.

1103
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,990
Wait. What about Ryan?

1104
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,990
My sister's in Michigan.

1105
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,970
It'll take her six hours

1106
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,970
to get here.

1107
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,230
Mom, I want to stay with you.

1108
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,230
No, you don't.

1109
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,630
A delivery room is no place

1110
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,630
for an 11-year-old boy.

1111
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,830
You'll be scarred for life.

1112
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,830
If it's okay with Ryan,

1113
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,040
I don't mind hanging with him

1114
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,040
here at the hospital.

1115
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,010
I don't have anywhere to be.

1116
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,010
No. No, I can't ask you

1117
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,010
to do that.

1118
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,210
You didn't. I offered.

1119
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,220
Thank you.

1120
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,220
Yeah.

1121
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,620
Hey, you listen

1122
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,620
to Dr. Marcel, okay?

1123
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,750
Okay, ready?

1124
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,750
Yeah.

1125
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,850
All right, bud.

1126
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,790
Come on.

1127
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,870
Dr. Archer, hi.

1128
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,700
I know it's not my place...

1129
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,910
But you

1130
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,910
are giving something up

1131
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,910
that you cannot get back.

1132
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,570
I understand that.

1133
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,810
And if you change your mind

1134
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,810
down the road--

1135
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,680
I'm not gonna change my mind.

1136
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,720
When you lose control

1137
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,720
of your bladder

1138
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,720
for the first time,

1139
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,850
you'll feel differently.

1140
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,090
Not to be disrespectful,

1141
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,090
but I went over all of this

1142
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,090
with Dr. Charles,

1143
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,320
and he was satisfied.

1144
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,600
Because you told him what

1145
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,600
you knew he needed to hear.

1146
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,720
Excuse me?

1147
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,720
I think you knew

1148
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,630
exactly what you were

1149
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,630
doing today.

1150
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,000
Dr. Archer,

1151
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,760
can I get a word, please?

1152
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,180
You think I don't know

1153
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,180
when I'm getting played

1154
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,180
by a patient?

1155
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,620
It wasn't a comment

1156
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,620
on your skill.

1157
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,050
Dean, what are you

1158
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,050
thinking, man?

1159
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,060
I need to remind you

1160
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,060
of all people

1161
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,060
that bullying a patient

1162
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,150
into a procedure

1163
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,150
might get you in real trouble?

1164
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,350
Somebody needed

1165
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,350
to talk some sense

1166
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,350
into this...

1167
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,250
All right, this is

1168
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,250
an unprecedented situation.

1169
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,890
No, it's not.

1170
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,890
It absolutely is.

1171
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,190
Maybe some more opinions

1172
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,190
in the mix.

1173
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,030
You want to get another

1174
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,030
psychiatrist to weigh in?

1175
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,830
I think it'd be wise.

1176
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,830
Great idea.

1177
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,270
It would cover

1178
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,270
ourselves legally.

1179
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,270
You're getting loud, Doctors.

1180
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,670
Dr. Kwon's on call.

1181
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,900
Say hi for me.

1182
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,270
All right, lidocaine

1183
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,270
and a gram of cefazolin,

1184
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,270
please. Thank you.

1185
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,820
What's that for again?

1186
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,860
It's an antibiotic to prevent

1187
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,860
infection post-procedure.

1188
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,120
Scalpel.

1189
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,350
All right, Alicia.

1190
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,350
You're gonna

1191
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,350
feel a little pressure

1192
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,820
as I make my incision, okay?

1193
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,820
Just breathe.

1194
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,300
How you doing, Alicia?

1195
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,170
Feels a little weird,

1196
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,170
but I'm okay.

1197
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,230
All right.

1198
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,230
Not too much longer, Alicia.

1199
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,000
Almost to the vessel.

1200
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,410
You're doing great.

1201
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Yeah,

1202
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,140
biopsy's nearly complete.

1203
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,010
Dr. Halstead, I--

1204
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,720
I can't...swallow.

1205
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,150
Is this from the anesthesia?

1206
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,020
No, it wouldn't affect

1207
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,020
your airway.

1208
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,150
Maybe you're just feeling

1209
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,150
a little nervous.

1210
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,150
Take a deep breath.

1211
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,690
I can't. My throat

1212
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,690
is closing in.

1213
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,330
Sats at 86%.

1214
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,330
Epi one milligram IV.

1215
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,330
125 solumedrol.

1216
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,130
I can't...

1217
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,330
Alicia, you're having

1218
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,330
an allergic reaction

1219
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,330
to something.

1220
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,270
There were no indications

1221
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,270
in her chart, right?

1222
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,200
None, and she didn't

1223
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,200
mention any allergies.

1224
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,140
I need you to keep

1225
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,140
that on for me.

1226
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,410
Where's that epi?

1227
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,080
It's right here.

1228
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,940
Okay, Alicia, hang on.

1229
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,940
You're gonna be okay.

1230
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,720
You're gonna be okay.

1231
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,990
Hey.

1232
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,990
Hey, I got your text.

1233
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,190
Sarah's baby is breech?

1234
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,860
Just scanned her

1235
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,860
a few minutes ago.

1236
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,370
If it were up to me,

1237
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,370
we'd proceed

1238
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,370
with a vaginal delivery

1239
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,870
and use pipers

1240
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,870
to pull the head out.

1241
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,740
But let me guess,

1242
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,740
Sarah wants to do a C-section

1243
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,240
because it's safer

1244
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,240
for the baby?

1245
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,900
But far riskier for Sarah,

1246
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,900
as you know, given

1247
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,900
her heart condition.

1248
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,380
I hated to pull you

1249
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,380
out of the ED,

1250
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,110
but I could really use

1251
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,110
an extra set of hands

1252
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,110
in there.

1253
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,050
Yeah, of course,

1254
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,050
I'll scrub and meet you

1255
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,050
in the OR.

1256
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,170
Great.

1257
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,010
I shouldn't have

1258
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,010
talked to her like that.

1259
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,950
Well, the thing

1260
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,950
about moms is

1261
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,960
they have this funny way of

1262
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,960
knowing what's in our hearts,

1263
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,860
even when we don't say it

1264
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,200
or if we say something

1265
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,200
we don't mean.

1266
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,060
They know better.

1267
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,190
Dr. Marcel,

1268
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,140
do you think

1269
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,140
I stress my mom out?

1270
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,940
I mean, she's always

1271
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,940
doing everything for me.

1272
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,400
Maybe that's why she's sick.

1273
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,070
No way.

1274
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,080
Look, Ryan,

1275
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,080
there's not a lot of

1276
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,080
stuff we can say

1277
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,850
with complete certainty

1278
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,850
in medicine,

1279
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,050
but this I can say

1280
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,050
with total confidence:

1281
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,350
you did nothing

1282
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,350
to cause your mom's condition.

1283
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,230
Hey, you want to get something

1284
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,230
from the gift shop there?

1285
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,830
For your mom and baby sister?

1286
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,300
My mom would like it

1287
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,770
if I wrote her a card

1288
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,770
telling her I'm sorry.

1289
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,200
Okay, then let's go. Come on.

1290
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,180
So turns out

1291
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,180
you're allergic to cefazolin.

1292
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,510
It's recorded

1293
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,510
in your chart now,

1294
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,290
but it's still something

1295
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,290
for you to be aware of.

1296
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,250
Cefazolin.

1297
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,250
Cefazolin, cefazolin.

1298
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,850
Can you tell me

1299
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,850
how to spell that?

1300
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,220
Sure. Let me know

1301
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,220
when you're ready.

1302
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,430
You know what? Never mind.

1303
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,560
Maybe I shouldn't

1304
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,560
research everything.

1305
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,200
Clearly it doesn't always

1306
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,200
lead to the best decisions.

1307
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,000
Hey, absolutely nothing wrong

1308
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,000
with wanting to be informed.

1309
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,500
You are

1310
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,500
your own best advocate.

1311
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,130
I think-- I think

1312
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,130
my headache's gone.

1313
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,570
The medicine's working.

1314
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,210
Excellent news.

1315
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,210
Yeah.

1316
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,810
Well, I'll let you

1317
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,810
get some rest.

1318
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,970
Thank you, Dr. Halstead,

1319
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,970
for everything.

1320
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,490
Hey.

1321
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,490
What's up?

1322
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,890
I heard what happened.

1323
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,890
Is your patient okay?

1324
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,480
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

1325
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,480
And the biopsy?

1326
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,320
Well, pathology

1327
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,320
won't get the results

1328
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,320
for at least a day,

1329
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,900
but Dr. Gordon said the vessel

1330
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,900
looked totally healthy.

1331
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,060
What a waste of time

1332
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,060
and resources.

1333
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,230
If you want to join me,

1334
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,230
I'm planning on paying

1335
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,230
Goodwin a visit.

1336
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,500
What do you mean? Why?

1337
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,240
To let her know what

1338
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,240
a disaster these upgrades are

1339
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,110
before they get past

1340
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,110
the pilot phase.

1341
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,240
Mags, come on.

1342
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,240
Don't you think that's

1343
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,240
overkill involving Goodwin?

1344
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,940
Will, patient care

1345
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,940
has been compromised

1346
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,490
on multiple fronts today.

1347
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,490
Not intentionally.

1348
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,490
And Grace, she's still

1349
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,490
working out the kinks.

1350
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,150
Well, I'm not trying

1351
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,150
to sabotage Grace's efforts,

1352
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,920
but I'm also

1353
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,920
not gonna stand by

1354
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,390
while Dayton tries to

1355
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,390
automate us all out of a job.

1356
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,970
Yeah?

1357
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,230
Yeah, uh...

1358
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,410
so Dr. Kwon agrees that

1359
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,410
Kurt has decisional capacity.

1360
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,880
Got it.

1361
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,880
Yeah.

1362
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,380
And he's signing the paperwork

1363
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,380
to leave AMA.

1364
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,110
Appreciate the update.

1365
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,550
So, uh...

1366
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,520
I'm tied to a dialysis machine

1367
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,520
most nights.

1368
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,320
And I'm currently

1369
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,320
being evaluated

1370
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,320
for the transplant list.

1371
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,000
I didn't know you were...

1372
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,000
That bad off?

1373
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, me neither.

1374
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,230
Yeah, and once

1375
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,230
I'm on the transplant list,

1376
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,040
I need to be within

1377
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,040
a certain radius of

1378
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,040
the hospital at all times.

1379
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,180
But suddenly my life

1380
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,180
and my plans

1381
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,510
are being dictated

1382
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,510
by my health.

1383
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,420
And so, when I see this young

1384
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,420
guy, this picture of health,

1385
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,050
willingly giving it up,

1386
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,690
I made it personal,

1387
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,420
which you already probably

1388
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,420
knew that I was doing

1389
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,590
because you're excellent

1390
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,590
at what you do, Dan.

1391
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,060
And I shouldn't have

1392
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,060
implied otherwise.

1393
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,630
All right.

1394
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,510
Hi.

1395
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,950
Oh, hey.

1396
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,040
Um...

1397
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,540
Your assistant let me in.

1398
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,540
I hope you don't mind.

1399
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,250
No, not at all, and

1400
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,250
thanks again for the flowers.

1401
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,260
They're lovely

1402
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,260
but really quite unnecessary.

1403
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,120
Sure. Mmm-hmm.

1404
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,120
Thank you.

1405
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,290
All right.

1406
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,700
I got your voicemail.

1407
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,210
Well, you know

1408
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,210
you could've just called me.

1409
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,000
You didn't have to make

1410
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,000
the trip over.

1411
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,270
Yeah.

1412
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,400
After hearing your message,

1413
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,240
I called Jack, and I asked him

1414
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,250
what this surprise

1415
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,250
board meeting was about.

1416
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,020
All right.

1417
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,460
Jack has a proposal

1418
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,460
on the table

1419
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,360
that would

1420
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,360
drastically change...

1421
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,120
Med's future.

1422
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,090
Mmm-hmm.

1423
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,530
Okay.

1424
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,040
First arm out.

1425
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,240
Towel.

1426
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,440
Here she comes.

1427
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,640
And there she is.

1428
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,410
Okay.

1429
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,750
All right, you have

1430
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,750
a beautiful baby girl, Sarah.

1431
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,620
She is so excited

1432
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,620
to meet her mama.

1433
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,170
I can't find a pulse.

1434
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,170
Her heart stopped.

1435
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,360
Pack her abdomen.

1436
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,360
I'll start compressions.

1437
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,310
Come on, Sarah.

1438
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,400
Stay with us.

1439
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,240
Charge to 200.

1440
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,710
Come on, Sarah.

1441
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,780
Come on.

1442
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,420
How's Ryan's aunt?

1443
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,260
She wanted to stay back

1444
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,260
in the nursery with the baby

1445
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,260
a bit longer.

1446
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,300
How's he doing?

1447
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,300
Yeah.

1448
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,230
About what you'd expect.

1449
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,700
Poor kid.

1450
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,310
His aunt and uncle

1451
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,310
seem really great.

1452
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,430
Mmm-hmm.

1453
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,430
Gets along

1454
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,430
with his cousins.

1455
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,140
Yeah, Ryan and

1456
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,140
his baby sister

1457
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,140
will be loved to pieces.

1458
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,340
His aunt

1459
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,340
made that very clear.

1460
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,210
Hey, walk with me.

1461
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,820
You know you did

1462
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,820
everything you could, right?

1463
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,280
Sarah's heart was worse off

1464
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,280
than we thought.

1465
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,150
Nothing we could've done

1466
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,150
to change that.

1467
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,420
Sad truth.

1468
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,630
Only thing that would've

1469
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,630
made a difference

1470
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,230
is if Sarah

1471
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,230
had come in earlier

1472
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,700
when she first started

1473
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,700
experiencing symptoms.

1474
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,640
You know, my sister,

1475
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,640
Elizabeth--Lizzy--

1476
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,580
she...

1477
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,640
She was Ryan's age

1478
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,640
when our mom died.

1479
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,680
I didn't know you lost

1480
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,680
your mom as a kid.

1481
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,260
Lizzy and Matt--

1482
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,520
that's my brother--

1483
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,220
they had it the toughest

1484
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,630
'cause they really

1485
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,630
remembered her.

1486
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,330
I never got to meet her.

1487
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,910
She died in childbirth

1488
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,910
with me.

1489
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,870
Aortic stenosis.

1490
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,870
Hmm.

1491
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,370
Undiagnosed.

1492
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,850
I'm sorry to hear that.

1493
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,750
The doctor said

1494
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,750
that he thought

1495
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,650
she was suffering

1496
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,650
with symptoms

1497
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,650
during her pregnancy

1498
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,780
but she just downplayed it.

1499
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,190
Yeah, because like Sarah,

1500
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,590
she wanted to be the best mom

1501
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,590
that she could be.

1502
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,920
To her, that meant

1503
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,920
putting her kids first

1504
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,260
and herself last.

1505
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,240
Swallowing any pain

1506
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,240
or discomfort

1507
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,500
so that she wouldn't

1508
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,500
burden her kids.

1509
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,780
And still, to this day,

1510
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,780
I am so angry at her for it.

1511
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,210
I'm so angry because

1512
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,210
I never got to have my mom.

1513
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,480
I don't get to remember her.

1514
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,550
It's okay.

1515
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,420
It's all right.

1516
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,690
It's okay.

1517
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,660
Hey, Lil.

1518
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,730
Liliana.

1519
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,730
Oh.

1520
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,340
You're still here.

1521
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,340
Yeah.

1522
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,510
I was actually...

1523
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,510
I was kind of hoping

1524
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,510
that I'd catch you.

1525
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,570
How's your day?

1526
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,570
Fine.

1527
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,620
You've given any more thought

1528
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,620
to Vanna's house?

1529
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,660
Yes. Maybe not the best idea.

1530
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,950
Why? 'Cause of what I said?

1531
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,720
You made some good points.

1532
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,990
No.

1533
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,360
No, I made some

1534
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,360
self-interested points.

1535
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,560
What do you mean

1536
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,560
self-interested?

1537
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,300
You walked in here

1538
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,300
this morning all excited

1539
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,640
about a beautiful little house

1540
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,640
you'd found, right?

1541
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,640
Your dream house.

1542
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,470
And what I heard was

1543
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,640
that maybe you were

1544
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,640
planning a future

1545
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,640
that didn't--

1546
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,050
you know, that didn't

1547
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,050
involve me, so...

1548
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:53,650
Owning my own home has been

1549
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:53,650
a goal for a long, long time.

1550
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,600
And the reason

1551
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,600
that I feel ready now

1552
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,860
to take this leap

1553
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,860
of faith is--

1554
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,600
is really

1555
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,600
all your fault, Daniel.

1556
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,740
Because of you,

1557
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,540
I now know I want

1558
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,540
to put down roots in Chicago.

1559
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,510
Despite its miserable winters.

1560
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,550
Remember, I'm from Poland.

1561
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,650
Yeah.

1562
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,800
Yes, it's Sharon Goodwin.

1563
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,360
I'd appreciate it if you

1564
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,360
could get back to me tonight,

1565
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,600
if at all possible.

1566
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,680
Yes, I'll be up late.

1567
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,570
Thank you.

1568
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,570
What's going on?

1569
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,340
We're trying to reach

1570
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,340
every member of the board

1571
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,420
before Jack

1572
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,420
can get to them first.

1573
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,080
He wants to convert Med

1574
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,080
into a for-profit hospital.

1575
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,940
Turn it over to investors.

1576
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,920
Can he do that?

1577
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,920
Well, he can certainly try.

1578
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,960
He wants to put it

1579
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,960
to a board vote.

1580
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,550
I mean, if Jack succeeds,

1581
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,550
there goes Med as we know it.

1582
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,720
Vital services that don't

1583
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,720
generate enough income cut.

1584
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,800
We're gonna have to discharge

1585
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,800
patients that can't pay.

1586
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,370
Yeah, I know. That's why

1587
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,370
we're doing everything we can

1588
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,740
to make sure

1589
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,740
he does not succeed.

1590
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,970
Look, I need to make

1591
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,970
this next call.

1592
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,630
Did you need something?

1593
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,630
No.

1594
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,900
No, it can wait.

1595
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,900
You sure?

1596
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,070
Yeah.

1597
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,070
All right.

1598
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,670
Hello?

1599
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,750
Thanks for meeting me.

1600
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,750
Of course.

1601
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,760
Rough day?

1602
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,390
Yeah, rough day.

1603
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,990
What's going on?

1604
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,030
I...

1605
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,970
I need to tell you something.

1606
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,580
Okay.

1607
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,500
It's about your dad, and...

1608
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,680
he can't know that you

1609
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,680
learned this from me, but...

1610
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,010
Look, if it was my parent,

1611
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,010
I'd want to know, so...

1612
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,950
What is it?

1613
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,550
Hannah, please.

1614
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,660
His health is getting worse.
