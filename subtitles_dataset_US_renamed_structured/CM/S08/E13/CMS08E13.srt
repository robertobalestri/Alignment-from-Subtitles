1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,030
Sean's being paroled.

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,130
That's great.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,500
I just want him

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,500
to have a fair shot.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,510
I want to do it right

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,510
this time, Dad.

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,430
And I've tasked

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,430
Dr. Grace Song here

9
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,740
with finding ways to make

10
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,740
your jobs more efficient.

11
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,740
We're deciding how to use

12
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,740
tech so that it's empowering.

13
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,110
I wonder if you might train me

14
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,110
on that new EMR program.

15
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,310
The longer

16
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,310
we don't talk,

17
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,220
the bigger the divide

18
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,220
between us becomes.

19
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,420
Maggie, you lied to me.

20
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,090
I'm not gonna give up on us.

21
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,630
Hi.

22
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,630
You've reached Ben Campbell.

23
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,640
Leave a message

24
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,640
after the beep.

25
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,170
Hey, um.

26
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,570
I know this is the third

27
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,570
message that I'm leaving.

28
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,370
And I really want to respect

29
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,370
the space you asked for,

30
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,070
but if you can text me

31
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,070
and let me know that

32
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,070
you're all right,

33
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,710
it's getting pretty

34
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,710
brutal out there.

35
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,310
And... Okay.

36
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,440
Love you.

37
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,410
Bye.

38
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,690
You hurt?

39
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,390
Injured?

40
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,390
Mmm-mmm.

41
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,460
Stay to the right

42
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,460
and settle in.

43
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,090
Someone will swing by

44
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,090
with a blanket soon.

45
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,630
Hey. What's our count?

46
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,630
Pushing 60.

47
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,290
Sixty? And it's

48
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,290
not even 10:00.

49
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,470
Hey. How long are we supposed

50
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,470
to keep letting people in?

51
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,710
Well, the worst of the storm

52
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,710
is still ahead of us.

53
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,340
The weather center

54
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,340
is expecting

55
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,340
70-mile-an-hour winds

56
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,380
and at least

57
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,380
ten inches of ice.

58
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,510
If we don't open our doors,

59
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,750
most of these people

60
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,750
won't survive the night.

61
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,320
I understand, but,

62
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,320
look, pretty soon

63
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,820
we're just gonna be

64
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,820
standing room only here.

65
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,650
Well, we're setting up cots

66
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,650
and the entryway

67
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,750
for the overflow.

68
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,190
What about our patients?

69
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,290
I'm short doctors,

70
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,290
and everyone I do have

71
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,100
is coming off a double

72
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,100
with no end in sight.

73
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,500
Well, I just got word

74
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,500
from the governor's office.

75
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,540
The National Guard

76
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,540
will be making runs,

77
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,770
picking up

78
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,770
essential medical personnel

79
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,770
who can't make it in.

80
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,280
Look, I know this isn't easy,

81
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,280
Dr. Archer,

82
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,110
but I promise,

83
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,110
reinforcements are coming.

84
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,270
All right.

85
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,510
You don't believe in omens.

86
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
Hey, Mags, let me know

87
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
when my OR is ready.

88
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm gonna grab a coffee.

89
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,650
You've been on your feet

90
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,650
for 72 hours now.

91
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,090
Might want to make

92
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,090
it a double.

93
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,090
Tell me about it.

94
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,430
Dr. Halstead,

95
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,430
we've got incoming.

96
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,590
You're going to Baghdad.

97
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,590
Can you give Dr. Song a hand?

98
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,860
I'll see what I can do.

99
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,500
Thank you.

100
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,370
So Dayton's got you

101
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,370
in the trenches with us

102
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,370
grunts tonight, huh?

103
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,740
He's concerned

104
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,740
you're running

105
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,740
out of ammo, yeah.

106
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,880
We're going to Baghdad.

107
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,880
Where's the ambo?

108
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,380
The tires started

109
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,380
spinning out

110
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,380
in the driveway.

111
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,180
Nina Simonds, 53 years old.

112
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,720
Carbon monoxide exposure

113
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,720
from lighting

114
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,720
an old gas stove.

115
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,380
Fell from a third-story window

116
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,380
trying to vent the apartment.

117
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,290
That's her nephew, Lucas.

118
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,290
No complaints.

119
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,890
Tubed in the ambo

120
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,890
for GCS of five.

121
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,390
Gross deformities

122
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,390
on the left arm and leg.

123
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,490
Eighteen-gauge in each arm.

124
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,490
Total of 500 milliliters

125
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,490
of normal saline.

126
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,160
Heart rate 120,

127
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,160
BP 104/78.

128
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,430
She's hypotensive.

129
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,430
She's bleeding

130
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,430
somewhere.

131
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,740
Two units of blood on

132
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,740
the rapid transfuser and

133
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,740
an X-ray, chest and pelvis.

134
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,470
On my count. One, two, three.

135
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,850
Thanks, guys.

136
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,880
Okay?

137
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,880
Yep.

138
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,160
We were getting dizzy.

139
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,560
She was just trying

140
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,560
to let in some fresh air.

141
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,360
Okay. Good to know,

142
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,360
Lucas. Don't worry.

143
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,490
We're gonna take good care

144
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,490
of your aunt, all right?

145
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,590
Doris?

146
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,590
Hey.

147
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,190
Let's get you

148
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,190
looked at, okay?

149
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,830
Lungs are

150
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,830
clear bilaterally,

151
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,200
but pressure's fallen

152
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,200
to 90 systolic.

153
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,280
Okay. Let's get an ABG,

154
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,280
two grams of TXA.

155
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,310
And, Dr. Song, fast her.

156
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,310
On it.

157
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,220
I don't see any fluid.

158
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,950
Me neither.

159
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,190
That's weird.

160
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,820
She's already sucked down

161
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,820
two units of blood,

162
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,520
and her pressure

163
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,520
hasn't budged.

164
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,790
X-ray.

165
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,240
Chest looks good.

166
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,810
Mike, get her pelvis quickly.

167
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,210
Open-book pelvic fracture.

168
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,210
It's completely shattered.

169
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,370
She's falling.

170
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,370
Okay.

171
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,880
Let's get a binder

172
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,880
on her pelvis now.

173
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,320
We need to lock it down

174
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,320
before she bleeds out.

175
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,480
Let's go.

176
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,990
You set?

177
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,990
Don't wait for me.

178
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,570
Tighten it.

179
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,500
Looks closed.

180
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,270
Pressure's coming up.

181
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,280
Let's get another X-ray

182
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,280
and keep pushing blood.

183
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,540
That was close.

184
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,370
So it looks like

185
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,310
the storm took out

186
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,310
the West Loop substation.

187
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,640
Anyone experience

188
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,640
disruptions to ventilators,

189
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,640
monitoring equipment?

190
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,480
No, no, no,

191
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,480
everything kicked over

192
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,480
to emergency backup.

193
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,350
All right, good.

194
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,350
Let's all get back to work.

195
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,720
I'll keep you informed

196
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,720
as we get updates.

197
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,720
Maggie, let's start getting

198
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,720
everyone who's stable

199
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,350
into the entryway.

200
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,330
They can hunker down

201
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,330
there for the night.

202
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,490
All right.

203
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,530
1979, You remember that one?

204
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,530
God, I remember that one.

205
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,430
4 degrees, 22 3/4 inches.

206
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,730
Wow.

207
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,730
Yeah. But then

208
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,730
there was 2012.

209
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,900
16 1/4 inches,

210
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,900
10 below zero.

211
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,310
Cold, very cold.

212
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,310
But tonight

213
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,310
is much colder.

214
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,900
You know what then?

215
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,670
It's really good

216
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,670
that you came in

217
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,670
when you did.

218
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,910
Yeah, good.

219
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,910
No, good for sure.

220
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,780
Felix, tell me how are you

221
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,780
doing with your lithium?

222
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,980
Are you

223
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,980
taking it regularly?

224
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,980
Yeah, pretty much.

225
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,680
Pretty much?

226
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
Okay. Well, then,

227
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
let me ask you.

228
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,620
How are you dealing

229
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,620
with the change of seasons?

230
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,420
You know, the shorter days,

231
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,420
the darker days?

232
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,690
Are you holding up okay?

233
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,690
It's never easy.

234
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,320
I try, but...

235
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,590
Hi.

236
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,590
Hey there, Felix.

237
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,960
How are those

238
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,960
toes feeling?

239
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,090
Slowly but surely

240
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,090
getting better,

241
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,090
as the saying goes.

242
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,070
Slowly but surely.

243
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,070
Great. Great.

244
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,640
Dr. Charles, can I speak

245
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,640
with you for a moment?

246
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,070
Be right back.

247
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,070
Yeah.

248
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,380
I've got a cot ready

249
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,380
for him in the entryway.

250
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,470
He's already got a bed.

251
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,820
I can't tie up a room

252
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,820
all night for some

253
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,820
frost nipped toes.

254
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,880
Thing is, though, Mags,

255
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,880
Felix is bipolar II

256
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,550
with history

257
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,550
of noncompliance.

258
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,560
I just don't think

259
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,560
that's an ideal situation

260
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,560
for him out there.

261
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,920
Well, we don't really

262
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,920
have a choice.

263
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,730
We have patients

264
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,730
with greater need.

265
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,730
Okay.

266
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,940
Excuse me, Dr. Archer.

267
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,940
Yeah?

268
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,070
Twenty-six-year-old male

269
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,070
with an eye injury,

270
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,840
possible orbital fracture.

271
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,740
I can put in the orders,

272
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,740
but I thought you might

273
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,740
want to see this one.

274
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,010
What? Why?

275
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,520
Sean?

276
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,520
Oh, hey, Dad.

277
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,020
Hey. Are you hurt?

278
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,020
No, I'm fine.

279
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,150
It's Clint, my roommate

280
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,150
from the reentry center.

281
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,450
I heard a lot

282
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,450
about you, Mr. Archer.

283
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,150
It's Doctor.

284
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,150
Right.

285
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,560
So what happened?

286
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,430
I was picking up

287
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,430
some essentials

288
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,430
before the storm hit,

289
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,830
you know, eggs,

290
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,830
milk, and such.

291
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,840
Got jumped leaving

292
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,840
the Mariano's over on Wabash.

293
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,470
Is that right?

294
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,470
Yeah.

295
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,440
It must have been,

296
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,440
like, ten dudes.

297
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,940
Didn't have a chance.

298
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,880
Sean was nice enough

299
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,880
to pick me up

300
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,880
in his four-by.

301
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,540
Well, that's my boy.

302
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,510
Let's see what's going on.

303
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,590
Can you see out of it?

304
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,590
Yeah, but kind of blurry.

305
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,690
It's really swollen.

306
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,160
All right, well,

307
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,160
keep ice on it

308
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,160
and get a CT.

309
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,020
Can I talk to you

310
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,020
for a minute?

311
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,900
Okay. What are you doing?

312
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,900
City's on lockdown.

313
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,060
He needed help.

314
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,870
Well, then get somebody else

315
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,870
to bail him out.

316
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,000
You got no business driving

317
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,000
around in an ice storm,

318
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,100
especially after curfew.

319
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,840
All it'll take

320
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,840
is one violation

321
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,840
to land you back in county.

322
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,940
He's my friend.

323
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,480
I couldn't just leave him

324
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,480
out there to freeze.

325
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,570
Sean...

326
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,570
Dr. Archer.

327
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,780
You have an OB patient

328
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,780
in treatment six.

329
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,150
Where's Dr. Asher?

330
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,190
She couldn't get her car

331
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,190
out of the garage.

332
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,750
Don't go anywhere.

333
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,130
Let's add a tox screen

334
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,130
to those labs.

335
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,160
Hi. You must be Katie?

336
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,160
Uh-huh.

337
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,900
Hi. I'm Dr. Archer.

338
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,900
This is Dr. Hudgins.

339
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,470
I see you're experiencing

340
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,470
mild contractions

341
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,740
and some dizziness.

342
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,540
I almost fell off the ladder

343
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,540
undressing my Christmas tree.

344
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,670
Hmm.

345
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,810
Well, I like

346
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,810
the festive spirit, Katie,

347
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,180
but Christmas in February?

348
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,840
I know. I'm a little

349
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,840
behind schedule.

350
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,820
I've been a bit preoccupied.

351
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,050
When is your due date?

352
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,090
Not for another seven weeks.

353
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,090
I was hoping he'd hold off

354
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,090
long enough

355
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,490
for my husband

356
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,490
to get back from Auckland.

357
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,790
Your contractions

358
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,790
could just be Braxton-Hicks.

359
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,160
So there's nothing

360
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,160
to worry about.

361
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,900
But I see that

362
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,900
your blood pressure

363
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,900
is slightly elevated.

364
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,670
What does that mean?

365
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,040
Hopefully, it's just

366
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,040
a response to the pain.

367
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,170
But we could be looking

368
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,170
at preeclampsia.

369
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,270
Oh, God.

370
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,670
Well, hang tight.

371
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,670
Stay warm.

372
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,810
Before anybody jumps

373
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,810
to conclusions,

374
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,210
I'm gonna have lab work

375
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,210
done and OB weigh in.

376
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,650
Thank you.

377
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,820
Nina Simonds'

378
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,820
latest scans.

379
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,730
As you can see,

380
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,730
binder's holding pressure

381
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,730
on her pelvis,

382
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,860
but she's still leaking

383
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,860
blood from the left

384
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,860
iliac artery.

385
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,900
So she needs surgery.

386
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,900
Ideally, yes.

387
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,070
But the second we open

388
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,070
her up, we'd release

389
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,070
the pressure.

390
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,140
And she'll bleed out

391
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,140
and likely die on the table.

392
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,270
So we take her to IR,

393
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,270
embolize the vessel.

394
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,550
Okay. But even

395
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,550
if we can reach

396
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,550
the artery,

397
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,910
and that's a big if,

398
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,910
the second we do,

399
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,280
she'd go into

400
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,280
hypotensive shock.

401
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,080
So we give blood

402
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,080
and resuscitate.

403
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,250
Which would require

404
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,250
continued use of massive

405
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,250
blood products.

406
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,950
We'd gut our supply.

407
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,220
Until the storm

408
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,220
blows through,

409
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,220
there's no telling

410
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,320
how long it'll be until

411
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,320
we get re-upped again.

412
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,720
So how about

413
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,720
we cut to the point

414
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,030
where you're recommending

415
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,030
a course of action?

416
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,300
Look, I don't want

417
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,300
to be a downer here, but...

418
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,970
I ran

419
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,970
an algorithmic simulation

420
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,100
with inputs

421
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,100
from patients with

422
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,100
a similar trauma profile.

423
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,940
It puts Nina's odds

424
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,940
of survival at 7%.

425
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,170
So what are we gonna do?

426
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,250
Honestly, nothing.

427
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,650
My recommendation would be

428
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,650
to transfer her to ICU

429
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,050
and make her comfortable.

430
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,680
You're kidding.

431
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,820
If it was any other day,

432
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,820
I'd say go for it,

433
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,160
but we have an obligation

434
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,160
to prioritize blood products

435
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,750
and other

436
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,750
precious resources

437
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,660
for patients who have

438
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,660
the most favorable outcome.

439
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,790
And unfortunately,

440
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,790
that's not her.

441
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,200
That kid lost

442
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,200
both his parents

443
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,200
in a car accident.

444
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,240
His aunt's all

445
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,240
he's got left now.

446
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,240
I feel you.

447
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,140
But it's not clinically

448
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,140
relevant, is it?

449
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,740
I just thought you should know

450
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,740
before we orphan him again.

451
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,210
I'm taking her to IR.

452
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,010
And if you don't want

453
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,010
to help, that's fine.

454
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,010
I'll find somebody else.

455
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,290
I've been trying

456
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,290
to reach Ben.

457
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,790
It's his bowling night,

458
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,790
and I'm worried

459
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,190
that he's out there

460
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,190
in the storm.

461
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,770
I never thought that

462
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,770
it would take him this long

463
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,200
to come around.

464
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
I'm starting to think

465
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
that it's never going to.

466
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,730
Well, you know

467
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,730
what they say.

468
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,030
Absence makes

469
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,030
the heart grow fonder.

470
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,010
Just give it some time.

471
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
Felix, how are those

472
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
frost nipped toes?

473
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
Here.

474
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,740
Felix?

475
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,680
Felix?

476
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,690
Felix?

477
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,150
Felix?

478
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,130
He's been stabbed.

479
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,370
Stay with me,

480
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,370
Felix.

481
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,070
Okay, I got three

482
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,070
clean points of entry

483
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,170
to the lower

484
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,170
right quadrant.

485
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,010
I'm gonna fast him.

486
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,010
I don't get it.

487
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,380
Why was this guy

488
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,380
moved to the entryway?

489
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,950
He was being

490
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,950
treated for frostbite.

491
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,380
It was frostnip.

492
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,220
And we needed

493
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,220
the room.

494
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,950
What the hell's wrong

495
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,950
with this thing?

496
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,790
I'll take a look.

497
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,790
No, no, no, forget it.

498
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,090
We gotta get him

499
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,090
up to CT anyway.

500
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,820
Let's get him upstairs.

501
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,820
All right, let's go.

502
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,920
Let's move.

503
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,020
Thank you.

504
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,130
Hey. I heard Felix

505
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,130
got stabbed.

506
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,220
What happened?

507
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,370
CPD's

508
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,370
been notified,

509
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,030
but their entire department

510
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,030
is underwater.

511
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,080
So it's going to be

512
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,080
a few hours before

513
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,080
they can even get here.

514
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,380
Jack.

515
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,380
Yeah?

516
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,710
What are you

517
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,710
still doing here?

518
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,080
We got delayed finishing up

519
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,080
the OR 2.0 sensory upgrades,

520
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,920
and then I couldn't

521
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,920
get the helicopter launched

522
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,920
before the storm hit.

523
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,760
So I... I was told

524
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,760
there was a stabbing.

525
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,920
It seems awfully calm.

526
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,830
Well, we're trying

527
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,830
to keep it quiet.

528
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,160
As far as anyone is concerned,

529
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,160
we had a medical emergency.

530
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,830
Okay. Then what happens now?

531
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,830
My team is pulling

532
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,230
the surveillance footage

533
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,230
as we speak.

534
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,270
But in the event

535
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,270
this is an active situation,

536
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,970
I think we have to call

537
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,970
a code silver,

538
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,010
evacuate the building

539
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,010
before anybody else

540
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,010
gets hurt.

541
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,480
I'd really prefer

542
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,480
not to do that.

543
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,010
A code silver

544
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,010
would require us

545
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,010
to lock down the hospital

546
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,520
and kick all of these people

547
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,520
back out onto the streets.

548
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,050
Then what are we

549
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,050
supposed to do?

550
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,250
Well, we can start

551
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,250
by quietly notifying essential

552
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,250
staff of the threat.

553
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,200
And if everyone

554
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,200
could have just a little

555
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,200
situational awareness,

556
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,460
we'd give Chief Madsen

557
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,460
and his team time

558
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,060
to review

559
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,060
the surveillance footage

560
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,060
and ID a suspect.

561
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,330
I don't know, Sharon.

562
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,270
We might have a lunatic

563
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,270
loose in our hospital.

564
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,500
I think we should

565
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,500
call the code.

566
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,340
Jack, these people

567
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,340
don't have anywhere to go.

568
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,810
I get it, but I'm not

569
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,810
gonna have this whole thing

570
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,540
blowing up in my face.

571
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,550
Shut it down.

572
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,820
I am not letting you

573
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,820
send people out there.

574
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,090
And that's it.

575
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,960
Yeah, we've got

576
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,960
a couple more pickups,

577
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,060
and the roads are a mess,

578
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,060
so I'd say about

579
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,060
an hour or so?

580
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,230
What are her liver

581
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,230
and kidney function numbers?

582
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,940
Creatinine at 1.

583
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,940
PC ratio of 200.

584
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,140
Mild contractions,

585
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,140
and her blood pressure's

586
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,550
persistently higher

587
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,550
than 140/90.

588
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,110
Okay, she could

589
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,110
be preeclamptic,

590
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,150
but we're a bit shy

591
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,150
of where we'd want

592
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,280
to induce right away,

593
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,280
33 weeks.

594
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,080
Admittedly, I'm a little

595
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,080
out of my depth,

596
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,520
but I am open to ideas.

597
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,990
Give her a shot

598
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,990
of betamethasone to help

599
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,990
mature the baby's lungs

600
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,190
and magnesium

601
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,190
to prevent seizures

602
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,320
in case we are dealing

603
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,320
with preeclampsia.

604
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,230
I'll be there

605
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,230
as soon as I can.

606
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,530
Okay. Got it. And, Hannah,

607
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,530
be safe out there.

608
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,400
I'll be there before

609
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,400
you know it.

610
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,410
We got Clint's

611
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,410
imaging results,

612
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,310
which confirmed

613
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,310
an orbital fracture.

614
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,150
I'm just waiting

615
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,150
until ophtho can get down

616
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,150
and do a consult.

617
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,450
Okay, yeah. So is there

618
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,450
anything else?

619
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,910
Yeah, um,

620
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,290
his lab results.

621
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,350
All right.

622
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,240
Hey, with me now.

623
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,440
So do you mind telling me

624
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,440
what's really going on here?

625
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,610
What? I don't know...

626
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,610
Clint's lab work.

627
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,610
Amphetamines,

628
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,610
benzos, opioids.

629
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,580
I mean, that guy's got

630
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,580
an entire pharmacy

631
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,120
in his bloodstream.

632
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,120
Okay. Okay.

633
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,190
Look, Clint called me

634
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,190
for a ride

635
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,320
because he relapsed

636
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,320
and he got into some trouble.

637
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,660
Are you using again?

638
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,660
No!

639
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,330
No, tell me the truth.

640
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,460
You know,

641
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,460
this is exactly why

642
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,460
I didn't tell you the truth

643
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,530
about why we were here

644
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,530
in the first place.

645
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,330
When are you ever gonna

646
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,330
have some trust in me?

647
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,200
When you stop making

648
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,200
bad decisions.

649
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,290
That's when.

650
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,040
I swear I'm clean.

651
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,940
You don't believe me,

652
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,940
give me a drug test.

653
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,210
Maybe I will.

654
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,250
Advancing the catheter.

655
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,100
I'm barely keeping

656
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,100
her pressure up.

657
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,230
I'm working as fast as I can.

658
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,230
Having some issues.

659
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,100
All right, give an amp

660
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,100
of calcium and bicarb.

661
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,540
And keep going

662
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,540
with the blood products.

663
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,610
Lost pulse.

664
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,610
She's arresting.

665
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,270
Starting compressions.

666
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,270
Push a milligram of epi.

667
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,410
Push it.

668
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,680
Epi's in.

669
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,150
Pulse is back.

670
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,150
I have ROSC.

671
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,590
All right.

672
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,590
Let's keep going.

673
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,680
No. I think

674
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,680
we're done here.

675
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,660
What?

676
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,660
I tried.

677
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,320
The pelvic binder's

678
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,320
in the way, and the

679
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,320
hematoma is too big.

680
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,730
It's distorting the anatomy.

681
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,730
I can't pass the wire.

682
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,230
What if we loosen

683
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,230
the binder?

684
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,230
No way.

685
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,430
As soon as you remove

686
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,430
the pressure, she'll bleed out

687
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,430
on the table.

688
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,530
Well, come on.

689
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,530
We have to think

690
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,530
of another way.

691
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,040
Gave it our best shot.

692
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,040
Sorry, Will.

693
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,520
Security's still

694
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,520
investigating.

695
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,640
In the meantime,

696
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,640
we're just telling people,

697
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,150
you know,

698
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,150
just keep an eye out

699
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,150
for anything suspicious.

700
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,620
Wow, a stabbing.

701
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,620
Okay, will do.

702
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,280
Dr. Charles, can you confirm

703
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,280
this pharmacy dosage, please?

704
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,350
Thank you.

705
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,990
Dr. Marcel.

706
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,990
Yeah?

707
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,770
So?

708
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,770
Not good.

709
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,500
A CT scan showed that

710
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,500
part of the knife broke off

711
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,040
and is lodged somewhere

712
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,040
in the middle of his liver.

713
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,670
So he's gonna

714
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,670
need surgery?

715
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,340
Yeah, but he has

716
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,340
three tracts in the liver.

717
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
From the surface,

718
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
it'll be challenging

719
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,380
to know which one

720
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,380
has the retained blade.

721
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,750
And, well,

722
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,750
if we go in blindly,

723
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,110
then he could

724
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,110
bleed excessively.

725
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,120
So I'm...

726
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,120
I'd like to go up to 2.0.

727
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,020
I'm hoping

728
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,020
the enhanced imaging

729
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,060
will give us

730
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,060
the roadmap we need

731
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,430
to make the repair.

732
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,390
Okay.

733
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,200
I'll call upstairs

734
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,200
and let them know

735
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,200
that you're on your way.

736
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,370
You get another

737
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,370
cup of coffee.

738
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,370
Yeah.

739
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,680
Liver injuries

740
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,680
are brutal.

741
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,150
Poor Felix.

742
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,090
I know it's chaotic tonight,

743
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,090
but how does something

744
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,090
like this happen?

745
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,050
Doris, please.

746
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,720
This is not helpful.

747
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,160
What happened?

748
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,090
Pressure is falling.

749
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,300
Oh, man.

750
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,140
Hang with me.

751
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,140
Hang with me, Katie.

752
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,370
All right.

753
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,340
Reflexes close

754
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,340
to absent.

755
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,240
Diminished urine output.

756
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,680
All right. Let's hold

757
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,680
the magnesium.

758
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,810
Give 500 cc fluid bolus

759
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,810
of lactated ringers.

760
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,490
And let's repeat all her labs,

761
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,490
including a mag level.

762
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,650
Copy.

763
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,750
Where the hell

764
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,750
is Hannah?

765
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,570
This doesn't look good.

766
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,410
No, we gotta

767
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,410
get him out of there.

768
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,410
Yeah.

769
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,620
Hey.

770
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,280
What's your name?

771
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,280
Paul.

772
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,420
Paul, take a few

773
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,420
deep breaths for me.

774
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,290
Okay. Are you okay?

775
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,290
Are you in pain?

776
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,420
No.

777
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,420
No?

778
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,330
No? Do you think

779
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,330
you can walk, Paul?

780
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,800
I think so.

781
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,800
Okay.

782
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,370
Good, 'cause we're

783
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,370
gonna get you out of here.

784
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,630
Grab an arm.

785
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,630
Yep.

786
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,370
On three. One, two, three.

787
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,460
Here we go.

788
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,310
We gotcha.

789
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,310
Gotcha.

790
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm dizzy. I gotta stop

791
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,800
for a sec.

792
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,150
Okay,

793
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,150
let's put him down.

794
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,150
Yeah.

795
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,410
I think there's a blanket

796
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,410
in the back seat.

797
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,780
Stay with him.

798
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,780
Keep him on his side.

799
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,750
Watch his neck.

800
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,750
Will do.

801
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,220
We gotcha.

802
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,310
Hey, Paul?

803
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,610
Hey.

804
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,850
Did you get hit?

805
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,260
I don't think so.

806
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,850
Okay, good.

807
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,890
Hang tight for a bit.

808
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,890
I'll be right back.

809
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,970
I think I took some shrapnel.

810
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,330
Oh, let me see.

811
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,230
We got to stop

812
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,230
the bleeding.

813
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,430
I have a tourniquet

814
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,430
in my vest.

815
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,510
Hold pressure.

816
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,950
Watch your hand.

817
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,980
That should do.

818
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,520
I'm gonna get you

819
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,520
to the hospital.

820
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,620
Not in that, you're not.

821
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,890
What?

822
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,230
Where are you

823
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,230
taking her?

824
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,340
Up to the ICU.

825
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,970
Dr. Davis couldn't

826
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,970
access the vessels,

827
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,970
just like you said.

828
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,410
I'm sorry, Will.

829
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,440
Auntie N!

830
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,420
Woah, woah,

831
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,420
easy, buddy.

832
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,490
Auntie N? Is she gonna

833
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,490
get better?

834
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,580
We're gonna do everything

835
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,580
we can for her.

836
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,520
It's my fault.

837
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,590
Lucas, why would

838
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,590
you say that?

839
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,690
She was lighting

840
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,690
the stove

841
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,690
'cause of me.

842
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,890
I was cold.

843
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,890
That's why she fell.

844
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,400
Lucas, there you are.

845
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,530
Let's go back to

846
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,530
the doctor's lounge, okay?

847
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,510
I'm so sorry.

848
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,510
It's all my fault.

849
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,740
Will, wait a sec.

850
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,750
What if we take her back

851
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,750
to the hybrid room?

852
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,650
And if we can loosen

853
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,650
the pelvic binder, maybe

854
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,650
we can find the vessels.

855
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,690
I thought of that.

856
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,690
Dr. Davis was not on board.

857
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,830
Then I'll do it myself.

858
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,730
One person said

859
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,730
they saw a guy in a red

860
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,730
T-shirt leaving the area.

861
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,810
But there were some

862
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,810
inconsistencies with

863
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,810
their account.

864
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,380
How about

865
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,380
security footage?

866
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,840
Cameras never

867
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,840
came back online

868
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,740
after we shifted over

869
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,740
to the backup generator.

870
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,580
Remind me to jump

871
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,580
down IT's throats

872
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,580
over that, please.

873
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,910
But what

874
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,910
can we do now?

875
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,010
We need to find out

876
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,010
who did this Felix.

877
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,750
If I had to hazard a guess,

878
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,750
I'd say whoever did this

879
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,950
already exited

880
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,950
the hospital.

881
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,920
At the moment,

882
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,920
our top priority

883
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,390
needs to be ensuring

884
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,390
the safety of our

885
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,390
patients and staff.

886
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,490
Were you able

887
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,490
to get in any extra

888
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,490
security personnel?

889
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,760
They're trickling in.

890
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,930
I wanted to talk to you

891
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,930
about how best

892
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,930
to deploy them.

893
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,630
Why don't we do a walkthrough?

894
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,800
I'll fill you in

895
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,800
if I get any more

896
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,800
information.

897
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,370
This is unacceptable.

898
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,370
It is.

899
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,970
But, look, we're gonna have

900
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,970
to accept the possibility

901
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,950
that we might never

902
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,950
find out who did this.

903
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,850
Yeah, but Felix wouldn't

904
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,850
even have been

905
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,850
in the entryway

906
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,580
had I not insisted

907
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,580
on turfing him.

908
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,050
Look, you've been

909
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,050
on your feet for,

910
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,050
what, 20 hours?

911
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,850
What do you say let me

912
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,850
pass the brick off to Doris

913
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,950
and you get some rest?

914
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,690
No, I'm gonna

915
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,690
power through.

916
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,730
Doctor's orders, then.

917
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,730
Daniel.

918
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,130
Margaret, I'm not

919
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,130
messing around here.

920
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,030
I'm worried about you.

921
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,030
You need some sleep.

922
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,770
Thank you.

923
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,820
Still can't tell where

924
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,820
the retained fragment is.

925
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,990
2.0, rotate the image

926
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,990
to feature the right

927
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,990
hepatic lobe.

928
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,720
What's this?

929
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,890
Intentional motions

930
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,890
are at 74% efficiency

931
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,700
compared to your

932
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,700
normal metrics.

933
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,070
What are you

934
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,070
talking about?

935
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,700
You're too fatigued

936
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,700
to continue operating.

937
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,680
You're kidding, right?

938
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,040
I've done hundreds of cases

939
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,040
far more exhausted than this.

940
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,580
It's recommended

941
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,580
you have another surgeon

942
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,580
complete the operation.

943
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,620
There is no other surgeon.

944
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,620
I can take over.

945
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,450
I just started my shift

946
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,450
a few of hours ago.

947
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,450
I'm plenty rested.

948
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,960
You're not qualified.

949
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,960
You're a junior resident.

950
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,620
I need you to

951
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,620
override the system

952
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,620
and give me my image.

953
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,790
I can't.

954
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,190
Uh, Mr. Dayton upgraded

955
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,190
the code to make it

956
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,190
impossible to override.

957
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,830
Then get Jack

958
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,830
up here to do it.

959
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,490
You're wasting

960
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,490
your breath.

961
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,930
He doesn't want

962
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,930
anyone operating

963
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,060
at a capacity below

964
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,060
the system's threshold.

965
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,800
This is ridiculous!

966
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,800
I feel fine!

967
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,030
I can do it.

968
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,010
Damn it.

969
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,780
Under your supervision,

970
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,780
of course.

971
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,560
2.0, transfer primary surgeon

972
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,560
to Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

973
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,850
Focus on

974
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,850
the right lower lobe.

975
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,060
Your show.

976
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,530
Katie's platelet count

977
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,530
dropped to 70,000.

978
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,840
And her LFTs doubled.

979
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,840
Mag level was seven.

980
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,810
All right, we're gonna

981
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,810
need to induce labor.

982
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,240
All right,

983
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,240
start her on oxytocin

984
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,210
and restart the mag

985
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,210
at one gram an hour

986
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,080
as long as she's doing better

987
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,080
and her reflexes are back.

988
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,210
Oh, uh, any ETA yet

989
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,210
on Dr. Asher?

990
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,550
Just got off with OEMC.

991
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,490
Seems she encountered

992
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,490
a trauma in the field.

993
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,960
What kind of trauma?

994
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,960
He didn't have

995
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,960
any details.

996
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,760
Only that the guard vehicle

997
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,760
was disabled

998
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,890
and they were

999
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,890
having difficulty

1000
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,890
finding transport.

1001
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,160
Thought it might be

1002
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,160
another hour.

1003
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,570
An hour? How is she

1004
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,570
gonna survive out there

1005
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,160
for that long in this cold?

1006
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,900
All right,

1007
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,900
you know what?

1008
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,900
I'm gonna pick her up myself.

1009
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,270
Where'd they say

1010
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,270
she was at?

1011
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,270
Canal and Lumber.

1012
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,110
I'm sorry, Dr. Archer,

1013
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,110
but Katie's delivering.

1014
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,580
Right now? She's only

1015
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,580
one centimeter dilated.

1016
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,690
I want you staying on this guy

1017
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,780
until Hannah gets back here

1018
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,780
safe and sound.

1019
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,220
All right. You got it.

1020
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,960
You think

1021
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,960
this is serious?

1022
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,230
Why? You got

1023
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,230
big weekend plans?

1024
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,200
Actually, I do.

1025
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,270
My fiancée and I are supposed

1026
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,270
to have cake tasting.

1027
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,870
I'm getting married

1028
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,870
next month.

1029
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,000
Is that right?

1030
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah.

1031
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,880
Well, don't worry.

1032
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,140
I'll make sure

1033
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,140
you're fixed up in time

1034
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,140
to walk down that aisle.

1035
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,920
How you doing

1036
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,920
back there, Paul?

1037
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,580
I don't know.

1038
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,550
It hurts pretty bad

1039
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,550
when I breathe.

1040
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,890
Okay, let me take

1041
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,890
a look at you.

1042
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,760
Okay.

1043
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,660
Where's the pain?

1044
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,660
My side.

1045
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,670
Your side? Give me

1046
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,670
your flashlight.

1047
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,140
I'm gonna lift up

1048
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,140
your shirt.

1049
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,210
Okay, it looks like

1050
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,210
the shrapnel

1051
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,250
might have penetrated

1052
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,250
your chest well.

1053
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,250
Hold that for me.

1054
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,040
Do you have

1055
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,040
any medical supplies?

1056
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,110
Uh, no,

1057
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,110
but there's a toolbox

1058
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,110
under your seat.

1059
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,900
Hey, that bag,

1060
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,900
hand it to me.

1061
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,760
Okay, here.

1062
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,000
All right, Paul.

1063
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,340
You have a hole

1064
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,340
in your lung.

1065
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,080
I'm gonna stabilize

1066
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,080
your breathing

1067
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,080
with an airtight patch.

1068
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,850
That's your patch?

1069
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,850
Yes.

1070
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,220
Here we go.

1071
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,350
It's going to conform

1072
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,350
to your body contour

1073
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,060
to create a better seal.

1074
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,960
All right.

1075
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,290
Now take a big

1076
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,290
inhale for me.

1077
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,990
That better?

1078
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,990
Mmm-hmm.

1079
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,030
Okay, good. Good.

1080
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,830
Good, good, good.

1081
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,270
There we go.

1082
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,200
The cavalry

1083
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,200
better get here soon.

1084
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,710
Yeah.

1085
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,210
This is all the blood

1086
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,210
we have left.

1087
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,350
Do you think

1088
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,350
we should use it?

1089
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,720
We don't have a choice.

1090
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,380
All right.

1091
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,990
A-line pressure's down.

1092
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,120
I don't think

1093
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,120
we're gonna make it.

1094
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,200
I only need

1095
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,200
another 30 seconds.

1096
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,670
I'm almost there.

1097
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,830
All right.

1098
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,830
Come on. Come on.

1099
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,340
Come on, Nina.

1100
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,970
I'm in.

1101
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,100
Launching the coil.

1102
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,390
Pressure's coming up.

1103
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,050
All right.

1104
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,920
Let's get her

1105
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,920
up to the ICU.

1106
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,920
BEN ON PHONE:

1107
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,920
Hi. You've reached

1108
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,920
Ben Campbell.

1109
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,060
Leave a message

1110
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,060
after the beep.

1111
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,900
I...

1112
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,910
Are you all right?

1113
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,820
It is so cold.

1114
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,410
What happened?

1115
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,410
I slipped on the ice.

1116
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,080
Okay. Come on.

1117
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,080
Let's get you inside.

1118
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,060
Okay.

1119
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,060
Oh, my God.

1120
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,100
You're frozen.

1121
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,720
How long were you

1122
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,720
out there for?

1123
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,890
I don't know, a couple

1124
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,890
of hours maybe.

1125
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,060
Okay, stay right there.

1126
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,060
Stay right there.

1127
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,770
Let me take a look

1128
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,770
at your ankle.

1129
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,110
No!

1130
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,110
Okay.

1131
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,810
I'm gonna go

1132
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,810
get a wheelchair,

1133
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,440
and we're gonna get your

1134
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,440
ankle all fixed up, okay?

1135
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,210
Okay, stay right here.

1136
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,790
It feels like

1137
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,790
there's a boulder on my chest.

1138
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,520
Okay.

1139
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,260
Okay.

1140
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,420
All right, when you feel

1141
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,420
that pressure building up,

1142
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,260
I want you to just

1143
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,260
pull that flap back, okay?

1144
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,890
Try that for me.

1145
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,280
Hey. Is that EMS?

1146
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,510
Looks like a civilian.

1147
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,930
Sorry. I got here

1148
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,930
as soon as I could.

1149
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,500
Were you looking for us?

1150
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,540
I was in the ED

1151
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,540
with a friend of mine when

1152
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,540
I heard you needed a lift.

1153
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,370
I'm Sean. Sean Archer.

1154
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,250
Wait. Dean's son?

1155
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,250
That's right.

1156
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,250
Huh.

1157
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,370
Okay.

1158
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,120
Well, let's get these guys

1159
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,120
in your truck.

1160
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,090
Okay.

1161
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,820
Katie, I know delivery

1162
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,820
didn't go exactly

1163
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,820
as you'd planned,

1164
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,300
but your baby looks

1165
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,300
healthy and strong.

1166
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,830
Isn't he?

1167
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,900
I was so worried.

1168
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,330
Because he was born

1169
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,330
prematurely,

1170
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,870
we're gonna have to have him

1171
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,870
evaluated up in the NICU.

1172
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,240
It's a perfectly

1173
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,240
normal protocol.

1174
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,440
Nothing to be

1175
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,440
concerned about.

1176
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,440
Okay.

1177
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,280
And what about

1178
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,280
the preeclampsia?

1179
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,120
Well, in most cases,

1180
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,120
it's resolved

1181
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,120
by giving birth.

1182
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,160
We'll keep an eye on that,

1183
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,160
but in the meantime,

1184
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,420
I'll have you transferred

1185
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,420
upstairs where you'll be

1186
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,420
a lot more comfortable.

1187
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,160
Thank you.

1188
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,160
Thank you both.

1189
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,160
Sure.

1190
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,610
Can you believe it?

1191
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,610
That was my first delivery.

1192
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,900
I can, actually.

1193
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,140
It's such a rush.

1194
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,140
Yeah.

1195
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,110
Dr. Archer,

1196
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,110
just spoke to OEMC.

1197
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,180
Hannah's on her way in.

1198
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,180
She should be about

1199
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,180
15 minutes out.

1200
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,550
Thank you, Doris.

1201
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,550
And I also

1202
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,550
need a consult,

1203
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,350
Dr. Archer,

1204
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,350
for treatment five.

1205
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,480
Patient's name is Heidi.

1206
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,480
She fell and twisted her ankle

1207
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,610
trying to enter the hospital

1208
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,610
over on Polk Street.

1209
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,290
Who do you have?

1210
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,290
Dr. Hudgins here

1211
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,290
would be happy to help.

1212
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,190
Great.

1213
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,190
Absolutely.

1214
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,190
Let's get an X-ray.

1215
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,660
That's Kathleen.

1216
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,960
Hi.

1217
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,090
We're gonna get you

1218
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,090
all patched up and back

1219
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,090
on your feet, Heidi.

1220
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,360
I promise.

1221
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,440
Stop smiling so much.

1222
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,030
It's creeping me out.

1223
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,410
X-ray.

1224
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,640
Okay, Heidi.

1225
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,640
Unfortunately,

1226
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,640
it is broken.

1227
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,620
I don't think

1228
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,620
you'll need surgery,

1229
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,420
but I'll inject

1230
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,420
a numbing agent until

1231
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,420
ortho can weigh in.

1232
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,290
In the meantime,

1233
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,290
let's get you out

1234
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,560
of this parka and under

1235
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,560
some warm blankets, okay?

1236
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,560
No! Stop!

1237
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,560
Stop handling me!

1238
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,030
I can do it myself.

1239
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,030
Okay.

1240
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,200
Everybody, all night,

1241
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,200
just hovering over me,

1242
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,470
just crowding my space.

1243
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,480
Zach, can you,

1244
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,480
come out here

1245
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,480
for a second?

1246
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,950
Yeah, one second.

1247
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,950
I just gotta draw this up.

1248
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,140
Zach.

1249
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,140
Get away from me!

1250
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,580
Get away from me!

1251
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,580
No! No! Let go of me!

1252
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,420
Can I get some help over here?

1253
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,420
Patient armed!

1254
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,720
Okay, sweetie.

1255
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,720
Pushing five of haldol.

1256
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,050
Right here.

1257
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,050
No.

1258
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,430
Okay, sweetie.

1259
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,170
Why won't anyone

1260
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,170
leave me alone?

1261
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,170
Okay. Okay.

1262
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,710
Daniel, do we know why

1263
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,710
she stabbed Felix?

1264
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,450
Because he was

1265
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,450
talking too much

1266
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,350
and in her personal space.

1267
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,480
What, she stabbed a guy

1268
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,480
for being a close talker?

1269
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,450
She's a seriously

1270
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,450
ill person.

1271
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,120
Diagnosed with paranoid

1272
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,120
schizophrenia when

1273
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,120
she was a young woman.

1274
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,220
Last time she was here,

1275
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,220
she was on thorazine,

1276
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,990
but that's, like,

1277
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,990
ten years ago.

1278
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,590
I'm pretty sure

1279
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,590
she has not had any kind

1280
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,590
of consistent care since.

1281
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,400
Without her meds,

1282
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,400
she's gonna be very volatile.

1283
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,700
Well, hopefully, she'll get

1284
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,700
the kind of help she needs

1285
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,700
moving forward.

1286
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,210
In a prison-affiliated

1287
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,210
psych ward?

1288
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,280
I wouldn't count on it.

1289
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,280
Hey, Jack.

1290
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,540
You got a minute?

1291
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,240
Yeah, of course. Excuse me.

1292
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,280
Look, we need to...

1293
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,410
We need

1294
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,410
to talk about 2.0.

1295
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,410
Yeah, let's.

1296
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,150
Now, I'm told

1297
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,150
that it delivered another

1298
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,150
tremendous success.

1299
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,490
Success?

1300
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,490
Yeah.

1301
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,190
2.0 walked an inexperienced

1302
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,190
surgeon through

1303
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,190
a complicated procedure.

1304
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,060
Yeah, I'd chalk that up

1305
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,060
as a win.

1306
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,030
Sure, the patient

1307
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,030
had a good outcome,

1308
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,660
but 2.0 glitched again,

1309
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,660
Jack, big-time.

1310
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,460
Come, walk with me.

1311
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,770
Now, I'm listening,

1312
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,770
though, sir. Keep talking.

1313
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,170
Well, this new feature,

1314
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,170
locking surgeons out

1315
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,210
because of some preprogrammed

1316
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,210
metric of fitness,

1317
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,540
it's got to go.

1318
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,710
2.0 is a tool that was

1319
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,710
designed to help surgeons,

1320
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,380
not keep them

1321
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,380
from doing their job.

1322
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,520
I think it needs

1323
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,520
to be disabled.

1324
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,320
Listen, I gotta disagree

1325
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,320
with you there.

1326
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,160
Now, look, I was told

1327
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,160
that you had some difficulty

1328
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,130
with this thing

1329
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,130
earlier, yeah?

1330
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,660
Uh...

1331
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,200
I couldn't

1332
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,200
get it to work. Yeah.

1333
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,200
Mmm-hmm.

1334
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,360
Well, maintenance

1335
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,360
took a look at it, and...

1336
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,240
Yeah, it turns out

1337
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,240
that it was working

1338
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,240
just fine.

1339
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,210
Well, it wasn't working

1340
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,210
when I tried it.

1341
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,480
Look, regardless,

1342
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,480
it was an emergent situation.

1343
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,110
I was in a rush.

1344
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,110
Or could it be

1345
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,280
that maybe you were more

1346
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,280
fatigued than you realized?

1347
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,120
Now look, it's common

1348
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,120
for all of us,

1349
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,190
maybe even top surgeons,

1350
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,190
to underestimate

1351
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,730
the effects of fatigue

1352
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,730
on our reflexes and judgment.

1353
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,360
But isn't it great to have

1354
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,360
a tool that can take all

1355
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,360
the guesswork out of it?

1356
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,140
Okay, 40-year-old

1357
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,140
male involved in

1358
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,140
a motor vehicle crash.

1359
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,110
Blunt trauma.

1360
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,110
Possible head injury.

1361
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,840
Penetrative wound

1362
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,840
to the left flank.

1363
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,310
Applied an occlusive dressing.

1364
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,310
All right.

1365
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,750
Take him to Baghdad.

1366
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,750
This way, guys.

1367
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,180
This is Corporal Parker.

1368
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,620
Twenty-eight years old.

1369
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,620
National Guardsman.

1370
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,750
Isolated arterial hemorrhage

1371
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,750
to the right leg.

1372
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,480
Applied a tourniquet

1373
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,480
about 90 minutes ago.

1374
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,820
Vascular surgeon

1375
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,820
is waiting upstairs.

1376
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,820
Okay.

1377
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,160
How you feeling?

1378
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,160
Good.

1379
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,820
Yeah, much better

1380
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,400
now that my patients

1381
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,400
are stable and in hospital.

1382
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,560
How did you get here?

1383
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,560
I was worried about you.

1384
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,860
Hey, Dad.

1385
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,500
Sean.

1386
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,900
I gotta move my truck.

1387
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,440
All right.

1388
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,310
I'm not sure we would

1389
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,310
have made it if he didn't

1390
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,310
show up when he did.

1391
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,440
Did you know

1392
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,440
that he spent a year in Alaska

1393
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,440
driving a snowplow?

1394
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,390
No, I didn't know.

1395
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,320
You got a good kid

1396
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,320
there, Dean.

1397
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,430
Nina, can you hear me?

1398
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,500
Hi, Nina.

1399
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,500
I'm Dr. Halstead.

1400
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,740
Can you hear me okay?

1401
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,610
Good.

1402
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,280
Come on. Come on in.

1403
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,760
Auntie N,

1404
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,760
you're all better now.

1405
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,350
You're gonna be okay.

1406
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,520
I'll give

1407
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,520
you two a moment.

1408
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,230
Which one of you two drongos

1409
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,230
is responsible

1410
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,530
for blowing through

1411
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,530
our entire blood supply?

1412
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,330
I'm sorry. Who are you?

1413
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,240
The surgeon

1414
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,240
who just performed

1415
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,970
a miracle cardiac bypass

1416
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,970
with only two units of blood.

1417
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,440
Justin, take it easy.

1418
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,210
Hey, we were

1419
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,210
all strapped today.

1420
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,280
You ate through 40 units

1421
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,280
on a single trauma.

1422
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,550
Now, if my patient wakes up

1423
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,550
with deficits because of this,

1424
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,990
that's on you.

1425
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,920
Don't worry about him.

1426
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,920
He's a prick.

1427
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,360
No, he's right.

1428
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,360
It was a bad call.

1429
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,960
How can you say that?

1430
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,530
I mean, look what

1431
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,530
we did for that kid.

1432
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,330
That's my point.

1433
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,330
I shouldn't have

1434
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,240
let my decision-making

1435
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,240
be influenced by this kid

1436
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,670
or anyone else.

1437
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,270
I should have followed

1438
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,270
the data like I always do.

1439
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,350
Doesn't sound very

1440
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,350
compassionate.

1441
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,390
I mean, remember,

1442
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,390
we're treating

1443
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,390
real people here.

1444
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,350
Sticking to the data,

1445
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,350
remaining objective,

1446
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,550
that's how we save

1447
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,550
the most lives.

1448
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,360
That's what makes us

1449
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,360
objective and compassionate.

1450
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,660
Hey.

1451
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,670
How's Paul doing?

1452
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,470
He's making a full recovery.

1453
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,910
And Corporal Parker?

1454
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,740
He's just out of surgery,

1455
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,740
and he'll be up and around

1456
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,280
and walking in no time.

1457
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,510
Listen, uh,

1458
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,510
about earlier, I...

1459
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,780
Oh, no.

1460
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,060
I'm guessing the roads are

1461
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,060
pretty ugly out there, huh?

1462
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,060
Well, I've seen worse,

1463
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,060
but... Yeah.

1464
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,530
Well, in that case,

1465
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,530
I haven't put

1466
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,530
my snow tires on yet,

1467
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,870
and I was wondering

1468
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,870
if I can get a lift home.

1469
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,310
Hey.

1470
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,510
Pretty impressive sleuthing

1471
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,510
there, Maggie.

1472
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,520
Not to mention stepping in

1473
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,520
before Zach got hurt.

1474
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,090
Is your arm okay?

1475
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,920
Yeah.

1476
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,420
And guess what?

1477
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,050
Felix is no longer critical.

1478
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,420
Crockett is confident

1479
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,420
he's gonna be okay.

1480
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,560
That's good news.

1481
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,930
Yeah, it is.

1482
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,800
Isn't it?

1483
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,110
Yeah, uh...

1484
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,970
Things haven't

1485
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,970
been that great

1486
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,970
between Ben and I.

1487
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,650
Sorry to hear that.

1488
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,620
You want to, uh...

1489
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,450
You want to go get

1490
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,450
a quick coffee or something?

1491
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,960
No.

1492
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,490
Actually, no.

1493
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,120
I just want to go home

1494
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,120
and crawl into bed.

1495
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,030
I hear that.

1496
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,700
Thank you.

1497
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,140
Of course.

1498
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,430
Yeah.

1499
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,560
Ben?

1500
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,390
Maggie.

1501
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,730
I'm sorry

1502
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,730
it took me so long.
