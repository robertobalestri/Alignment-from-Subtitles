1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,960
There's been a

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,960
collapse in the subway tunnel.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,560
Over here! I'm Jack Dayton.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,400
Over there. He works for me.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,570
His lung is likely collapsed.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,230
Let's get him out here.

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,230
No, no, no.

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,540
If we're gonna save him,

9
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,540
we got to do it right here.

10
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,550
I mean, what do you do if you

11
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,550
can't get the only drug

12
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,550
that'll treat an infection?

13
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,020
Start calling around.

14
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,020
Everyone

15
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,020
I talk to is out.

16
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,050
I know someone

17
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,050
that has access to everything.

18
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,520
You're talking like

19
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,520
some kind of drug dealer.

20
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,180
But no one can

21
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,180
ever know about this.

22
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,520
In the future, maybe at least

23
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,520
page me before administering

24
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,520
a very high dose...

25
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,750
Six milligrams is well within

26
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,750
the standard of care, I...

27
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,530
The standard of care

28
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,530
is not some blanket template

29
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,360
you follow without any regard

30
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,260
for the person

31
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,260
you're supposed

32
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,260
to be helping.

33
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,530
I just don't always trust

34
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,530
my own instincts.

35
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,540
I can promise you, you will

36
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,540
get there. I don't have

37
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,540
a shred of doubt in my mind.

38
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,700
Good morning.

39
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,480
Hi. So night shift left us

40
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,480
three patients.

41
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,140
A bipolar woman, 38.

42
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,140
Checked herself in.

43
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,450
A gentleman with CTE, 64.

44
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,320
Got booted from his board

45
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,320
and care home.

46
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,190
Let me guess,

47
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,190
smoking violation?

48
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,320
Ugh, yeah.

49
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,230
And lastly,

50
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,230
a 31-year-old psychotic

51
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,230
in an extrapyramidal state.

52
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,730
You know, that gentleman

53
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,730
looks like we probably

54
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,060
just have to rebalance

55
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,060
his meds, but these other two,

56
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,230
I think we're gonna

57
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,230
have to admit.

58
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,310
Agreed,

59
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,310
but once again,

60
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,170
there are no beds

61
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,170
in the psych unit

62
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,370
and all the other local EDs

63
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,370
are at capacity.

64
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,640
Well, we got to branch out.

65
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,640
Check the TRCs. See if they

66
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,640
have any room.

67
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,550
Every morning

68
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,550
it's the same thing.

69
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,750
Psych patients

70
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,750
just stashed

71
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,750
around the ED.

72
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,380
You know, my parents,

73
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,380
where they come from,

74
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,510
no one talks about psychiatry.

75
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,390
In fact, they're not convinced

76
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,390
I'm even a real doctor

77
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,620
because my brother is

78
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,620
a pediatric spine surgeon.

79
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,190
So they see him helping kids

80
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,190
walk again, but me...

81
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,400
Pretty good argument.

82
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm not even treating

83
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,400
patients,

84
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,560
just shuffling them off

85
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,560
somewhere else.

86
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,370
Will. Will. Hey.

87
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,370
Good morning.

88
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,570
So I reached out to Rose

89
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,570
Fremont, our UTI from

90
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,570
the other day,

91
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
and I know what

92
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
happened didn't happen...

93
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,410
That's okay.

94
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,410
I've been thinking

95
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,410
about her too.

96
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,280
How's she doing?

97
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,280
She's amazing.

98
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,150
She said she finally

99
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,150
feels like herself again.

100
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,750
That's really great news.

101
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,620
Yeah, you know, still,

102
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,620
we never buy drugs

103
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,620
from that dealer again.

104
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,530
Or any dealer.

105
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,390
Hey.

106
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,830
You and Will

107
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,830
are getting close.

108
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,600
Uh, yeah.

109
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,600
I guess, we are.

110
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,470
Hey, where are you headed?

111
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,600
Treatment four.

112
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,840
No, I need you

113
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,840
in treatment six.

114
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,170
Archer's already there.

115
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
Yeah, oh,

116
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
treatment seven then.

117
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,310
Dr. Halstead,

118
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,310
I need you in treatment four.

119
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,440
I'll send you the chart.

120
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,570
Will, Will,

121
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,570
Will, scratch that.

122
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,780
I already got it.

123
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,780
Wait. Hold...

124
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,580
Mags, Mags,

125
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,580
I'll be in four.

126
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,710
Yeah.

127
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,520
April.

128
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,520
Ethan.

129
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,690
Uh...

130
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,290
And you got

131
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,290
the chart, so...

132
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,290
I got to go.

133
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,380
Hey, I'm Dr. Choi.

134
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,650
Brock Huntley.

135
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,650
Nice to meet you, sir.

136
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,190
So, uh...

137
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,190
Sorry.

138
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,690
I should've

139
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,690
introduced you.

140
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,390
Dr. Choi and I used to

141
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,390
work together.

142
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,460
He is an excellent physician.

143
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,330
Thank you.

144
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,330
Um, so, Brock,

145
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,330
what's going on?

146
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,800
Feeling pretty lousy, sir.

147
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,430
For how long? Days, weeks?

148
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,510
More like months.

149
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,510
Yeah, that's why

150
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,510
we're here.

151
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,200
Brock has been

152
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,200
seen by a number

153
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,200
of internists at my group.

154
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,470
Fever, headache,

155
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,470
abdominal pain, diarrhea,

156
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,470
high white count.

157
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,310
It sounds like viral

158
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,310
gastroenteritis.

159
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,750
That is what we thought

160
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,750
as well, but bugs usually

161
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,750
come with vomiting.

162
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,180
That hasn't been

163
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,180
a symptom.

164
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,350
It's a little tender.

165
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,350
Sorry about that.

166
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,720
Sometimes small talk's

167
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,720
a good distraction.

168
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,590
So what do you do, Brock?

169
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,720
Uh, I'm a mechanic.

170
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,930
I'm in between jobs.

171
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,630
I work on Honeywell AGT1500s.

172
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,370
It's a gas

173
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,370
turbine engine, right?

174
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,600
Yeah.

175
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,600
High powered.

176
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,900
So, Dr. Choi,

177
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,900
what do you think?

178
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,680
Well, the, uh, diffused

179
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,680
belly pain could indicate

180
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,680
a surgical issue,

181
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,510
but the other symptoms

182
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,510
like headache, diarrhea...

183
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,650
They don't support it.

184
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,650
No.

185
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,520
All right, Brock, next steps.

186
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,520
Labs. Stools, ultrasound, CT,

187
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,520
the works.

188
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,930
As long as we figure this out.

189
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,230
I'll be right back.

190
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,270
Hey, Ethan.

191
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,730
Dr. Choi.

192
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,930
Yeah.

193
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,700
Hey, I'm really sorry

194
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,700
for the sneak attack.

195
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,680
I just was worried

196
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,680
that reuniting

197
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,680
in a treatment room

198
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,270
would be awkward,

199
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,270
which it was.

200
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, a little, uh,

201
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,520
but, uh, no harm, no foul.

202
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,890
I hope not.

203
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,720
I know using Maggie to skirt

204
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,720
the system and cherry-pick

205
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,290
a doc must be a headache

206
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,290
for the ED chief.

207
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,420
Yeah, but good thing

208
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,420
it's not me anymore.

209
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,820
My choice.

210
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,930
April Sexton in the flesh.

211
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,510
Dr. Marcel.

212
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,980
Man, it's been forever.

213
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,440
Maybe for you.

214
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,280
I mean, for me,

215
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,280
it feels like

216
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,280
yesterday.

217
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,910
Oh, that's because

218
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,910
it was.

219
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,450
I saw you. The Trib,

220
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,450
the "Sun-Times".

221
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,320
The tunnel collapse.

222
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,320
Mmm-hmm.

223
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,690
I got to say, the heroics

224
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,690
were not a surprise,

225
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,820
but I didn't see

226
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,820
transplant surgeon coming.

227
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,460
Yeah, well, I guess

228
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,460
like you, I was looking

229
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,460
for something more.

230
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,330
Excuse me.

231
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,340
It's the ICU.

232
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,340
It's really nice

233
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,340
to see you.

234
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,600
You too.

235
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,070
Hey. I came in

236
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,070
to say good morning

237
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,670
and suddenly alarms

238
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,670
start going off.

239
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,400
Nathaniel,

240
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,400
what's going on, bud?

241
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,340
I can't breathe.

242
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,440
Sats are into the 80s

243
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,440
and dropping.

244
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,440
Heart rate's climbing.

245
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,610
Yeah, he's in

246
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,610
respiratory distress.

247
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,690
Cannula, mask him.

248
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,690
High flow O2 please.

249
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,920
I was in with his sister

250
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,920
yesterday, telling jokes,

251
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,920
laughing. He was fine.

252
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,960
And call anesthesia.

253
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,960
We're intubating him.

254
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,960
CT PE to follow.

255
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,790
What's happening?

256
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,490
I'm gonna find out, okay?

257
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,800
Lift your chin up.

258
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,800
There you go.

259
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,430
He's looking better.

260
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,840
I gave him two

261
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,840
of benztropine.

262
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,880
Gonna let him rest a bit

263
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,880
and then discharge him.

264
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,950
How's it going with those

265
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,950
transfers? You know, the

266
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,950
overnight intake?

267
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,610
I found them each

268
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,610
a spot in therapeutic

269
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,610
residential centers.

270
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,040
Oh, excellent.

271
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,350
They are successfully

272
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,350
shuffled off

273
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,350
to someplace else.

274
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,750
Dr. Charles, I just sent you

275
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,750
treatment three.

276
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,620
Good Samaritan found him

277
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,620
wandering in the street.

278
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,390
No phone, no wallet,

279
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,390
no ID, and very confused.

280
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,360
Thanks, Mags.

281
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,360
Right.

282
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,500
Where am I?

283
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,390
You are in the hospital.

284
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,460
Um... I'm Dr. Charles,

285
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,460
and this is Dr. Cuevas.

286
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,910
Uh, what's your name?

287
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,970
I, um...

288
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,510
I don't know.

289
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,150
Will.

290
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,520
Hey, you.

291
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,520
Hey.

292
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,420
I was hoping

293
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,420
I'd run into you.

294
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,860
Odds were in your favor.

295
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,860
I've been working a bunch

296
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,860
of double shifts.

297
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,790
Money troubles again.

298
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,790
Wait. What?

299
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,590
I heard you bought

300
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,590
a whole apartment building.

301
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,860
Long story.

302
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,400
What's... What's up

303
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,400
with your gig?

304
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,600
Oh, well, COVID burnout.

305
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,600
You know, hit the practice

306
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,600
really hard.

307
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,570
And you know what?

308
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,570
It's been a challenge,

309
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,410
but really rewarding.

310
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,510
I'm proud of you.

311
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,510
Thank you, Will.

312
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,710
So he doesn't know his name,

313
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,710
age, where he lives,

314
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,950
or how he ended up

315
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,950
wandering the streets.

316
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,120
I mean, you think

317
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,120
he's unhoused?

318
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,720
I'm not really

319
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,720
getting that vibe.

320
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,700
His clothes are clean,

321
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,700
they fit. Fingernails

322
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,700
are trimmed.

323
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,200
Well, he's clearly anxious

324
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,200
and in some sort of

325
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,200
dissociative state.

326
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,990
Could be drug induced

327
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,990
or self-medicating

328
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,990
mental illness.

329
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,600
Yeah, perhaps.

330
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,600
I mean, unless it's a stroke.

331
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,580
I didn't see any

332
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,580
facial paralysis

333
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,580
or muscle weakness.

334
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,740
Hmm, I was thinking

335
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,740
more atypical TIA.

336
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,040
Okay, well, since right now

337
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,040
it could be anything,

338
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:13,550
I'm gonna order head CT,

339
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:13,550
labs, tox screen,

340
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:13,550
chest X-ray, EKG,

341
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,020
EEG to check for subclinical

342
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,020
seizures, and CT to check

343
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,020
for stroke.

344
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,720
Excellent.

345
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,720
Sounds like a plan.

346
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,850
Okay.

347
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,800
Excuse me. Please,

348
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,800
could you help me?

349
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,770
My name is Elinor Whipple.

350
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,770
I fell last night.

351
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,810
Actually, this watch

352
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,810
that my son gave me

353
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,810
called the paramedics.

354
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,900
He lives in Oregon.

355
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,600
Oh, boy. Well,

356
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,600
are you all right?

357
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,770
You feeling better?

358
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,770
Oh, yeah.

359
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,610
I just have

360
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,610
a bruise on my hip.

361
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,710
You know, the doctor

362
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,710
discharged me hours ago

363
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,840
and the van was supposed to

364
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,840
drive me home, but it's been

365
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,840
a long time. Nobody's come.

366
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,080
Let me, uh... Let me see

367
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,080
if I can figure out

368
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,080
what's going on.

369
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,950
Okay? Um...

370
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,950
Thank you.

371
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,120
Mags, do you have

372
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,120
an update on Elinor

373
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,120
Whipple's transportation?

374
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,860
Medicar still hasn't come?

375
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,860
No.

376
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,730
I'm gonna make a call

377
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,730
and light a fire.

378
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,100
Thank you.

379
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,530
Maggie, the charge nurse,

380
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,630
is gonna call the company

381
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,630
and see what's happening.

382
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,640
I just want to go home.

383
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,230
My husband spent

384
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,230
his final weeks in hospice.

385
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,770
I don't like hospitals.

386
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,840
Why don't we see

387
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,840
if we can find you

388
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,840
a place to, um...

389
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,110
To sit while you wait.

390
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,620
Oh, thank you.

391
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,620
Okay?

392
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,650
I'm Dr. Charles, by the way.

393
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,650
Thank you, Dr. Charles.

394
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,920
Male, late 20s.

395
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,920
Stoned out of his mind.

396
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,990
Picked him up talking to a

397
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,990
mailbox. Wouldn't give a name.

398
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,790
Oh, my God, Devon.

399
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,790
You know him?

400
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,690
Yeah, sort of.

401
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,690
From med school.

402
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,960
Wait, wait!

403
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,960
Get off!

404
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,090
I'm out of here.

405
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,700
Come at me! Let's go!

406
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,000
Get back. Get back.

407
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,140
Hey.

408
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,290
Get off, man.

409
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,290
Taser, Taser!

410
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,990
No. Don't hit Ethan.

411
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,120
Pile on.

412
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,230
All right.

413
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,990
Ethan, are y'all

414
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,990
all right?

415
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,570
I'm good. Dean got

416
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,570
the worst of it.

417
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,690
Hey.

418
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,770
Wait. That's Devon. Seriously?

419
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,770
Guy who just went all

420
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,770
"Incredible Hulk"

421
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,250
is the dealer we're using

422
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,250
to treat Rose?

423
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,980
It gets worse. His tox report

424
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,980
just came back. Cocaine laced

425
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,980
with PCP.

426
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,750
PCP? Hold on, you told me

427
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,750
this guy was into party pills

428
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,120
and medicine cabinet pharma.

429
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,090
I thought he was.

430
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,290
We had to use him,

431
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,290
though. I mean, Rose

432
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,290
needed those meds.

433
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,730
She could've died.

434
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,270
We didn't have another play,

435
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,270
but that was then.

436
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,800
I mean, now, we have to

437
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,800
call the police.

438
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,300
Laced drugs? Come on.

439
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,070
Whoever gave them to Devon,

440
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,070
they have to be

441
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,070
off the street.

442
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,970
If we call PD,

443
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,970
they're gonna ask Devon

444
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,970
a lot of questions

445
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,640
and my name could come up.

446
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,210
Vanessa, as long as

447
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,210
there's a bad batch out there,

448
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,910
someone else could OD.

449
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,950
No, you're right.

450
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,950
We call CPD.

451
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,050
If I would've known Devon

452
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,050
was involved in hard drugs,

453
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,320
I would've

454
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,320
never suggested

455
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,320
going to him.

456
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,620
Hey. I know.

457
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,820
I think they

458
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,820
might be a thing.

459
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,660
Keep walking, Doris.

460
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,400
Easy, easy.

461
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
You're lucky

462
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
I tired him out for you.

463
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,840
Yeah, the way you went at him

464
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,840
with your face and ribs,

465
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,970
that was impressive.

466
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,870
Even smiling hurts,

467
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,870
all right?

468
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,710
'Cause your jaw's swollen.

469
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,710
Let me see your ribs.

470
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,180
All right, I got it.

471
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,180
I got it. I got it.

472
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,180
All right.

473
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,840
Flesh wound?

474
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,150
Oh, yeah, yeah.

475
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,150
Nice one.

476
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,240
Hey, Zach, do a work up.

477
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,150
No, no. First year

478
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,150
resident, no, no.

479
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,810
I don't think so.

480
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,810
Hey, come on.

481
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,390
We're still a teaching

482
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,390
hospital, Dean.

483
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,090
It's already been

484
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,090
a day, okay?

485
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,290
Just order me X-rays

486
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,290
for my ribs and a CT

487
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,290
for my jaw, will you, please?

488
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,260
Yeah, you got it, man.

489
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,100
Hey.

490
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,840
Man. I go upstairs

491
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,840
to deliver a baby

492
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,840
and miss all the action.

493
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,350
How you doing?

494
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,710
I'll live.

495
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,710
Okay.

496
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,790
If you need anything,

497
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,790
I'm around.

498
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,910
All right.

499
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,820
This is Nathaniel's

500
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,820
chest X-ray from

501
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,820
when he was admitted.

502
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,420
The left chest had

503
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,420
a hemopneumothorax.

504
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,130
The right chest,

505
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,130
however, was okay. Gene.

506
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,690
Now, his chest X-ray

507
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,690
from 30 minutes ago.

508
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,690
Night and day.

509
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,200
Wait, this happened

510
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,200
in 36 hours?

511
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,130
It caught me by surprise too.

512
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,870
Yeah.

513
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,000
Peter.

514
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry to interrupt.

515
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,940
Peter, what's going on?

516
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,980
Nathaniel has given

517
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,980
permission for the hospital

518
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,050
to share his medical

519
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,050
information with Mr. Dayton.

520
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,920
Now, I know this

521
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,920
is unorthodox,

522
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,920
but I built that train.

523
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,280
Nathaniel, he's been

524
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,280
with me for years

525
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,050
and my team,

526
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,050
they're more than

527
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,050
just employees.

528
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,820
They may as well be family.

529
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,460
Legal signed off on it.

530
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,360
Okay. Peter, thank you.

531
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,930
Bilateral multi-lobar

532
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,930
consolidation.

533
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,070
Heavy scarring,

534
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,070
inflammation.

535
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,070
Which means?

536
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,510
His lungs are destroyed,

537
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,510
but this much damage

538
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,510
this fast, how?

539
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,310
Only thing I can think of...

540
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,310
Train's batteries.

541
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,870
Mmm-hmm.

542
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,150
From when he

543
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,150
was trapped in

544
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,150
the conductor's compartment.

545
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,950
The tunnel was full

546
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,950
of moisture. Leaky lithium ion

547
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,950
batteries plus moisture?

548
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,890
Hydrofluoric acid.

549
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,460
Highly corrosive, toxic.

550
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,130
Nathaniel inhaled it.

551
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,130
So what's the fix?

552
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,260
At this point, a lung

553
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,260
transplant.

554
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,460
I'll put Nathaniel

555
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,460
on the list immediately.

556
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,800
In the meantime,

557
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,800
I'd like to get him off

558
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,800
the vent and onto ECMO.

559
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,000
Take some pressure

560
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,000
off his lungs.

561
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,200
I'm afraid ECMO's

562
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,200
not an option.

563
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,980
Tubing shortage.

564
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,050
The machine's down

565
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,050
until the shipment arrives.

566
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,450
When will that be?

567
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,820
Maybe two days, three?

568
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,120
People spend weeks

569
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,120
on ventilators.

570
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,780
Sometimes longer, right?

571
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,780
So maybe we're in good shape.

572
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,220
We're not.

573
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,790
Nathaniel's lungs

574
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,790
are so injured,

575
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,360
the vent's barely doing

576
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,360
the job and I've only

577
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,360
got a little wiggle room

578
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,960
with the settings

579
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,960
without risking

580
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,960
further damage.

581
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,500
Even with the vent,

582
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,500
we're sinking.

583
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,510
Fever notched up a bit.

584
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,080
I've just been laying here,

585
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,080
but I'm spent.

586
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,510
Your body's at war.

587
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,140
Unfortunately,

588
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,140
I don't know yet

589
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,140
what it's fighting against.

590
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,150
The labs and scans

591
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,150
didn't show anything?

592
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,980
Nothing definitive.

593
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,580
A mild enlargement

594
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,580
of the liver and spleens,

595
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,290
swollen lymph nodes,

596
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,290
global intestinal

597
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,290
inflammation.

598
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,160
So all viral symptoms,

599
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,160
but not pointing

600
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,160
in a specific direction.

601
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,230
Brock, you've got

602
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,230
an extensive

603
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,230
vaccination history.

604
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,240
I see the requirements

605
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,240
like mumps, measles, rubella.

606
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,570
Some optionals like flu and

607
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,570
COVID, but there are a few

608
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,570
that are, um...

609
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,340
only for international travel.

610
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,570
Have you left

611
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,570
the country recently?

612
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,410
No. Never.

613
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,410
I'm from Chicago.

614
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,580
I, uh...

615
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,080
I've been in Georgia

616
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,080
since graduating high school.

617
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,350
First, the south of Atlanta

618
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,350
then near the coast.

619
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,450
I just recently

620
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,450
moved back home.

621
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,430
Should we bring

622
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,430
in Infectious Diseases?

623
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,400
Uh, I could call a fellow,

624
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,400
but if there's been no travel,

625
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,300
then, uh, I don't think

626
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,300
she'll have anything

627
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,300
new to add.

628
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,030
Where do we go

629
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,030
from here then?

630
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,310
More labs.

631
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,640
Blood and stool cultures,

632
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,640
a mono spot test,

633
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,610
but I'll definitely put you on

634
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,610
empiric broad-spectrum

635
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,610
antibiotics.

636
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,280
Hopefully, we can

637
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,280
get that fever down.

638
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,650
So our mystery patient,

639
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,650
EEG and CT, both negative.

640
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,090
He didn't have a seizure

641
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,090
or stroke. Tox also negative,

642
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,090
so not drugs.

643
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,500
His electrolytes were

644
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,500
a little off, but I'm

645
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,500
not buying amnesia.

646
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
No, me neither.

647
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,230
I just hung a second bag of

648
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,230
fluids. He seems more alert

649
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,230
than when he came in.

650
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,060
Thank you, Nancy.

651
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,060
Good.

652
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,310
How you doing?

653
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,110
It's, uh...

654
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,110
It's Dr. Charles

655
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,110
and Dr. Cuevas again.

656
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,410
Do you remember us

657
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,410
from before?

658
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,410
Kind of.

659
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,350
Do you know

660
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,350
where you are?

661
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,440
Looks like the hospital.

662
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,440
Emergency room.

663
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,960
Mmm-hmm. And do you

664
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,960
know who you are?

665
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,290
Harris. I'm...

666
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,290
I'm Harris Bevel.

667
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,450
And how old

668
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,450
are you, Harris?

669
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,450
28.

670
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,190
And where do you live?

671
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,230
Wrigleyville.

672
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,230
Near the ballpark.

673
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,130
Wow. That's

674
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,130
the north side of town.

675
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,230
Do you know how you ended up

676
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,230
here in the West Loop?

677
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
No. I'm not sure.

678
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't know why

679
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
I would be outside.

680
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,270
I... I don't know

681
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,270
why I would take that risk.

682
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,240
What do you mean by that?

683
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,240
Taking the risk.

684
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,210
It's dangerous outside.

685
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,210
It's... It's hard to hide.

686
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,110
You got to always have

687
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,110
a hiding spot.

688
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,710
Okay. Okay.

689
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,060
Yeah, well, I noticed you

690
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,060
haven't really touched your

691
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,060
sandwich. What? No appetite?

692
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,290
Uh... Didn't have

693
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,290
the energy. I'm...

694
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,060
I'm tired. I don't sleep

695
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,060
that much.

696
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,960
So is that having

697
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,960
a hard time falling asleep,

698
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,190
having a hard time

699
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,190
staying asleep...

700
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,560
Yeah, yeah, that one.

701
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:54,440
Every night, 3:00 a.m.,

702
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:54,440
I'm wide awake thinking,

703
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,600
you know, worrying.

704
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,200
About anything

705
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,200
in particular?

706
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,440
No. Just...

707
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,740
everything.

708
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,020
Yeah. I... I get it.

709
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,580
That happens to me

710
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,580
sometimes too.

711
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,550
It does?

712
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,550
Oh, yeah.

713
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,060
Sometimes the world just...

714
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,570
moves too fast. You know?

715
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,000
What about family, Harris?

716
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,000
Anyone live nearby?

717
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,600
Uh, no. Tucson.

718
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,200
Any friends?

719
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,040
I have... I haven't

720
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,040
seen them in a while.

721
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,210
Okay. You know what?

722
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,210
That's been really

723
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,210
helpful. Um...

724
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,180
Dr. Cuevas and I are gonna

725
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,180
step out for bit.

726
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,770
Do you mind hanging out

727
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,770
for a little while?

728
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,080
No.

729
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,080
We'll be back soon, okay?

730
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,450
If I were a gambler,

731
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,230
I'd bet big

732
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,230
on Harris having

733
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,230
undiagnosed depression.

734
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,700
I don't disagree.

735
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,700
I don't think

736
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,700
he's a suicide risk,

737
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,240
but I'm just not crazy

738
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,240
about discharging him, either.

739
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,360
Yeah, me too.

740
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,240
One problem,

741
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,240
psych unit's full,

742
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,440
and I used up all the TRC

743
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,440
options this morning.

744
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,170
I'm gonna call up

745
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,170
there anyway.

746
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,170
I mean, you never know.

747
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,440
There could be

748
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,440
somebody's on a hold

749
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,440
who's expiring today,

750
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,310
getting discharged early.

751
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,310
It's worth a shot.

752
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,180
Okay. I'll call

753
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,180
Harris' family. See if

754
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,180
I can get more of a history.

755
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,590
Excellent.

756
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,820
I need some help,

757
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,820
Dr. Charles.

758
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,690
Patients are piling up.

759
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,690
I need trauma two back.

760
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,260
Elinor's still here?

761
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,560
Yeah, I called Medicar

762
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,560
three times. They're

763
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,560
short on drivers.

764
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,500
Skip them all together

765
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,500
and call Uber or taxi?

766
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,270
No, no, no,

767
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,270
let's stick with

768
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,270
medical transport.

769
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,430
I mean, at least

770
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,430
we know them.

771
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,530
Copy that,

772
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,530
but I still need

773
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,530
the room.

774
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,140
Mags, do you mind if we just

775
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,140
set up a chair for her

776
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,140
in the nursing station?

777
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,370
I know it's not ideal,

778
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,810
but she's just had

779
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,810
a really rough day.

780
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,110
Yeah. I'll find a corner.

781
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,110
Thank you very much.

782
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,350
Okay.

783
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,650
So news?

784
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,350
A pair of lungs

785
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,350
has become available.

786
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,830
Well, that's great.

787
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,760
The donor died in

788
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,760
a car crash. These lungs

789
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,760
are beat up pretty good.

790
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,770
Will they work?

791
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,770
No, not right now,

792
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,670
but I believe with EVLP,

793
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,670
they can be resuscitated.

794
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,430
EVLP?

795
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,430
Yeah.

796
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,200
Ex vivo lung perfusion.

797
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,250
Instead of sitting on ice,

798
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,250
the donor lungs are attached

799
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,870
to a machine that

800
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,870
circulates blood through them.

801
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,650
Well, thank God

802
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,650
for tech, huh?

803
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,380
There is one issue.

804
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,320
The hospital doesn't have an

805
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,320
EVLP machine.

806
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,260
Supply chain disruptions

807
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,260
have led to a delay

808
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,260
in delivery.

809
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,490
Why are we talking about EVLP

810
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,490
if we don't have the machine?

811
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,530
We think that you

812
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,530
and your engineering team

813
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,800
can build an EVLP machine

814
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,800
using parts from machines

815
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,430
that are already

816
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,430
in the hospital.

817
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,130
All the schematics

818
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,130
are online.

819
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,900
Here's the thing, Jack.

820
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,870
If we pass on these lungs,

821
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,770
I don't think

822
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,770
another pair will

823
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,770
become available in time.

824
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,410
So, intricate machinery,

825
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,410
a ticking clock,

826
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,410
and a life at stake.

827
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,360
Yeah. It is

828
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,360
a monumental challenge.

829
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,360
No question.

830
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,690
Well then, I'm on board.

831
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,160
Excellent.

832
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,160
Great.

833
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,370
The police.

834
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,520
Multiple non-displaced

835
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,520
lateral rib fractures.

836
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

837
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,720
Heavy contusions.

838
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,420
Yeah, yeah. My jaw.

839
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,650
Dislocated temporomandibular

840
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,650
joint. It needs

841
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,650
to be reduced.

842
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,360
All right.

843
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,360
Grab Ethan.

844
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,730
He's with a patient.

845
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,860
Dr. Halstead and Dr. Taylor

846
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,860
are busy also, but I'm free.

847
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,770
How many jaw reductions

848
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,770
have you done?

849
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,280
Get Asher.

850
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,510
Patients all over

851
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,510
the place.

852
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,790
A battle royale

853
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,790
in the football.

854
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,520
I guess it's just another day

855
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,520
in the ED, huh?

856
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,460
You miss the action?

857
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,530
Yeah. A little.

858
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,360
But really,

859
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,360
I miss y'all.

860
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,970
What are you doing

861
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,970
this evening?

862
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,800
X-ray tech Mike

863
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,800
moonlights as a DJ.

864
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,900
He's spinning tonight.

865
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,900
A bunch of us are going.

866
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,500
We can dance away

867
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,500
the day like we used to.

868
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,810
I'm in.

869
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,810
Yeah?

870
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,380
- Yeah.

871
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,380
- Nice.

872
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,510
Soon.

873
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,510
Okay.

874
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,610
Oh, and apparently we have

875
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,610
a lot to catch up on.

876
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,250
Yeah.

877
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,560
Full disclosure,

878
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,560
it's been a decade

879
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,660
since I've reduced a jaw,

880
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,660
but I just watched one

881
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,530
on YouTube, so see one,

882
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,530
do one, right?

883
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,540
That's not funny.

884
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,040
It's a little funny.

885
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,040
It's not funny.

886
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,770
Okay. Here we go.

887
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,570
Open up.

888
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,510
Let's do this. Ready?

889
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,510
Uh-huh.

890
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,270
One, two...

891
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,270
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

892
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,010
Damn.

893
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,380
Holy...

894
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,980
You're welcome.

895
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,480
Ah.

896
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,830
Hey.

897
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,800
The empiric antibiotics

898
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,800
aren't doing anything.

899
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,700
His fever's

900
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,700
still ticking up,

901
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,600
now he's having

902
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,600
trouble breathing.

903
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
And his belly pain?

904
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
It's worse.

905
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,670
Is there anything

906
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,670
in the latest labs?

907
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,500
No. Mono test was negative.

908
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,700
The blood cultures

909
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,700
are unremarkable so far,

910
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,040
but his lymphocytes

911
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,040
were on the high side.

912
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,410
You're thinking lymphoma.

913
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,340
It's been in the back

914
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,340
of my mind all day.

915
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,050
I just didn't want to jump

916
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,050
straight to the worst option.

917
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,550
Well, I still don't.

918
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,930
His sed rate and CRP

919
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,930
are high.

920
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,030
Rising inflammatory

921
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,030
markers could point

922
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,030
to an autoimmune issue.

923
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,760
Kawasaki disease?

924
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,960
Kawasaki primarily affects

925
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,960
children and often presents

926
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,960
with a telltale rash.

927
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,770
That wasn't one of

928
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,770
Brock's symptoms.

929
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,470
Doesn't rule it out, though.

930
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,780
It could just be

931
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,780
an odd presentation.

932
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,040
You know what?

933
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,040
You're right. Uh...

934
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,980
I don't think it's Kawasaki,

935
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,980
but you've given me a thought.

936
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,020
I want to run one more test.

937
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,720
Okay, I like it.

938
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,520
Arterial and venous tubing

939
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,520
from a dialysis machine.

940
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,400
Pumps, oxygenator,

941
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,400
gas and heat exchanger

942
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,400
from an ECMO.

943
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,600
Bits and pieces

944
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,600
of an enclosure bed and

945
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,600
added plastic for the housing.

946
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,000
It's not fancy,

947
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,000
but I think it's gonna work.

948
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,070
You're not sold.

949
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,670
I don't like the housing.

950
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,500
It's too flimsy.

951
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,500
It's got to be stronger.

952
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,480
It can't tear.

953
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,480
It can't collapse.

954
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,050
I mean,

955
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,050
this is what holds

956
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,050
the donor lungs.

957
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,050
Yeah, the lungs,

958
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,050
they're precious.

959
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,790
They have to be

960
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,790
treated as such.

961
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,020
Cradled. Hmm.

962
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,060
Like a newborn.

963
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,660
How about an incubator?

964
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,430
Yeah. Hey, Alex, baby floor.

965
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,430
Get me an incubator.

966
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,510
Donor lungs have arrived.

967
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,970
Great. Let's take a look.

968
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,730
Thank you.

969
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,880
Oh, geez.

970
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,180
It's worse shape

971
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,180
than I thought.

972
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,580
Yeah, but seven, eight hours

973
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,580
of perfusion and aeration...

974
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,050
I'm cautiously optimistic.

975
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,720
How long until the machine

976
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,720
is ready?

977
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,660
Five minutes.

978
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,660
Prep the donor lungs.

979
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,790
Sharon.

980
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,790
We have a situation in the ED.

981
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,440
I cannot believe you put

982
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,440
this hospital in that kind

983
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,440
of legal jeopardy.

984
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,880
And yourselves.

985
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,640
You are to fully cooperate

986
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,640
with these detectives.

987
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,980
Is that understood?

988
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,080
Okay.

989
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,020
What the hell is going on?

990
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,660
Will and Vanessa

991
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,660
went rogue. It's bad.

992
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,200
Bought meds

993
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,200
off a drug dealer.

994
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,230
That guy.

995
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,140
What's your pain level now,

996
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,140
one through ten?

997
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,550
Thirty-five.

998
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,150
IV fentanyl isn't doing it.

999
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,990
The line's working fine.

1000
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,660
I've... I've reduced dozens

1001
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,660
of jaws. I've treated

1002
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,660
thousands of broken ribs.

1003
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,890
Pain meds help

1004
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,890
those patients, they

1005
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,890
should be helping me, yeah?

1006
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,270
Here, let me...

1007
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,270
Let me see

1008
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,270
my chart, please.

1009
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,040
Are you kidding me?

1010
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,140
Get Dr. Asher in here now.

1011
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,010
Oh, hey.

1012
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,750
So I was able to free up a bed

1013
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,750
in the psych unit for Harris,

1014
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,750
so that's good.

1015
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,190
That's great, because I think

1016
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,190
his depression stems from

1017
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,190
childhood PTSD.

1018
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,620
Really?

1019
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,750
Do you remember

1020
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,750
a couple weeks ago that

1021
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,750
shooting on Clark Street?

1022
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,830
Yeah, that guy

1023
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,830
with all the body armor.

1024
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,660
Like, 2,000 rounds of ammun...

1025
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,940
That was at Wrigleyville

1026
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,940
where Harris says he lives.

1027
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,700
And it turns out that all went

1028
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,700
down in front of Harris'

1029
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,700
apartment building.

1030
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,010
Oh, my God. So he, like...

1031
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,010
He saw the whole thing?

1032
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,100
He heard it. I just talked

1033
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,100
to his sister in Tucson,

1034
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,770
and she said that he locked

1035
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,770
himself in the apartment

1036
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,820
and laid low in the closet.

1037
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,150
So he was never

1038
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,150
in danger,

1039
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,880
but apparently

1040
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,880
since that day,

1041
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,880
he's just been off.

1042
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,090
Yeah, this morning he said,

1043
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,090
"It's dangerous outside.

1044
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,820
"You always need to find

1045
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,820
a hiding spot."

1046
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,990
Talking about mass shootings.

1047
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,760
I was in sixth grade

1048
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,760
when I had my first

1049
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,760
active shooter drill,

1050
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,000
and speaking from experience,

1051
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,000
they're terrifying.

1052
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,940
So it's reasonable to think

1053
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,940
that this incident

1054
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,810
triggered some deep-rooted

1055
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,810
fears that led us

1056
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,810
to where we are now.

1057
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,640
I mean, in my day,

1058
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,640
it was, you know,

1059
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,640
it was air raid drill

1060
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,810
in case of

1061
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,810
nuclear frickin' war.

1062
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,850
Duck and cover, you know?

1063
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,850
Your patient.

1064
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,850
Harris Bevel, he's gone.

1065
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,950
What?

1066
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,950
I'm gonna call the other EDs

1067
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,050
and see if he shows up

1068
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,050
at one of them.

1069
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,850
I'll reach out to CPD,

1070
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,850
ask them to do a welfare check

1071
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,850
at his apartment.

1072
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,930
I'll call security

1073
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,930
in case somebody

1074
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,930
saw him leave.

1075
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,360
All right.

1076
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,360
You underdosed...

1077
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,260
You underdosed me.

1078
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,260
Come here.

1079
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,840
Come here.

1080
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,130
All right, I'm 6'0, 180.

1081
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,900
The healthy, responsible

1082
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,900
dose of fentanyl for me

1083
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,710
would be 150 mics.

1084
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,710
You gave me 25.

1085
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,910
I'm so sorry.

1086
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,950
I got a dislocated jaw

1087
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,950
and broken ribs,

1088
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,950
not a papercut.

1089
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,680
I'll fix it. 150 mics.

1090
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,680
I'll put in the order.

1091
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,780
Do it.

1092
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,920
Oh, now the doctors

1093
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,920
are fighting with each other?

1094
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,660
I just want to

1095
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,660
go home, please.

1096
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,040
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.

1097
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,040
I know you're uncomfortable.

1098
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,770
"Never say die."

1099
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,310
That's the spirit.

1100
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,980
I'll be right back.

1101
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,150
Vent's not cutting it.

1102
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,250
Donor lungs have only been

1103
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,250
perfusing for four hours.

1104
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,190
Is that long enough?

1105
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,190
It's gonna have to be.

1106
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,970
Please have answers.

1107
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,100
I do.

1108
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,040
The last lab I ran

1109
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,040
was a COVID antibody test.

1110
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,170
It was positive.

1111
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,170
I have COVID?

1112
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,300
No. You had COVID.

1113
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,040
Your symptoms now

1114
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,040
are the lasting effects

1115
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,040
of the virus.

1116
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,950
You're thinking MIS.

1117
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,950
What's that?

1118
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:51,010
Multisystem inflammatory

1119
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:51,010
syndrome. It's a condition

1120
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:51,010
associated with COVID-19.

1121
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,420
It can impact the heart,

1122
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,420
lungs, kidneys, brain,

1123
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,990
or gastrointestinal organs.

1124
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,460
It's rare and it's been

1125
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,460
affecting children.

1126
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,100
And it's only been found

1127
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,100
in a handful of adults.

1128
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,930
That's why it wasn't

1129
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,930
on our radar until

1130
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,930
everything else was ruled out.

1131
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,340
Few months ago,

1132
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,340
I had a couple weeks

1133
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,340
of complete exhaustion.

1134
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,210
I COVID tested multiple times,

1135
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,210
rapid and PCR,

1136
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,840
but the results

1137
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,840
were always negative.

1138
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,950
I probably had it,

1139
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,950
didn't I?

1140
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,810
Yeah, very likely.

1141
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,250
It threw my world into chaos,

1142
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,250
especially at work.

1143
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,380
Yeah, I couldn't pull

1144
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,380
my weight at all.

1145
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,980
Boss got on me.

1146
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,290
Colleagues didn't trust me.

1147
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,870
It all got to be too much,

1148
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,870
so I... I bolted.

1149
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,400
I left in the middle

1150
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,400
of the night.

1151
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,400
Went home.

1152
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm sorry, man. I, uh...

1153
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,410
I know how physical setbacks

1154
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,410
can upend your life,

1155
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,840
but they don't have to

1156
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,840
hold you down forever.

1157
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,940
MIS is manageable

1158
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,940
with high dose steroids,

1159
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,180
and you can get back

1160
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,180
to your life.

1161
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,750
Return to work in Savannah.

1162
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,090
That's where you said you were

1163
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,090
most recently living, right?

1164
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,130
No, he just said

1165
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,130
near the coast.

1166
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,930
Oh, my mistake.

1167
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,760
Anyway, I'm gonna have

1168
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,760
to admit you for treatment

1169
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,500
and a nurse will be by

1170
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,500
to start the paperwork.

1171
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,370
Okay? April, speak

1172
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,370
with you a moment?

1173
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,280
Is Brock AWOL?

1174
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,890
The engine he works on,

1175
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,890
the Honeywell AGT1500,

1176
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,220
it powers the M1 Abrams.

1177
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,220
That's an army tank.

1178
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,320
The army's third infantry

1179
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,320
uses that tank.

1180
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,450
They're based at Fort Stewart,

1181
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,450
Savannah, Georgia.

1182
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,120
Near the coast.

1183
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,430
Third ID also has

1184
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,430
soldiers in Africa.

1185
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,900
Looking at Brock's vaccination

1186
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,900
history, if he had to deploy

1187
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,900
there, he could.

1188
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,200
I know Brock is army,

1189
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,300
but when he said,

1190
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,300
"left in the middle

1191
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,300
of the night,"

1192
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,470
did that mean

1193
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,470
he was on active duty

1194
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,470
and went AWOL?

1195
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,490
That's why

1196
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,490
you didn't want me

1197
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,490
taking this case.

1198
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,290
You thought if I found out,

1199
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,290
I'd turn him in.

1200
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,980
Can you blame me?

1201
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,330
Ethan, when it comes

1202
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,330
to the military, you've

1203
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,330
rarely looked the other way.

1204
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,960
No, guess I haven't.

1205
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,430
I assume you're

1206
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,430
gonna call the MPs.

1207
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,470
No, I'm not.

1208
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,050
I wasn't expecting that.

1209
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,270
Guess the world's not

1210
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,270
so black and white anymore.

1211
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,580
Still, skipping out

1212
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,580
on a commitment

1213
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,580
is a serious offense,

1214
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:39,330
so whether he goes back

1215
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:39,330
to his unit or gets out

1216
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:39,330
of the army altogether,

1217
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,890
he's gonna need some help.

1218
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,590
I am texting you a contact

1219
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,590
to a military attorney.

1220
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,070
Will you pass it on to Brock?

1221
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,030
Absolutely.

1222
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,640
Security didn't see Harris.

1223
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,640
You check the local ED?

1224
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,250
Hasn't turned up and CPD's

1225
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,250
welfare check came up dry too.

1226
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,420
Dr. Charles,

1227
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,420
just heard back

1228
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,420
from Medicar dispatch.

1229
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,650
Elinor's van is gonna be

1230
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,650
in the main entrance

1231
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,650
in three minutes.

1232
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,260
What? They told me

1233
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,260
Ambo Bay in an hour.

1234
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,560
Well, welcome to my world.

1235
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,160
The left hand has no idea

1236
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,160
what the right hand is doing.

1237
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,000
Grab me a wheelchair, please.

1238
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,000
Okay.

1239
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,200
Elinor, guess what?

1240
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,200
Your ride is finally arriving.

1241
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,170
I haven't taken

1242
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,170
my blood pressure

1243
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,170
or cholesterol pills

1244
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,010
or my arthritis.

1245
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,010
My joints really hurt.

1246
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,010
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1247
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,010
Well, you know what?

1248
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,410
You're gonna be home

1249
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,410
before you know it and you

1250
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,410
can take all your meds then.

1251
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,680
When will that be?

1252
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,180
Now. Right now.

1253
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,980
Come on.

1254
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,980
Well, it's about time.

1255
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,990
I have been waiting here

1256
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,990
since last night.

1257
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,990
You can't do this to people.

1258
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,360
You are absolutely right,

1259
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,360
which is why we need to

1260
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,330
get you out of here

1261
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,330
as quickly as possible.

1262
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,560
Did she eat or drink

1263
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,560
anything today?

1264
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,560
I don't know.

1265
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,300
I reached out to Upton

1266
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,300
at CPD.

1267
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
She thinks even

1268
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
with Devon's statement

1269
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
and your confession,

1270
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,700
the state's department

1271
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,700
is unlikely to pursue charges.

1272
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,510
That's a relief.

1273
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,510
Yeah.

1274
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,170
Hopefully, we dodged

1275
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,170
one bullet.

1276
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,510
Just have to see

1277
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,510
if the hospital hits us

1278
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,380
with disciplinary action.

1279
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,380
How's Devon doing?

1280
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,080
Drugs are out of his system,

1281
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,080
so he's gonna be okay.

1282
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,990
For real, Will?

1283
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,960
Buying drugs off the street,

1284
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,400
and then you just

1285
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,400
pull Vanessa into it?

1286
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,330
It's a little more

1287
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,330
complicated than that.

1288
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,560
I mean, you want

1289
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,560
to risk your own career,

1290
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,560
I mean, that's fine.

1291
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,540
But don't...

1292
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,540
Maggie.

1293
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,700
Don't risk Vanessa's.

1294
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,180
Where's the van?

1295
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,180
You said it was here.

1296
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,260
I'm sure it's just

1297
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,260
stuck in traffic.

1298
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,260
I'm sure it'll be here

1299
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,260
any minute.

1300
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,260
I'll call them.

1301
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,660
Hey, Elinor. Can you breathe

1302
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,660
with me? Slow and deep

1303
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,660
just like this.

1304
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,410
Yeah, I'm at the main entrance

1305
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,410
with Elinor Whipple.

1306
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,570
There's no van.

1307
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,570
Please do not put me on hold.

1308
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,320
How do the donor lungs

1309
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,320
look to you?

1310
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,550
Better than when

1311
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,550
they came in. Riley,

1312
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,550
can you open it up, please?

1313
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,480
Okay.

1314
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,160
Ah, finally.

1315
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,200
Look, Elinor.

1316
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,200
The van's here.

1317
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,200
There it is.

1318
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,740
I don't even

1319
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,740
care anymore.

1320
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,610
I'm so tired.

1321
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,610
I just want this

1322
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,610
whole thing

1323
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,610
to be over.

1324
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,370
Uh...

1325
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,050
Is that just venting

1326
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,050
or is that a threat

1327
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,050
of self-harm?

1328
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,390
I don't know.

1329
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,830
Sorry it took us so long.

1330
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,830
It's our eighth

1331
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,830
run of the day.

1332
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,150
Still got two more.

1333
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,290
Okay. Well,

1334
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,290
you're here now.

1335
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,060
Guess what, Elinor?

1336
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,060
It's finally time to go home.

1337
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,430
Let's get you

1338
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,430
into the van...

1339
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,160
You're hurting me. Get away.

1340
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,440
We're just trying to help you

1341
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,440
get home. Do you want

1342
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,440
to get in the van, Elinor?

1343
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,570
What's going on?

1344
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,310
She's exhausted,

1345
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,310
in pain. She missed

1346
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,310
her daily medication.

1347
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,540
Hasn't eaten all day,

1348
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,540
and she's likely dehydrated.

1349
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,520
I don't think we can

1350
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,520
take her like this.

1351
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,650
Yeah, well, I'm not

1352
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,650
gonna let you anyway.

1353
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,720
Okay, well, at least

1354
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,720
we have a bed.

1355
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,160
I'll call psych.

1356
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,160
Tell them we're

1357
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,160
on our way up.

1358
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,200
Gave her 0.5 of Xanax

1359
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,200
to calm her down.

1360
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,710
You know, fluids,

1361
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,710
good night's sleep,

1362
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,600
getting her back

1363
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,600
on her regular med schedule's

1364
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,370
gonna help a lot and then

1365
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,370
we'll go from there.

1366
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,480
We move mountains to be

1367
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,480
in a position to open up

1368
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,480
space for Harris,

1369
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,610
a man seriously

1370
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,610
in need of help,

1371
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,650
but now he's

1372
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,650
in the wind

1373
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,650
and Elinor,

1374
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,590
who should've

1375
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,590
been home hours ago,

1376
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,590
is in the psych unit.

1377
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,320
Irony sucks.

1378
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,520
Yeah.

1379
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,570
Pushing the rock uphill

1380
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,570
and we're not even

1381
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,570
helping people.

1382
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,430
We're just creating

1383
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,430
patients along the way.

1384
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,840
Maybe

1385
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,840
my parents were right.

1386
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,910
Not much to do

1387
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,910
for busted ribs

1388
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,910
except ice them down.

1389
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,720
Maybe this Velcro binder...

1390
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,720
Oh, thanks.

1391
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,550
Will help keep

1392
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,550
the packs in place.

1393
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,780
Yeah.

1394
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,790
Moving, breathing,

1395
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,790
feels like I'm

1396
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,790
being stabbed.

1397
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,260
Good times.

1398
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,350
I'll just put this

1399
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,350
in your bag.

1400
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,350
Thank you.

1401
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,430
Uh, listen, um...

1402
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,430
I'm sorry for blowing up

1403
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,430
on you earlier.

1404
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,940
It's the pain talking.

1405
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,940
Dean, no.

1406
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,570
Everything that

1407
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,570
happened today,

1408
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,570
that is totally on me

1409
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,880
and my complicated history

1410
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,880
with opiates.

1411
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,610
Okay, I know

1412
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,610
their dark side,

1413
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,210
so my instinct is

1414
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,210
to protect people

1415
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,210
from getting sucked in.

1416
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,290
I know I was

1417
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,290
projecting, but...

1418
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,290
No, it's okay.

1419
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,380
It's okay. I get it.

1420
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,490
All right.

1421
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,830
Can I give you a hand

1422
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,830
with your bag?

1423
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,830
Uh...

1424
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,430
I'll help you out.

1425
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:31,410
Ah, Dr. Taylor,

1426
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:31,410
Dr. Halstead, a moment.

1427
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,780
So the board is not happy

1428
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,850
that two of our ED doctors

1429
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,850
went to a street dealer.

1430
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,680
That was...

1431
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,680
I'm sorry...

1432
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,320
But they're not going to press

1433
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,320
the matter any further.

1434
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,430
You're good doctors.

1435
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,430
You're fighting

1436
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,430
for your patients

1437
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,940
and you're being put

1438
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,940
in an untenable situation.

1439
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,700
And I'm sorry about that.

1440
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,600
I... I understand

1441
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,600
with your backs

1442
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,600
up against the wall

1443
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,700
how you'd need to look

1444
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,700
for creative solutions.

1445
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,620
All I ask is that

1446
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,620
in the future,

1447
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,620
you give me a heads up.

1448
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,420
He's back?

1449
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,430
Walked in a few minutes ago.

1450
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,700
Have you talked

1451
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,700
to him yet?

1452
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,430
Briefly, but he specifically

1453
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,430
asked to speak to you.

1454
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,970
Me?

1455
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,970
Yeah.

1456
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,040
I mean, he feels rapport

1457
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,040
because you connected

1458
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,040
with him today,

1459
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,750
and I saw it happen.

1460
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,780
Nellie, of course the system

1461
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,780
is deeply flawed,

1462
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,850
and it often feels like

1463
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,850
wins can be really hard

1464
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,850
to come by,

1465
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,830
but you got one today.

1466
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,560
So... So good work,

1467
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,560
Doctor.

1468
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,500
Really.

1469
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,500
Thanks.

1470
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,940
Dr. Marcel.

1471
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,440
Yeah. Hey.

1472
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,840
You already started

1473
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,840
weaning the vent?

1474
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,880
Uh... The new lungs

1475
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,880
are working. Uh...

1476
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,710
I hope to try an SBT tomorrow,

1477
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,710
but we're off to a good start.

1478
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,310
Well, internet's

1479
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,310
gonna blow up.

1480
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,950
I got 30 million

1481
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,950
social media followers waiting

1482
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,950
to hear how this story ends.

1483
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,690
Yeah, Med's gonna

1484
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,690
go viral, huh?

1485
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,490
Not just Med, Dr. Marcel.

1486
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,660
You saved Nathaniel's life

1487
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,660
twice now.

1488
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,960
Both in spectacular fashion.

1489
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,590
What are you on,

1490
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,590
by the way?

1491
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,330
Twitter, Insta, TikTok?

1492
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,330
None of the above.

1493
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,000
Ah, well, no worries.

1494
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,010
I'll text my PR team.

1495
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,010
Set up accounts for you.

1496
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,810
In the meantime,

1497
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,810
get ready for what comes next.

1498
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,680
What's that?

1499
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,940
Fame.

1500
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,860
Put your hands up! Yeah!

1501
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,030
When I'm gone

1502
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,900
When I'm gone

1503
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,900
I'm never really gone

1504
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,030
You think you're moving on

1505
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,040
But it won't be for long

1506
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,040
You'll see

1507
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,770
When I'm gone

1508
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,770
I'm never really gone

1509
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,850
You think you're moving on

1510
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,710
But no one's gonna feel like

1511
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,710
Feel like me

1512
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,810
I'm tired of you

1513
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,810
Touch you like I do

1514
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,620
Know you never forget

1515
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,990
When I'm gone

1516
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,990
I'm never really gone

1517
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,030
You think you're moving on

1518
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,570
But no one's gonna feel like

1519
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,570
Feel like me
