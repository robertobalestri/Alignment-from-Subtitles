1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,430
We have a seat opening up

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,430
on the board.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,060
Are you familiar

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,060
with George Thomas?

5
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm not trying to be

6
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,200
a part of your board

7
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,240
so I can be a mouthpiece for

8
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,240
some special interest groups.

9
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,540
I'm all ears.

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,470
I think that you got

11
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,470
a lot invested in 2.0.

12
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,070
I'm not gonna gamble

13
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,070
with a patient's life

14
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,650
just so I can show off

15
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,650
my shiny new toy.

16
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,010
The real-time

17
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,010
data's insufficient.

18
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,280
Imaging is inadequate.

19
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,690
What am I supposed

20
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,690
to do here?

21
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,180
The hospital is flying in

22
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,180
workers if we walk out.

23
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,990
They're flying in scabs?

24
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,160
I don't ever tell you

25
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,160
how to do your job.

26
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,460
And I'm not telling you

27
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,460
how to do yours.

28
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,560
I'm telling you

29
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,560
people are scared

30
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,260
'cause they can't afford

31
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,260
to miss a paycheck.

32
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,570
Dignity, respect,

33
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,570
more money in our checks.

34
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,300
Dignity, respect,

35
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,300
more money in our checks.

36
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,510
Dignity, respect,

37
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,510
more money in our...

38
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,050
Give me a second, okay?

39
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,070
Sharon.

40
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,050
Daniel.

41
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,050
You're striking?

42
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,180
No. I'm just, you know,

43
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,180
showing solidarity,

44
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,050
which I believe I'm allowed

45
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,050
to do on my day off.

46
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,180
You are.

47
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,520
Look, I know that

48
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,520
this whole labor dispute

49
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,600
has been complicated

50
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,600
for us.

51
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,600
It is.

52
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,330
I just want you to know

53
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,330
I support the service workers,

54
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,530
and it's very important

55
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,530
for me to feel

56
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,540
that Liliana feels like

57
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,540
I have her back.

58
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,110
Okay, Daniel.

59
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,110
All right.

60
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,400
Just stay warm

61
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,400
out here.

62
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,400
Thank you.

63
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,070
See you tomorrow.

64
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,070
Okay.

65
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,240
Dignity, respect,

66
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,240
more money in our checks.

67
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,250
It means a lot

68
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,250
to me, Daniel,

69
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,720
and my friends,

70
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,190
you being out here

71
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,190
in the cold with all of us.

72
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,480
Are you kidding me?

73
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,390
We get to hang out

74
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,390
together, and, I mean,

75
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,550
you are very attractive,

76
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,550
which is a bonus.

77
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,650
Oh.

78
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,790
It is.

79
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,790
Hey.

80
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,260
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

81
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,260
There's a little

82
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,260
foot traffic outside.

83
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,170
Hard to navigate.

84
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,170
I noticed.

85
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,800
I already got your coffee.

86
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,800
Oh, thanks.

87
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,440
Thanks for meeting me.

88
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,440
Yeah, of course.

89
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,440
What's going on?

90
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,700
Well, um,

91
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,700
I'm working the steps

92
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,250
in NA with my sponsor,

93
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,710
and I'm up to step nine.

94
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,410
Oh, yeah?

95
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,410
Okay, that's good.

96
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
Step nine is making amends

97
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
with the people

98
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
you've harmed.

99
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,690
Oh, well, you don't

100
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,690
have to do that.

101
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,690
Yes, I do.

102
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,090
Anyway, I'm sorry

103
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,090
for not showing up

104
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,130
to that job interview

105
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,130
you arranged at O'Hare.

106
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,260
Oh, you're going way back,

107
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,260
aren't you?

108
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,770
And for that time I stole

109
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,770
Grandpa's pocket watch

110
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,240
and hocked it for cash.

111
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,500
And, um,

112
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,210
this one

113
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,210
really haunts me, uh...

114
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,250
that time I said

115
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,250
Mom drinks because of you.

116
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,650
Yeah. Water under the bridge.

117
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,620
Have you talked

118
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,620
to her at all?

119
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,880
Do you know where she is?

120
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,250
Well, last I heard, uh,

121
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,250
she quit rehab.

122
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,450
But it's actually later

123
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,450
than I thought,

124
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,590
and, I got to get...

125
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,590
Get to work.

126
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,600
Maybe we can pick this up

127
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,600
another time, all right?

128
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,900
Okay.

129
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,900
Thanks for the coffee.

130
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,310
Going to treatment six.

131
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,600
All the attendees

132
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,600
are occupied,

133
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,600
so you've got me.

134
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,610
David Sullivan, 18 years old.

135
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,370
BP 118/77, heart rate 99.

136
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,740
His parents called 911.

137
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
David fainted,

138
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,820
probably 'cause he hasn't

139
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,820
eaten anything in days.

140
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,910
But it's even worse

141
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,910
than that.

142
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,620
He's saying some

143
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,620
pretty horrible stuff.

144
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,420
Okay. Hey, David.

145
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,420
I'm Dr. Asher.

146
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,650
Can you tell me

147
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,650
what's going on?

148
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,350
Go away.

149
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,460
All right, on my count.

150
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,430
One, two, three.

151
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,360
We came in with David

152
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,360
six months ago.

153
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,570
Dr. Charles and Dr. Cuevas

154
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,570
diagnosed him with

155
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,570
schizoaffective disorder.

156
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,940
Are they...

157
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,940
Are they here?

158
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,870
Uh, Dr. Charles

159
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,870
isn't working today,

160
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,870
but Dr. Cuevas is.

161
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,610
Can you call Dr. Cuevas

162
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,610
for me, please?

163
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,380
Leave me alone!

164
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,350
David, we just want

165
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,350
to check you out.

166
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,720
It won't matter.

167
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,680
Nothing matters.

168
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,930
Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan.

169
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,220
Hi.

170
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,350
David, hi.

171
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,300
Do you remember me?

172
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,300
Dr. Cuevas?

173
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,960
I don't need a doctor.

174
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,200
Okay. Can you tell me

175
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,200
why you think that?

176
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,200
I know.

177
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,810
David, are the voices

178
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,810
talking to you?

179
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,610
Maybe if you tell me what

180
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,610
they're saying, we can help.

181
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,310
You can't.

182
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,650
Why is that?

183
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,620
Tell them, David.

184
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,620
Go ahead, honey.

185
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm dead.

186
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,620
What do you mean?

187
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,970
You can't help me

188
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,970
because I'm already dead.

189
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,780
In the months since

190
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,780
we were last here,

191
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,620
David has been taking

192
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,620
a combination of risperidone,

193
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,630
aripiprazole, and clozapine.

194
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,330
Yeah. Things were going okay

195
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,330
for a little while there,

196
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,330
but then there was

197
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,330
this new development.

198
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,440
So David, how did you

199
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,440
come to believe

200
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,440
that you're dead?

201
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,500
David?

202
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,010
I could feel it.

203
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,950
And what did it feel like?

204
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,540
Like my organs

205
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,540
stopped working.

206
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,320
And did anything else

207
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,320
besides the feeling

208
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,590
lead you to believe this?

209
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,420
The voices.

210
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,330
The voices in your head?

211
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,530
And why do you think that

212
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,530
they're telling you the truth?

213
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,570
Stop trying to convince me

214
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,570
that I'm wrong.

215
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,070
I'm only trying

216
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,070
to understand.

217
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,670
I remember now.

218
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,570
I remember you.

219
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,870
Yeah. I've treated you

220
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,870
before, more than once.

221
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,880
You were the first one

222
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,880
to make me take medicine.

223
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,580
I was just trying

224
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,580
to help you, David.

225
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,790
You're the reason I'm dead!

226
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,660
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

227
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,390
It's okay.

228
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,670
It says here, Walter,

229
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,670
you're a type 1 diabetic?

230
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,370
Yeah. That's why

231
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,370
I'm in the Med more times

232
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,370
than I can count.

233
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,870
Sorry about that.

234
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,870
That's all right.

235
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,010
I mean, it's nice to

236
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,010
have a hospital I trust

237
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,010
for days like this.

238
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,480
And the Tylenol is not helping

239
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,480
with the fever and the chills.

240
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,780
101.5.

241
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,780
All right.

242
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,350
Let's have a listen.

243
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,090
And deep breath for me.

244
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,490
All right, good breath sound.

245
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,000
Glands feel a bit swollen.

246
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,760
You have a sore throat?

247
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,760
A little, I guess.

248
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,060
It's mild.

249
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,060
Okay.

250
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,000
Remove your glasses

251
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,000
for me, please.

252
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,600
How long have you been

253
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,600
feeling this way?

254
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,700
Uh, three days.

255
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,870
I know because it started

256
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,910
just after a trip I took

257
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,910
to Yosemite for hiking.

258
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,910
I hear it's beautiful there.

259
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,910
It is spectacular.

260
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,370
I mean, the only

261
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,370
downside for me was...

262
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,880
Yeah, I guess I should

263
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,880
show you this.

264
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,480
Argh!

265
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,480
Oh, yeah.

266
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,820
Yeah, I slipped and fell

267
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,820
on some rocks.

268
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,450
Sorry.

269
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,990
Yeah. It looks like

270
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,990
it could be infected.

271
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,690
Might explain your fever.

272
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,700
CBC, CMP, Accu-Chek,

273
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
hemoglobin A1C

274
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
and blood cultures.

275
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,730
Uh, let's swab

276
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,730
for COVID too,

277
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,730
just to rule it out.

278
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,860
And add a tetanus booster

279
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,860
if it's been more

280
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,860
than ten years.

281
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,170
Very thorough. I like it.

282
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,170
It's always been the MO here.

283
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,410
We try, Walter.

284
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,410
Hang in there.

285
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,670
All right. Thanks.

286
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,500
Maggie?

287
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,500
Yep?

288
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,880
Trash in three is

289
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,880
practically overflowing.

290
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,450
It looks like it hasn't

291
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,450
been emptied in days.

292
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,020
Oh, all right.

293
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,020
I'll talk to the guy

294
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,020
who's subbing.

295
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,620
Joe, right?

296
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,490
Did you turn over

297
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,490
treatment three?

298
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,490
Turn over?

299
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,820
Change the sheets,

300
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,820
wipe down the surfaces,

301
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,820
clean the floor,

302
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,090
like we do after a patient

303
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,090
is discharged?

304
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,190
Yeah, I think so.

305
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,630
Then why is

306
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,630
the trashcan full?

307
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,760
I'll empty it.

308
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,890
Uh...

309
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,660
I cannot believe

310
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,660
it's come to this.

311
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,000
Hiring scabs?

312
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,530
Doris.

313
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,200
Look, the strike

314
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,200
has us in a bind.

315
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,480
I need your help in

316
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,480
turning over rooms today.

317
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,950
I thought we had

318
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,950
replacement janitors?

319
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,520
Yeah, but they're

320
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,520
slacking off.

321
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,680
Start with

322
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,680
the empty rooms

323
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,050
and work your way

324
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,050
around the football

325
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,820
as patients are

326
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,820
being discharged.

327
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,910
Please?

328
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,990
That's just great.

329
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,990
Thank you.

330
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,720
Ms. Goodwin?

331
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,720
Yeah?

332
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,460
It's been seven days.

333
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,460
How long is this strike

334
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,460
supposed to go on?

335
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,800
All I know is, the board

336
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,800
and union are working

337
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,800
to come to an agreement.

338
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,230
Well, it's only

339
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,230
a matter of time till

340
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,230
this blows back on us.

341
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,940
I'm aware,

342
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,940
Dr. Halstead.

343
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,170
Your concerns are noted.

344
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,250
Okay, Jack.

345
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,250
I'll make it known.

346
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,110
Talk later.

347
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,260
Sharon Goodwin.

348
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,790
What a delightful way

349
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,790
to start the day.

350
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,790
George.

351
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,990
How are

352
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,990
negotiations going?

353
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,860
They're going.

354
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,770
That's all I can tell you

355
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,770
at this point.

356
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,830
Well, look. I'm not

357
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,830
trying to insinuate myself

358
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,830
into the negotiations,

359
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,140
but I do need to share

360
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,140
my staff's concerns

361
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,110
over how patient care

362
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,110
could be affected

363
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,180
if this strike

364
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,180
drags on much longer.

365
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,580
Hopefully, we're not too far

366
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,580
from an agreement.

367
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,520
Okay, well, I'll keep

368
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,520
my fingers crossed

369
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,280
and hope to hear

370
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,280
good news soon.

371
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,110
I promise you'll

372
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,110
be the first to know.

373
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,750
All right.

374
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,750
Okay.

375
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,820
What've we got?

376
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,960
Abby Hawkins,

377
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,960
eleven years old.

378
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,900
Sustained a pretty bad leg

379
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,900
injury on her family's farm.

380
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,240
BP and heart rate remained

381
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,240
stable the whole way here.

382
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay. Hey, Abby.

383
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm Dr. Marcel.

384
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,100
You're at Chicago Med.

385
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,970
We're gonna take

386
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,970
good care of you, okay?

387
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,210
Thanks for your help.

388
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,210
Look, I'm not leaving her.

389
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,770
I'm Abby's doctor,

390
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,770
Warren Johnson.

391
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,940
Dr. Charles?

392
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,890
We are essential!

393
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,290
Oh. Give me a sec.

394
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,150
Sorry. I heard

395
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,150
you were out here.

396
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,250
That's okay. What's up?

397
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,060
Do you remember

398
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,060
David Sullivan?

399
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,260
I do, yeah.

400
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,260
Well, his parents

401
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,260
brought him in.

402
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,930
His paranoid delusions

403
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,930
have given way to

404
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,930
something else.

405
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,000
He now believes

406
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,000
that he's dead.

407
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,730
Dead.

408
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,830
Okay.

409
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,610
Crucial that you don't

410
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,610
push back on the delusion.

411
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,170
Well, I tried

412
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,170
reinforcing it

413
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,170
to gain his trust,

414
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,610
but it didn't

415
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,610
get me anywhere.

416
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,310
Okay. I'll be right back.

417
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,680
Liliana, there's a young man

418
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,680
that I've been treating.

419
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,260
He's back in the hospital,

420
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,260
and he's in trouble.

421
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,090
I need to go

422
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,090
check in on him.

423
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,090
Okay.

424
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,790
All right.

425
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,790
I'll be right back,

426
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,790
soon as I can.

427
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,160
We are essential!

428
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,820
Hang in there, Abby.

429
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,820
Maggie?

430
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,020
You're going to Baghdad.

431
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,600
She and her family

432
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,600
are patients at

433
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,600
the clinic where I work.

434
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,730
They brought her in?

435
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,240
Yeah. I gave her 50 mics

436
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,240
of fentanyl for the pain

437
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,330
and put a splint on her leg.

438
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,670
Okay. Here we go.

439
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,670
I got it. Thank you.

440
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,110
You're also a pilot?

441
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah, I used to be a flight

442
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,200
paramedic in the army.

443
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,750
Those skills come in handy

444
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,750
when you're out

445
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,750
in the boonies like us.

446
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,820
Soon as I saw Abby's leg,

447
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,820
I knew I had to

448
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,820
bring her here.

449
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,110
Luckily, the farm co-op

450
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,110
has a chopper.

451
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,310
Where are

452
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,310
her parents now?

453
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,720
Following behind

454
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,720
in their truck.

455
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,850
They'll be a couple of hours,

456
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,250
but they've given consent for

457
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,250
any treatment Abby may need.

458
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,120
Okay.

459
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,850
Oh, man.

460
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,790
How did this happen?

461
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,960
Abby works on her family farm.

462
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,300
Her leg got caught

463
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,300
in the hydraulic bucket

464
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,300
of a skid steer.

465
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,270
What's that?

466
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,900
A machine

467
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,900
used to feed cattle.

468
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,970
My uncle has a farm.

469
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,850
And why was this little girl

470
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,850
allowed anywhere near

471
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,850
dangerous machinery?

472
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,850
Look, her father was

473
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,850
working the skid steer.

474
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,010
Abby was trying

475
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,010
to climb aboard

476
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,010
when her leg slipped.

477
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,910
Okay, um...

478
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,260
get me X-rays of the leg,

479
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,260
chest, and pelvis.

480
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,730
After that, get me a CT

481
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,730
angiogram of the leg, please.

482
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,070
And another 50 mics

483
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,070
of fentanyl, please.

484
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,160
Got it.

485
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,210
Hang in there

486
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,210
for me, Abby.

487
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,210
You're all right.

488
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,740
Seeing a laceration

489
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,740
on the crown.

490
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,370
Um, add a CT head,

491
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,370
abdomen, and pelvis.

492
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,670
You know what,

493
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,680
let's just plan on

494
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,680
going to 2.0. Let's go.

495
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,280
2.0?

496
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,280
Surgical suite.

497
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,450
You still think

498
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,450
you can save her leg?

499
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,280
Well, I'm not sure yet.

500
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,790
We'll see. Come on.

501
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,020
Let's go.

502
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,240
Breath for me, Deanna.

503
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,270
Again.

504
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,340
Okay. Clear on

505
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,340
both sides.

506
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,000
When did you

507
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,000
start throwing up?

508
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,100
Yesterday.

509
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,770
But I've been really nauseous

510
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,770
for a couple of days.

511
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,910
Hmm. You weighed in

512
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,910
today at 112.

513
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,290
You were 131

514
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,290
at your last physical.

515
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,420
That's a pretty significant

516
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,420
decrease at your height.

517
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,390
I didn't realize

518
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,390
I'd lost that much.

519
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,450
I've had very little appetite

520
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,450
the last couple of months.

521
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,790
Oh, yeah?

522
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,790
You want to tell me

523
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,790
why that might be?

524
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,840
Uh, my daughter, Olivia,

525
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,840
she lives with me.

526
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,840
She's been going through

527
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,840
some health issues.

528
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,140
I'm pretty stressed out

529
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,140
about that.

530
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,730
Yeah, kids.

531
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,730
Tell me about it.

532
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,970
I'm gonna be sick.

533
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,970
All right. Basin.

534
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,040
All right. We're gonna

535
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,040
figure this out.

536
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,310
Uh, chest X-ray,

537
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,310
blood cultures,

538
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,750
and, uh,

539
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,750
CT abdomen, pelvis.

540
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,860
Dr. Charles.

541
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,860
Oh. They told us that

542
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,860
you had the day off.

543
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,450
Dr. Cuevas told me

544
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,450
you guys were here,

545
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,960
and so I just...

546
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,960
I thought I'd check in.

547
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,200
Appreciate it.

548
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,200
Thank you.

549
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,860
David, how are you?

550
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,810
What's up? How you, uh...

551
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,810
How you feeling?

552
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,810
I, um...

553
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,810
I took the liberty.

554
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,970
This is your...

555
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,770
your drink of choice,

556
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,770
isn't it?

557
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,870
He's been refusing

558
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,870
to eat or drink anything.

559
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,010
Huh.

560
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,980
Why, uh... Why is that?

561
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,380
There's no point.

562
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,090
You know, Dr. Cuevas

563
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,090
said that you told her

564
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,090
that you were dead.

565
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,130
I'm really sorry

566
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,130
to hear that. Um...

567
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,390
How's that feel?

568
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,160
What's it like?

569
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,890
What do you think

570
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,890
it's like?

571
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,130
Honestly, I have no idea.

572
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,130
That's why I'm asking.

573
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,140
It's like...

574
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,140
Like my insides are rotting.

575
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,940
Wow. That sounds awful.

576
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,040
It is awful. I hate it.

577
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,550
Well, maybe there's

578
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,550
something we can

579
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,550
do about that.

580
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,250
I'm not taking any more pills.

581
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,480
I hate the way they

582
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,480
make me feel.

583
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,420
David, please. We should

584
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,420
listen to Dr. Charles.

585
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,890
I won't do it.

586
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,550
You can't make me.

587
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,990
Hey, um, could we just

588
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,990
step outside for

589
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,990
a quick second?

590
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,230
David, hang in there.

591
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,230
I'll be right back, all right?

592
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,230
Be right back, honey.

593
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,170
You know, I was looking

594
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,170
at David's chart,

595
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,070
and he apparently

596
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,070
just had a birthday,

597
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,510
and that was 18,

598
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,510
which means

599
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,510
he's legally an adult.

600
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,910
If he doesn't want to

601
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,910
take medication,

602
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,910
then he...

603
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,570
He has the right

604
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,570
to refuse it.

605
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,010
How is that possible?

606
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,550
You heard the things

607
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,550
that he was saying in there.

608
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,050
Well, despite

609
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,050
his delusion,

610
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,890
he made it very clear

611
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,890
that he doesn't like the way

612
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,890
the pills make him feel.

613
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,930
Now, look. David can

614
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,930
barely keep it together

615
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,930
with medication.

616
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,500
What's he gonna be like

617
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,500
without it?

618
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,290
Dr. Charles,

619
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,290
he thinks he's dead.

620
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,970
Look, I understand

621
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,970
how frustrating this is.

622
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,560
But patients' rights

623
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,560
in this country

624
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,370
are extraordinarily robust,

625
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,140
even if the patient

626
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,140
happens to be having

627
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,140
a mental health crisis.

628
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,410
So you're saying that there's

629
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,410
absolutely nothing to be done?

630
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,450
What I'm saying is

631
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,450
that we, uh...

632
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,040
We have to reconsider

633
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,040
our tactics.

634
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,310
Okay.

635
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,030
Hey. Got your CT scans

636
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,030
here, Deanna.

637
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,330
Okay. So as you can

638
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,330
see right here,

639
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,990
there's a blockage

640
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,990
of some kind

641
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,330
that's amassed

642
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,330
in your stomach.

643
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,160
Cancer?

644
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,040
From the looks of it,

645
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,040
I would say that

646
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,040
it is not, no.

647
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,210
Oh, thank God.

648
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,570
But, uh, whatever it is,

649
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,570
it does not belong in there,

650
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,240
and needs to come out

651
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,240
immediately.

652
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,280
Does that mean surgery?

653
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,280
Yes, a laparotomy.

654
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,220
We have to open your stomach

655
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,220
to get it out.

656
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,650
It's scary,

657
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,650
but it's a procedure

658
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,650
I've done many times.

659
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,160
I guess if it

660
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,160
has to be done...

661
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,250
It does.

662
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,450
So I will call up to the OR,

663
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,090
make sure they're

664
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,090
ready for us.

665
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,960
And if you need,

666
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,960
I can contact your daughter.

667
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,090
No.

668
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll call her myself. Uh...

669
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,070
She has her own

670
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,070
health issues to deal with.

671
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,430
I don't want her

672
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,430
to be alarmed.

673
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,640
No fractures

674
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,640
on the X-rays and CT.

675
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,340
Most of the leg muscles

676
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,340
are still intact.

677
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,510
Yeah.

678
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,140
She might have adequate

679
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,140
motor function. That's okay.

680
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,280
Her sensory function,

681
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,280
that's almost gone.

682
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,260
2.0, show us the CT angiogram.

683
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,390
CT angio.

684
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,360
Sagittal subtraction roadmap.

685
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,230
What was that?

686
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,500
2.0's AI.

687
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,730
Wow. That's amazing.

688
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,270
The SFA and pop

689
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,270
look intact.

690
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,310
Yeah, but I'm not

691
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,310
seeing any blood flow

692
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,310
below the trifurcation.

693
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,970
2.0, can you confirm?

694
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,380
7% percent blood flow

695
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,380
to the foot.

696
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,710
Only 7%?

697
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,020
Afraid so.

698
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,220
So you have to amputate.

699
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,220
Sadly, I'm not seeing

700
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,220
another option.

701
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,590
I'll call the parents.

702
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,660
This never should

703
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,660
have happened.

704
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,140
Dr. Archer,

705
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,140
I got your page.

706
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,510
Dr. Cuevas, are you

707
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,510
familiar with the term bezoar?

708
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,380
Bezoar?

709
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,350
Yes. It's a mass

710
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,350
of foreign material

711
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,120
that accumulates

712
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,120
in the stomach.

713
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,780
Hmm. Very good.

714
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,560
Behold, the bezoar I found

715
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,560
in my patient, Deanna.

716
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,530
It's a giant hairball.

717
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,200
Hair?

718
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,200
Yeah.

719
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,460
Obviously, she's been

720
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,460
snacking on it.

721
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,230
Oh, my God.

722
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,740
The question is, why has

723
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,740
she been eating her hair?

724
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,470
When I'm done here,

725
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,470
you can help figure that out,

726
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,070
'cause it's now a psych case.

727
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,510
Okay.

728
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,050
Hey, Maggie.

729
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,120
How's Abby doing?

730
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,160
Well, Dr. Marcel said

731
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,160
he has to amputate.

732
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, that's awful.

733
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,220
Yeah. I just called her

734
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,220
parents to tell them.

735
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,060
They're still a ways away,

736
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,060
so I'm gonna stick around

737
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,630
and be here for them

738
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,630
when they get here.

739
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,220
That's good.

740
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,100
Maybe it'll help

741
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,100
to see a friendly face.

742
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,360
Yeah.

743
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
Hey, you mentioned

744
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
your uncle has a farm.

745
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,260
Yeah, in Sheffield.

746
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,260
Oh, yeah.

747
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,740
He raises

748
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,740
chicken and cattle.

749
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,730
When I was growing up,

750
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,730
I'd love spending

751
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,730
the summers

752
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,810
just working alongside

753
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,810
him and my cousins.

754
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,080
Yeah. It's a different world

755
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,080
out there in farm country.

756
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,170
Yeah.

757
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,680
I hate to see what

758
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,680
this is going to do

759
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,680
to Abby and her family.

760
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,780
Look, I can

761
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,780
tell you this.

762
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,190
From what I know

763
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,190
about Abby over

764
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,190
the years I've treated her,

765
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,490
she's got heart.

766
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,490
She'll overcome this.

767
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,220
Leg or no leg, nothing's

768
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,220
gonna keep her down.

769
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,320
Well, that's good.

770
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,490
Madeline?

771
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,670
Uh, DCFS was notified of

772
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,670
a potential child abuse case.

773
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,460
I don't know anything

774
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,460
about that.

775
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,100
Dr. Marcel made the call.

776
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,370
Well, there must be

777
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,370
some sort of confusion.

778
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,570
Where's Dr. Marcel?

779
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,570
He's not here,

780
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,370
but I'll track him down

781
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,370
and get to the bottom of it.

782
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,470
You can go back

783
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,470
to your office,

784
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,770
and I'll call you

785
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,770
when I get something.

786
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,840
Okay. Let me know.

787
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,170
Yeah.

788
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,280
Child abuse?

789
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,280
This wasn't child abuse.

790
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,480
I know.

791
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,890
Why would Dr. Marcel

792
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,890
do that?

793
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,220
I'm gonna find out.

794
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
Crockett?

795
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
Yeah?

796
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,690
I need to talk to you.

797
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,370
I'm about to

798
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,370
operate, Maggie.

799
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,400
Why did you call DCFS?

800
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,310
Because it's

801
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,310
my legal obligation

802
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,850
as a mandated reporter, okay?

803
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,410
Come on.

804
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,410
It was an accident.

805
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,920
Yeah, well,

806
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,920
there's no reason a child

807
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,150
should have been anywhere

808
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,150
near a machine like that.

809
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,220
You don't know what

810
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,220
it's like on a family farm.

811
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,720
Kids work.

812
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,720
It's part of the culture.

813
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
Well, maybe it shouldn't be,

814
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
because this little girl

815
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,260
is about to lose her leg

816
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,260
as a result of her parents'

817
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,260
negligence.

818
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,760
Crockett, I know how these

819
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,760
DCFS investigations play out.

820
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,360
If Abby and her parents

821
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,360
get separated,

822
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,770
it could be impossible

823
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,770
to get them back together.

824
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,900
Please. Call off

825
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,900
Madeline Gastern.

826
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,770
Where are we?

827
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,180
Whenever you're

828
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,180
ready, Doctor.

829
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,770
Crockett.

830
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,280
Maggie, I'd appreciate it

831
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,280
if you'd leave.

832
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,390
Okay.

833
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,490
That's odd.

834
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,930
Her foot color looks better.

835
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,610
Yes, it does.

836
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,780
I'm feeling a good pulse.

837
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,610
How's that possible,

838
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,610
given the lack of blood flow

839
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,270
on the CT angiogram?

840
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,390
Maybe the vessels

841
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,390
in her leg

842
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,390
were spasming

843
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,890
due to the shock

844
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,890
of the accident.

845
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,510
2.0, what's your assessment?

846
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,460
Given change in exam,

847
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,460
three-vessel spasm likely.

848
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,590
Then this pulse means

849
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,590
the spasm must have broken.

850
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,760
All right, let's shoot

851
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,760
an on-table angiogram.

852
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,700
Maybe Abby doesn't have

853
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,700
to lose her leg after all.

854
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,970
Walter, what's going on?

855
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,640
Ah, it's my back.

856
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,270
Itches like crazy.

857
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,310
Open that up a little.

858
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,410
Yeah, you've developed

859
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,410
a rash back here.

860
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,850
You've never had an allergic

861
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,850
reaction to antibiotics

862
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,850
before, have you?

863
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,390
No, never.

864
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,880
Let's get a differential

865
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,880
to the CBC, lymphocytes,

866
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,880
and monocytes.

867
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,520
Could infection from

868
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,520
the cut have caused this?

869
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,590
I doubt it.

870
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,760
But, uh, this next set

871
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,760
of tests will tell us.

872
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,530
Go easy on that, okay?

873
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,970
Okay.

874
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,540
Hair?

875
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,900
That is so strange.

876
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,480
Yeah. And quite

877
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,480
a bit of it, too,

878
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,610
which is why I asked

879
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,610
Dr. Cuevas to join us.

880
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,650
Psychiatry?

881
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,650
Yes.

882
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,650
But there's no reason

883
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,650
to be alarmed.

884
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,740
We just want to help.

885
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,350
There is a condition

886
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,350
called trichophagia,

887
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,450
where a person compulsively

888
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,450
eats their hair.

889
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,830
Okay. No. No.

890
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,490
Dr. Archer mentioned

891
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,490
that you've been under

892
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,490
a lot of stress recently.

893
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,000
And I ask because this

894
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,000
compulsion can be triggered

895
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,000
by feelings of anxiety.

896
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,730
I do not eat my hair.

897
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,030
It's actually not

898
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,030
that uncommon.

899
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,650
Over a million people

900
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,650
in the U.S...

901
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,440
Well, I am not

902
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,440
one of them.

903
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,610
I think this

904
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,610
conversation is over.

905
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,680
Deanna...

906
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,680
No.

907
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,020
Please leave.

908
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,980
Okay.

909
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,390
And listen,

910
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,660
my daughter is on her way

911
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,660
in here soon.

912
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,600
I do not want you

913
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,600
mentioning this to her.

914
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,640
Of course.

915
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,640
We will respect

916
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,640
your wishes.

917
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,340
That is the second patient

918
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,340
today I have struck out with.

919
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,670
Hey, you tried.

920
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,780
You mind if I, uh,

921
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,780
run something by you?

922
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,350
Whatever it is,

923
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,350
I won't do it.

924
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,750
That's, uh,

925
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,750
completely up to you.

926
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,050
I'd just appreciate it

927
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,050
if you'd hear me out,

928
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,050
'cause it's...

929
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,830
I don't know,

930
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,830
it's conceivably

931
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,830
something that could...

932
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,130
get you back on track.

933
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,660
I can't be fixed.

934
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,900
Nothing will change

935
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,900
the fact that I'm dead.

936
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,860
No argument there.

937
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,400
What?

938
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,940
Well, look.

939
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,940
My primary concern is your...

940
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,670
Is your well-being,

941
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,050
you know, your...

942
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,050
Your state of mind.

943
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,910
And you made it

944
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,910
very clear that you

945
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,920
did not at all like the way

946
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,920
that this made you feel.

947
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,950
So I'm just wondering if...

948
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,850
I don't know,

949
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,850
there might be something

950
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,160
that could move you on

951
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,160
to the next phase,

952
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,160
you know, to...

953
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,390
To a new life,

954
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,660
a life after death,

955
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,660
if you will,

956
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,930
a different life.

957
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,110
David, have you ever heard

958
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,110
of something called ECT,

959
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,900
or electroconvulsive therapy?

960
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,780
Like, electricity?

961
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,750
Life after death?

962
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,920
What, you mean...

963
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,160
You mean, like Frankenstein?

964
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,060
Well, actually, yeah.

965
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,060
I mean, kind of like

966
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,060
Frankenstein.

967
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,800
I mean,

968
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,800
didn't Dr. Frankenstein

969
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,670
jolt electricity into

970
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,670
his creature to, you know,

971
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,670
to reanimate it?

972
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,810
'Cause frankly,

973
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,810
that's kind of

974
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,710
what I'm hoping ECT

975
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,710
might do for you.

976
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,750
Is that something

977
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,750
that you might...

978
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,910
Might think about?

979
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,720
I'd definitely consider it.

980
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,160
Okay, good.

981
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,470
Excuse me,

982
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,470
I'm all turned around.

983
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,010
How do I get to

984
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,010
the intensive care unit?

985
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,510
My mom just

986
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,510
got out of surgery.

987
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,510
Name's Deanna Brooks.

988
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,130
Oh, hey. No, I got this.

989
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,650
Hi, you must be

990
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,650
her daughter, Olivia.

991
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,720
I'm Dr. Archer.

992
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,720
I treated your mother.

993
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,720
She's doing well.

994
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,150
Oh, I'm so glad

995
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,150
to hear that.

996
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,840
Yeah. She's upstairs

997
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,840
in the ICU,

998
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,080
and the elevator's

999
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,080
just around the corner.

1000
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,180
Trini, can you

1001
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,180
do me a favor?

1002
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,520
Could you please

1003
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,520
take Miss Brooks

1004
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,090
up to her mother

1005
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,090
in the ICU?

1006
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,630
Of course.

1007
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,630
Right this way.

1008
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,590
Thank you.

1009
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,590
Sure.

1010
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,230
Are you thinking

1011
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,230
what I'm thinking?

1012
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,230
Yeah.

1013
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,270
Dr. Halstead, the lab

1014
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,270
just sent Walter Crotty's

1015
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,270
latest results.

1016
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,770
Thanks, Nancy.

1017
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,940
Bad news?

1018
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,110
I thought I had my

1019
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,110
patient's diagnosis pegged.

1020
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,120
But he got this weird rash,

1021
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,120
and I can't figure out why.

1022
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,190
You know, I created

1023
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,190
a diagnostic search engine

1024
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,550
optimized to take account

1025
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,550
of irregular symptoms.

1026
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,020
Why am I not surprised?

1027
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,120
You have some time

1028
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,120
to help me out?

1029
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,750
Sure.

1030
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,630
I'll run your patient's

1031
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,630
charts and labs

1032
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,630
and see what comes up.

1033
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,720
Send them to me.

1034
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,790
Great. On their way.

1035
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,260
Stick around.

1036
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,660
Almost there.

1037
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,040
Okay.

1038
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,870
Tularemia, streptococcus,

1039
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,870
lymphadenitis,

1040
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,140
cat scratch fever,

1041
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,140
tuberculosis,

1042
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,940
meningococcemia,

1043
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,750
and then there's plague.

1044
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,950
Plague? Bubonic plague?

1045
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,880
Yes, but the odds are

1046
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,880
considerably lower

1047
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,880
than for the others.

1048
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,790
Wait. Plague is flea-borne.

1049
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,060
Walter's red bumps

1050
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,060
could be flea bites, but...

1051
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,570
when was the last case

1052
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,570
of recorded plague?

1053
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,200
Actually, just six weeks ago.

1054
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,200
Sacramento.

1055
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,940
Walter mentioned

1056
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,940
he just got back from

1057
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,940
a hiking trip in Yosemite.

1058
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,100
Which is only a couple

1059
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,100
of hours from Sacramento.

1060
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,980
I'm going to have

1061
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,980
the lab run a Gram stain

1062
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,980
on Walter's blood.

1063
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,880
I'm gonna reach out

1064
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,880
to the CDC,

1065
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,010
let them know we might have

1066
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,010
an outbreak on our hands.

1067
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,800
Dr. Archer, hi.

1068
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,800
Hi.

1069
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,130
This is my colleague,

1070
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,130
Dr. Cuevas.

1071
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,930
I got a page that you

1072
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,930
wanted to talk to me?

1073
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,060
I did.

1074
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,060
My mom's still

1075
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,060
pretty tired.

1076
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,800
Well, that's normal

1077
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,800
after surgery.

1078
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,840
Right.

1079
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,840
Mmm-hmm.

1080
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,380
I guess I'm sort of rattled.

1081
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,310
She won't say much

1082
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,310
about her procedure,

1083
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,940
only that you removed

1084
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,940
some sort of blockage,

1085
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,940
but that's it.

1086
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,350
Can you fill me in

1087
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,350
on what happened?

1088
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,640
Well, I'm sorry,

1089
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,640
but it's up to your mother

1090
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,090
to share those

1091
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,090
details with you.

1092
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,020
Every time I ask,

1093
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,020
she just changes

1094
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,020
the subject.

1095
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,290
Turns it back to me.

1096
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,020
You know, your mom

1097
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,020
mentioned that you have

1098
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,020
some health issues.

1099
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,190
Do you mind sharing

1100
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,190
a little bit about that?

1101
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,290
Sure.

1102
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,990
I was diagnosed with

1103
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,990
breast cancer six months ago.

1104
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,900
Just finished

1105
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,900
my fifth round of chemo.

1106
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,830
The cancer hasn't spread,

1107
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,830
and my oncologist

1108
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,710
has been very positive

1109
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,710
so far, so I'm hopeful.

1110
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,840
Sounds like you have

1111
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,840
every reason to be.

1112
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,340
Thanks.

1113
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,780
Sorry to make you

1114
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,780
come up here,

1115
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,780
go out of your way.

1116
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,870
No, not at all.

1117
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,850
Thank you.

1118
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,230
CDC says until we know

1119
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,230
the results of Walter's labs,

1120
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,320
we need to cordon him off

1121
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,800
and limit contact

1122
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,800
with anyone else.

1123
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,660
I'll let the nursing

1124
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,660
staff know.

1125
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,930
Hey, Doris.

1126
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,930
Have you seen Maggie?

1127
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,130
We need to restrict

1128
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,130
all access to

1129
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,130
treatment three.

1130
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,710
What's going on?

1131
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,710
Uh, potential contagion.

1132
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,110
I'm waiting on the lab

1133
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,110
to confirm it,

1134
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,270
but steer clear

1135
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,270
for the time being, okay?

1136
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,010
Okay. Yeah. Um,

1137
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,010
I'll let the nurses know.

1138
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,110
You okay?

1139
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,950
Something on my neck

1140
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,950
is driving me nuts.

1141
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,780
Can I take a look?

1142
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,910
Yeah.

1143
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,420
Grace.

1144
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,300
Doris, let's get in the room.

1145
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,300
Oh, okay.

1146
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,390
It's a rash,

1147
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,390
like my patient.

1148
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,970
Couldn't be spreading

1149
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,970
that quickly.

1150
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,370
Let me see.

1151
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,370
What is "it"?

1152
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,740
And... And what does "it"

1153
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,740
have to do with my neck?

1154
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,070
Have you been in

1155
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,070
treatment three today?

1156
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,410
Have you had any interaction

1157
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,410
with my patient, Walter?

1158
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,380
No. I... I've been turning

1159
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,380
over rooms all day

1160
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,750
because the replacement

1161
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,750
janitors aren't doing squat.

1162
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,120
All right.

1163
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,120
What's happening to me, Will?

1164
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,880
Incubation period

1165
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,880
for the bubonic plague

1166
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,880
is two days, so...

1167
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,120
Bubonic plague?

1168
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,090
Uh, no. Can't be.

1169
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,060
Yeah, no.

1170
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,060
Wait.

1171
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,430
What are you doing?

1172
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,110
Unbelievable.

1173
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,380
No, I know exactly

1174
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,380
what this is.

1175
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,050
Hey, Sharon.

1176
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,050
How great is this,

1177
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,050
twice in one day?

1178
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,220
I'm sorry, George.

1179
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,220
We have a serious problem.

1180
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,800
Oh?

1181
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,800
Take a look.

1182
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,460
Okay. I'm not understanding

1183
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,460
what I'm looking at.

1184
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,830
Eggs.

1185
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,300
Eggs?

1186
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,300
Eggs, George,

1187
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,300
from bedbugs.

1188
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,070
One of my doctors just took

1189
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,070
this picture in our ED.

1190
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,080
It seems the re...

1191
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,080
The replacement janitors

1192
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,020
have not been properly

1193
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,020
changing sheets, or...

1194
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,420
Or sanitizing the rooms.

1195
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,480
Oh, no.

1196
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,480
A patient

1197
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,860
has developed a rash

1198
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,860
from a bug bite.

1199
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,050
So has a nurse,

1200
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,050
and it remains

1201
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,050
to be seen who's next.

1202
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,000
This strike needs to end.

1203
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,260
Jack's not gonna give in

1204
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,260
unless he gets more

1205
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,260
concessions from the union.

1206
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,570
He says we can't afford to.

1207
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,930
And what about liability

1208
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,930
lawsuits from patients?

1209
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,410
Can we afford those?

1210
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,570
Yeah.

1211
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,470
I hear you.

1212
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,580
I'll make sure Jack

1213
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,580
understands what's at stake.

1214
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,120
Mom's awake

1215
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,120
and feeling pretty good,

1216
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,380
so I'm getting a coffee.

1217
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,060
My daughter just stepped out,

1218
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,060
but she won't be long.

1219
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,570
We actually

1220
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,570
spoke to Olivia.

1221
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,170
I asked you not to.

1222
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,470
We didn't tell her a thing

1223
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,470
about your condition.

1224
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,310
However, she did mention

1225
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,310
that she's been undergoing

1226
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,310
chemotherapy

1227
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,500
for the last six months.

1228
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,880
It's been

1229
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,880
a very difficult time.

1230
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,080
I have no doubt,

1231
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,080
and I'm very sorry.

1232
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,380
But it seems like

1233
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,380
around the time

1234
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,050
Olivia started losing

1235
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,050
her hair from the chemo,

1236
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,320
you began having

1237
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,320
stomach issues.

1238
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,930
Deanna, we believe you

1239
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,930
that you haven't been

1240
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,930
eating your hair,

1241
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,490
but you were eating

1242
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,490
your daughter's hair,

1243
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,900
weren't you?

1244
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,080
Her hair started falling out.

1245
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,550
It was on her pillowcase

1246
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,550
and her sheets, and...

1247
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,220
seeing it there,

1248
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,220
my baby's hair...

1249
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,080
my heart would pound

1250
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,080
in my chest.

1251
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,950
My whole body would tremble.

1252
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,950
It just... It was unbearable.

1253
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,650
And eating her hair

1254
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,650
made you feel better?

1255
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,470
I put some in my mouth

1256
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,470
and chewed it, and I felt...

1257
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,590
I felt better.

1258
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,140
When I swallowed it,

1259
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,140
those awful feelings...

1260
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,070
went away.

1261
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,510
So as she kept losing it,

1262
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,510
I kept eating it.

1263
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,110
Mom, what's wrong?

1264
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,610
Excuse us.

1265
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,680
Mom.

1266
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,050
Honey, I need

1267
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,050
to tell you something.

1268
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,630
So we're going to send

1269
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,630
a mild electrical current

1270
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,630
through David's brain,

1271
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,430
which is going to cause

1272
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,430
a brief seizure.

1273
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,590
Won't that hurt him?

1274
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,500
He'll be under general

1275
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,500
anesthetic the whole time.

1276
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,940
He won't feel a thing.

1277
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,440
Look, we want to do

1278
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,440
whatever it takes

1279
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,440
to help our son, but...

1280
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,100
But shock therapy?

1281
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,510
I don't know. I don't know.

1282
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,510
It just feels so extreme.

1283
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,170
I completely understand

1284
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,170
why you feel that way,

1285
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,950
because of the way

1286
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,950
the procedure has been

1287
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,950
portrayed in the media.

1288
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,520
You know?

1289
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,520
But the truth is

1290
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,350
is that modern ECT is

1291
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,350
safer than ever before,

1292
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,480
and has proven

1293
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,480
to be very effective

1294
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,260
against certain

1295
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,260
treatment-resistant disorders,

1296
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,450
schizophrenia among them.

1297
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,990
You know, in many patients,

1298
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,990
it seems to have the ability

1299
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,590
to press a reset button

1300
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,590
in the brain.

1301
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,700
Anyway, gonna get going,

1302
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,700
and I'll check back.

1303
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,000
Okay.

1304
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,000
All right.

1305
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,370
How you doing, pal?

1306
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,370
You ready?

1307
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,480
Okay. I want you to

1308
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,480
count backwards from 10

1309
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,480
for me, all right?

1310
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,620
Ten, nine,

1311
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,710
eight, seven...

1312
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,650
Tourniquet looking good.

1313
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,560
Keep the paralytic

1314
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,560
out of that leg.

1315
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,730
Set.

1316
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,230
Okay.

1317
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,640
Here we go.

1318
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,620
Abby!

1319
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,140
You okay, pumpkin?

1320
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,300
Dr. Marcel says I will be.

1321
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,640
Yeah. She'll need more

1322
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,640
surgeries in the future,

1323
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,640
but, uh...

1324
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,180
I'm hopeful Abby

1325
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,180
will eventually make

1326
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,180
a full recovery.

1327
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,510
Thank you for everything.

1328
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,590
And thank you,

1329
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,590
Dr. Johnson,

1330
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,280
for making sure

1331
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,280
she got the best care.

1332
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,780
Daddy?

1333
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,390
What is it?

1334
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,790
It's my fault.

1335
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,190
What?

1336
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,730
No, it...

1337
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,730
It was an accident.

1338
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,240
You told me

1339
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,240
to stay back, but I...

1340
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,440
I didn't listen.

1341
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,800
You're gonna be okay.

1342
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,800
That's all that matters.

1343
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,380
But my leg, it's so bad.

1344
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,380
I can't help.

1345
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,080
Pumpkin, you don't need

1346
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,080
to worry about that.

1347
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,090
Your mom and I have

1348
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,090
got the farm covered.

1349
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,160
Honey, you just think

1350
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,160
about getting better, okay?

1351
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,570
You were supposed to

1352
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,570
get back to me, Maggie.

1353
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,400
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1354
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,400
That was...

1355
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,400
That was my fault.

1356
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,810
I misjudged the situation.

1357
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,400
And how exactly

1358
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,400
did that happen?

1359
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,240
Well, I didn't have

1360
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,240
all the information

1361
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,240
when I called.

1362
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,110
I really don't like my time

1363
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,110
being wasted, Dr. Marcel.

1364
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,810
And I'm very sorry

1365
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,810
about all that.

1366
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,710
You need to get

1367
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,710
your act together.

1368
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,220
Indeed, we do.

1369
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,490
I don't know, I...

1370
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,150
I guess I had

1371
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,150
blinders on today.

1372
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,760
All I could see

1373
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,760
was another kid

1374
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,760
suffering abuse, you know?

1375
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,490
Mmm. Turned out okay.

1376
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,430
You saved a leg,

1377
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,430
and a family, too.

1378
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,630
Thank you.

1379
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,920
David, how are you...

1380
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,510
How are you doing?

1381
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,510
How you feeling?

1382
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,520
Um, don't know.

1383
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,520
I feel kind of different.

1384
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,610
Okay.

1385
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,290
Voices? Any...

1386
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,290
Any voices?

1387
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,730
Actually, I... I can't

1388
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,730
really hear them right now.

1389
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,860
Huh.

1390
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,500
Mom?

1391
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,540
I'm just...

1392
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,540
I'm so happy, honey.

1393
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,670
I'm just really happy.

1394
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,720
Hydrocortisone should

1395
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,720
relieve some of the itching

1396
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,720
and swelling.

1397
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,490
Whatever.

1398
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,660
Hey, good news,

1399
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,660
your white cell

1400
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,660
count is down,

1401
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,470
and your blood sugar

1402
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,470
is back where it should be.

1403
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,630
Antibiotics and insulin

1404
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,630
did their job.

1405
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,970
That's a silver lining,

1406
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,970
I guess.

1407
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,910
You know,

1408
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,910
I used to be so impressed

1409
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,910
with this hospital.

1410
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,640
Sorry, Walter.

1411
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,550
I'll go put in

1412
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,550
your discharge paperwork.

1413
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,850
Mmm-hmm.

1414
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,990
How's it going down here?

1415
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,890
Patient's upset,

1416
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,890
and I can't say I blame him.

1417
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,990
But he'll be okay.

1418
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,360
Well, hopefully,

1419
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,360
we can put this behind us.

1420
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,270
The board and the union

1421
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,270
just reached an agreement

1422
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,600
on a new contract.

1423
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,300
Housekeeping staff will

1424
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,300
be back at work tomorrow.

1425
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,820
I'm so proud

1426
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,820
of each of you. We did it.

1427
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,980
Liliana!

1428
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,690
Oh, just a minute.

1429
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,580
I'm so sorry.

1430
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,280
I did not mean to desert you

1431
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,280
for the entire day.

1432
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,790
I understand.

1433
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,790
You do?

1434
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,800
He was your patient.

1435
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,800
You had to help.

1436
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,490
Oh, thank you.

1437
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,960
Oh, my...

1438
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,960
Congratulations!

1439
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,660
New contract!

1440
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,960
I'm going with my friends

1441
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,960
to celebrate. Come!

1442
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,370
Oh, no. Your victory,

1443
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,370
your party.

1444
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,600
Have a good time.

1445
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,600
No. No, Daniel.

1446
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,600
You have to come.

1447
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,900
You're my boyfriend.

1448
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,340
I am?

1449
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,340
Yeah.

1450
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,780
Oh. Well, when you

1451
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,780
put it that way...

1452
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,410
I'd show you my room,

1453
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,410
but we're not allowed

1454
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,650
to have visitors

1455
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,650
up there.

1456
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,650
Yeah.

1457
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,910
This is where we usually

1458
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,910
have our meetings.

1459
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,360
Yeah. It's, uh...

1460
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,350
it's nice.

1461
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,530
Thanks for

1462
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,530
letting me come by.

1463
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,930
It's almost curfew, but...

1464
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,500
I think we still have

1465
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,500
time to make coffee.

1466
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,760
Oh, no, no, no.

1467
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,760
It's fine.

1468
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,700
It's, uh...

1469
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,700
It won't take that long.

1470
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,570
Uh, I don't like the way

1471
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,570
I left things earlier.

1472
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,310
Um, kind of ran out.

1473
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,400
Oh, it's no big deal.

1474
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,010
Yeah, it is. It is to me.

1475
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,010
It... It is.

1476
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,350
Uh...

1477
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,720
All right. Uh...

1478
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,420
Okay, so, uh...

1479
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,420
So you mentioned

1480
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,420
your mother.

1481
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,770
All I ever wanted

1482
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,770
when you were a kid

1483
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,510
was to get her

1484
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,510
to stop drinking.

1485
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,870
But she wouldn't.

1486
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,470
She couldn't. She couldn't.

1487
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,620
And, uh, I didn't know

1488
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,620
what to do.

1489
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,480
And then, you know,

1490
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,480
you started having your...

1491
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,450
Your problems, and, uh...

1492
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,720
guess I just

1493
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,720
sort of checked out.

1494
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,920
And, uh...

1495
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,690
I wasn't there for you guys.

1496
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,000
I just... I wasn't.

1497
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,970
And, uh, I...

1498
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,970
I should have tried harder.

1499
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,600
And instead,

1500
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,600
I just got angry,

1501
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,600
you know?

1502
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,440
And I tried to just

1503
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,440
push it all away.

1504
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,040
And I ended up pushing you,

1505
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,040
my own son, away.

1506
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,610
And, uh...

1507
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,950
I don't know if

1508
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,950
I'll ever be able

1509
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,080
to say this to her,

1510
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,080
or when.

1511
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,560
But, Sean, I wasn't

1512
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,560
there for you.

1513
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,790
I wasn't there.

1514
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,430
I wasn't there.

1515
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,960
I wasn't there.

1516
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,530
Dad,

1517
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,410
you're here now.

1518
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,640
Am I?
