1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,230
Okay, this is the moment

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,230
of truth, Dr. Marcel.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,430
If there's a chance

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,430
she could lose function

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,430
in her hands,

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,560
she'd be against it.

7
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,660
Knowing your mother,

8
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,660
I'd agree.

9
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,270
Let's get her off the table.

10
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,270
Come on.

11
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,440
How could you

12
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,440
do this to me?

13
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,980
Your life was on the line.

14
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,720
I know that we have history,

15
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,720
but it is history.

16
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,540
We could try starting fresh.

17
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,540
New neighbors.

18
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,420
Your father

19
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,420
never wanted you to know.

20
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,990
We were in love.

21
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,360
You're the one

22
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,360
who should have this.

23
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,230
Vanessa's biological father,

24
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,230
I loved him at the time.

25
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,330
What happens if those old

26
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,330
feelings are still there?

27
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,130
I'm so happy to see you.

28
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,130
Will, the Vas-COM trial,

29
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,360
please tell me you're

30
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,360
not going to testify.

31
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,630
I have to.

32
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,710
Then what about me?

33
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,710
You're going to ruin my life.

34
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,000
They're going

35
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,000
to throw me in jail.

36
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,130
Let go of me.

37
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,080
I used to be a cop.

38
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,080
Inside, I'll always

39
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,080
bleed blue.

40
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,650
It wasn't my idea

41
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,650
to drag you in.

42
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,220
I can't wait

43
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,220
for this case to be over.

44
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,450
The building's on fire.

45
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,450
You need to get out.

46
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,620
You lying bitch.

47
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,660
Take the back stairs!

48
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,360
Let's get him out of here.

49
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,430
Let's get back in the room.

50
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,170
One, two, three.

51
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,520
Hey, up here! Up here!

52
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,590
Hermann!

53
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,590
Hey, Will!

54
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,150
We need the basket.

55
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,150
On it.

56
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,150
Hey, grab me the skid.

57
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,790
Will, need a hand

58
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,790
over here, man.

59
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,160
I don't think he's going

60
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,160
to last much longer.

61
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,600
Any other way

62
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,600
out of here?

63
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,130
Just both stairwells,

64
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,130
but CFD's coming up.

65
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,170
Let's get him

66
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,170
by the window.

67
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,700
Slide the curve

68
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,700
to his feet.

69
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,180
You guys okay?

70
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,180
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,280
Clip the straps.

72
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,280
Yeah.

73
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,290
Grab him by the feet.

74
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,290
We're going to

75
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,290
pull them through.

76
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,380
Okay. Yeah.

77
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,220
One, two, three.

78
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,220
Good job. Clip him up.

79
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,660
We're going to

80
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,660
swing him around

81
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,660
counterclockwise, all right?

82
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,690
And one, two, three, go.

83
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,340
Hey, Roy!

84
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,340
Skid's coming down.

85
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,740
You got it?

86
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,740
On the way!

87
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,470
One, two, three.

88
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,700
All right. Let's go.

89
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,870
Slide him down.

90
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,870
Stay low.

91
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,650
Let's go. Skedaddle.

92
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,250
Let's go! Go!

93
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,210
Whoa!

94
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,770
Hey, Will, Dylan.

95
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,770
Hey, you guys

96
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,770
should be on oxygen.

97
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,200
Yeah. Yeah.

98
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,270
Hannah?

99
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,270
I'm okay.

100
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,400
I thought you got out.

101
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,450
No, I...

102
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,280
I went back in

103
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,280
to find you.

104
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,180
Your lungs are clear.

105
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
Anybody seen Milena?

106
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,890
As far as CFD can tell,

107
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,890
no one else is

108
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,890
in the building.

109
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,690
I got to find her.

110
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,460
What we got?

111
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,460
Male, mid-30s.

112
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,460
GSW to the abdomen.

113
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,660
GCS 3t.

114
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,710
Extracted from structure fire

115
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,710
with an inhalation injury.

116
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,240
Dr. Asher's in the next

117
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,240
ambo with Dr. Halstead.

118
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,330
All right.

119
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,780
Dr. Taylor and I

120
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,780
will take this guy.

121
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,240
You take Hannah.

122
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,240
Okay.

123
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,910
All right, let's go.

124
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,910
Come on. On my count.

125
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,410
Ready? One, two, three.

126
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,840
All right.

127
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,450
Bilateral breath sounds.

128
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,290
Get me an X-ray, chest,

129
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,290
and belly, please.

130
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,860
BP 98/68.

131
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,860
Heart rate 130.

132
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,260
All right. Single hole,

133
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,260
left upper quadrant.

134
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,260
This guy's in trouble.

135
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,390
Let's roll him.

136
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,560
Second hole,

137
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,560
right back.

138
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,800
Through and through.

139
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Let's hope.

140
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Laparotomy?

141
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,270
Yeah. Let's see

142
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,270
how bad the damage is.

143
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,940
Any time.

144
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,940
X-ray.

145
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,540
Okay, no retained

146
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,540
missiles.

147
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,810
Two units whole blood

148
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,810
and prep the hybrid OR.

149
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,350
On it.

150
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,850
Jo!

151
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,290
Jo?

152
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,830
Dylan?

153
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,700
Oh, man. You've been hit.

154
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,330
We got... We got to get

155
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,330
you to the hospital.

156
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,530
Dylan.

157
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,530
Yeah.

158
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,400
It's not your fault.

159
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,840
Come on, Jo.

160
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,670
Stay with me.

161
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,350
You're gonna be okay,

162
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,350
all right?

163
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,750
You're going

164
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,750
to be okay. Hello?

165
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,840
This is Dr. Scott.

166
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,620
I need an ambulance stat.

167
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,760
So you had

168
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,760
a mild inhalation injury,

169
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,390
but you responded well

170
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,390
to the supplemental O2.

171
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,300
How high was

172
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,300
her CO level?

173
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,610
Uh, peaked at 12, but now

174
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,610
it's back to normal.

175
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,970
How are you feeling?

176
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,540
Good.

177
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,980
Can I get dressed now?

178
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

179
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,920
Well, if you want

180
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,920
to take a couple hours...

181
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,610
Will, thanks,

182
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,610
but I'm fine.

183
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,520
Oh, what about Dylan?

184
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,520
Did he find Milena?

185
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,650
Yeah, but it's not

186
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,650
looking great.

187
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,290
Oh, God.

188
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,960
Hey, you all right?

189
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,500
Yeah.

190
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,940
You could use

191
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,940
some cleaning up.

192
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,630
I've got to testify

193
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,630
at the Vas-COM

194
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,630
trial today.

195
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,070
All my clothes,

196
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,070
everything, it's gone.

197
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,840
I'll see if I can

198
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,840
scrounge up a clean shirt.

199
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,810
It's Milena.

200
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,040
Tracy, let's go.

201
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,040
Follow me.

202
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,950
Lost pulse and went

203
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,950
systolic on the monitors.

204
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,760
Yeah, she's bleeding

205
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,760
from everywhere.

206
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,760
Let me take over. All right.

207
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,590
Maggie, hit her

208
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,590
with a milligram of epi,

209
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,460
one of calcium,

210
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,460
an amp of bicarb,

211
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,460
and keep transfusing.

212
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,470
Come on.

213
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
Does her pulse check?

214
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,640
No pulse. She's asystole.

215
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,970
Give her another round.

216
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,480
Open her chest.

217
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,910
It's no use.

218
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,550
She's coagulopathic.

219
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,550
Then another round.

220
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,790
Come back, Jo.

221
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,430
Come on. Come back, Jo.

222
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,430
We lost her, Dylan.

223
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,870
We lost her.

224
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,610
Jo.

225
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,590
Time of death, 8:04.

226
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,700
She's gone.

227
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,600
I'm so sorry.

228
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,060
It was my fault.

229
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,060
It was not your fault.

230
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,540
I shot the gun.

231
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,870
Dylan, you were being

232
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,870
attacked, all right?

233
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,040
There was an assailant.

234
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,010
How could you know the bullet

235
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,010
was going to go through him

236
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,170
and hit Milena?

237
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,170
How could you know that?

238
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,470
Her name was Jo.

239
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,640
And you were trying

240
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,640
to protect her.

241
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,120
I did a hell

242
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,120
of a job, man.

243
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,950
Buddy, you did

244
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,950
the best you could.

245
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,980
I killed her.

246
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,760
I killed the woman

247
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,760
I love, man.

248
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,560
Oh, God.

249
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,770
I wouldn't go in there

250
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,770
if I were you.

251
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,770
She's still upset?

252
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,810
Livid is the word

253
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,810
I'd use.

254
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,040
What's her prognosis?

255
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,050
Since she hasn't yet

256
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,050
rescinded power of attorney,

257
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,480
I suppose I can share.

258
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,610
She's going to Brooks

259
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,610
Emmerich in Boston.

260
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,160
In my opinion,

261
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,160
it's the best neuro

262
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,160
rehab center in the country.

263
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,620
In all likelihood,

264
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,620
she'll come back

265
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,620
from this.

266
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,060
Good. Thank you.

267
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,060
Hey, Sam.

268
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,630
You understand

269
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,630
why I opted to sack

270
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,630
the vessel?

271
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,890
I understand,

272
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,890
but your decision was...

273
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,700
Well, uninspired

274
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,700
is the kindest thing

275
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,700
I can say.

276
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,970
And personally,

277
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,970
I've struggled

278
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,970
not to take offense.

279
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,010
Offense?

280
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,010
Yeah.

281
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,940
Clearly, you doubted

282
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,940
I could make the repair.

283
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,950
Oh, believe me, that

284
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,950
had nothing to do with it.

285
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,110
You say so.

286
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,680
Oh, and not that

287
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,680
this had anything

288
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,020
to do with your decision,

289
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,020
but it is ironic

290
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,890
the way you managed

291
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,890
to sideline

292
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,890
the chief of transplant,

293
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,150
some might say

294
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,150
making room for

295
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,150
the next rising star.

296
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,030
Hey.

297
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,630
He's waiting to hear

298
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,630
about Goran.

299
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,710
I can't imagine what

300
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,710
Dylan's going through.

301
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,210
I know.

302
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,210
Ms. Goodwin,

303
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,210
can I have a word?

304
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,210
Yeah? Oh. Sure.

305
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,750
Look, I know this is

306
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,750
probably the last thing

307
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,050
you need today,

308
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,050
but I I'd like

309
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,050
to be taken off

310
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,650
the transplant service.

311
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,800
Taken off?

312
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,800
Yes.

313
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,890
After all

314
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,890
the time and money

315
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,730
that has gone into

316
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,730
your training?

317
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,710
After having,

318
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,710
in effect, a fellowship

319
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,710
with our premier

320
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,710
transplant surgeon?

321
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,610
I have my reasons.

322
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,610
Well, I'm sure you do.

323
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,040
And I'm guessing

324
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,040
it's personal

325
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,040
and not related

326
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,080
to your competence

327
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,080
in the OR.

328
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,910
That's right.

329
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,910
Well, the answer is no.

330
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,010
Whoa, Ms. Goodwin.

331
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,010
Hold on.

332
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,010
Look, look, no, no, no.

333
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,720
Dr. Marcel, I know all

334
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,720
about Dr. Blake's surgery,

335
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,800
and I suspect

336
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,800
you feel a need to atone

337
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,160
for the decision you made.

338
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,930
But do you have any idea

339
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,930
what it would cost

340
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,270
to replace you,

341
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,270
to recruit a top-notch

342
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,270
transplant surgeon?

343
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,240
No, you don't.

344
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,080
And we are not about to

345
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,080
start turning away patients.

346
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,240
No, no, no, no.

347
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,150
Uh-uh.

348
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,120
You are on

349
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,120
the transplant service.

350
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
Wait, deliberate?

351
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
You're sure?

352
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,090
No question.

353
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,400
We found traces of accelerant

354
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,400
at the base of both stairways.

355
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,730
Excuse me.

356
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,770
The fire, it was arson?

357
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,770
Goran's the

358
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,770
most likely suspect.

359
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,100
Could have wanted to flush

360
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,100
Milena out, got trapped.

361
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,270
We won't know

362
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,270
for certain

363
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,850
until we check

364
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,850
security cameras

365
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,850
in the area.

366
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,070
Thanks.

367
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,250
I'm sorry, Will.

368
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,250
And I brought

369
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,250
all this on you.

370
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,250
Please, you don't need

371
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,250
to apologize.

372
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,380
Yeah, but had I not

373
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,380
asked you to

374
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,380
let her stay...

375
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,820
Dylan, come on.

376
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,830
My loss was nothing

377
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,830
compared to yours.

378
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,660
I'm fine.

379
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,660
I just feel for you.

380
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,770
Dr. Marcel and I

381
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,770
are in complete agreement.

382
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,780
The patient's hilum

383
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,780
is not reconstructable.

384
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
His liver's shot. Sorry.

385
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
No pun intended.

386
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,690
He's going to need

387
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,690
a transplant.

388
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,420
I'll put him

389
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,420
on the list, okay?

390
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,920
Hold on.

391
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,360
He might die

392
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,360
before that happens.

393
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,020
Yeah. What a loss.

394
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,720
I'll donate.

395
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,860
What?

396
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,060
I said I'll donate.

397
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,230
Oh, come on.

398
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,430
Hey, Dylan.

399
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,430
Look, I get it.

400
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,970
But you're in no condition

401
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,970
to make a decision like this.

402
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,970
I can't let him die.

403
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,040
What's your blood type?

404
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,040
A positive.

405
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,180
Well then, that's that.

406
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,180
He's B negative.

407
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,080
Well, then we have to

408
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,080
find a donor.

409
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,950
You do not

410
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,950
give up, do you?

411
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,350
Dr. Marcel,

412
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,350
your case.

413
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,390
We'll do our best, okay?

414
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,300
Looks like that breakfast

415
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,300
burrito is getting cold.

416
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,400
You know,

417
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,400
I forgot all about it.

418
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,980
You know,

419
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,980
I tried to talk to Dylan?

420
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,040
Did you know

421
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,040
he was in love with her?

422
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
Like, grief on top

423
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
of grief,

424
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
you know?

425
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,910
Yeah.

426
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,910
What can you say?

427
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,250
Well, what could anybody say?

428
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,980
Brutal though, right?

429
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,460
So who are you

430
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,460
talking to these days?

431
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,850
What do you mean?

432
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,160
Well, you know, after

433
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,160
all that Lonnie business,

434
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,420
I thought you'd look

435
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,420
for another therapist.

436
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,400
You know what?

437
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,400
I haven't... I haven't

438
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,400
really been looking.

439
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,990
No?

440
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,990
Uh-uh.

441
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,170
Hey, doesn't the, uh,

442
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,170
Vas-COM trial start today?

443
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,440
Subject changer.

444
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,110
Yes, it starts

445
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,110
this afternoon.

446
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,340
Good luck with that.

447
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,020
Maggie.

448
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,560
Look who's here.

449
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,450
Grant.

450
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,450
Hello, Maggie.

451
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,820
He wanted to see

452
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,820
where I worked.

453
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,290
Oh. Sorry.

454
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,290
It's kind of

455
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,290
a sad day for us here.

456
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,960
Yeah, Vanessa told me.

457
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,130
Are you getting coffee?

458
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,130
You should join us.

459
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,960
You know, I didn't

460
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,960
realize how late it was.

461
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,040
I have to get back

462
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,040
to the ED.

463
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,160
Another time, then.

464
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,060
Yeah. Yeah.

465
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,410
Thanks for coming, Dad.

466
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,280
Oh, hey.

467
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,080
Hey, I'm sorry about Jo.

468
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,080
I know you were close.

469
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,050
Yeah.

470
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,550
Look, Dad,

471
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,550
I need a favor.

472
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,520
Can you call the head

473
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,520
of narcotics, get me

474
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,520
the yellow file on Goran?

475
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,600
I need to see if he's

476
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,600
got any relatives nearby.

477
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,990
Relatives?

478
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,990
Yeah.

479
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,260
He needs a liver transplant,

480
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,260
and I've got to find a match.

481
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

482
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,430
hold on, Dylan.

483
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,370
Don't you think you're going

484
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,370
through an awful lot

485
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,370
for this guy?

486
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,410
He's my patient,

487
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,410
and I've got to do

488
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,410
at least one thing right.

489
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,570
Okay.

490
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,080
Dr. Archer,

491
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,080
17-year-old boy,

492
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,080
David Sullivan,

493
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,920
was brought in last night.

494
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,120
Smoked marijuana

495
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,120
laced with fentanyl.

496
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,120
Narcan'd in the field.

497
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,390
Resident put him

498
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,390
on saline to flush

499
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,390
his system.

500
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,890
Okay.

501
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,890
Treatment 6.

502
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,260
Here's his

503
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,260
latest drug panel.

504
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,260
All right. Thank you.

505
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,490
Yeah.

506
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,570
Can you sit up?

507
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,570
Try to sit up.

508
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,360
What's going on?

509
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,360
Where am I?

510
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,940
David, I'm Dr. Archer.

511
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,940
I'll be treating

512
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,940
your son today.

513
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,600
Thank you.

514
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,600
Where am I?

515
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,900
Stop saying that.

516
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,000
Look, you know perfectly

517
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,000
well where you are.

518
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,610
This... This isn't

519
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,610
like him, all right?

520
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,610
David's not some pothead.

521
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,040
His labs are good.

522
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,120
Drugs have pretty much

523
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,120
cleared his system.

524
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,410
Who are you?

525
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,010
Hey, he's your doctor.

526
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,990
They said the marijuana

527
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,990
had fentanyl in it.

528
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,390
Your son might not even

529
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,390
have known.

530
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,320
We're seeing

531
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,320
a lot of cannabis

532
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,320
sprayed with fentanyl.

533
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,220
You could have

534
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,220
died, David.

535
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,350
Are they coming?

536
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,520
Are who coming?

537
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,070
He's still high.

538
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,930
His THC levels

539
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,930
are negligible,

540
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,060
but we'll keep him on an IV,

541
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,060
make sure we flush his system.

542
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm not listening to you!

543
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,900
Hey, hey, David. Hey.

544
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,200
What is going on

545
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,200
with you?

546
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,580
I'll check back

547
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,580
in a little while.

548
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,580
Okay. Thank you.

549
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,040
Hey.

550
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,040
Can you page

551
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,040
Dr. Charles, please?

552
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,450
Yeah.

553
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,420
Hannah?

554
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,430
I can't catch

555
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,430
my breath.

556
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,050
All right.

557
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,050
We'll get you

558
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,050
in a room.

559
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,660
Ethan!

560
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,660
Let me help.

561
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,990
Hey.

562
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,370
She's dyspnic

563
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,370
and wheezy.

564
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,370
Okay. Will, I got this.

565
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,460
No, I'm staying.

566
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,470
100 milligrams

567
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,470
of SOLU-MEDROL

568
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,470
and a breathing treatment.

569
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,940
Yeah.

570
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,340
Why wheezing? Why now?

571
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,110
Inhalation injury was minimal,

572
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,110
and the CO wasn't that high.

573
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,190
I don't know.

574
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,190
Until we can figure this out,

575
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,190
I think we should intubate.

576
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,650
Just saying... Yeah.

577
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,650
No, please.

578
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,420
She's setting at 92

579
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,420
with the cannula.

580
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,650
Maybe we don't need to.

581
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,650
Please.

582
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,090
She doesn't want it.

583
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,220
This isn't what

584
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,220
I'd recommend.

585
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
All right.

586
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,960
We'll see if

587
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,960
you can pull through

588
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,960
without intubation,

589
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,130
but I want a chest CT.

590
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,170
Mags, order a blood gas

591
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,170
and let Radiology

592
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,290
know we're coming up.

593
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,100
Will do.

594
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,200
Sit tight, okay?

595
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,350
You're too close to her.

596
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,350
You can't be objective.

597
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,510
You need to back off.

598
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,510
We're not together.

599
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,070
It doesn't matter.

600
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,070
You were, and feelings

601
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,070
just don't disappear.

602
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,150
Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan?

603
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,150
You again.

604
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,150
You know, David,

605
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,150
I don't think we met.

606
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,390
Um, I'm Dr. Charles,

607
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,390
and this is Dr. Cuevas.

608
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,190
You're psychiatrists?

609
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,190
Yes.

610
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,530
Stay away from me.

611
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,530
Okay.

612
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,070
Oh, God.

613
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,070
He doesn't need

614
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,070
a psychiatrist.

615
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,770
He doesn't need a...

616
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,770
No, he smoked

617
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,770
some pot. That's it.

618
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,510
And it was stupid.

619
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,510
I admit that.

620
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,100
You know, especially

621
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,100
for someone who's earned

622
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,680
early admission to Stanford.

623
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,470
Oh, well,

624
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,470
that's pretty impressive.

625
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,710
Hey, David,

626
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,710
I see you haven't

627
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,710
eaten yet.

628
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,050
Honey, the doctor's

629
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,050
talking to you.

630
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,140
It's poison.

631
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,160
David, it's...

632
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,160
It's not poison.

633
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,450
I want to go home.

634
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,030
Well, if you hadn't done what

635
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,030
you did in the first place,

636
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,030
we wouldn't even be here.

637
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,490
Eric, that's not helping

638
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,490
right now. Stop.

639
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,030
David, I want you

640
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,030
to know that we

641
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,030
completely understand

642
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,660
that this can be a really

643
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,660
uncomfortable place,

644
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,500
and we want you

645
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,500
to know that we're

646
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
going to try and get you

647
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
out of here as soon

648
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
as possible, okay?

649
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,440
Okay.

650
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,270
Nice to meet you.

651
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,270
Yeah.

652
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,740
Nice to meet you.

653
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,780
Dr. Cuevas,

654
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,780
this is Dean Archer.

655
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,780
He is the head of the ED.

656
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,680
Nellie is starting

657
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,680
a psych rotation today.

658
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,090
Ah, another lamb

659
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,090
to the slaughter.

660
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,380
Hardly a lamb,

661
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,380
Dr. Archer.

662
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,680
Sorry.

663
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,790
So what's going on

664
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,790
with the kid?

665
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,590
What are you thinking?

666
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,130
He's paranoid, exhibiting

667
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,130
persecutory delusions.

668
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,260
It isn't just what he said

669
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,260
but his body language,

670
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,600
refusal to make

671
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,600
eye contact.

672
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,800
Yeah. The question is,

673
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,800
is it chemically induced,

674
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,510
or is there

675
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,510
something else

676
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,510
going on here?

677
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,670
Well, if it is

678
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,670
chemically induced,

679
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,670
it should resolve.

680
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,240
Yeah. In the meantime,

681
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,240
we got to get

682
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,240
a better history

683
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,650
from the parents.

684
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,650
Yeah.

685
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,090
I'm seeing

686
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,090
ground glass opacities.

687
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,850
And an enlarged

688
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,850
pulmonary artery.

689
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,820
She's definitely got

690
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,820
interstitial disease.

691
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,530
But what is causing it?

692
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,150
We need to get

693
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,150
a bronchoscopy,

694
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,150
clean out her lungs.

695
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,100
They can take a biopsy,

696
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,100
see if we can find out.

697
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,540
Hannah! Hannah!

698
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,700
She's only sating at 83.

699
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,840
Get respiratory in here.

700
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,410
We got you, Hannah.

701
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,410
We got you. Okay?

702
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,410
Just relax.

703
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,440
There you go.

704
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm in.

705
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,720
We should have

706
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,720
intubated her downstairs.

707
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,890
Look, I was upset earlier,

708
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,890
but I don't want you

709
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,360
to get the wrong impression

710
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,360
about David.

711
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,460
I mean, he is a great kid,

712
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,460
and we're very proud of him.

713
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,600
You know,

714
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,600
this whole business

715
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,600
with the marijuana,

716
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,900
that's way out

717
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,900
of character.

718
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,610
He was such a sweet,

719
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,610
happy child.

720
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,200
You know,

721
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,200
everyone would always

722
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,200
compliment us

723
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,800
on how good his manners are.

724
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,250
And up until now,

725
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,250
I mean, he's been

726
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,250
a straight-A student.

727
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,850
So his grades

728
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,850
have fallen off?

729
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,540
Just recently.

730
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,520
Any other changes

731
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,520
in his behavior that

732
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,520
you can think of?

733
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,880
Anything at all

734
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,880
come to mind?

735
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,420
Well, I guess

736
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,420
he's quieter lately.

737
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,550
Quieter?

738
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,690
Sometimes, he seems

739
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,690
off in his own world.

740
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,730
I mean, he spends

741
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,730
a lot more time alone

742
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,730
in his room.

743
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,170
Well, you don't notice it

744
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,170
so much because

745
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,170
you're at work.

746
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,170
Okay, so he's been spending

747
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,170
more time alone.

748
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,830
What about...

749
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,830
What about friends?

750
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,670
Does he have

751
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,670
a group of buddies

752
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,670
he normally hangs out with?

753
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,470
I don't know. I mean,

754
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,470
he doesn't bring

755
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,470
anyone home.

756
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,210
You know,

757
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,210
I guess he's just

758
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,210
more of a loner these days.

759
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
Yeah, but I mean,

760
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
that's true for

761
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
a lot of kids, though.

762
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,480
You know,

763
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,480
since COVID,

764
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,480
and the online classes

765
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,390
and the socializing.

766
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,390
Sure.

767
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,620
I mean, the pandemic

768
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,620
has been really rough

769
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,620
on young people, for sure.

770
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,200
But you haven't noticed

771
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,200
anything different?

772
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,290
I don't know.

773
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,490
Some...

774
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,490
Okay, I'll get up

775
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,490
at night sometimes,

776
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,860
and I'll see that the light

777
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,860
in his room's still on.

778
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,730
Well, yeah. I guess that's

779
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,730
why David sleeps so much

780
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,730
on the weekends.

781
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,900
He's just not getting

782
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,900
enough rest.

783
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,830
So sleeping habits

784
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,830
have changed?

785
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,710
Oh, I mean, this is all

786
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,710
normal teenage stuff,

787
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,710
right?

788
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,340
Very possibly.

789
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,280
But honestly,

790
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,280
we would really

791
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,280
appreciate it if you would

792
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,280
give us permission to have

793
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,280
another quick conversation

794
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,280
with David

795
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,910
just to help us

796
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,910
figure out, you know,

797
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,820
what's going on

798
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,820
and maybe what isn't.

799
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,590
We certainly

800
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,590
don't want this

801
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,590
to happen again.

802
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,630
No. We don't.

803
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,830
I guess if you think

804
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,830
that it will help.

805
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,460
Great.

806
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,630
Thank you.

807
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,630
All right.

808
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,330
Dr. Scott.

809
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,830
Dr. Marcel.

810
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,740
Bogdan Costavich,

811
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,740
Goran's brother.

812
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,810
He's B negative.

813
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,810
A match.

814
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,970
He's agreed to donate

815
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,970
a lobe of his liver.

816
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,650
Well, Mr. Costavich,

817
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,650
this is very generous.

818
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,650
I just want to make sure

819
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,650
you understand what it is

820
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,650
you're agreeing to.

821
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,950
This is... Well, it's

822
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,950
not a simple procedure.

823
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,680
Yes. Dr. Scott

824
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,680
explained to me.

825
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,820
Yeah. There's risk involved,

826
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,820
and it might be as long

827
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,820
as two months

828
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,490
before you're able

829
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,490
to go back to work,

830
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,490
so just keep that in mind.

831
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,860
Goran and I,

832
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,860
we went different ways.

833
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,270
I know he's done bad things,

834
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,270
but he's my brother.

835
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,500
I understand.

836
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,300
Please, Crockett.

837
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,030
Yeah. All right.

838
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,310
Dr. Scott here is going

839
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,310
to get you prepped, okay?

840
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,900
I'll see you in there.

841
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,880
Hey.

842
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,920
Here's her biopsy.

843
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,790
Talc crystals embedded

844
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,790
in periarterial granulomas.

845
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,790
Look,

846
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,790
on the street,

847
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,300
heroin is often cut

848
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,300
with talcum powder.

849
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,490
When she used,

850
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,490
the talc formed emboli,

851
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,490
which went into her lungs.

852
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,000
So she's had these

853
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,000
granulomas for years.

854
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,000
Obviously, she's been

855
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,000
able to get by.

856
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,610
But the smoke

857
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,610
last night triggered

858
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,610
the interstitial disease

859
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,440
and caused

860
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,440
the inflammation.

861
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,440
Yeah.

862
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,540
Hey, she's on steroids

863
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,540
right now.

864
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,080
Let's see how she responds.

865
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,040
Okay.

866
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,340
All right.

867
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,460
Grant.

868
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,590
I got your text message.

869
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,400
Maggie, I was hoping

870
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,400
I could catch you.

871
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,030
Okay.

872
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,930
You seemed

873
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,930
uncomfortable

874
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,930
this morning.

875
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,340
Was it because of me?

876
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,340
No, no, no, no, no.

877
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,840
Look, I was very happy

878
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,840
to bring you

879
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,840
and Vanessa together.

880
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,350
And it meant

881
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,350
a lot to me, too,

882
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,350
to see you again.

883
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,980
I felt the same way.

884
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,750
Tell me, Maggie,

885
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,750
you ever wonder

886
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,550
what it would have been like

887
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,550
if we'd just run off together?

888
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,060
I mean, if our parents

889
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,060
hadn't found out and...

890
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,060
Grant.

891
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,950
I mean,

892
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,950
if they hadn't made us put

893
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,950
the baby up for adoption.

894
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,790
Of course I do.

895
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,700
But that's not

896
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,700
what happened.

897
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm married, Grant.

898
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,440
And I'm very happy,

899
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,440
and I love my husband.

900
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,940
And you have

901
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,940
a relationship

902
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,940
with Vanessa now,

903
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
and that's fine.

904
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
That's good.

905
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,510
But I can't be

906
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,510
a part of that.

907
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,510
I'm sorry.

908
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,750
Dr. Marcel.

909
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,590
Yeah. Get him prepped.

910
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,590
I'll be right there.

911
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,520
Going into this transplant,

912
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,520
I hope there's

913
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,120
no residual resentment.

914
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,690
I'm a surgeon.

915
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,690
The patient needs me.

916
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,790
On top of that,

917
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,790
I'm doing this for Dylan,

918
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,790
so, no, Ms. Goodwin.

919
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,700
No resentment.

920
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,700
Glad to hear it.

921
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,670
As you know,

922
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,670
the hospital is obligated

923
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,400
to have a senior

924
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,400
surgeon supervising,

925
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,570
and since Dr. Jones

926
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,570
will be resecting

927
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,570
the donor liver,

928
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,970
he can take that role.

929
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,070
Yeah, that's fine.

930
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,040
I also came to tell you

931
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,040
that we're experiencing

932
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,680
another shortage

933
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,680
of packed red blood cells.

934
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,780
I can only

935
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,780
allow this patient

936
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,780
seven units.

937
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,020
Ms. Goodwin,

938
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,020
a surgery like this is usually

939
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,020
allotted 10 to 20 units.

940
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,720
Yes, I'm aware,

941
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,720
but we can't have

942
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,720
any one patient

943
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,020
depleting our supplies.

944
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,060
We have other surgeries,

945
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,060
other patients.

946
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,720
So call another hospital.

947
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,720
I need that blood.

948
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,200
I've tried.

949
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,200
We're all in the same boat.

950
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,100
So you keep me

951
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,100
in transplant

952
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,100
but tie my hands?

953
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,570
I'm sorry, Dr. Marcel.

954
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,440
Seven units.

955
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,910
So, David,

956
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,910
do you know why

957
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,910
you're here?

958
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,010
Can you remember

959
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,010
what happened at all?

960
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,680
Why should I

961
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,680
talk to you?

962
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,650
Well, you don't

963
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,650
have to, actually.

964
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,850
But we're really just

965
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,850
trying to help you.

966
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,230
Dad said the pot was bad.

967
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,230
When you smoked it,

968
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,230
were you

969
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,060
alone or with some friends?

970
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,500
What difference

971
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,500
does it make?

972
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,800
Maybe none at all.

973
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,800
But I mean,

974
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,800
just out of curiosity,

975
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,240
were you hanging

976
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,240
with your crew, or...

977
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,110
People are stupid.

978
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,610
Certainly can be.

979
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,480
Let me ask you,

980
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,480
have you noticed

981
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,480
anything different

982
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,710
about yourself, about...

983
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,480
I don't know,

984
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,480
the way you...

985
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,220
The way you think,

986
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,220
about the way

987
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,220
you feel about things?

988
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,020
Anything at all?

989
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,190
I think maybe...

990
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,200
I know. I know.

991
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,770
I know.

992
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,100
David?

993
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,530
You're trying

994
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,530
to read my mind.

995
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,610
Is there someone in here

996
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,610
who's telling you that?

997
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,110
What?

998
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,110
No. I'm not crazy.

999
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,020
You know what?

1000
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,020
Sometimes I have this...

1001
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,780
This little voice

1002
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,780
in my head that's

1003
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,780
trying to tell me stuff,

1004
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,220
and I actually get confused.

1005
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,720
I lose track of whether

1006
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,720
is that me talking

1007
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,720
to myself,

1008
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,230
or is it someone else?

1009
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,160
Does that ever

1010
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,160
happen to you?

1011
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,720
Okay.

1012
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,560
And... And does that voice

1013
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,560
ever tell you to do things?

1014
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,080
Yes.

1015
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,610
Not to trust you.

1016
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,110
Okay.

1017
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,120
There's something wrong

1018
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,120
with me, isn't there?

1019
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,320
You know, pal,

1020
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,320
we're going

1021
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,320
to figure it out.

1022
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,660
Okay?

1023
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,730
You can trust me on that.

1024
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,860
Okay, so we know

1025
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,860
what we're looking at.

1026
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,700
His affect,

1027
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,700
disordered thinking,

1028
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,700
the voices.

1029
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,070
Now we can move forward.

1030
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,070
We can start a course

1031
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,070
of treatment.

1032
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,640
I think we need to take

1033
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,640
a little breath here, Doctor.

1034
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,870
The patient is a minor,

1035
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,870
which means that

1036
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,870
it's his parents

1037
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,880
who are going to be

1038
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,880
determining how we proceed,

1039
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,820
so I hope that you

1040
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,820
were observing them

1041
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,820
as closely as you were David.

1042
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,620
Dr. Marcel,

1043
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,620
how's it going?

1044
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,990
Good.

1045
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,030
Just the

1046
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,030
hepatic anastomosis

1047
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,030
has taken some work.

1048
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,660
Both the native artery

1049
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,660
and the donors'

1050
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,660
are a little short.

1051
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,630
You're using

1052
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,630
a parachute technique

1053
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,630
to bring them together.

1054
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,830
Yeah.

1055
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,900
Okay, good.

1056
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,900
Holler if you need me.

1057
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,230
Okay.

1058
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,310
Almost got

1059
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,310
the arteries together.

1060
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,100
How are his vitals?

1061
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,340
BP's starting to tank.

1062
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,840
Where we at on pressers?

1063
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,780
Maxed out.

1064
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,780
Fluid resuscitation?

1065
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,250
Same.

1066
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,250
Let's hang another unit

1067
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,250
of packed cells.

1068
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,880
Can't. That was our seventh.

1069
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,880
We're out.

1070
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,850
He's getting acidotic.

1071
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,110
Crockett?

1072
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,660
Yeah, almost there.

1073
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,820
One more.

1074
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,120
Okay, hepatic artery

1075
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,120
anastomosis complete.

1076
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,720
BP 87/56.

1077
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,720
Should I transfuse

1078
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,720
more platelets?

1079
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,960
Yeah.

1080
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,800
And 90 mgs per kg

1081
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,800
of Factor VII.

1082
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,800
Why?

1083
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,030
Got to get him clotting.

1084
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,030
Get me some Evarrest.

1085
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,300
We're gonna go ahead

1086
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,300
and pack and get out.

1087
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,840
Pack? No.

1088
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,840
You have to complete

1089
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,840
the bile duct anastomosis.

1090
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,970
No. He's lost

1091
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,970
too much blood.

1092
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,670
Gotta get him

1093
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,670
clotting now,

1094
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,670
or we'll lose him.

1095
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,210
Maybe you should

1096
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,210
call Dr. Jones.

1097
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,810
I know what I'm doing.

1098
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,390
We pack him,

1099
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,390
recycle what blood

1100
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,390
he's lost,

1101
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,020
and wait to complete

1102
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,020
the transplant.

1103
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,350
You can't stop the surgery.

1104
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,720
I have to.

1105
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,090
Believe me,

1106
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,090
it's the only option.

1107
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,060
All right, lap pads.

1108
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,060
Let's go. Come on.

1109
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,990
There it is. Keep going.

1110
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,160
Hey, Dan.

1111
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,430
The new psych fellow's

1112
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,430
looking for you.

1113
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,440
Oh.

1114
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,900
Yeah, thanks.

1115
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,000
We were able

1116
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,000
to diagnose that kid.

1117
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,110
It's funny. I think

1118
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,110
that Dr. Cuevas is taking

1119
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,740
a certain satisfaction

1120
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,740
in being able to put

1121
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,740
a name on it.

1122
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,980
I mean, I get that.

1123
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,920
I was like that

1124
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,920
when I was starting out.

1125
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,020
But you know,

1126
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,020
there's a little

1127
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,020
more to it.

1128
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,460
Yeah. So what is

1129
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,460
the diagnosis?

1130
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,460
Schizophrenia.

1131
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,900
I mean, we have to

1132
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,900
follow up and confirm

1133
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,900
and all that,

1134
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,200
but I'm...

1135
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,890
I'm pretty sure it's

1136
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,890
what we're looking at.

1137
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah. Have you told

1138
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,000
the parents?

1139
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,100
Not yet.

1140
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,770
I tried to call

1141
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,770
my son yesterday.

1142
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,370
Didn't know

1143
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,370
you had a son.

1144
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,350
Yeah.

1145
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,420
15 years ago,

1146
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,420
lost him to drugs.

1147
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,990
He's alive. I don't...

1148
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,110
I just don't know

1149
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,110
where he is.

1150
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,880
Sorry to hear that, Dean.

1151
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,880
Yeah.

1152
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,760
I'm telling you this

1153
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,760
because I know

1154
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,390
what it's going to be like

1155
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,390
for those parents.

1156
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,720
Boy.

1157
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,890
Oh, they're going

1158
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,890
to remember

1159
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,890
that laughing kid

1160
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,270
running through

1161
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,270
the sprinklers,

1162
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,270
how proud he was

1163
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,460
when he learned

1164
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,460
how to ride a bike.

1165
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,070
And they are not

1166
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,070
going to understand

1167
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,370
how it's possible

1168
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,370
that some outside force

1169
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,070
has stolen that boy away.

1170
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,890
Oh... You know that.

1171
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,350
Yeah.

1172
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,920
Well, I gotta go tell them.

1173
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,320
Gotta go tell the parents.

1174
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,890
Well, like you always say,

1175
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,890
at least now

1176
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,290
he'll get the help he needs.

1177
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,800
Let's hope so.

1178
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,810
All right,

1179
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,810
let's unpack him.

1180
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,140
You got it?

1181
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,770
Great.

1182
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,480
Thank you.

1183
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,350
Okay, no active bleeding.

1184
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,290
Marty?

1185
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,980
Vitals are steady.

1186
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,450
Looks like it worked.

1187
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,190
Hell of a call, Crockett.

1188
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,060
All right.

1189
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,060
Good job, everyone.

1190
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,060
Let's wrap this up.

1191
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,160
So, Dr. Cuevas and I

1192
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,160
have a strong hunch

1193
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,430
about what could be causing

1194
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,430
David's difficulties.

1195
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,230
Is it really

1196
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,230
such a mystery?

1197
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,170
I mean,

1198
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,170
it seems like just

1199
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,170
normal adolescent stuff.

1200
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,940
I know you've

1201
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,940
noticed his...

1202
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,170
His odd comments,

1203
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,170
his jumbled thoughts.

1204
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,270
His fearfulness.

1205
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,540
You... You think that there's

1206
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,540
something wrong with David?

1207
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,050
We think David is

1208
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,050
suffering from an illness.

1209
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,920
We'd like him to see one of

1210
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,920
our outpatient psychiatrists.

1211
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,490
Wait, wait, wait,

1212
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,490
wait, wait, wait.

1213
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,490
Another psychiatrist?

1214
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,820
It's just part of

1215
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,820
the evaluation process.

1216
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,390
I don't understand.

1217
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,570
This isn't

1218
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,570
making any sense.

1219
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,930
What is going on?

1220
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,460
We know that you love

1221
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,460
your son very much,

1222
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,540
and this might not be

1223
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,540
easy to hear,

1224
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,010
but we believe

1225
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,010
that David is developing

1226
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,010
a schizoaffective disorder.

1227
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,380
What?

1228
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,500
Mentally ill?

1229
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,880
No.

1230
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,110
Psychotic?

1231
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,310
No!

1232
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,010
No, we're taking

1233
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,010
David home right now.

1234
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,480
How can you

1235
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,480
say that about him?

1236
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,020
This is

1237
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,020
a treatable condition.

1238
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,020
How?

1239
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,110
We have a much better

1240
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,110
understanding

1241
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,380
of the mechanism...

1242
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,380
My boy isn't crazy.

1243
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,920
You're the ones

1244
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,920
that are crazy.

1245
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,620
I think if we can just...

1246
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,620
Can we please

1247
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,620
talk about this?

1248
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,190
No. No.

1249
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,290
Look, we don't want

1250
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,290
anything to do with you.

1251
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,390
Stay away from us.

1252
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,550
We should sue you.

1253
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,460
Oh, my God.

1254
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,440
I mean, I've had patients

1255
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,440
with schizophrenia before,

1256
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,240
but I've never had to break

1257
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,240
the news to the parents.

1258
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,310
Sadly, their reaction

1259
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,310
is not uncommon.

1260
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,320
Well, how is that boy

1261
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,320
supposed to get any help?

1262
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,440
Exactly.

1263
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,650
Come in.

1264
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,360
Ms. Goodwin.

1265
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,930
Dr. Scott.

1266
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,260
I wanted to let you know,

1267
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,260
Goran's transplant

1268
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,260
is going well.

1269
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,390
Dr. Marcel thinks

1270
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,390
he'll pull through.

1271
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,910
Well, good.

1272
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,910
I know how much

1273
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,910
that means to you.

1274
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,940
I'm sorry,

1275
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,940
I have to run out.

1276
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,440
I have

1277
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,440
the Vas-COM trial.

1278
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,540
I also wanted to tell you

1279
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,540
I'm leaving Med.

1280
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,050
What?

1281
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,560
You once reminded me

1282
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,560
that I wear a white coat,

1283
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,560
not a blue one.

1284
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,120
But the thing is,

1285
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,120
here in Chicago,

1286
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,460
I don't think I'll ever

1287
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,460
be able to escape my past.

1288
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,400
I don't think

1289
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,400
I'll ever be able to

1290
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,400
take that blue coat off.

1291
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,530
But Chicago's your home.

1292
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,530
You grew up here.

1293
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, that's the problem.

1294
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,270
Those old ties

1295
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,270
keep pulling me back in.

1296
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,510
I have to go someplace

1297
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,510
where I can just be

1298
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,510
a doctor. So...

1299
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,720
Well, you will be

1300
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,720
sorely missed.

1301
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,680
Is there any way I can

1302
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,680
talk you out of it?

1303
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:25,060
This is where I met Jo,

1304
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:25,060
and where I lost her.

1305
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:30,000
So every time

1306
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:30,000
I go past that room,

1307
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,440
I think of her, and...

1308
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,510
Understood.

1309
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,100
It has truly been

1310
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,100
my pleasure, Dr. Scott.

1311
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,020
Wow. Extubated.

1312
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,690
RSBI was normal.

1313
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,190
Passed her breathing trial

1314
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,190
with flying colors.

1315
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,160
Talc granulomas.

1316
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,490
Heroin addiction.

1317
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,690
A gift that keeps giving.

1318
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,500
The pulmonologist will

1319
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,500
get your lungs cleaned up.

1320
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,590
You'll be fine.

1321
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,260
Yeah, till the next thing.

1322
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,340
I just can't seem to

1323
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,340
shake the past.

1324
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,570
Hey, you're not

1325
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,570
in this alone,

1326
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,570
Hannah, okay?

1327
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,640
Excuse me.

1328
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,620
Dr. Halstead,

1329
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,620
you and I have

1330
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,620
a date in court.

1331
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,550
Where did you get

1332
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,550
that outfit?

1333
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,650
Maggie dug it out

1334
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,650
of the lost and found.

1335
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,090
Yeah? Well, she didn't

1336
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,090
do you any favors.

1337
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,390
Jessa Rinaldi,

1338
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,390
we're placing you

1339
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,390
under arrest.

1340
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,490
What?

1341
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,590
Don't say anything.

1342
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,690
You're charged with

1343
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,690
aggravated arson

1344
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,100
and one count

1345
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,100
of attempted murder

1346
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,400
against Dr. Will Halstead.

1347
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,600
Oh, come on.

1348
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,600
What the hell is this?

1349
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,140
This is absolutely

1350
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,140
ridiculous.

1351
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,140
We have credit card

1352
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,140
evidence of your client

1353
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,140
buying accelerant

1354
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,710
plus surveillance

1355
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,710
camera footage

1356
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,400
of her entering

1357
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,400
and leaving the building

1358
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,110
immediately before the fire.

1359
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,710
Let's go.

1360
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,730
I thought Sam told you

1361
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,730
I didn't want to see you.

1362
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,560
He did.

1363
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,170
But I have something

1364
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,170
I need to say.

1365
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,640
Look, if you came

1366
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,640
to apologize...

1367
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,370
I didn't.

1368
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,570
I came to thank you.

1369
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,210
I had a win

1370
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,210
in the OR today,

1371
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,210
largely because of you,

1372
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,550
what you taught me.

1373
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,380
It made me realize, I...

1374
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,220
I have an obligation

1375
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,220
to continue this work,

1376
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,690
that I can't throw away

1377
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,690
the knowledge you've

1378
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,690
given me.

1379
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,560
Very nice speech, Crockett.

1380
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,630
Meanwhile, I'm sidelined

1381
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,630
with this injury.

1382
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,800
I know.

1383
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,840
When I come back,

1384
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,840
which I will,

1385
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,200
if you think you're going to

1386
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,200
be on my team, think again.

1387
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,310
All right.

1388
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,580
You know, if it had

1389
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,580
been me on the table,

1390
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,180
and it was you

1391
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,180
who had to make the call,

1392
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,850
I'm pretty sure you would've

1393
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,850
done the same thing.

1394
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,870
Good night, Pamela.

1395
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,370
So I don't know

1396
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,370
if he mentioned it,

1397
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,500
but I actually

1398
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,500
did my residency

1399
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,500
with your partner

1400
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,140
way back when.

1401
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,140
A little before your time.

1402
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,780
But, uh, anyway,

1403
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,580
so, um, you know

1404
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,580
I had to part company

1405
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,580
with my therapist

1406
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,450
about, ah,

1407
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,450
two months ago.

1408
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,650
And I don't know,

1409
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,650
lately I've just been really

1410
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,650
missing the interaction.

1411
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,790
And, uh...

1412
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,570
And then today,

1413
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,570
I just had this

1414
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,570
brutal day, and...

1415
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,330
I'm sorry. I just

1416
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,330
have to ask you

1417
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,330
a few questions. Uh...

1418
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,300
Do you smoke?

1419
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,300
No.

1420
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,470
Take any

1421
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,470
recreational drugs?

1422
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,700
No.

1423
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,850
Do you have

1424
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,850
a gun in the house?

1425
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,650
No, I do not.

1426
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,650
Okay.

1427
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,520
So you were saying

1428
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,520
that today was

1429
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,520
particularly difficult?

1430
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,430
In what way

1431
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,430
was it difficult? Hmm?

1432
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,370
April?

1433
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,410
Ethan. Hi.

1434
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,480
I, um...

1435
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,480
I saw your dad's obituary.

1436
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:49,290
I... I would have come

1437
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:49,290
to the service, but I...

1438
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,760
I wasn't sure.

1439
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,660
I mean, I didn't want

1440
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,660
it to be awkward, so, um...

1441
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,570
Um, are you back

1442
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,570
in Chicago?

1443
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,730
Yeah. Yeah.

1444
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,640
I finished my NP program.

1445
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,550
I'm working with

1446
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,550
a medical group here, so...

1447
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,880
What about you?

1448
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,880
Are you all better?

1449
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,750
Yeah, uh, pretty much.

1450
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,720
Guess my NFL career

1451
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,720
is over, but...

1452
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,290
How's the family?

1453
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,860
Emily, the baby?

1454
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,260
Well, he's probably

1455
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,260
huge by now.

1456
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,730
Not a baby anymore, no.

1457
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,730
Um...

1458
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,770
But good.

1459
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,930
They're really good.

1460
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,740
You didn't get married

1461
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,740
or anything, did you?

1462
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,640
No.

1463
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,570
Did you?

1464
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,810
No.

1465
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,850
Um...

1466
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,730
Well, I will see you around.

1467
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,490
Yeah.

1468
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,460
Yeah.

1469
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,360
Hello.

1470
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,360
You have a call from...

1471
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,950
Sean Archer.

1472
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,430
An inmate

1473
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,430
at Cook County Jail.

1474
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,660
Will you accept?

1475
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,660
Yes.

1476
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,400
Absolutely.

1477
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,700
Dad?

1478
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,930
Dylan.

1479
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,550
Hey, Dylan.

1480
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,830
Wait up.

1481
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,870
It wasn't Goran.

1482
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,600
It was Jessa.

1483
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,830
What?

1484
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,840
The fire. Goran had

1485
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,840
nothing to do with it.

1486
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,380
Jessa from Vasik, she was

1487
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,380
the one who started it.

1488
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,970
Yeah, Ms. Goodwin

1489
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,970
told me you were leaving.

1490
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,610
I know you've

1491
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,610
been through a lot,

1492
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,590
but if your decision

1493
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,590
had anything to do

1494
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,590
with the fire...

1495
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,750
It didn't.

1496
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,160
You know what?

1497
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,160
I appreciate it.

1498
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,980
Yeah.

1499
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,600
Yeah. Maybe give it

1500
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,600
a couple of days.

1501
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,760
Think about it.

1502
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,090
You're a good guy, Will.

1503
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,870
Take care, man.

1504
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,170
You too.
