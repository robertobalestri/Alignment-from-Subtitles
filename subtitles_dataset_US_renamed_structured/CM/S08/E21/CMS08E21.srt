1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,300
I'm testing to see if I can

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,300
give you my kidney.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,000
You went to Sean

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,000
against my wishes.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,440
It felt like Sean

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,440
needed to know

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,010
how bad you're

8
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,010
actually doing.

9
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,370
Hannah's smart, kind,

10
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,370
and super cute.

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,180
You're still in recovery.

12
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,180
So is Hannah,

13
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,180
for that matter.

14
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,580
I have a bad feeling

15
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,580
about the direction that

16
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,580
Jack is taking us.

17
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,680
Since we stopped taking

18
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,680
walk-ins without insurance,

19
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,150
numbers are down.

20
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,120
Heard rumors of you

21
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,120
acting like a cowboy.

22
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,320
That's not what

23
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,320
happened today.

24
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,450
Who you trying to convince

25
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,450
with that? Me or you?

26
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,550
I know the tech.

27
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,550
I promise you.

28
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,550
It won't let you down.

29
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,690
2.0, guide me

30
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,690
to the next lesion.

31
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,200
Calculating. Calculating.

32
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,360
Richard, can you hear me?

33
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,000
Sometimes,

34
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,000
patients don't survive.

35
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,670
But it's the burden we bear.

36
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,510
He's selling seats

37
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,510
on a rocket ship,

38
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,240
making up rules only

39
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,240
his rich pals can play by.

40
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,310
It's not right.

41
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,150
Yeah. So how was

42
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,150
your date last night?

43
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,450
God, I wouldn't

44
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,450
consider a guy

45
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,450
talking at me

46
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,080
for 90 minutes

47
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,080
straight a date.

48
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,080
Oh.

49
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,350
I swear, Hannah,

50
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,350
he didn't ask me

51
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,350
a single question

52
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,260
about myself.

53
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,260
Oh, that sounds awful.

54
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,060
You met him on the apps?

55
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,230
Yeah, but I think after

56
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,230
last night, I'm just

57
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,230
gonna delete them all.

58
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,170
No, don't lose hope.

59
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,260
Dean!

60
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,770
Over here.

61
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,300
Cuevas. You bellowed?

62
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,210
Here it is.

63
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,210
What is this?

64
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,370
It's a bomb.

65
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,350
It's a renal-friendly

66
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,350
snack bar.

67
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,650
Yeah? Does it taste

68
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,650
like cardboard?

69
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,780
I'm happy to report

70
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,780
that it does not.

71
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,250
I even tried it myself.

72
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,720
Well, you enjoy

73
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,720
those disgusting

74
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,720
green smoothies,

75
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,420
so your taste is suspect.

76
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,220
I'll see both

77
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,220
of you in the ED.

78
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,370
So what about

79
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,370
your dating life?

80
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,370
Hmm.

81
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,630
It's been a while since

82
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,630
you've dated, right?

83
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,630
Not since Will?

84
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,470
I mean, who's counting?

85
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,470
But yeah.

86
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,840
Actually...

87
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,080
Wow, I didn't realize

88
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,080
it's been that long.

89
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,110
Well, maybe it's time

90
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,110
to put yourself out there.

91
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,520
Hi.

92
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,760
Morning.

93
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,230
You look nice.

94
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,500
Thanks.

95
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,270
Big media blitz

96
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,270
today with Jack.

97
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,770
This for the IPO launch

98
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,770
tomorrow?

99
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,580
2.0's going public, right?

100
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,840
Correct.

101
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,310
And Jack will go

102
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,310
from billionaire

103
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,310
to gazillionaire.

104
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,880
More importantly,

105
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,880
it'll expand 2.0's

106
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,880
global reach.

107
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,490
Look, I know

108
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,490
you're not Jack's

109
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,490
biggest fan, but...

110
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,690
I don't like the direction

111
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,690
he's taking Med in.

112
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,770
It's becoming a place

113
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,770
I don't recognize anymore.

114
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,830
Well, maybe that's not

115
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,830
such a bad thing.

116
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,130
Jack's tasked me with

117
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,130
assessing the state

118
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,130
of the hospital,

119
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,570
and I found numerous

120
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,570
examples of inefficiency.

121
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,840
How are we

122
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,840
inefficient, exactly?

123
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,410
Treating patients

124
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,410
or turning a profit?

125
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,820
I know you're deeply

126
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,820
invested in Med

127
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,850
and that makes it difficult

128
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,850
for you to see the flaws.

129
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,650
I guess I could say

130
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,650
the same for you, Grace.

131
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,350
Jack was your mentor.

132
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,820
You got a lot of

133
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,820
respect for the guy.

134
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,820
I know that.

135
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,330
But he's only

136
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,330
out for himself.

137
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,760
That's not true.

138
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,390
I guess we're gonna

139
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,390
have to agree to

140
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,390
disagree on this one.

141
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,540
Self-portrait?

142
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,410
No.

143
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,240
My friend Owen

144
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,240
drew it for me.

145
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,510
Owen?

146
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,510
Natalie Manning's son?

147
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,890
Hang out at the

148
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,890
nurses' station,

149
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,260
hear some things.

150
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,420
I bet.

151
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,960
Look, Natalie and I

152
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,960
keep in touch, but...

153
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,930
You really don't owe me

154
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,930
any explanation.

155
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,400
It's not like we're...

156
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,340
Anything.

157
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,570
Are we?

158
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,870
Grace...

159
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,870
I'm not sure this is

160
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,870
gonna work.

161
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,910
Good luck today.

162
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,680
Mrs. Abrams.

163
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,680
I am Dr. Asher.

164
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,380
Please, call me Michelle.

165
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,790
I am so sorry my husband

166
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,790
roped you into this.

167
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,760
Oh, I don't mind at all.

168
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,760
I'm happy to help.

169
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,350
It's just my doctor

170
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,350
couldn't get me in

171
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,560
until next week and...

172
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,560
Mm-hmm.

173
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,890
Honey.

174
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,670
Please tell me you did not

175
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,670
just leave surgery.

176
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,330
No. Our part was over,

177
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,330
so I had an underling close.

178
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,270
Dr. Asher, thanks again

179
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,270
for doing this.

180
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,370
Yeah.

181
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,270
As if you gave

182
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,270
her a choice.

183
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,510
Next time a family member

184
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,510
needs a craniotomy,

185
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,780
I'm your man.

186
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,780
Well, I will hold

187
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,780
you to that.

188
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,010
So, Michelle,

189
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,010
what's going on?

190
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm 99% sure

191
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,520
I have a UTI.

192
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,520
I had one about a year ago,

193
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,620
and I'm experiencing

194
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,620
the same symptoms

195
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,750
like abdominal pain,

196
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,320
um, pelvic pressure,

197
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,320
and frequent urination.

198
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,400
Okay, well, let's

199
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,400
get you in a gown.

200
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,400
Excuse me.

201
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,800
We will start by

202
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,800
taking a urine sample.

203
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,870
Okay? Okay.

204
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,870
Sounds good.

205
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,000
Morning, Will.

206
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,370
I thought you

207
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,370
were off today.

208
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,320
Jack roped me into

209
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,320
speaking at the IPO

210
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,320
press conference.

211
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,540
Tried to get out of it,

212
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,020
but he was conveniently

213
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,020
unavailable to

214
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,020
take my calls.

215
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,690
Makes sense

216
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,690
he wants you there.

217
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,320
You are the face

218
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,320
of the machine.

219
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,320
Ha.

220
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,830
Yeah, well, I'm not

221
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,830
exactly feeling

222
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,830
camera ready.

223
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,400
Haven't been sleeping much.

224
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,330
Yeah? What's going on?

225
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
I can't stop thinking

226
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
about Richard Evans.

227
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,770
I feel you.

228
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,770
Been weighing on me too.

229
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,040
Keep trying to

230
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,040
piece together

231
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,040
what went wrong.

232
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,980
What do you mean?

233
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,980
CT showed he

234
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,980
suffered a stroke.

235
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,920
His echo revealed

236
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,920
a ventricular

237
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,920
septal defect.

238
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,450
That's true.

239
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,320
So he must have thrown a clot,

240
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,320
traveled to his brain

241
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,820
through the septal defect.

242
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,990
Deep vein clots are one of

243
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,990
the most common surgical

244
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,990
complications, aren't they?

245
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,860
Yes, they are.

246
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,930
But in those cases,

247
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,930
where would you expect

248
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,930
the clot to originate?

249
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,360
His pelvis or his legs.

250
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,570
Richard's CT showed

251
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,570
the clot was in his liver.

252
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,940
Wait, how did he get

253
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,940
a clot in his liver?

254
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,040
That's what I can't

255
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,040
seem to figure out.

256
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,710
What, are you gonna

257
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,710
do an autopsy?

258
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,720
No, his wife

259
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,720
didn't want it.

260
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,380
But 2.0 records

261
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,380
a massive amount of

262
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,380
intraoperative data,

263
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,820
so I'm gonna have...

264
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,360
I'm gonna have Grace

265
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,360
pull his files on

266
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,360
Richard's surgery,

267
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,660
see if I can find

268
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,660
some answers there.

269
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,890
Keep me posted.

270
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,700
Yeah. Will do.

271
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,410
What's up?

272
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,850
One second.

273
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,850
Grace, talk to me.

274
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,390
The data from

275
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,390
Richard Evans' surgery,

276
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,390
it's missing.

277
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,720
What do you mean missing?

278
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,690
It's not on the server.

279
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,690
I don't know

280
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,690
where it could be.

281
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,030
There must be a backup.

282
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,930
I tried the backup server.

283
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,930
It's not there either.

284
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,730
Has this happened before?

285
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,730
Data just disappearing?

286
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,870
No. Never.

287
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,520
Wow! Somebody looked

288
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,520
pretty happy for having just

289
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,520
gotten off the night shift.

290
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,800
I get the appraisal back

291
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,800
on my new home today.

292
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,100
If it appraises for

293
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,100
what I expect,

294
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,610
I remove my

295
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,610
final contingency.

296
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,470
Wow. Big day.

297
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,470
Yeah.

298
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,010
So you've given notice

299
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,010
to your landlord

300
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,010
and everything?

301
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,810
Oh, yes. I think he's

302
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,810
more excited than me.

303
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,820
Day after I move out,

304
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,820
he has a contractor

305
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,820
coming in

306
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,510
to start renovations.

307
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,210
Anything I can do to

308
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,210
help with the move?

309
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,120
Uh, I will be packing

310
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,120
all day and night.

311
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,520
Company would be nice

312
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,520
when you get off work.

313
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,750
I can do you one better.

314
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,490
Me and wine, plus pizza.

315
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,500
You know the way to my heart.

316
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,630
I do, don't I?

317
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,630
Yeah.

318
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,900
See you later.

319
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,070
All right.

320
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,070
Let's get you guys home.

321
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,230
Let's go, guys.

322
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,140
Okay, and you'll wanna

323
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,140
change the bandage

324
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,140
every day

325
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,940
and apply this ointment

326
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,940
at night.

327
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,680
Just generally overall

328
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,680
stay off the foot

329
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,680
as much as possible.

330
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,770
I'll try.

331
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,790
Now Penny, if the wound

332
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,790
turns red or develops pus

333
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,950
or you start running

334
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,950
a fever, I want you

335
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,950
to come back.

336
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,960
Just say you're having

337
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,960
chest pain so

338
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,960
you don't have

339
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,820
any trouble checking in

340
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,820
without insurance.

341
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,160
Right. Got it.

342
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,160
I really appreciate

343
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,160
your help.

344
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,790
Because of my

345
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,790
immigration status,

346
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,920
I'm careful about

347
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,920
where I give my name,

348
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,970
and I always come to Med

349
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,970
'cause I know it's safe.

350
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,130
It still is.

351
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,600
We just got some

352
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,600
new policies

353
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,600
to contend with.

354
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,570
Well, thanks again.

355
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,070
Come on, boys. Let's go.

356
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,170
Bye, guys.

357
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,620
How long do you think

358
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,620
you'll be able to get

359
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,620
away with this?

360
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,710
With what?

361
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,980
Another patient

362
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,980
complaining of chest pain?

363
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,120
It's the only way to

364
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,120
get around Dayton's

365
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,120
new policy.

366
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,060
I'm not mocking you.

367
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,060
I'm applauding

368
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,060
your creativity.

369
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
I'm just as fed up

370
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
as you are.

371
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,930
But unfortunately,

372
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,930
it's not a long-term

373
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,930
solution.

374
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,560
I know.

375
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,930
Yeah.

376
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,900
Dr. Asher.

377
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,000
So, Michelle,

378
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,000
I got your lab

379
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,000
results back,

380
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,910
and it turns out

381
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,910
you do not have a UTI.

382
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,550
You're kidding.

383
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,680
I thought for sure.

384
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,650
Well, sometimes

385
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,650
symptoms of a UTI

386
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,550
can mimic those

387
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,550
of pregnancy.

388
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,620
What? Are you saying...

389
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,720
Yes.

390
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,630
Michelle, you are pregnant.

391
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,300
No. No. That...

392
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,930
That's a mistake.

393
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,940
I had a vasectomy

394
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,940
seven years ago.

395
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,310
Oh, well, we can absolutely

396
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,310
run a beta to confirm.

397
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,910
I was also about to do

398
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,910
an ultrasound and

399
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,910
a pelvic exam as well.

400
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,310
Well, there's just...

401
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,640
There's no way

402
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,640
this is possible.

403
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,690
Well, recanalization can

404
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,690
happen after a vasectomy.

405
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,780
Right. Not seven years later.

406
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,250
If it's gonna happen,

407
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,250
it usually happens

408
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,250
in year one.

409
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,350
Sam.

410
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,850
Stop debating whether

411
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,850
it's possible

412
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,020
and let's just get the

413
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,020
ultrasound so we can confirm

414
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,020
I'm actually pregnant.

415
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,150
Right, right, right. Yeah.

416
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,060
Yeah. Okay.

417
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,600
Do you mind lifting

418
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,600
your gown a little?

419
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,600
Mm-hmm.

420
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay.

421
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,360
So this will feel

422
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,360
a little cold.

423
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,730
You ready?

424
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,730
Mm-hmm.

425
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,140
Oh, wow!

426
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,010
Do you wanna hear

427
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,010
the heartbeat?

428
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,010
Yeah.

429
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,760
I'm gonna sue my urologist.

430
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,020
Told me he never had

431
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,020
a vasectomy fail.

432
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,700
Seriously?

433
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,870
That's all you have to say?

434
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,870
I am going to give you

435
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,870
guys a minute.

436
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,310
Michelle, I will be

437
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,310
back for your pelvic

438
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,310
exam in a bit.

439
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,910
Yeah.

440
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,780
Dr. Charles?

441
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,350
Dr. Nellie Cuevas.

442
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,350
What's up?

443
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,150
David Sullivan's back.

444
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,090
Really?

445
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,990
I was just talking

446
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,990
to his mom,

447
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,990
like, last week.

448
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,900
She said that he's doing

449
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,900
really well on his ECT

450
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,900
maintenance regimen.

451
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,870
They might have even just

452
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,870
lowered his risperidone.

453
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,440
I mean, how does he seem?

454
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,300
I haven't spoken to him.

455
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,340
I thought it would be better

456
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,340
if you did the intake.

457
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,930
Why is that?

458
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,110
Well, the last few times

459
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,110
he's been in the ED,

460
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,010
my presence has only

461
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,010
agitated him

462
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,950
and tightened his paranoia.

463
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,310
Just for the record,

464
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,310
that's probably

465
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,310
got a lot less

466
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,750
to do with you than

467
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,750
the paranoid delusions

468
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,750
he was experiencing.

469
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,290
I just don't wanna

470
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,290
risk upsetting him

471
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,350
right off the bat,

472
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,350
but he looks calm

473
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,350
right now.

474
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,060
So if you wouldn't mind?

475
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,900
Give me two minutes.

476
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,900
Okay, thanks.

477
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,700
Oh, good.

478
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,900
Dr. Charles, I was hoping

479
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,900
you'd be here today.

480
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,240
So your mom said

481
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,240
you decided

482
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,240
on U of Illinois?

483
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,250
Dude, that's a great school.

484
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,250
Congratulations.

485
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,720
Thanks.

486
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,910
But I'm not sure

487
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,910
it's gonna work out,

488
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,420
that I'll be able to go.

489
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,720
How come?

490
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,180
Dr. Charles, you can't

491
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,180
tell my parents this.

492
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,230
Okay. They don't know

493
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,230
you're here?

494
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,490
I just didn't want

495
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,490
them to worry.

496
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,460
All right.

497
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,130
But I've been hearing

498
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,130
voices again.

499
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,970
Okay. Well, what are

500
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,970
they saying?

501
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,240
That a diploma

502
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,240
doesn't matter

503
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,240
if I'm still crazy.

504
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,040
You know, that I should

505
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,040
stay in my room

506
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,040
all the time.

507
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,270
That if I go places,

508
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,270
I'll just embarrass myself.

509
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,150
Places like what?

510
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,150
What kind of places?

511
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,740
College.

512
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,350
Graduation.

513
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,750
Prom this weekend.

514
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,090
You're going to prom?

515
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,090
That's fantastic.

516
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,250
Yeah.

517
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,930
With this girl Amber

518
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,930
and her friends.

519
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,500
But I have to back out.

520
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,960
Because of the voices?

521
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,130
Yeah. They're saying

522
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,130
it's gonna be the

523
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,130
worst night of my life,

524
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,330
that I'm gonna make

525
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,330
a fool of myself,

526
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
and Amber won't even

527
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
wanna talk to me

528
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
when it's all over.

529
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,970
Huh.

530
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,110
Buddy, can I ask you,

531
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,280
what exactly do these

532
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,280
voices sound like?

533
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,320
Can you get specific for me?

534
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,350
What do you mean?

535
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,860
Well, in the past,

536
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,860
you've often described

537
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,050
the voices as loud,

538
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,050
aggressive, abrasive,

539
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,290
like, scary, even.

540
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,960
Do these voices...

541
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,960
Do they sound like that?

542
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,090
No.

543
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,100
No, they don't really

544
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,100
have a sound,

545
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,100
but they're there.

546
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,110
I know they're there.

547
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,040
Huh.

548
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,310
Listen, pull up

549
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,310
my schedule.

550
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,440
Cancel the 4:00 today.

551
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,580
Sharon, you're going

552
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,580
the wrong direction.

553
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,150
Good morning, Jack.

554
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,120
Yeah, the IPO conference

555
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,120
is in the amphitheater.

556
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,380
I'm aware.

557
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,020
Did you forget

558
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,020
you're making

559
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,020
a statement?

560
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,150
I did not, but after

561
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,150
giving it more thought,

562
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,890
I decided that it would

563
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,890
be inappropriate

564
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,260
for me to speak

565
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,260
on behalf of

566
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,260
the hospital.

567
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,490
And why is that?

568
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,330
Well, because 2.0

569
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,330
hitting the stock exchange

570
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,030
benefits Dayton Corporation

571
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,030
and not Chicago Med.

572
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,340
Well, 2.0 put Med

573
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,340
on the map. Made it a

574
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,340
destination hospital.

575
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,240
Well, I'm of a different

576
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,240
opinion, and the

577
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,240
bottom line, Jack,

578
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,010
hawking your wares

579
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,010
is not in

580
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,010
my job description.

581
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,150
Hey, Grace.

582
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,150
Any luck getting

583
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,150
the data back?

584
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,190
Not yet. I'm working on it.

585
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,390
Got a bit of

586
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,390
a surprise plan,

587
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,390
so just roll with it

588
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,200
and we'll touch base

589
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,200
later on. Okay?

590
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,270
Jack...

591
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,270
Hi, everyone.

592
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,170
So, um,

593
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,070
I'm gonna keep this

594
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,070
short and sweet

595
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,010
because I'm gonna be

596
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,010
asking all of you,

597
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,550
well, to come back

598
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,550
in about 24 hours.

599
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,410
Tomorrow, we are gonna be

600
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,410
inviting the general public

601
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,960
to invest in the future

602
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,960
of OR 2.0,

603
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,290
and I want them to

604
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,290
see exactly what

605
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,290
they're investing in.

606
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,490
So I am very excited

607
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,490
to announce that tomorrow

608
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,500
we will be live streaming

609
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,500
a surgery on the 2.0

610
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,090
for the entire

611
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,090
world to watch.

612
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,300
Who's the patient?

613
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,300
That's a great question.

614
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,640
I'm gonna put my life

615
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,640
in its hands

616
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,350
and in the very

617
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,350
capable hands

618
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,350
of Dr. Marcel here,

619
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,510
who I'm sure you're

620
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,510
all quite familiar with

621
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,510
at this point.

622
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,050
So let's open this up

623
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,050
to some questions.

624
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,090
What the hell was that?

625
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,530
Oh, listen, I'm...

626
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,570
I'm sorry I didn't

627
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,570
give you more

628
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,570
of a heads up.

629
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,690
Had this idea last night.

630
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,690
I just had to go with it.

631
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
What surgery

632
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
am I performing

633
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
on you anyway?

634
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,570
It's nothing. It's a redo

635
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,570
ventral hernia repair,

636
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,240
something I've been

637
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,240
meaning to do for a while.

638
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,240
Total softball surgery.

639
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,970
This way, you can focus

640
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,950
on highlighting

641
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,950
the bells and

642
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,950
whistles of 2.0.

643
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,980
Yeah, well,

644
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,980
speaking of 2.0,

645
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,980
we got a problem.

646
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,310
What do you mean?

647
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,350
It deleted a surgery's

648
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,350
worth of data.

649
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,110
What surgery?

650
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,190
A patient by the name

651
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,190
of Richard Evans.

652
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,310
Right.

653
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,990
Yeah, the gentleman with

654
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,990
the pancreatic cancer

655
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,460
spread to his liver, right?

656
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,500
Yeah. How'd you know that?

657
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,160
It's 2.0's

658
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,160
first recorded fatality.

659
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,290
Of course I know.

660
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,290
Dr. Song briefed me.

661
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,270
Yeah, well,

662
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,270
the data's gone.

663
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,640
I'm trying to

664
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,640
figure out what caused

665
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,640
Mr. Evans' death.

666
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,230
Look, his liver was

667
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,230
riddled with lesions.

668
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,230
He was a ticking time bomb.

669
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,970
Never gonna

670
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,970
survive long term.

671
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,240
Yes, but I was trying

672
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,240
to buy him more time...

673
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,040
Just leave it alone,

674
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,040
Crockett.

675
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,610
What does that mean?

676
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,980
Nothing.

677
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,110
Nothing, look, it's...

678
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,110
Let it go, all right?

679
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,350
It's a fool's errand.

680
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,350
Where's the data, Jack?

681
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,150
Jack?

682
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,560
I'm trying to

683
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,560
protect you here, man.

684
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,030
What do you mean protect me?

685
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,030
You made a mistake.

686
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
Hey, there.

687
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,380
Did Sam have to go

688
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,380
back upstairs?

689
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,250
No. He's taking a walk.

690
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,650
Figured we could both

691
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,650
use a breather.

692
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,090
Yeah.

693
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,090
Mm-hmm.

694
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,780
All right, well, let's take

695
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,780
a quick look inside, okay?

696
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,290
You're gonna feel

697
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,290
some pressure, but...

698
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,420
It won't last long,

699
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,420
I promise. Okay?

700
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,470
All right. You ready?

701
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,470
Mm-hmm.

702
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,370
No unusual discharge.

703
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,370
Everything's looking good.

704
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,330
Almost to the cervix.

705
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,800
Dr. Asher?

706
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,700
Is everything okay?

707
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,510
So, Michelle,

708
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,280
what I'm seeing is

709
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,280
what we call cervical

710
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,280
insufficiency.

711
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,090
In other words,

712
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,090
your cervix is starting

713
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,090
to open prematurely.

714
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,750
Am I gonna lose the baby?

715
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,830
In order to prevent

716
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,830
a miscarriage,

717
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,830
I'd recommend a cerclage.

718
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,750
It's a minimally

719
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,750
invasive procedure

720
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,590
where we stitch

721
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,590
the cervix closed.

722
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,590
It takes about an hour.

723
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,100
How soon can I have

724
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,100
the operation?

725
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,800
I would like to do it today,

726
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,800
if that's okay with you.

727
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,270
When the cervix

728
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,270
starts opening,

729
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,810
the condition can

730
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,810
progress pretty quickly.

731
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,340
Yes.

732
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,170
Yes. Absolutely.

733
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,170
Okay.

734
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,840
Can you check

735
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,840
if an OR's open?

736
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,840
Of course.

737
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,480
Thank you. All right.

738
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,490
Oh. Hey. Mark,

739
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,490
you're glowing.

740
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,180
Listen, I really should

741
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,180
talk to Sean first.

742
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,520
That's the protocol.

743
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,790
But I called

744
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,790
and got his voicemail.

745
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,690
Yeah. Well,

746
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,690
he's working today.

747
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,690
What's going on?

748
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,320
Just got all of his

749
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,320
test results back.

750
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,320
Uh-huh.

751
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,130
He's a donor match

752
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,130
for you, Dean.

753
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,530
Really?

754
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,230
Wow.

755
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,140
Well, that's, uh...

756
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,710
Fantastic?

757
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,710
Hey.

758
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,170
I already checked

759
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,170
with transplant.

760
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,640
They think we can

761
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,640
get you and Sean

762
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,180
in for surgery next month,

763
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,180
maybe even earlier.

764
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,580
So let the powers that be

765
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,580
know that you're gonna

766
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,580
need some time off.

767
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,150
Will do.

768
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,150
Congrats.

769
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,810
Happy for you, my friend.

770
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,440
Hey, thanks. Thanks.

771
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,330
Hey. Maggie,

772
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,330
you're early.

773
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,430
I thought we were

774
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,430
doing lunch at 1:00.

775
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,870
Yeah, about that.

776
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,870
Um, can we rain check?

777
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,370
Of course.

778
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,370
Is everything okay

779
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,370
in the ED?

780
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,170
Yeah, um,

781
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,840
that recruiter I've been

782
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,840
working with, she called.

783
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,510
I have a job interview.

784
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,220
Oh.

785
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,260
Wow. That was fast.

786
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,260
And this is

787
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,260
a job you'd want?

788
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,520
Well, I thought

789
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,520
I'd at least hear

790
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,520
what they have to say.

791
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,790
It's a new hospital

792
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,790
opening up in Hyde Park.

793
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,390
Yeah. Uh, Midwest Advocate.

794
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,660
Yeah, apparently

795
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,660
they're looking

796
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,660
for a charge nurse.

797
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,240
I see.

798
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,600
I wouldn't normally

799
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,600
schedule an interview

800
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,600
during work hours...

801
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,300
Maggie,

802
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,300
you don't have to...

803
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,710
And I don't want you

804
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,710
to think that...

805
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,610
I don't. I don't.

806
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,270
Yeah.

807
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,620
Good luck.

808
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,620
Yeah. Thanks.

809
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,970
Learn what you need

810
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,970
to learn about this

811
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,970
and please move on.

812
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,640
I haven't lost

813
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,640
any confidence in

814
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,640
your surgical skill.

815
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,770
I still want you

816
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,770
as my surgeon

817
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,770
tomorrow...

818
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,750
And as a key partner

819
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,750
in 2.0's future.

820
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,950
Don't blow up your

821
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,950
career over this.

822
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,360
We can still do a lot

823
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,360
of great work together.

824
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,680
What are you doing?

825
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,680
Yeah, that's my wife

826
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,680
on the table.

827
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,920
Yeah, I understand,

828
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,920
but you're a neurosurgeon.

829
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,720
I'm sorry to be blunt,

830
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,720
but you have

831
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,720
nothing to offer

832
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,380
when it comes to

833
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,380
performing a cerclage.

834
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,690
You expect me to sit

835
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,690
in the waiting room?

836
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,820
Fine.

837
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,900
You can stay,

838
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,900
but no backseat driving.

839
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,020
I mean it.

840
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,390
Understood.

841
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,990
Unlike your colleagues

842
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,990
in the ED, I can

843
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,990
follow directions.

844
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,740
Okay.

845
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,680
So I'm not

846
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,680
hearing voices?

847
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,810
I think what you're

848
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,810
actually hearing is

849
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,810
your own voice...

850
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,410
You know,

851
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,410
your own thoughts.

852
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,580
We all have this ongoing

853
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,580
inner dialogue, right?

854
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,320
It helps us navigate

855
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,320
and process the world

856
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,320
around us.

857
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,290
How do I make it stop?

858
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,420
Well, I think rather than

859
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,420
trying to silence it,

860
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,700
you can learn a whole lot

861
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,700
by actually engaging

862
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,700
with it, you know?

863
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,900
And that's something that

864
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,900
I wanted to explore today,

865
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,060
and, uh,

866
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,770
I actually asked

867
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,770
Dr. Cuevas if she would

868
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,770
help us with that.

869
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,040
You remember Dr. Cuevas.

870
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,070
Hi, David.

871
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,070
Hey.

872
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,370
Anyway,

873
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,370
I thought it might help

874
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,370
to kind of actually

875
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,320
talk through the scenarios

876
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,320
that are making you anxious.

877
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,950
You know, for instance,

878
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,950
senior prom, right?

879
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,720
When you think about prom,

880
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,720
what is the first

881
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,720
big snag you hit?

882
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,690
Probably the drive there.

883
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,630
Just me and Amber alone.

884
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,630
Dr. Cuevas, you had

885
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,630
a really good idea

886
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,500
about how we might

887
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,500
go about that.

888
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,090
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

889
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,890
We can practice

890
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,890
the car ride here.

891
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,540
You know, act out

892
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,540
what you might say

893
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,540
and what Amber

894
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,540
might say back.

895
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,380
Um, actually, David,

896
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,380
how about you sit here?

897
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,420
This can be

898
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,420
the driver's seat,

899
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,420
and I will be Amber.

900
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,980
What is it specifically

901
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,980
about the car ride,

902
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,560
about that conversation

903
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,560
that makes you nervous

904
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,890
about what might come up?

905
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,030
Not knowing

906
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,030
what to talk about.

907
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,700
What if she asked me

908
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,700
why I missed so much

909
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,700
school this year?

910
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,470
Do I have to

911
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,470
tell her that...

912
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,470
That I'm...

913
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,630
Do you have to tell her

914
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,630
that you were diagnosed

915
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,630
with schizophrenia?

916
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,810
Is that something

917
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,810
you think you might feel

918
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,810
like revealing to her?

919
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,640
Not really.

920
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,110
No. No, I don't.

921
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,110
Well, you know what?

922
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,820
That's just fine

923
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,820
because it's actually

924
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,080
your private information

925
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,080
and it's your choice.

926
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,950
I would just hope

927
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,950
that if it did come up

928
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,960
that it would

929
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,960
not be something

930
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,960
that you were,

931
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,720
you know, embarrassed

932
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,720
or ashamed about.

933
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,530
Sometimes I am.

934
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,490
Having a disease,

935
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,860
any disease,

936
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,060
lupus, cancer,

937
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,060
schizophrenia,

938
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,440
that's not something

939
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,440
that makes you

940
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,440
less than anyone else.

941
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,910
And, David, I'm also really

942
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,910
confident that over time

943
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,980
you are not gonna feel

944
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,980
like this is something

945
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,980
that defines you.

946
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,540
You get to decide

947
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,540
what defines you. Right?

948
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,590
I mean, just like you get to

949
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,590
decide who you wanna share

950
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,590
this information with.

951
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,050
I just...

952
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,130
I feel like it's gonna

953
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,130
come up, why I missed

954
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,130
so much school.

955
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,960
You know, if you wanna take

956
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,960
the attention off yourself,

957
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,470
you just ask

958
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,470
Amber questions.

959
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,540
What kind of questions?

960
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,470
Just about herself.

961
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,880
You know, speaking

962
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,880
from experience,

963
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,680
it's actually really nice

964
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,680
when someone shows interest

965
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,150
in learning more about you.

966
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,110
Do you think I could just

967
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,110
spend the whole ride

968
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,480
asking her questions?

969
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,450
I don't think

970
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,450
you're gonna

971
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,450
need to, buddy.

972
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,150
I mean, look,

973
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,150
I think all you have

974
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,150
to do, I don't know,

975
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,920
just lob in an icebreaker.

976
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,150
Uh, what kind of music

977
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,150
you been listening to?

978
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,560
And that'll start

979
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,560
a back and forth and

980
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,560
you're off to the races.

981
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,860
Do you think that'll work?

982
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,500
I do, but I don't know.

983
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,500
You want to try it out?

984
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,240
So...

985
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,740
Yeah. What kind of music

986
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,740
do you listen to?

987
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,190
You know, you would actually

988
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,190
be really surprised.

989
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,550
See if you can guess.

990
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,750
Um...

991
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,820
East Coast hip-hop?

992
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,130
No, but I will add

993
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,130
that to my list.

994
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,220
Keep guessing.

995
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,220
West Coast hip-hop?

996
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,730
Yes.

997
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,730
Mm.

998
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,530
Mm-hmm.

999
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,660
I knew it.

1000
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,660
Yeah.

1001
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,240
I'm not exactly sure

1002
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,240
how long I'll be down.

1003
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,880
Probably around

1004
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,880
eight weeks.

1005
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,850
Well, you take as much

1006
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,850
time as you need.

1007
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,010
I'm just so glad

1008
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,010
your son is a match.

1009
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,110
Right.

1010
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,210
Well, thank you.

1011
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,060
You were hoping

1012
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,060
he wouldn't be a match.

1013
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,000
Here I'm thinking

1014
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm doing such a good job

1015
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,000
acting excited.

1016
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,260
Even though I agreed

1017
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,260
to let Sean donate,

1018
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,630
a part of me, a big part

1019
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,630
of me was hoping

1020
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,010
it wouldn't work out.

1021
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,010
Hmm.

1022
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,680
You know,

1023
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,680
for what it's worth,

1024
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,150
you can't always trust

1025
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,150
cold feet.

1026
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,620
You know, that fear

1027
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,620
when the theoretical

1028
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,620
becomes reality...

1029
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,950
Because more often than not,

1030
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,650
it's just trying to

1031
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,650
sabotage a good thing.

1032
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,790
And this is

1033
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,790
a good thing, Dean.

1034
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,080
Slight change of plans.

1035
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,270
Put her in a steep

1036
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,270
Trendelenburg position.

1037
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,780
Wait, what's wrong?

1038
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,050
The amniotic sac membranes

1039
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,050
are protruding out through

1040
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,050
the cervix.

1041
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,020
That wasn't the case

1042
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,020
when you examined

1043
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,020
Michelle earlier.

1044
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,850
You said her cervix

1045
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,850
was shortened,

1046
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,850
but only slightly dilated.

1047
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,980
Yes, at that point it was,

1048
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,120
but as I warned Michelle

1049
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,120
could happen, her condition

1050
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,120
has progressed.

1051
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,990
I'm going to insert

1052
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,990
a balloon that

1053
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,860
will push the membranes

1054
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,860
back into the cervix

1055
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,860
and then tie it off.

1056
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,700
Wait, that's a different

1057
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,700
procedure with a much

1058
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,700
greater risk to Michelle.

1059
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,290
If you break her water,

1060
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,290
she could become septic.

1061
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm not going to

1062
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,000
let that happen.

1063
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,000
I've done this a dozen times.

1064
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,170
I don't care.

1065
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,270
As her husband,

1066
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,270
I'm her medical

1067
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,270
surrogate, right?

1068
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,970
Do not even try me

1069
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,970
right now, Sam.

1070
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,740
This is not a surgical

1071
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,740
decision point

1072
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,210
that I would ever consult

1073
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,210
the family about.

1074
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,080
I am well aware of

1075
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,080
Michelle's wishes and...

1076
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,850
I'm instructing you to stop.

1077
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,110
And I am telling you

1078
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,110
to leave now.

1079
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,220
If anything happens to her...

1080
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,190
The longer Michelle stays

1081
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,190
anaesthetized on this table,

1082
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,660
the greatest risk to her.

1083
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,890
So stop distracting me

1084
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,890
and let me finish.

1085
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,810
Okay.

1086
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,740
I need a 30 CC foley

1087
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,740
and a ring forcep.

1088
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,920
Oh, man.

1089
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,290
I messed up.

1090
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,060
I injured the hepatic vein

1091
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,060
going after a nearby lesion.

1092
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,030
That's what caused the clot.

1093
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,160
Are you sure that's

1094
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,160
what the data shows?

1095
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,270
See for yourself.

1096
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,270
Clear as day.

1097
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,900
It's my fault, Will.

1098
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,970
That's why Jack erased it.

1099
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,970
He was trying to protect me.

1100
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,880
Jack looking out for

1101
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,880
someone else?

1102
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,310
Nah, I don't buy that.

1103
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,820
Well, maybe he was

1104
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,820
protecting his investment.

1105
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,010
Like you said,

1106
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,010
I'm the face of

1107
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,010
the machine, right?

1108
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,190
It doesn't look good

1109
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,190
when your star surgeon

1110
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,950
makes a fatal error.

1111
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,950
Crockett.

1112
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,220
You know anytime

1113
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,220
you ablate a lesion

1114
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,270
there's a risk of injury

1115
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,270
to proximal veins.

1116
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,270
You can't avoid that.

1117
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,860
Mm-hmm.

1118
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,740
Michelle is just fine.

1119
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,290
We got the membranes

1120
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,290
pushed back

1121
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,290
into the uterus

1122
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,850
without breaking the water.

1123
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,350
They'll take her

1124
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,350
to post-op

1125
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,350
in a few minutes

1126
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,820
and you should be able

1127
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,820
to see her soon after.

1128
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,160
And the fetus?

1129
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,090
Will Michelle be able

1130
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,090
to carry to term?

1131
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,760
I can't make any promises.

1132
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,890
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

1133
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,800
The odds are in her favor,

1134
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,800
and I'm cautiously optimistic.

1135
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,900
Good.

1136
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,930
Good, good. Good, good.

1137
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,100
Thank you.

1138
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,270
Um...

1139
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,250
For the record,

1140
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,250
I do want this baby.

1141
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,450
I'll admit that the news

1142
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,450
surpri... Shocked me.

1143
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,860
I'm an empty nester

1144
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,860
Um...

1145
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,320
My daughter, Lucy,

1146
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,320
just started

1147
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,320
graduate school,

1148
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,400
and I didn't expect

1149
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,400
to see diapers again

1150
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,370
until I became a grandfather.

1151
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,990
I'll bet.

1152
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,030
But I love being a father,

1153
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,970
and I'm actually

1154
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,970
quite good at it.

1155
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,100
What I'm not so

1156
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,100
good at historically

1157
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,380
is being a good father

1158
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,380
and a good partner

1159
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,380
at the same time.

1160
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,290
Trying to parent with

1161
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,290
my first wife destroyed

1162
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,290
our marriage.

1163
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,980
You'll be surprised

1164
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,980
to hear this,

1165
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,980
but I can be stubborn.

1166
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,260
I've built a great life

1167
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,260
with Michelle.

1168
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,160
I just don't wanna ruin it

1169
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,160
by making the same mistakes.

1170
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,870
Come here.

1171
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,340
So this is just a hunch,

1172
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,250
but I'm guessing you lacked

1173
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,250
this level of self-awareness

1174
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,050
in your first marriage.

1175
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,560
My ex-wife would certainly

1176
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,560
agree with that assessment.

1177
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,850
Look, you're not

1178
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,850
the same person

1179
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,850
anymore, Sam.

1180
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,020
And the fact that

1181
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,020
you can honestly admit

1182
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,020
your shortcomings

1183
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,290
is a pretty good sign

1184
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,290
that you won't repeat them.

1185
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,400
Been cruising the Hallmark

1186
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,400
aisle in your free time?

1187
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,200
Hmm...

1188
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,860
Um, but your little

1189
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,860
homily assumes

1190
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,340
that human beings

1191
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,340
are capable

1192
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,340
of two things,

1193
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,310
learning from their

1194
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,310
failures and change.

1195
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,310
I think we are.

1196
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,620
Having trouble

1197
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,620
finding data from

1198
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,620
Richard Evans' surgery?

1199
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:42,920
How did you...

1200
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,400
Let me save you time.

1201
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,400
It's all there.

1202
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,060
Where'd you get this?

1203
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,570
Jack erased it

1204
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,570
from the system.

1205
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,140
What?

1206
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,640
Crockett made a mistake

1207
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,640
during surgery

1208
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,930
and Jack didn't want

1209
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,930
a spokesmodel tarnished

1210
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,600
before the IPO launch.

1211
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,600
He wouldn't...

1212
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,210
It's true.

1213
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,110
I'm telling you,

1214
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,110
Jack cannot be trusted.

1215
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,490
Dr. Archer?

1216
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,260
Yeah?

1217
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,930
I'm Harrison Jenkins,

1218
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,930
the supervisor

1219
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,930
down at valet.

1220
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,300
Your boy Sean

1221
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,300
works with us.

1222
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,060
Yeah, is everything okay?

1223
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,640
Well, first let me say,

1224
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,030
Sean's been doing

1225
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,030
a stand-up job.

1226
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,610
He's got

1227
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,610
a positive attitude.

1228
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,580
He's always on time.

1229
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,580
Sure.

1230
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,480
Everybody loves him.

1231
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,480
Yeah, yeah. No. Thank you.

1232
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,240
Thanks. So what's...

1233
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,110
He didn't show up

1234
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,110
for work today.

1235
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,580
No call, nothing.

1236
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,020
Tried him,

1237
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,020
he didn't pick up.

1238
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,450
I was wondering if you

1239
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,450
heard anything from him.

1240
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,020
I just wanna

1241
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,020
make sure he's okay.

1242
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,530
I haven't heard anything.

1243
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,490
I didn't mean to rat

1244
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,490
on him or anything...

1245
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,160
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1246
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,160
You did the right thing.

1247
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,240
I'm sure there's

1248
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,240
an explanation,

1249
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,240
so thanks for letting me know.

1250
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,500
Yeah. I'm sure.

1251
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,500
Okay.

1252
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,640
Oh, there you are.

1253
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,010
Oh, hey.

1254
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,550
I wanted to see how

1255
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,550
your interview went.

1256
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,590
Oh, it was fine.

1257
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,280
Just fine?

1258
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,950
Look, Maggie.

1259
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,430
I was caught off

1260
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,430
guard earlier.

1261
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,590
I knew this day was

1262
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,590
coming, but I just...

1263
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,560
I just wasn't ready for it.

1264
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,070
And to be honest,

1265
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,070
neither was I.

1266
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:36,170
And then I was really angry

1267
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:36,170
with Jack because

1268
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,440
he's driving away

1269
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,440
one of our most

1270
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,440
valuable people.

1271
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,710
But I am so happy for you.

1272
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,050
You know, you're always

1273
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,590
looking out for

1274
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,590
everybody else,

1275
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,590
and you're finally

1276
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,990
looking out for yourself,

1277
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,990
and that is a

1278
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,990
really good thing.

1279
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,230
Now you better tell me

1280
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,230
how that interview went.

1281
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,390
It was great.

1282
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,100
Yeah?

1283
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,100
Really great.

1284
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,610
They want me to

1285
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,610
build the ED

1286
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,610
from the ground up.

1287
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,580
Well, they'll be

1288
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,580
lucky to have you.

1289
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,710
I don't have the job yet.

1290
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,710
You will.

1291
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,080
They won't find

1292
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,080
anybody better.

1293
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,080
You best believe that.

1294
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,060
Girl, they gonna give me

1295
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,060
the keys to that ED.

1296
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,330
Gonna cut you loose

1297
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,330
in the ED.

1298
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,540
How you feeling, honey?

1299
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,310
Not too bad.

1300
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,680
I have a little cramping,

1301
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,680
but Dr. Asher says

1302
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,680
that's normal.

1303
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,090
Very normal.

1304
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,250
Um, this is for you.

1305
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,630
Sam, you don't

1306
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,630
even like baseball.

1307
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,540
It was the only father-son

1308
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,540
onesie in the gift shop.

1309
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,210
What if it's a girl?

1310
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,480
No, it's not.

1311
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,720
Oh, damn it. I'm so sorry,

1312
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,720
honey, Michelle.

1313
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,810
Wait, what?

1314
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,420
I had seen on the ultrasound

1315
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,420
that it was a boy

1316
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,720
and I was waiting to see

1317
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,720
if you both wanted to know.

1318
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,630
I forced it out of her,

1319
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,760
and then promised

1320
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,760
not to say anything.

1321
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,390
We're having a boy?

1322
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,590
We are. Yeah.

1323
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,170
We're having a boy!

1324
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,280
Hey.

1325
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,120
You know all those apps

1326
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,120
you're about to delete?

1327
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,620
Yes.

1328
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,200
Which one is

1329
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,200
the least terrible?

1330
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,460
Does this mean

1331
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,460
you're officially putting

1332
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,460
yourself out there?

1333
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,620
I'm just...

1334
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,700
I'm dipping toes

1335
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,700
in the water.

1336
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,330
Historically, romantic

1337
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,330
relationships haven't

1338
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,330
really gone well for me.

1339
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,370
I've never been

1340
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,370
a great partner.

1341
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,570
Oh, Hannah, I'm sure

1342
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,570
that's not true at all.

1343
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,150
No. No, it's very true.

1344
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,450
I've always been

1345
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,450
unreliable and erratic.

1346
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,250
You were dealing

1347
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,250
with an addiction.

1348
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,160
Yeah.

1349
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,560
This is the longest

1350
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,560
I've ever been sober

1351
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,560
in my entire adult life.

1352
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,230
I wanna believe that

1353
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,230
I'm not that same

1354
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,230
person anymore,

1355
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,870
you know, that I can

1356
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,870
be a great partner

1357
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,870
for someone else.

1358
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,240
Well, you're certainly

1359
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,240
a good friend.

1360
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,330
I can confirm that.

1361
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,930
Thank you.

1362
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,580
Okay.

1363
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,640
So all of the dating

1364
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,640
apps are terrible.

1365
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,640
Ah!

1366
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,720
Let me see your phone

1367
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,720
and I'll show you

1368
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,720
which ones I'm on.

1369
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,550
I left it at

1370
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,550
the nurse's station,

1371
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,550
but I will be back.

1372
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,820
Okay.

1373
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,300
Hey. Did you talk

1374
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,300
to Sean today?

1375
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,460
No, why?

1376
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,660
He's not

1377
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,660
answering his phone,

1378
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,660
didn't show up for work.

1379
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,240
Yeah. Let me know

1380
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,240
if you hear

1381
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,240
from him, okay?

1382
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,530
Of course.

1383
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,530
Hey, try not to

1384
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,530
think the worst.

1385
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,640
Right.

1386
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,480
Will, wait.

1387
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,440
I need to show you something.

1388
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,440
Can you come with me?

1389
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,890
Sure.

1390
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,560
This is Richard Evans'

1391
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,560
pre-op CT.

1392
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,690
This is his

1393
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,690
intraoperative CT.

1394
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,660
The large lesion near the

1395
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,660
hepatic vein that Crockett

1396
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,660
attempted to ablate?

1397
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,760
Yeah?

1398
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,300
It's not on

1399
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,300
Richard's pre-op CT.

1400
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,390
What?

1401
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,770
A lesion doesn't just develop

1402
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,770
over a matter of hours.

1403
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,470
No, it doesn't.

1404
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,540
So that means 2.0 created

1405
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,540
the lesion on its own?

1406
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,510
I believe so.

1407
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,480
Crockett would never

1408
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,480
have gone near

1409
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,480
the hepatic vein...

1410
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:17,560
If 2.0 hadn't directed him

1411
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:17,560
to ablate a phantom lesion.

1412
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,020
Jack thought he was

1413
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,020
protecting Crockett

1414
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,020
by erasing the data,

1415
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,300
but Crockett wasn't

1416
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,300
responsible for

1417
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,300
Richard Evans' death.

1418
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,560
2.0 was.

1419
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,930
Sausage pizza,

1420
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,930
extra cheese,

1421
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,600
and whatever, you know,

1422
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,600
the wine shop

1423
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,600
said this was.

1424
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,040
Thank you, Daniel.

1425
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,040
Thank you so much.

1426
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,440
Why you whispering?

1427
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,410
Pawel just fell asleep.

1428
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,020
Oh. Everything...

1429
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,020
Everything okay?

1430
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,290
What's going on?

1431
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,290
I had to pull out of escrow.

1432
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,730
What?

1433
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,530
Why? Did the house

1434
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,530
not appraise?

1435
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,930
Pawel is having

1436
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,930
financial difficulties.

1437
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,060
All right, honey.

1438
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,060
What's going on?

1439
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,060
Talk to me. Tell me.

1440
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,070
He has a very large

1441
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,070
gambling debt.

1442
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,540
And so you're gonna...

1443
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,880
You're gonna pay it

1444
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,880
off for him?

1445
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,010
Well, of course.

1446
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,010
I have to.

1447
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,020
I mean, sweetie,

1448
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,020
is that really

1449
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,020
your responsibility?

1450
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,490
Well, he's my brother,

1451
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,490
and we are responsible

1452
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,490
for each other.

1453
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,460
Right. Okay. Okay.

1454
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,360
Well, I don't know.

1455
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,360
Can I...

1456
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,660
Can I at least help you

1457
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,660
unpack some stuff

1458
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,660
or something?

1459
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,090
There's no reason to.

1460
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,890
I still have to move out

1461
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,890
before the end of the month.

1462
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,490
Why?

1463
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,440
I talked to the landlord,

1464
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,440
and he won't budge.

1465
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,060
I still have to honor

1466
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,060
the notice I gave him.

1467
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,770
Wait, wait.

1468
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,770
That's ridiculous.

1469
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,540
Do you have his number?

1470
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,540
Let me give him a call.

1471
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,340
No, I don't want

1472
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,340
you to call him.

1473
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,680
It's my responsibility.

1474
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,440
Okay, but, where are

1475
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,440
you gonna live?

1476
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,540
I don't know yet.

1477
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,920
I haven't thought

1478
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,920
that far ahead.

1479
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,120
Why don't you come

1480
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,120
live with me?

1481
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,520
What?

1482
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,820
You can come live with me.

1483
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,490
I mean,

1484
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,490
I got plenty of room,

1485
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,490
that's for sure.

1486
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,460
No. No, no,

1487
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,460
no, no. I can't.

1488
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,860
But, honey, why not?

1489
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,730
I mean,

1490
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,730
at least until you,

1491
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,500
I don't know, find

1492
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,500
another place to stay.

1493
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,630
I can take care

1494
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,630
of myself, Daniel.

1495
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,970
I don't need your help.

1496
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,480
I just don't have it

1497
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,480
figured out right in

1498
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,480
this moment.

1499
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,570
I know you can take care

1500
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,570
of yourself, okay?

1501
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,710
I'm actually asking

1502
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,710
you to do this

1503
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,710
because I want to.

1504
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,810
Really?

1505
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,790
Then why didn't

1506
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,790
you ask me before?

1507
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,750
Why are you only

1508
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,750
asking me now?

1509
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,850
Gee, I don't know.

1510
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,760
Maybe because you

1511
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,760
bought a freakin' house

1512
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,760
before I could?

1513
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,590
Oh, so maybe my house

1514
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,590
falling through

1515
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,100
is not such a terrible

1516
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,100
thing for you

1517
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,720
because you can

1518
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,720
come in here

1519
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,100
and rescue me like I am

1520
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,100
some charity case?

1521
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,830
Are you serious?

1522
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,830
What are you talking about?

1523
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,670
I've never thought

1524
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,670
of you that way.

1525
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,830
You know what?

1526
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,830
This is not a good

1527
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,830
night for company.

1528
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,110
I think you might be

1529
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,110
right about that.

1530
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,580
"Charity case."
