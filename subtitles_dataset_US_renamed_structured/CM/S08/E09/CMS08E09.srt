1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,660
I've decided to not

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,660
tell Ben about the accident.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,210
There's no benefit

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,210
to him knowing.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,170
I don't wanna

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,170
make it any worse.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,700
Mazel tov.

8
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,540
Congrats on your

9
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,540
big news, buddy.

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,070
I'm so happy for you guys.

11
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,170
I'm pretty excited.

12
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,280
Asking Dayton for

13
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,280
$10 million right after

14
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,280
I helped rescue him

15
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,720
kind of feels like

16
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,720
a quid pro quo.

17
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,350
I think you're setting

18
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,350
your sights too low.

19
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,150
I'm gonna do something

20
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,150
even better for Chicago Med.

21
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,560
The people who

22
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,560
need us the most never even

23
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,560
make it through our doors.

24
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,760
When did we decide

25
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,760
that's the way it is?

26
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,730
It can't be.

27
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,730
I'm not gonna let it.

28
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,260
Ms. Goodwin.

29
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,570
Dr. Choi, I'm on my way

30
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,570
to the cleaners to pick up

31
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,570
my dress for your wedding.

32
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,370
Can I walk you

33
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,370
to your car?

34
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,640
Sure. What's on

35
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,640
your mind?

36
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,740
Well, April and I have

37
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,740
always talked about

38
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,740
bringing health care

39
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,450
to underserved communities.

40
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,450
Mmm-hmm.

41
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,150
And as you know,

42
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,150
so many folks use our ED

43
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,150
for their primary care,

44
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,520
and we'd like to get

45
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,520
to them before they

46
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,520
need to do that.

47
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,090
And one way, we thought,

48
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,090
would be to have

49
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,090
a mobile clinic.

50
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,060
That's a great idea.

51
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,430
Yeah. I got a small

52
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,430
inheritance from my dad,

53
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,120
and April saved up

54
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,120
some money.

55
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,330
So we bought a mobile

56
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,330
eye clinic we're refitting

57
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,330
for general care.

58
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,600
Oh?

59
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,070
And this is something

60
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,070
you could do part-time?

61
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,340
Full-time.

62
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,500
Ms. Goodwin,

63
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,500
after our honeymoon,

64
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,310
we'd like to start going out,

65
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,310
treating people.

66
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,420
Dr. Choi, are you

67
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,420
giving me notice?

68
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,580
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,690
Believe me, this wasn't

70
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,690
an easy decision.

71
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,390
Is your plan to put

72
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,390
my ED out of business?

73
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,490
I'm certainly gonna try.

74
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,170
Good for you.

75
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,210
That was beautiful.

76
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,520
Really. So, so beautiful.

77
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,280
Thank you.

78
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,280
Thank you very much.

79
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,650
Can I ask you a question?

80
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,520
Have we...

81
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,520
Have we met?

82
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,760
You seem so familiar to me.

83
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,760
Yes. From the hospital.

84
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,390
I'm Liliana.

85
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,730
I clean your office.

86
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,860
Liliana.

87
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,400
Of course!

88
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,400
Oh, my God,

89
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm so sorry.

90
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,700
No. Please, I understand.

91
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,610
You only see me in my uniform,

92
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,610
and most of the time,

93
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,340
you're not there

94
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,340
when I clean.

95
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,470
Still, I'm very embarrassed.

96
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,470
No, please!

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,240
Anyway, you, Liliana,

98
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,240
are a wonderful singer.

99
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,820
Thank you.

100
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,820
Absolutely wonderful.

101
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,220
Thank you so much.

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,220
Okay. So thank you.

103
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,880
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.

104
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,390
At the hospital. Okay.

105
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,660
Good night.

106
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,480
We are deeply grateful

107
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,480
to Jack Dayton,

108
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,450
who has made

109
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,450
a most generous

110
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,450
gift to our hospital,

111
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:25,550
this advanced surgical suite,

112
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:25,550
which he calls O.R. 2.0.

113
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,960
Mr. Dayton?

114
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,660
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

115
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,540
O.R. 2.0 is the fruit

116
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,540
of years of development

117
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,830
by Dayton Corporation

118
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,830
and partners.

119
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,470
I've entrusted it

120
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,470
to this hospital

121
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,340
because, well, Chicago Med

122
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,340
has always been

123
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,410
on the cutting edge

124
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,410
of medical care,

125
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,610
and it has the surgeons

126
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,610
with the talent and skill

127
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,350
to put O.R. 2.0 to good use,

128
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,450
doctors like

129
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,450
Crockett Marcel here.

130
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,580
That's very kind, Mr. Dayton.

131
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,580
Thank you.

132
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,780
With the help of Dr. Dupre,

133
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,920
who headed

134
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,920
the beta-testing team,

135
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,290
I'm still learning all

136
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,290
the bells and whistles

137
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,290
here, so bear with me.

138
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,770
But, I can tell you

139
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,770
a few things.

140
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,310
The O.R. 2.0 platform

141
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,310
integrates robotics,

142
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,410
immersive computing,

143
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,410
advanced sensory detection,

144
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,570
artificial intelligence,

145
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,570
all to make

146
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,520
the most challenging

147
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,520
and complex surgeries viable.

148
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,290
And the radiolucent

149
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,290
table allows

150
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,720
for accurate imaging

151
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,720
in any modality,

152
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,850
including X-ray and CT.

153
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,490
The numerous sensors

154
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,490
analyze every data point,

155
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,030
assisting the surgeon

156
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,030
in approach and technique,

157
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,890
even on the level

158
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,890
of suggesting

159
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,890
what instrument to use.

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,730
And the surgeon wears

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,730
these gloves while operating.

162
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,400
The sensors assess

163
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,400
the surgeon's efficacy,

164
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,570
hand accuracy,

165
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,570
and risk of complications.

166
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,570
For instance.

167
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,780
Please.

168
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,780
Okay.

169
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,550
There's a 10% chance

170
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,550
you'll have a major laceration

171
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,950
of the left anterior

172
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,950
descending artery.

173
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,750
Consider another approach.

174
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,320
2.0, to help Dr. Marcel,

175
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,320
can you show him a 3-D image

176
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,320
of the patient's heart?

177
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,330
Loading.

178
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,870
Oh, wow.

179
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,910
How much you think

180
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,910
that setup cost?

181
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,450
Gotta be north of 50 mil.

182
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,040
Surgery on a whole

183
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,040
other level.

184
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,390
Pretty soon, they won't be

185
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,390
needing us.

186
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,390
Yeah, right.

187
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,080
What, not impressed,

188
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,080
Dean?

189
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,090
Did you ever see

190
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,090
A Space Odyssey?

191
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,460
"I'm sorry, Dave.

192
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,460
Can't allow you

193
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,460
to do that." Right?

194
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,430
So what

195
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,430
are you, you...

196
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,830
You're really

197
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,830
doing this whole

198
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,830
mobile clinic thing?

199
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,960
Yeah. I told Ms. Goodwin

200
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,960
last night.

201
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,910
Hey, everybody, remember,

202
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,910
this afternoon in the

203
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,910
doctors' lounge,

204
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,380
cupcake party for Ethan

205
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,380
and his bride-to-be.

206
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,450
Mags, you don't have to...

207
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,450
None of that.

208
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,020
It's the least

209
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,020
we could do.

210
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,590
Dr. Halstead,

211
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,590
you and I are up.

212
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,850
All right.

213
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,580
Forty-five-year-old male,

214
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,580
Richard Evans.

215
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,720
Head laceration with

216
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,720
retained glass.

217
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,160
You're going to

218
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,160
treatment three.

219
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,730
Really, I'm fine.

220
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,160
You're bleeding

221
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,160
like crazy, babe.

222
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,520
Vitals are normal.

223
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,000
GCS 15, no LOC.

224
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,540
We're gonna take good care

225
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,540
of you, all right?

226
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,540
Thank you.

227
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,040
Okay, on my count.

228
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,910
One, two, three.

229
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,480
I was making

230
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,480
a vacuum chamber

231
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,480
out of an old bell jar.

232
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,750
I wanted to show the kids

233
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,750
how you can boil water

234
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,750
at room temperature.

235
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,980
Thank God I tried it

236
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,980
at home first, huh?

237
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,520
Richard teaches fifth grade.

238
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,420
I hooked up the jar

239
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,420
to my compressor,

240
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,460
and obviously,

241
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,460
it was not rated for,

242
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,190
what, 6,000 pounds of force.

243
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,630
Boom! Ow!

244
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,200
The jar imploded.

245
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,990
So stupid on my part.

246
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,700
Hold this for me, would you?

247
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,700
Yeah.

248
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,040
Well, it doesn't look

249
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,040
too serious.

250
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,970
A few stitches ought

251
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,970
to fix you right up.

252
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,710
We'll get a head CT just

253
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,710
to make sure.

254
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,710
Thank you.

255
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,580
Prep and drape, and get me

256
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,580
a lac tray, please.

257
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,740
Right,

258
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,450
Mr. Evans has an extensive

259
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,450
chart at Med.

260
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,580
Okay, thanks.

261
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,580
Yes, he does.

262
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,560
Richard, you've,

263
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,560
been diagnosed

264
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,560
with pancreatic cancer.

265
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,620
Yeah.

266
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,490
My surgeons

267
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,490
and the tumor board

268
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,490
ruled it inoperable.

269
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,230
And the tumor is inside

270
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,230
the pancreas

271
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,130
and has invaded the duodenum

272
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,130
and surrounding tissues.

273
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,930
There's no way to get it all.

274
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,040
They're just gonna

275
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,040
let him die.

276
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,970
Honey.

277
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,780
He's just such

278
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,780
a wonderful person.

279
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,180
His students love him.

280
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,580
I love him.

281
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,510
It's just not right.

282
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm so sorry.

283
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,910
Thank you.

284
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,590
Page me when Mr. Evans

285
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,590
is prepped.

286
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,590
Will do.

287
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,500
Good morning.

288
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,490
I'm Dr. Archer.

289
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,100
Mr. Michaels, 65.

290
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,870
Took a spill coming

291
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,870
down the stairs.

292
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,100
He really

293
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,100
hurt himself.

294
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,680
He tore his pants,

295
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,680
and his hands

296
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,680
are all scraped up.

297
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,180
Mr. Michaels is complaining

298
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,180
of pain in his ankle

299
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,180
and right wrist.

300
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,870
Who's gonna

301
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,870
rake the leaves?

302
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,140
I will, Dad.

303
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,280
This is the second time

304
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,280
he's fallen in a week.

305
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,880
I gave him Toradol,

306
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,880
15 milligram.

307
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,620
IV for his pain.

308
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,620
There are his X-rays.

309
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,220
Doesn't look like

310
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,220
he fractured anything.

311
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,520
I agree.

312
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,520
What did you recommend?

313
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,000
Rest, ice, compression,

314
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,000
and elevation.

315
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,620
Very good.

316
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,830
Who's gonna rake the leaves?

317
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,830
I told you, Dad. I will.

318
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,130
Dr. Archer,

319
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,130
can I speak with you?

320
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,800
Yes, of course.

321
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,140
This is just like my mom.

322
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,980
What do you mean?

323
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,610
She died of Alzheimer's.

324
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,220
Thank you.

325
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,220
Dang.

326
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,090
Whole new O.R. suite?

327
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,660
That's quite a gift.

328
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,660
Yeah.

329
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,000
No strings?

330
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, not that

331
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,000
I can see so far.

332
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,860
I mean,

333
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,860
that is really some...

334
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,900
Daniel?

335
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,310
You remember that piano

336
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,310
bar I was telling you about,

337
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,310
with the amateur night?

338
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,770
I actually finally...

339
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,210
I went last night.

340
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,210
Really?

341
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,810
This one lady, she got up and

342
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,810
she sang this song in Polish.

343
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,710
It was so beautiful.

344
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,880
No kidding.

345
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,880
Yeah.

346
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,350
And you know what

347
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,350
the crazy thing is?

348
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,210
She works here, at Med.

349
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,590
Get out.

350
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,590
Yeah.

351
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,130
What, nurse? Doctor?

352
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,130
Um...

353
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,200
You know, it was a...

354
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,200
It was a short conversation.

355
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,200
We didn't...

356
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,090
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

357
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,760
I got to...

358
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,990
I got to get to the ED.

359
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,630
I'll catch you later.

360
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,960
Your coffee.

361
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,740
We lost my mom,

362
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,740
his wife, to Alzheimer's

363
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,740
a year ago.

364
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,740
And now Dad,

365
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,740
with how he repeats

366
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,740
things, and his balance.

367
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,210
It's just the way

368
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,210
it happened

369
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,210
with her.

370
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,750
I'm gonna

371
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,750
lose him, too.

372
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,980
Has he been evaluated?

373
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,090
No, I guess I haven't

374
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,090
wanted to know.

375
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,950
I completely

376
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,950
understand that.

377
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,690
How long were your mom

378
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,690
and dad married for?

379
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,660
Oh, gosh.

380
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,990
Right out of high school.

381
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,120
Almost 50 years.

382
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,330
Well, then, that's gonna be

383
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,330
a huge loss for him, right?

384
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,660
Yeah. It was terrible.

385
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,670
You know, I've never

386
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,670
seen him like that.

387
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,200
You know,

388
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,200
it's entirely possible

389
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,200
that he's still grieving.

390
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,300
You know,

391
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,300
he could be suffering

392
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,300
from depression,

393
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,900
not necessarily Alzheimer's,

394
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,170
and there are other

395
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,170
possibilities too.

396
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,720
I mean, I'm happy

397
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,720
to have a chat with him

398
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,340
and see if I can get

399
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,340
a better sense

400
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,340
what's going on.

401
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,880
Yes, please.

402
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,130
Go, go, go, go,

403
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,130
go, go, go, go.

404
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,320
Good.

405
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,090
Very nice.

406
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,960
This rate, we might be able

407
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,960
to send you home in a week.

408
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,730
Hey, how about that?

409
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,730
Yeah.

410
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,000
You getting out of bed?

411
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,440
Moving a couple

412
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,440
of times a day?

413
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,440
Uh-huh.

414
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,830
Good. Yeah.

415
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,740
Okay. Hey, keep working.

416
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,000
Excuse me, Jack.

417
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,750
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

418
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,920
Inoperable.

419
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,920
Was inoperable.

420
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,460
But not with that new O.R.

421
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,320
Oh, come on. No.

422
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,720
The image guidance?

423
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,720
Real-time histology?

424
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,850
You could resect

425
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,850
the whole tumor.

426
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,850
No way.

427
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,300
I'm still getting used

428
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,300
to the technology.

429
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,260
You expect me to dive in

430
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,260
on a surgery like this?

431
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,890
I think it's

432
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,890
a great idea.

433
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,000
It's the perfect way to

434
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,000
demonstrate what

435
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,000
O.R. 2.0 can do.

436
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,200
Not if the man dies

437
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,200
on the table.

438
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,370
Guys, I need some time

439
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,370
to familiarize myself

440
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,370
with the platform.

441
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,380
There isn't any.

442
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,380
He's already got

443
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,380
lymph involvement.

444
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,740
We wait any longer,

445
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,740
he dies anyways.

446
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,010
You can do this.

447
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,810
Besides the guidance

448
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,810
you get from the Al,

449
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,820
Dr. Dupre will be

450
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,820
there to assist you.

451
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,750
She knows the system

452
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,750
inside and out.

453
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,820
Crockett, this man

454
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,820
has zero options.

455
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,760
Let's give him this one.

456
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,160
Spontaneous hemorrhage,

457
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,160
lower left leg.

458
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,430
Applied tourniquet

459
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,430
in the field to control

460
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,430
the bleed.

461
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,070
BP 90/32 after

462
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,070
500 milliliters fluids.

463
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,840
Heart rate 120.

464
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,000
Maggie.

465
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,350
All right, on my count.

466
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,180
Ready, one, two, three.

467
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,350
All right, let's get two units

468
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,350
whole blood in him.

469
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,490
On it.

470
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,490
He was in an accident

471
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,490
a week ago.

472
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,160
He had a tibial

473
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,160
pseudoaneurysm,

474
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,160
but it stopped bleeding.

475
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,030
Loosen the tourniquet.

476
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,030
Okay.

477
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,360
It ruptured.

478
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,340
All right, call the O.R.

479
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,810
Let them know

480
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,810
we're coming up.

481
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,810
Yeah.

482
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,970
All right.

483
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,210
Now, I have to emphasize,

484
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,210
this is an experimental,

485
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,210
high-risk surgery.

486
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,260
This is the first time

487
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,260
the platform is being

488
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,260
used on a patient.

489
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,520
If this

490
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,520
doesn't go well,

491
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,520
which is likely,

492
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,850
Richard will be robbed

493
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,850
of whatever time

494
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,850
he has left.

495
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,830
That's true, Richard.

496
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,420
You'd be taking a big risk.

497
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,900
And if I don't?

498
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,500
What do I have

499
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,500
to look forward to?

500
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,880
I get weaker and weaker,

501
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,880
more pain,

502
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,180
debilitation, until

503
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,180
I'm confined to a bed

504
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,180
with a morphine drip?

505
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,340
No.

506
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,220
I don't want that.

507
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,320
I don't want to put Vicky

508
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,320
through that.

509
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,980
It is not

510
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,980
about me, Richard.

511
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:32,160
Dr. Marcel, all my life,

512
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:32,160
I have been a science geek.

513
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,970
And here you are, offering me

514
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,970
the chance to be a part of

515
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,970
something groundbreaking,

516
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,130
that science has

517
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,130
made possible.

518
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,310
It's like being given

519
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,310
the chance to be the

520
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,310
first person on the moon.

521
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,240
And even if the worst

522
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,240
happens to me...

523
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,010
Hopefully you'll learn

524
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,010
something from it.

525
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,290
That's how science works,

526
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,290
isn't it?

527
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,240
Well, then, we just need

528
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,240
your signature on

529
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,240
this consent form.

530
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,890
You're a courageous

531
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,890
man, Richard.

532
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,890
No.

533
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,150
I'm gonna be asleep.

534
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,660
You're the courageous one.

535
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,330
Yeah.

536
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,330
That a picture of your wife?

537
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,140
Sarah.

538
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,640
We were in Maine.

539
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,380
Beautiful woman.

540
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,350
Jessica was telling me that

541
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,350
she passed about a year ago?

542
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,010
Yes. She's gone.

543
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,920
Sorry about that.

544
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,520
We went to school together.

545
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,630
Knew each other

546
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,630
a long time, huh?

547
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,630
Yeah. Yeah.

548
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,960
There was this tree

549
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,960
on her front lawn

550
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,510
that we used to go

551
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,510
and sit under and do

552
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,510
all our homework.

553
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,270
She was a lot better

554
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,270
at math than I was.

555
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,140
You know, I have

556
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,140
a daughter too.

557
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,140
I think about Jessica's age.

558
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,650
What year was she born?

559
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,010
Um...

560
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,570
1985?

561
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,150
Okay.

562
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,280
And then, how old

563
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,280
would that make her?

564
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,590
Uh...

565
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,190
Let me think, now.

566
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,030
'85 to...

567
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,690
You know what,

568
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,690
it's not important.

569
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,530
Look, I can't remember

570
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,530
what I had for breakfast.

571
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,700
You know, and my daughter,

572
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,700
she's actually always

573
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,030
giving me these, like,

574
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,030
memory quizzes, you know?

575
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,700
The other day she was,

576
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,610
"Hey, Dad, can you say

577
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,610
these random words

578
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,610
back to me in order?"

579
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,550
You know, like, cow,

580
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,550
window, umbrella.

581
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,710
Can you do that?

582
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,150
Say them back?

583
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,150
Yeah, in order.

584
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,190
Cow, window, umbrella.

585
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,520
Cow.

586
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,120
Um...

587
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,030
Umbrella.

588
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,460
Not easy, right?

589
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,560
No.

590
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,680
Ethan, April just brought

591
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,680
in her father.

592
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,540
Treatment five.

593
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,540
Her father? What?

594
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,050
Chest pains.

595
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,050
He insists that

596
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,050
you treat him.

597
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,580
It's crazy, right?

598
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,210
The day before

599
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,210
your wedding.

600
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,680
Ethan.

601
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,680
Hey.

602
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,560
Thanks God.

603
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,350
Marcia, hi.

604
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,590
What's going on?

605
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,590
Chest pains?

606
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,190
When did they start?

607
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,190
It's no big deal.

608
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,320
I saw him wince,

609
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,320
rub his chest.

610
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,160
He didn't want to tell me

611
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,160
what it was. I had to

612
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,160
pull it out of him.

613
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,600
They come and go.

614
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,570
I mean, so much trouble

615
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,570
for nothing.

616
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,040
Papai, chest pains

617
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,040
are not nothing, okay?

618
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,170
He wouldn't even let me

619
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,170
call an ambulance,

620
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,080
but I gave him some aspirin

621
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,080
on the way over.

622
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,210
Good.

623
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,210
He never complains.

624
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,080
He went a year

625
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,080
with that hernia.

626
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,490
Well, your heart

627
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,490
and chest sound good,

628
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,560
but April was right

629
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,560
about your chest pains.

630
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,390
We're gonna have to

631
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,390
give you a full workup.

632
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,390
Yeah.

633
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,590
Really?

634
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,590
Yes, really.

635
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,100
Let's start with an EKG.

636
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,100
Yeah.

637
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,470
Ethan, can I talk to you?

638
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,470
Yeah, sure.

639
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,440
Hey, we'll be right back,

640
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,440
all right?

641
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,600
Excuse us.

642
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,240
Do you think we should

643
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,240
postpone the wedding?

644
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,700
I don't know.

645
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,720
We might, but let's

646
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,720
see what the tests

647
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,720
show first, okay?

648
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,410
Okay.

649
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,410
Hey.

650
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,480
Yeah?

651
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,820
So your dad has

652
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,820
excellent recall,

653
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,830
going back to talking

654
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,830
about your mom

655
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,830
when they were kids.

656
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,160
So long-term memory

657
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,160
is intact.

658
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,700
I did notice some

659
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,700
short-term memory issues,

660
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,170
and he's having a little

661
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,170
difficulty concentrating.

662
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,170
It's just like Mom

663
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,170
all over again.

664
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,240
You know, she was such

665
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,240
a smart and funny person,

666
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,870
but eventually Alzheimer's

667
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,870
took everything away.

668
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,340
Just so you know, Jessica,

669
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,340
this is a cursory examination

670
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,440
that I gave him.

671
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,210
I'm not prepared to make

672
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,210
that diagnosis yet.

673
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,150
You said that what's happening

674
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,150
to him might be depression

675
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,150
because my mom died.

676
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,240
And it very well might be.

677
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,620
Yeah, and I read that

678
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,620
a lot of people

679
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
that have Alzheimer's

680
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
have lost a loved one,

681
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
just like my dad.

682
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,420
Well, that hasn't been

683
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,420
established as a cause.

684
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,860
Many Alzheimer's patients

685
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,860
haven't lost loved ones.

686
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,360
I think you want your dad

687
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,360
to have a full workup

688
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,160
with his internist, and a...

689
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,160
A neurologist who

690
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,160
specializes in dementia.

691
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,300
I've got a great list,

692
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,300
if you want a referral.

693
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,440
All right.

694
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,570
I'll get his discharge

695
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,570
paperwork going.

696
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,920
Hey.

697
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,210
Did you see?

698
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,380
You got a full house.

699
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,660
What?

700
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,660
The amphitheater.

701
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,620
Hey.

702
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,490
What's going on?

703
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,290
Who are all those people,

704
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,290
and why are they here?

705
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,830
Some are doctors,

706
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,830
some tech,

707
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,830
some media.

708
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,230
I invited them.

709
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,230
Why?

710
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,930
For the launch,

711
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,930
of course. 2.0.

712
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,930
No, no, no, no.

713
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,270
That surgery's hard enough

714
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,270
without having a bunch

715
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,270
of looky-loos.

716
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,840
Now, get rid of them.

717
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,840
Hey, Crockett. Relax.

718
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,970
They're friends, all right?

719
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,970
They're rooting for us.

720
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,910
For God's sakes, Jack.

721
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,910
Do you understand?

722
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,450
This is not a simulation.

723
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,540
There's a human being

724
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,540
on that table.

725
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,240
I know. And you're

726
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,240
gonna save his life.

727
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,340
And what if I don't?

728
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,890
What if he dies?

729
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,390
I'm not worried about that.

730
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,390
Well, you should be.

731
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,650
I am.

732
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,650
I know the tech.

733
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,560
I've been working on it

734
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,560
for years.

735
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,530
I promise you,

736
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,530
it won't let you down.

737
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,400
You know tech,

738
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,400
but you don't

739
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,400
know surgery.

740
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,830
Send them away.

741
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,770
No, I'm not

742
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,770
gonna do that.

743
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,900
Jack...

744
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,900
Crockett, this is not

745
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,900
who you are.

746
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,670
You're the man who

747
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,670
ran into that tunnel,

748
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,970
who saved my life,

749
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,970
who saved Nathaniel's.

750
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,570
Now, come on.

751
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,680
Have a little

752
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,680
faith in yourself.

753
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,660
Here's those referrals

754
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,660
I was telling you about.

755
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,670
My cell number's on there too.

756
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,670
Please call me any time.

757
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,330
He's seizing.

758
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,630
Dad!

759
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,640
Okay, let's get him back

760
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,640
in the room.

761
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,640
Need some help here.

762
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,810
Two of Ativan.

763
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,670
All right, Paul.

764
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,670
Don't worry. We got you.

765
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,950
Okay, Paul, we're just

766
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,950
gonna give you

767
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,950
some medicine

768
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,550
to calm this down

769
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,550
a little, all right?

770
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,830
Okay, on the bed.

771
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,400
One, two, three.

772
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,430
Head CT, Dr. Charles?

773
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,530
Why?

774
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,510
Although there was nothing

775
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,510
about headaches or nausea

776
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,980
in your father's history,

777
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,980
we should rule out a brain

778
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,980
mass or a bleed.

779
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,880
Has he complained about

780
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,880
any of those symptoms,

781
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,780
or pins and needles

782
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,780
of any kind?

783
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,780
No.

784
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,820
We should do the head CT.

785
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,550
If that comes back normal,

786
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,550
which I suspect it will,

787
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,990
we need to do a spinal tap.

788
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,730
Good to see you.

789
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,730
Good to see you too.

790
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,960
April?

791
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,400
Hey.

792
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,370
I'm sorry

793
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,370
about your father.

794
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,910
That's some stress

795
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,910
you don't need right now.

796
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,530
Hey. Good news.

797
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,580
His troponins

798
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,580
were normal.

799
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,340
There's no indication

800
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,340
he had a heart attack.

801
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,480
God.

802
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,480
That's such good news.

803
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,520
You two, congratulations.

804
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,950
There are

805
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,950
big changes ahead.

806
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,990
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

807
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,990
Thank you.

808
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,590
So, wow.

809
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,560
So you think

810
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,560
it was just

811
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,560
stress-induced?

812
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,860
You mean a panic attack?

813
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,740
There were no other

814
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,740
symptoms, no dizziness

815
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,740
or difficulty breathing.

816
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,800
Well, weddings

817
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,800
can be stressful.

818
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,140
Yeah.

819
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,110
But it's normal,

820
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,110
though, right?

821
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,380
Hmm?

822
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,380
To have, like, anxiety.

823
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,510
You feeling

824
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,510
anxious, April?

825
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,510
No!

826
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,150
I'm... Well, not more than

827
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,150
anyone else would be, right?

828
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,080
I mean, it's a big step.

829
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,560
Marriage. Like...

830
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,560
Yes. Yes.

831
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,420
Like Ms. Goodwin just said,

832
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,420
big changes.

833
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,050
Wait, you're not

834
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,050
having doubts,

835
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,050
are you?

836
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,100
No.

837
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,500
Not doubts.

838
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm just...

839
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,000
Ethan, you've never

840
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,000
been married before.

841
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,570
I've never

842
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,570
been married before.

843
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,770
When you asked if we should

844
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,770
postpone the wedding,

845
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,640
do you want to

846
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,640
postpone the wedding?

847
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,640
Of course not.

848
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,080
I'm so good.

849
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,810
So can you just get his

850
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,810
discharge papers going,

851
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,780
and I'll let Dad know

852
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,780
the good news?

853
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,010
Sure.

854
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,010
Okay.

855
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,490
Okay.

856
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,760
Okay, pancreas head

857
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,760
and proximal duodenum are out.

858
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,070
Can we have a real-time

859
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,070
scan side-by-side with

860
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,070
pre-op, please?

861
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,870
Loading.

862
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,080
Nice work.

863
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,090
Okay, can I get a

864
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,090
vivo histology assessment

865
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,650
on the margins, please?

866
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,990
Margins are clear.

867
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,920
All right.

868
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,160
Time to start reconstruction.

869
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,660
Caution.

870
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,010
Do not sacrifice venous

871
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,010
return to the small bowel.

872
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,910
You need to preserve

873
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,910
the proximal arcade.

874
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,540
Yes, I'm aware.

875
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,010
My line of sight is limited.

876
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,490
The robotic scanner can

877
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,490
transilluminate the branches.

878
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,920
Okay.

879
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,950
I need more views

880
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,950
of the small

881
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,950
bowel vasculature.

882
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,100
Lucky break.

883
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,100
We have enough length.

884
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,100
Yeah.

885
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,600
Primary anastomosis

886
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,600
is possible.

887
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,640
Assessment is correct.

888
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,700
Okay.

889
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,800
Here we go.

890
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,520
Suture.

891
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,000
Suture spacing is too wide.

892
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,130
Risk for post-op

893
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,130
anastomotic leak.

894
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,770
No. I've done lots of

895
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,770
anastomoses this way,

896
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,770
without leak.

897
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,940
Risk for post-op

898
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,940
anastomotic leak.

899
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,080
Suturing too close risks

900
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,080
tearing the tissues.

901
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,050
Risk assessment re-evaluated.

902
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,180
Continue suturing.

903
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,750
Thank you.

904
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,570
Once I have exposure

905
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,570
to Grant's artery,

906
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,160
I'll have you...

907
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,160
Deflate the tourniquet?

908
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,710
Yeah.

909
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,740
And, I'm gonna need

910
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,740
to get proximal and distal

911
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,740
control of the...

912
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,210
God.

913
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,910
What?

914
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,880
You know what...

915
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,660
why don't you just go

916
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,660
ahead and start,

917
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,090
and, uh, I'll be in

918
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,090
in a minute.

919
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,720
What? Where are you going?

920
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,320
Call of nature.

921
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,320
You all right?

922
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,320
You were just there.

923
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,790
I'm fine.

924
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,700
It looks good on you.

925
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,700
Yeah?

926
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,010
Hey, you guys are all set.

927
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,240
Okay, great.

928
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,810
I got to head back to work.

929
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,250
Bye.

930
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,250
All right.

931
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,720
See you at the

932
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,720
church tomorrow.

933
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,720
You got it.

934
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,250
You ready, Dad?

935
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,880
Afonso!

936
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,980
The pain.

937
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,980
Dad?

938
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,350
It's back.

939
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,350
It's worse. I'm sorry.

940
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,060
No, it's okay, Papai.

941
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,060
It's okay.

942
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,820
Let's get you back in bed.

943
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,820
Okay. All right.

944
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,700
What's wrong with him?

945
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,330
All his tests were normal,

946
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,330
but there's something else.

947
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,330
I want to look into.

948
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,910
April, let's get a CT.

949
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay.

950
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,800
I'll have Maggie let

951
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,800
Radiology know.

952
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,050
We'll be back as soon

953
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,050
as we get the results, okay?

954
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,930
Dan, you know

955
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,930
where Maggie is?

956
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,830
I got the cupcakes

957
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,830
for the party.

958
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,100
She's up in surgery.

959
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,100
I'll take those.

960
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,430
Surgery?

961
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,800
Oh, not her.

962
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,000
The guy she was

963
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,000
in the accident with.

964
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,200
What accident?

965
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,340
Last week,

966
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,340
when she got T-boned.

967
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,010
Oh...

968
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,850
Thanks.

969
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,760
Auto accident?

970
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,190
Ben.

971
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,730
You never told me

972
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,730
you were in an accident.

973
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,860
I wasn't hurt.

974
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,860
That's not the point.

975
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,230
You never told me you

976
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,230
were in an accident.

977
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,710
I didn't want to upset you.

978
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,710
Upset me?

979
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,900
Who were you with?

980
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,180
Who's the guy in surgery?

981
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,180
Was it Grant?

982
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,340
Is that why you didn't

983
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,340
want to tell me?

984
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,440
Was it?

985
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,440
No.

986
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,950
He was just showing me

987
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,950
his car and...

988
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,950
Showing you his car.

989
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,750
I go out of town,

990
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,750
he's showing you his car.

991
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,790
Ben, I know

992
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,790
how it looks, but...

993
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,790
Are you having an affair?

994
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,220
No! Never.

995
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,490
How am I supposed

996
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,490
to believe you?

997
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,290
Ben, wait.

998
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,160
Ben.

999
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,210
There's every indication

1000
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,210
that we were able

1001
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,210
to entirely remove

1002
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,470
the patient's tumor,

1003
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,440
and we're optimistic

1004
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,440
for his future.

1005
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,520
Now, bear in mind,

1006
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,520
the patient's tumor

1007
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,260
was considered completely

1008
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,260
inoperable before O.R. 2.0.

1009
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,880
And thanks to Mr. Dayton's

1010
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,880
generosity, Chicago Med

1011
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,090
is able to provide

1012
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,090
our patients with

1013
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,090
the best possible outcome

1014
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,070
through a whole new level

1015
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,070
of surgical intervention.

1016
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,400
Thank you.

1017
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,770
Dr. Dupre,

1018
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,770
a moment, please.

1019
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,850
What the hell

1020
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,850
happened in there?

1021
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,850
You had to override the Al.

1022
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,810
It wasn't 2.0's fault.

1023
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,810
It gave me bad advice.

1024
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,010
That was because of me.

1025
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,550
I was overly cautious.

1026
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,480
I programmed 2.0 for someone

1027
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,480
that was less proficient.

1028
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,380
The risk threshold

1029
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,380
was too low.

1030
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,080
But you are

1031
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,080
a very skilled

1032
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,080
surgeon, Dr. Marcel.

1033
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,250
The AI learns.

1034
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,850
Believe me, you will not

1035
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,850
have this problem again.

1036
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,390
So Paul,

1037
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,000
we think that we have

1038
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,170
a much better idea about

1039
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,170
what's been going on with you.

1040
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,910
Is it what I thought?

1041
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,910
It's not.

1042
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,510
The lumbar puncture showed

1043
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,510
elevated protein levels,

1044
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,380
which means there's

1045
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,380
inflammation present.

1046
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,080
The good news,

1047
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,080
there's no sign

1048
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,080
of any infection.

1049
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,390
So it looks like inflammation

1050
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,390
is the cause of your

1051
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,390
father's symptoms.

1052
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,580
Inflammation from what?

1053
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,290
The immune system

1054
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,290
attacking the brain.

1055
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,990
It's a condition called

1056
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,990
autoimmune encephalitis.

1057
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,060
Why? Why would

1058
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,060
that happen?

1059
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,290
We don't know.

1060
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,340
It can be caused by a tumor,

1061
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,340
but that's not the case

1062
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,340
with your father.

1063
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,530
And it's just one of those

1064
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,530
medical mysteries

1065
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,400
that just haven't

1066
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,400
been solved yet.

1067
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,910
The good news is that

1068
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,910
it's entirely treatable.

1069
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,910
We're going to give your

1070
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,910
father high-dose steroids,

1071
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,040
and this will reduce

1072
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,040
the brain inflammation

1073
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,380
and lessen

1074
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,380
the immune response.

1075
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,950
His balance?

1076
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,950
His memory loss?

1077
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,080
We think that they're

1078
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,080
all gonna improve.

1079
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,550
And, hopefully pretty

1080
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,550
quickly too.

1081
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,520
Hear that, Dad?

1082
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,590
They're gonna

1083
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,590
make you better.

1084
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,330
Thank you.

1085
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,570
Hi.

1086
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,340
We know what's

1087
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,340
causing your pain.

1088
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,210
Okay.

1089
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,980
You have a condition

1090
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,980
called myocardial bridging.

1091
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,250
That doesn't sound good.

1092
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,290
Well, you actually

1093
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,290
were born with it.

1094
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,950
It's a condition where one

1095
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,950
of your coronary arteries

1096
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,550
runs through your

1097
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,550
heart muscle, instead

1098
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,550
of on top as it should.

1099
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,560
Right, so when

1100
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,560
the heart compresses,

1101
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,150
it reduces blood flow

1102
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,150
to that artery,

1103
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,150
causing your pain.

1104
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,430
Now, we can address it with

1105
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,430
a procedure called unroofing.

1106
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,440
It's where a surgeon cuts

1107
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,440
through your heart muscle,

1108
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,060
just to relieve

1109
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,060
the pressure.

1110
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,160
Heart surgery?

1111
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,640
So I'm going to

1112
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,640
miss the wedding?

1113
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,070
No.

1114
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,070
No, no, no, no, no.

1115
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,040
This isn't an emergency.

1116
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,610
You should schedule

1117
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,610
the surgery soon,

1118
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,580
but, we can wait till

1119
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,580
after the wedding.

1120
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,080
You're gonna be fine, Pai.

1121
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,450
All right, I'm gonna go

1122
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,450
text Noah and tell Mai.

1123
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,620
Okay.

1124
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,000
I'll be

1125
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,000
right back, okay?

1126
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,340
Hey, April.

1127
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,110
Look.

1128
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm nervous too.

1129
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,510
You are?

1130
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,510
Yeah.

1131
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,710
Here I am, asking you

1132
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,710
to change your life,

1133
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,960
leave your practice,

1134
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,960
and I worry one day

1135
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,030
you'll say,

1136
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,030
"What have I done?

1137
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,030
This whole thing is crazy."

1138
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,390
I couldn't sleep last night.

1139
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,390
I was just thinking, like,

1140
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,390
what if...

1141
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,400
I don't know, Ethan

1142
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,400
realizes I'm not the

1143
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,400
person he thinks I am?

1144
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,970
What if in a couple of years,

1145
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,970
he's sorry he married me?

1146
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,510
No, no. Hey.

1147
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,200
I don't want

1148
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,200
to let you down.

1149
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,330
I don't want to let

1150
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,330
you down, either.

1151
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,350
Well, maybe that's

1152
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,350
a good place to start.

1153
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,180
Hey, Maggie.

1154
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,520
How's Grant?

1155
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,460
He's fine.

1156
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,460
The surgery went well.

1157
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,730
Good. Your cupcake

1158
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,730
party's starting.

1159
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,090
Right.

1160
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,070
What's the matter?

1161
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,730
Ben.

1162
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,510
He found out

1163
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,510
about the accident.

1164
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,630
Oh, no.

1165
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,640
There's nothing

1166
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,640
I could say.

1167
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,180
He thinks that

1168
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,180
we need time apart.

1169
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,680
Oh, Maggie.

1170
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,480
I'm so sorry.

1171
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,320
I don't know what to do.

1172
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,640
Hey, Sharon.

1173
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,100
You got a second?

1174
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,100
Yeah, sure.

1175
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,770
So, you remember

1176
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,770
the singer that I was

1177
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,600
telling you about, who,

1178
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,600
you know, I saw last night,

1179
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,200
who works here?

1180
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,200
Yeah, yeah.

1181
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,480
Yeah, she's with

1182
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,480
the housekeeping department.

1183
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,780
Okay.

1184
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,780
Yeah, and...

1185
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,520
I was thinking about

1186
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,520
asking her out.

1187
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,720
Am I completely

1188
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,720
frigging crazy?

1189
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,660
Daniel, you're

1190
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,660
being impulsive?

1191
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,820
You know, life full of

1192
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,820
surprises? I don't know

1193
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,820
what to tell you.

1194
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,720
Well, tell me about her.

1195
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,430
She, sings like a dream

1196
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,430
and cleans my office.

1197
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,700
That's all I got.

1198
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,830
It's a little awkward,

1199
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,830
though, don't you think?

1200
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,800
Well, there is an unequal

1201
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,800
power dynamic, but...

1202
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,640
Exactly, and I don't

1203
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,640
want her to feel obligated.

1204
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,300
Listen, Daniel, you're...

1205
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,440
It's not like

1206
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,440
you're her supervisor.

1207
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,070
Sharon, I think

1208
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,070
it's too fraught.

1209
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,350
It's too fraught.

1210
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,350
You know.

1211
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,610
Thank you. Good talk.

1212
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,480
I appreciate it.

1213
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,480
I'm gonna bag it.

1214
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,560
Oh!

1215
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,560
Okay.

1216
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,600
Hey, Grant's coming around.

1217
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,790
He's doing well.

1218
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,590
That's good.

1219
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,590
Yeah.

1220
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,270
Hey, Dean, have you seen

1221
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,270
a nephrologist?

1222
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,170
Nephrologist? What are you

1223
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,170
talking about?

1224
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,340
Last week, you asked

1225
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,340
my opinion on

1226
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,340
an ultrasound.

1227
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,780
The renal artery

1228
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,780
was clearly stenotic.

1229
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,780
Yeah, that was a patient.

1230
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,440
Yeah, and today,

1231
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,440
all those trips

1232
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,440
to the loo.

1233
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,850
Med-zone Nancy Drew.

1234
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,850
Dean.

1235
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,600
Tell me,

1236
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,600
what's going on?

1237
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,830
Yeah, I'm seeing

1238
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,830
a nephrologist.

1239
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,700
And?

1240
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,770
Interstitial nephritis,

1241
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,780
papillary necrosis.

1242
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,880
There's more.

1243
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,750
How? Why?

1244
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,880
Those hits I took

1245
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,880
to my kidneys,

1246
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,680
I've taken too many NSAIDS

1247
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,680
for the busted ribs.

1248
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,350
It's stupid.

1249
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,620
Well, how are you

1250
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,620
being treated?

1251
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,420
He's putting me

1252
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,420
on a renal diet.

1253
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,520
If that doesn't turn

1254
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,520
things around, then I'll...

1255
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,220
Dialysis?

1256
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,220
Yes.

1257
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,300
And then, well...

1258
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,300
You know.

1259
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,470
I'm so sorry.

1260
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,340
It's gonna resolve.

1261
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,400
Is there anything I can do?

1262
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,840
Yeah, you can

1263
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,840
keep it to yourself.

1264
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,350
Of course.

1265
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,670
Dr. Charles!

1266
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,670
Hey, Liliana.

1267
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,570
How are you doing?

1268
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,570
Are you looking for me?

1269
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,580
Did I miss something

1270
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,580
in your office?

1271
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,580
No, not at all.

1272
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,980
Um... I was...

1273
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,650
Hey, would you like to

1274
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,650
get some coffee?

1275
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,610
Get coffee? For you?

1276
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,880
No, no, no, no. With me.

1277
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,360
Would you like to

1278
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,360
have some coffee...

1279
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,360
Have some coffee with me?

1280
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,520
You're asking me out?

1281
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,450
Yeah.

1282
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,370
Look, if I'm being

1283
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,370
presumptuous,

1284
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,370
I'm so sorry.

1285
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,490
I don't know

1286
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,490
anything about you,

1287
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,490
your personal life.

1288
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,300
You could be involved with

1289
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,300
somebody, in which case...

1290
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,630
No, I'm not.

1291
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,340
You're serious?

1292
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,400
Yeah.

1293
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,710
Look, if I've gotten off

1294
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,710
on the wrong foot

1295
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,710
here, I really...

1296
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,680
No, no, no, no.

1297
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,450
I'd like to have

1298
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,450
coffee with you.

1299
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,250
When?

1300
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,580
Any time you want.

1301
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,580
I mean...

1302
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,820
How about now?

1303
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,620
What a good...

1304
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,620
That's a great idea.

1305
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,600
Let's have some coffee now.

1306
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,030
I just have to change.

1307
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,430
Cool. Okay.

1308
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,030
I'll just...

1309
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,030
I'll wait out here.

1310
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,940
Good.

1311
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,660
Since it is

1312
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,660
your intention to enter the

1313
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,660
covenant of holy matrimony,

1314
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,930
join your hands and declare

1315
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,930
your consent before

1316
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,930
God and this church.

1317
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,600
I, Ethan, take you,

1318
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,600
April, to be my wife.

1319
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,380
I promise to always

1320
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,380
be faithful to you,

1321
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,980
in good times and in bad,

1322
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,050
in sickness and in health,

1323
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,050
to love you,

1324
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,310
and to honor you,

1325
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,310
all the days

1326
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,310
of my life.

1327
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:31,590
I, April, take you, Ethan,

1328
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:31,590
to be my husband.

1329
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,430
I promise to be

1330
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,430
faithful to you,

1331
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,600
in good times and in bad,

1332
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,610
in sickness and in health,

1333
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,610
to love you,

1334
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,800
and to honor you,

1335
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,800
for all the days of my life.

1336
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,440
May I have the rings?

1337
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,970
Whoo!

1338
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,640
Oh, my God. Sharon.

1339
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,980
What?

1340
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,980
The board

1341
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,980
was just informed.

1342
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,450
Jack Dayton has bought

1343
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,450
controlling interest

1344
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,950
in the Gaffney Medical Group.

1345
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,580
What?

1346
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,750
So I guess

1347
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,750
he's in charge now.
