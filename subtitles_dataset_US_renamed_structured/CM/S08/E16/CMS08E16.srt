1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,440
He's put me on

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,440
a renal diet. If that doesn't

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,440
turn things around, then...

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,030
Dialysis? I'm so sorry.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,040
I don't advertise

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,040
my immigration status,

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,040
but I'm undocumented.

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,440
My future always

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,440
feels precarious.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,080
More money in our checks!

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,180
We are essential!

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,020
You're striking?

13
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,020
It's very important

14
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,320
that Liliana feels like

15
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,320
I have her back.

16
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,550
I'm going

17
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,550
with my friends to

18
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,550
celebrate. Come.

19
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,100
You have to come.

20
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,100
You're my boyfriend.

21
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,100
Oh, no...

22
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,500
Lil.

23
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,430
Daniel.

24
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,560
Oh, the time.

25
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,300
I didn't realize.

26
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,340
I... I'm almost finished.

27
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,710
I'm usually done

28
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,710
before you arrive.

29
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,180
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,180
Oh, no. No,

31
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,180
let me get that.

32
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,310
I'm the one

33
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,310
who should be apologizing.

34
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,110
No. No, I had

35
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,110
the interns in

36
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,110
for pizza last night.

37
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,550
Then they dragged me out

38
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,550
for a drink,

39
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,590
and we just left.

40
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,590
It's okay.

41
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,590
I've got it.

42
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,450
I apologize for the mess.

43
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,450
Really, I do.

44
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,450
It's okay.

45
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,120
Compared to other offices,

46
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,120
it's not that bad.

47
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,130
Oops.

48
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,630
Daniel,

49
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,630
have a good day.

50
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,230
You too.

51
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,380
Ah.

52
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,380
I think this

53
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,380
belongs to you.

54
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,410
Indeed, it does.

55
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,410
Where did you find it?

56
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,510
This time?

57
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,510
Waiting room.

58
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,140
Top of the

59
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,140
vending machine.

60
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,480
Hmm. You know,

61
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,480
maybe I should

62
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,480
just, uh, put it

63
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,560
in a little red-and-white

64
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,560
striped shirt,

65
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,680
put a bobble hat on it,

66
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,680
black glasses,

67
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,520
and call it my

68
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,520
"Where's Waldo?"

69
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,520
water bottle, huh?

70
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,600
You get it?

71
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,430
I get it.

72
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,430
You have to stay hydrated.

73
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,770
Thanks, Mom.

74
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,700
Dr. Cuevas.

75
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,330
Ms. Goodwin,

76
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,330
good morning.

77
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,330
Good morning.

78
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,850
Do you have a moment

79
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,850
to discuss your

80
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,850
DACA renewal?

81
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,380
Oh. Um, now?

82
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,080
Well, the paperwork's

83
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,080
not due for a few months,

84
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,680
but I want to make sure

85
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,680
we get everything

86
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,680
filed early,

87
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,450
just in case there's

88
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,450
an unexpected policy change.

89
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,150
Right, of course.

90
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,150
I appreciate that.

91
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,630
I just was about

92
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,630
to dig into these

93
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,630
overnight charts.

94
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,690
Understood.

95
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,690
How about we meet up

96
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,690
at the end of the day?

97
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,330
Yeah. Sure, that works.

98
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,460
I will...

99
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,460
I'll see you then.

100
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,240
Dr. Asher. Need you.

101
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,240
Oh, yeah.

102
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,240
Come this way.

103
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,640
Hi, I'm Dr. Asher.

104
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,220
Leah, what's going on?

105
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,810
Parents and

106
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,810
their daughter.

107
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,110
Came in a few minutes ago.

108
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,110
They're terrified.

109
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,750
Even scared me.

110
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,750
Going to two.

111
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,620
I didn't get a history.

112
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,620
Just came for you.

113
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Excuse me, Doctor.

114
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
We need your help.

115
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,730
Our daughter.

116
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,730
All right.

117
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,890
Hi, I'm Dr. Halstead.

118
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,890
What's your name?

119
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,390
Um...

120
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,390
Maria. Her name

121
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,390
is Maria. Very sick!

122
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,540
I'm sorry.

123
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,540
I don't speak Spanish.

124
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,540
Get Dr. Cuevas.

125
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,370
I'm just gonna

126
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,370
feel your neck, okay?

127
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,740
Does that hurt?

128
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,290
Â¿Malo? Bad?

129
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,550
What are they saying?

130
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,530
They're saying that

131
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,530
she has the sickness,

132
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,730
and if we don't help her,

133
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,730
she will die.

134
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,680
Thank you.

135
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,310
Hey. How's Maria doing?

136
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,260
Uh, still a bit groggy,

137
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,260
but responding

138
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,260
to questions in English.

139
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,290
Whatever this is,

140
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,290
it seems to be sporadic.

141
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,260
Any guesses?

142
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,260
I don't know.

143
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,420
Maybe infectious encephalitis,

144
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,420
but her vitals were normal.

145
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,860
I'm hoping labs

146
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,860
shed some light.

147
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,660
What did Mom and Dad

148
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,660
have to say?

149
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,670
The sickness that they're

150
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,670
referring to has to do

151
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,670
with her older brother, Hugo.

152
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,330
About a month ago,

153
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,330
he came down

154
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,330
with an illness,

155
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,910
was admitted to Oakview

156
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,910
Community Hospital,

157
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,980
and then died

158
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,980
a few days later.

159
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,980
Oh, man.

160
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,910
Yeah, and even worse,

161
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,910
Oakview couldn't make

162
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,910
a diagnosis.

163
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,880
Well, explains why they're

164
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,880
beating down our doors.

165
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,510
They're afraid

166
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,510
whatever ravaged Hugo

167
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,510
is now attacking Maria.

168
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,490
But a death

169
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,490
in the family,

170
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,490
no answers,

171
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,990
plus the fear

172
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,990
that she might have

173
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,990
the same illness?

174
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,260
Since nothing's

175
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,260
jumping out,

176
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,260
I think it's possible

177
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,420
that her emotions could be

178
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,420
manifesting physically.

179
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,620
I want to talk to her,

180
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,620
see if there could be

181
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,620
a psych explanation.

182
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,330
Okay. Meantime,

183
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,330
I'll reach out to Oakview,

184
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,300
get Hugo's records

185
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,300
and autopsy results.

186
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
If Maria does have

187
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
the same illness, there

188
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
could be a clue in there.

189
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,270
Okay, Layla, you're

190
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,270
7 centimeters dilated,

191
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,840
100% effaced.

192
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,610
How long ago

193
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,610
did your water break?

194
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,810
About an hour,

195
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,810
hour and a...

196
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,750
7:02 a.m., I think.

197
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,680
This baby

198
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,680
is coming out sideways.

199
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,650
No, it just

200
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,650
feels like that.

201
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,650
Your fetus is OP,

202
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,550
meaning it's facing up

203
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,550
instead of down.

204
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,850
Something's wrong?

205
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,850
No.

206
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,260
Baby's just moving around,

207
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,260
letting us know that

208
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,260
it is time to come out.

209
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,800
I'll have a nurse

210
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,800
let L&D know.

211
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,330
Oh, my God. Quentin,

212
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,330
our son is coming.

213
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,900
I'm gonna be a mom today.

214
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,470
You know, I can't remember

215
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,470
if I turned off the oven

216
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,470
before we left the house.

217
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,540
Quentin, we haven't

218
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,540
cooked in days.

219
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,540
The oven is off.

220
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,980
I'm just gonna go home

221
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,980
and check.

222
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,980
Quentin, no!

223
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
Mr. Bell,

224
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
please don't go.

225
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
You know what?

226
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,680
Maybe you can have

227
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,680
a neighbor check on it,

228
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,270
or maybe it's just

229
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,270
nervous energy

230
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,650
that's making you think

231
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,650
that you left it on.

232
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,950
Yeah, I just don't

233
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,950
feel like myself.

234
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,020
I get it.

235
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,020
It's a big day.

236
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,350
You know, a lot

237
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,350
of new experiences

238
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,350
all happening at once.

239
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,890
But, Quentin,

240
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,890
this is not new for me.

241
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,620
I have been here

242
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,620
many, many times,

243
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,860
and I know exactly

244
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,860
how to help you and Layla

245
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,860
get through this.

246
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,860
Thank you.

247
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,640
Sorry, Lay. I just lost

248
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,640
my mind for a minute.

249
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,070
Nice save.

250
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,070
Mm-hmm.

251
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,540
Hey, Sam. This

252
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,540
is Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

253
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,910
He's gonna be

254
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,910
scrubbing in

255
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,910
with me today.

256
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,580
He's one of

257
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,580
my surgical residents.

258
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,580
Uh, technically

259
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,580
I'm a resident but

260
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,580
definitely not a beginner.

261
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,590
Okay.

262
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,590
Anyway, like

263
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,590
we discussed,

264
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,390
it's a straight

265
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,390
appendix removal.

266
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,790
You're gonna be

267
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,790
a bit sore afterwards,

268
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,090
but in a week or two,

269
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,090
you'll be back

270
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,090
to full strength.

271
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,530
Mm. Perfect, because

272
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,530
I've been itching to

273
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,530
get back in the gym.

274
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,400
Rugged Maniac is this summer.

275
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,630
Rugged Maniac?

276
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,630
The adventure race?

277
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,500
You know it?

278
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,500
Yeah, sort of.

279
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,670
A couple of guys

280
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,670
from the community

281
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,670
are putting a team together.

282
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,800
Community? You mean

283
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,800
other doctors?

284
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,570
No, uh, CrossFit.

285
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,880
From my Kalsu group.

286
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,880
Kalsu's a workout.

287
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,850
We do burpees

288
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,850
and thrusters

289
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,850
for time.

290
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,850
Anyway, back to the task

291
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,850
at hand. If you're ready,

292
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,850
we're ready.

293
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,890
Let's do this.

294
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,890
Great.

295
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,750
Nurse Trisha will be in

296
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,750
to get the prep started.

297
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,420
Anesthesia after that.

298
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,420
Sounds good, Doc.

299
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,590
See you on

300
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,590
the other side,

301
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,590
all right?

302
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,930
Appendix removal,

303
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,930
pretty basic.

304
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,730
Well, sorry Sam's

305
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,730
not sick enough

306
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,730
for you.

307
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,030
Oh, you know

308
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,030
what I mean.

309
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,630
OR 2.0 is a Ferrari...

310
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,630
sexy surgery. But a lap appy?

311
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,730
Well, not even

312
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,730
in that today.

313
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,640
Sam had a sigmoid

314
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,640
colon resection

315
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,640
18 months ago.

316
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,050
Likely adhesions

317
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,050
in his pelvis,

318
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,120
so we're gonna

319
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,120
do this appy open,

320
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,940
right lower

321
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,940
quadrant incision.

322
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,710
Okay?

323
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,710
Old school.

324
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,390
Gee, hope I'm

325
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,390
up to the challenge.

326
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,690
For a resident,

327
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,690
guy sure is

328
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,690
full of himself.

329
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,160
I'm not a fan.

330
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,560
Hugo's gone.

331
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,970
I'm oldest now.

332
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,970
I need to be strong.

333
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,970
For my other brothers

334
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,970
and sisters.

335
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,840
For my parents.

336
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,070
They've been a wreck

337
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,070
since Hugo died.

338
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,520
They can't sleep.

339
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,520
They can't eat.

340
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,720
Now I'm putting them

341
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,720
through it again.

342
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,990
I have it too.

343
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,990
No.

344
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,190
Hey, we don't know that.

345
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,470
All of the labs

346
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,470
Dr. Halstead ran

347
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,470
came back normal.

348
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,870
Then what's wrong with me?

349
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,870
In some cases,

350
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,870
it's possible

351
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,910
for grief and fear to lead

352
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,910
to physical symptoms.

353
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,740
No, I'm not imagining this.

354
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,640
No, you're not.

355
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,680
Your symptoms

356
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,680
are very real.

357
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,890
You suffered

358
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,890
a devastating loss,

359
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,890
a trauma.

360
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,960
Hugo's tests

361
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,960
were normal too.

362
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,800
And then he died.

363
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,770
I don't think we're looking

364
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,770
at a psych condition.

365
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,630
In conversion disorder,

366
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,630
it's rare

367
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,070
that patients can

368
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,070
express their emotions

369
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,070
the way Maria is.

370
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,610
But her awareness

371
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,610
of the situation,

372
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,700
her acknowledgment

373
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,700
of the fear,

374
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,700
it doesn't fit.

375
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,980
There's definitely

376
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,980
something physical going on.

377
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,520
I wish I knew what.

378
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,520
Medical examiner said

379
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,520
Hugo died of brain swelling

380
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,250
but don't know

381
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,250
what caused it.

382
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,220
And here's the kicker,

383
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,220
it was only three days

384
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,620
from when Hugo was admitted

385
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,620
to the time he died.

386
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,920
Okay, so whatever it is,

387
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,920
it moved really fast.

388
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,090
I think

389
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,090
he's stuck.

390
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,690
No, just a big head.

391
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,690
That's all.

392
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,630
Oh, my God.

393
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,630
Is he gonna fit?

394
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,630
Yes, he will.

395
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,610
We just need to open up

396
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,610
the birth canal a bit wider.

397
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,700
McRoberts?

398
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,700
Yes. Uh, call the OB

399
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,700
resident on call.

400
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,870
Layla, we're gonna adjust you

401
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,870
to a new position, okay?

402
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,610
It makes it easier

403
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,610
for the baby to come out.

404
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,880
Okay.

405
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,750
I'm right here.

406
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,750
All right,

407
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,750
Quentin.

408
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,650
Why don't you let him

409
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,650
take over for you, okay?

410
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,850
And I can use

411
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,850
some pressure.

412
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,850
Yep.

413
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,820
Okay, now

414
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,820
on your next

415
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,820
contraction,

416
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,590
I want you to give me

417
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,590
everything you've got.

418
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,860
Everything.

419
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,860
Okay.

420
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
Okay.

421
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
I can do this.

422
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,100
Yes, you can.

423
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,100
You got this.

424
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
You got this.

425
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay.

426
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,140
I've got the head.

427
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,700
Shoulder.

428
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,800
I've got him.

429
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,240
I got him.

430
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,240
He's here.

431
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,180
He's here.

432
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,650
He's here.

433
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,650
Oh, my God.

434
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,550
Oh, my God.

435
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,850
I'm a mom. Our baby,

436
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,850
he's beautiful.

437
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,180
He's perfect.

438
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,760
Hey, Dad, do you want

439
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,760
to cut the umbilical cord?

440
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,770
Yeah.

441
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,200
Okay. Just right here

442
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,200
in the middle, okay?

443
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,080
That's not my son.

444
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,040
What?

445
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,710
Layla, who's the father?

446
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,080
You are, Quentin.

447
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,980
You are. That's our baby.

448
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,950
No, you're lying!

449
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,950
You're lying!

450
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,890
Hey, Quentin, it's okay.

451
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,890
We'll figure this out,

452
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,890
all right?

453
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,820
That's not my son.

454
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,820
That's our baby.

455
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,820
Of course it is!

456
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,620
No, get back!

457
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,620
Of course it is!

458
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,320
I got to get out of here.

459
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,320
Hey, deep breaths, okay?

460
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,000
Quentin, breathe with me.

461
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,260
Breathe with me, Quentin.

462
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,260
Deep breaths.

463
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,200
I got to get out of here!

464
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,200
Stay! Baby, stay!

465
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,140
Hey, call security.

466
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,140
Help!

467
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,180
Oh, my God.

468
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,180
What's happening?

469
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,180
Hey! Hey, stop!

470
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,800
Hey, guards!

471
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,800
Quentin, stop!

472
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,250
Why are you chasing me?

473
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,250
Just leave me...

474
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,250
leave me alone!

475
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,250
Stay back! Stay back!

476
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,250
Hey, Quentin...

477
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,220
It's okay. It's okay.

478
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,220
Deep breath.

479
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,220
Please, just breathe.

480
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
I just got to

481
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
get out of here.

482
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,690
I just got to get out of here!

483
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,690
No, no, no, no, no!

484
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,400
All right, Quentin.

485
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,400
It's okay.

486
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,740
Oh, my God,

487
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,740
the scissors,

488
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,740
they're pulsating.

489
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,110
They're penetrating

490
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,110
the carotid artery.

491
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,340
I'll get someone

492
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,340
to turn off the machine.

493
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,710
No, the magnet is holding

494
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,710
everything in place,

495
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,710
including the scissors.

496
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,720
If gravity takes over,

497
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,720
it'll shift everything,

498
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,380
and we'll have maybe

499
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,380
20 seconds

500
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,380
before he bleeds out.

501
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,420
Okay, we need help.

502
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,420
Call Dr. Archer.

503
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,420
Dr. Charles too.

504
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,920
Yeah.

505
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,890
Do not touch

506
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,890
the scissors, okay?

507
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,790
We got you.

508
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,370
Everything's gonna be okay.

509
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,930
Coming through, excuse me.

510
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,700
Thank you guys

511
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,700
for coming.

512
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,180
Absolutely.

513
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,040
Hey, fellas.

514
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,040
Doctor.

515
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,210
He's conscious and calm

516
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,210
but out of it.

517
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,220
He's not being crushed.

518
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,220
He's able to breathe.

519
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,310
He's got to be

520
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,310
in pain, though.

521
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,310
Okay.

522
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,150
So let's give him

523
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,150
50 mics of fentanyl IM.

524
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,160
Syringe is plastic

525
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,160
and the needle nonferrous,

526
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,700
so it should be MRI safe.

527
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,860
Okay, I'll get it. Dr. Asher

528
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,860
went back to be

529
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,860
with his wife, Layla.

530
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,870
She's still in L&D.

531
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,870
Okay.

532
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,830
It's a rescue situation.

533
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,830
I just don't really know

534
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,830
where to start.

535
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,340
All of our tools

536
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,340
have metal in them.

537
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,840
So nothing is usable

538
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,840
as long as the MRI machine

539
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,840
is running.

540
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,000
All right, well,

541
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,000
let's say we did

542
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,000
turn the machine off.

543
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,140
Everything falls

544
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,140
to the floor. Bed alone

545
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,140
is a couple hundred pounds.

546
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,340
I can put two of my guys

547
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,340
in there to try and catch it,

548
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,280
then get it out of the way

549
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,280
so you can get to Quentin.

550
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,720
Scissors in his neck

551
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,720
are magnetic too.

552
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Cut the MRI's power,

553
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
they're gonna move.

554
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Quentin will bleed out fast.

555
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,220
If you could go in there

556
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,220
with clamps and stem the flow,

557
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,890
would that buy us some time?

558
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,890
Not enough.

559
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,860
Odds of survival

560
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,860
are less than 1%.

561
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,190
I'm running

562
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,190
outcome probabilities

563
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,190
on our options,

564
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,130
and turning off the machine

565
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,130
cold turkey is the worst.

566
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,210
So what's the best?

567
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,770
If CFD can secure Quentin

568
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,780
and ensure

569
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,780
the bed won't displace him

570
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,900
and Dr. Archer can

571
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,900
stabilize the neck wound

572
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,410
all before turning off

573
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,410
the MRI machine,

574
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,420
then the odds of survival

575
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,420
are roughly 61%.

576
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,180
Okay, we've got a plan.

577
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,180
Can it be done?

578
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,920
Well, safest way

579
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,920
to secure the patient

580
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,290
would be to do

581
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,290
a, uh, webbing harness.

582
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,860
We can throw the ropes

583
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,860
over the MRI machine,

584
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,190
and then two of my guys

585
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,190
can hold it on the other side.

586
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,060
Okay, the magnet's off,

587
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,060
the bed falls.

588
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,260
How do we ensure that

589
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,260
Quentin doesn't

590
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,260
go with it?

591
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,170
We can create a buffer zone

592
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,170
between him and the bed

593
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,100
using wooden cribbing,

594
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,100
wedges and airbags.

595
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,040
We can run some hoses

596
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,040
and inflate them

597
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,400
from a tank here

598
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,400
in the hallway.

599
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,140
All right,

600
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,140
we're halfway there.

601
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,480
Dr. Archer?

602
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,480
Yeah. I just need

603
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,480
to clamp the artery

604
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,950
in order to control

605
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,950
the bleeding.

606
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,350
Then I can take

607
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,350
the scissors out.

608
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,280
But the issue is

609
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,280
the tools needed to do it.

610
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,380
I can make them plastic.

611
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,380
3D printers.

612
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,790
There are four

613
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,790
in the robotics lab.

614
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,090
All right. Get on it.

615
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,090
And get a few of the

616
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,090
2.0 engineers to help.

617
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,830
We'll get started too.

618
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,830
Good.

619
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,460
Okay, you're

620
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,460
doing great.

621
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,560
Gonna give you

622
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,560
a little injection.

623
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,560
Some pain meds, all right?

624
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,460
To, uh, just make you

625
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,460
a little more

626
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,460
comfortable, okay?

627
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,900
Little pinch.

628
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,570
Okay.

629
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,810
Daniel?

630
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,350
I'm just gonna step away

631
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,350
for a second,

632
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,820
have a little chat

633
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,820
with my colleague.

634
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,350
I'm not going

635
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,350
anywhere, okay?

636
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,020
How's he doing?

637
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,300
Well, you know, I mean,

638
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,300
he's pinned to an

639
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,300
MRI machine, so...

640
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,130
Do you have any theories

641
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,130
on what sparked the break?

642
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,570
I've been really focusing

643
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,570
on trying to keep him calm.

644
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,430
But how's the plan

645
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,430
to get him off

646
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,430
the thing going?

647
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,840
Well, we've got one.

648
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,840
But it's a possibility

649
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,840
that it won't work, Daniel,

650
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,040
so I've asked Dr. Asher

651
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,040
to bring Quentin's

652
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,040
wife down here

653
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,080
to see him

654
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,080
'cause it may be

655
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,080
the last time.

656
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,880
Okay, thank you.

657
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,350
Okay,

658
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,350
making the incision.

659
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,580
Okay.

660
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,230
Okay, nice and easy.

661
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,090
Lap cut.

662
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
Yep.

663
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,130
Definitely feeling

664
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,130
some adhesions.

665
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,110
Point taken.

666
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,110
Open surgery

667
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,110
was the right call.

668
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,380
Go ahead, say it.

669
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,380
"I told you so."

670
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,010
Yeah, maybe later.

671
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,950
For now, why don't you

672
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,950
get some practice

673
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,950
old-school style?

674
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,380
Come around.

675
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,290
Okay. You got it?

676
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,980
Yeah.

677
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,980
All right.

678
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,430
Babcock.

679
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,230
You okay?

680
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,130
Yeah, it's just

681
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,130
a little heartburn.

682
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,570
I'm fine.

683
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,980
Oh, uh...

684
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,210
Uh... God, excuse me.

685
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,210
I'm sorry.

686
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,240
Stop it.

687
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,940
Stop.

688
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,250
It's no big deal.

689
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,250
It happens, okay?

690
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,090
Just focus on the field.

691
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,980
Stay focused.

692
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,460
Ah. Here comes another one.

693
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,260
Kai?

694
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,930
Kai, talk to me.

695
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,300
Hey, buddy! Hey!

696
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,300
Angel. Angel, check him.

697
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,710
Got a pulse.

698
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,710
All right. Give me

699
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,710
the, uh, babcock, please.

700
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,410
Maria!

701
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,410
Need some help in here!

702
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,210
Maria!

703
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,480
I was helping her

704
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,480
to the bathroom,

705
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,480
and she started seizing.

706
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,250
Okay, 4 milligrams

707
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,250
of Ativan.

708
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,680
Please help her.

709
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,680
Please.

710
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,160
Ativan's in.

711
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,670
Okay, she's gonna be

712
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,670
postictal for a while.

713
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,960
Put her on a foley.

714
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,700
I don't want her

715
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,700
getting out of the bed,

716
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,700
not even for the bathroom.

717
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,380
A seizure expands

718
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,380
our differential tenfold.

719
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,110
We got to widen our net,

720
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,110
CT panscan,

721
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,180
MRI brain, sed rate,

722
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,180
autoimmune labs.

723
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,340
Let's rope in neurology.

724
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,340
Guys. Ms. Goodwin

725
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,340
just called.

726
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,980
She said stand down.

727
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,980
No more treatment.

728
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,180
What? What are you

729
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,180
talking about?

730
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,120
She's in the MRI suite.

731
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,120
Be here as soon

732
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,120
as she can, okay?

733
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,760
Hey, you okay?

734
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,760
This is overkill.

735
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,660
I probably just had

736
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,660
some bad oatmeal.

737
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,030
Well, bad oatmeal

738
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,030
doesn't drop you

739
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,030
in the middle of surgery.

740
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,000
So how about

741
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,000
you let me check you out?

742
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,500
How's Sam?

743
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,500
Appendectomy go okay?

744
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,080
Yeah, all good.

745
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,080
Dr. Graham is finishing up.

746
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,740
At least it's just

747
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,740
an appendectomy.

748
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,740
Not missing much.

749
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,140
Argh!

750
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,140
Oh, my chest. Pressure.

751
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,660
Oh, God.

752
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,660
I'm sorry.

753
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,760
That was weird.

754
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,060
Your heart rate plummeted,

755
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,060
but as soon as you

756
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,060
passed gas,

757
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,260
it came back.

758
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,160
Will you

759
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,160
sit up for me?

760
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,560
Take a deep breath.

761
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,140
All right.

762
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,140
Lean back for me.

763
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,140
Hey, Mike.

764
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,740
Let's get an X-ray in here.

765
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,510
What, did you hear

766
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,510
a murmur?

767
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,310
Honestly, I'm not sure

768
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,310
what I heard.

769
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,750
You're joking, right?

770
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,750
Come on.

771
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,280
Has heartburn

772
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,280
been an issue

773
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,280
before today?

774
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,750
I mean, I get it.

775
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,220
Even when I was a kid,

776
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,220
it would flare up

777
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,220
here and there.

778
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,120
But it's never

779
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,120
been an issue.

780
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,250
X-ray up. Clear.

781
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,230
What the hell?

782
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,230
That's my colon.

783
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,830
It shouldn't be in my chest.

784
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,830
No, it should not.

785
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,740
Her brother. Hugo,

786
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,740
was a patient treated

787
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,740
at Oakview.

788
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,070
So was Maria.

789
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,310
She was admitted yesterday

790
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,310
via ambulance,

791
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,470
but this morning,

792
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,470
her family just

793
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,470
walked her out.

794
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,850
They just left... absconded.

795
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,780
Well, her brother died at

796
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,780
Oakview, and they didn't

797
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,780
get any answers.

798
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,320
You see how scared

799
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,320
they are.

800
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,480
It's no wonder

801
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,480
that they didn't

802
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,480
want to stay.

803
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,250
Look, I agree,

804
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,250
but walking out

805
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,620
is the same as leaving

806
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,620
against medical advice.

807
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,390
It's triggered

808
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,390
an insurance nightmare

809
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,390
with the family's HMO.

810
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,630
They won't pay

811
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,630
for any more treatment

812
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:05,500
until Maria is placed back

813
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:05,500
with their preferred network

814
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:05,500
provider, Oakview.

815
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,130
Are you kidding me?

816
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,130
They're a community hospital.

817
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,370
They don't have the resources

818
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,370
to run the tests she needs.

819
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,640
Well, I've already

820
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,640
reached out

821
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,310
to the director

822
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,310
of patient services

823
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,310
at Oakview,

824
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,710
and she assured me

825
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,710
they'll do the best they can.

826
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,450
The best they can?

827
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,150
Ms. Goodwin, can't you reason

828
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,150
with the insurance company?

829
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,520
Hector and Gloria

830
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,520
aren't trying to

831
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,520
take advantage of them.

832
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,290
They're trying

833
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,290
to save their daughter's life.

834
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,520
Look, I know, and I share

835
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,520
in your frustration,

836
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,520
but they're...

837
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,860
No. No, I don't care what

838
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,860
the insurance company says.

839
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,460
I'm not sending Maria

840
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,460
back to Oakview

841
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,460
until I get a guarantee

842
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,830
she gets the treatment

843
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,830
she needs in time.

844
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,560
Dr. Halstead, the tests

845
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,560
that you ordered

846
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,570
will cost tens of thousands

847
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,570
of dollars,

848
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,910
and I know that's not

849
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,910
coming out your pocket.

850
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,300
The family has to decide

851
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,300
how to proceed.

852
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,760
Okay, Quentin, so listen,

853
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,760
we're gonna secure you

854
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,760
to the machine

855
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,190
while it's still running

856
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,190
with a harness.

857
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,290
So then, Dr. Archer,

858
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,290
who is an excellent surgeon,

859
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,830
is gonna come in here

860
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,830
and clamp your arteries

861
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,600
stabilize your neck wound,

862
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,900
and make it safer

863
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,900
when they pull out

864
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,900
the scissors. All right?

865
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,170
Then we turn off

866
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,170
the machine.

867
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,210
The idea is,

868
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,210
bed falls to the side,

869
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,540
you're held firmly in place

870
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,540
by the harness, okay?

871
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,510
Still with me?

872
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,510
Mm-hmm.

873
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,710
Great. Last thing.

874
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,510
Lower you onto a gurney,

875
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,510
shoot you off the ER,

876
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,520
and finish fixing up

877
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,520
your neck.

878
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,380
How's that sound?

879
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,660
Am I gonna die?

880
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,500
Look, this is

881
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,500
a complicated situation.

882
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,770
But some really

883
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,770
skilled people have

884
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,770
come up with this plan,

885
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,740
and it's the best option

886
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,740
we got.

887
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,710
All you got to do,

888
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,710
breathe in and out,

889
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,250
stay as still

890
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,250
as you possibly can, okay?

891
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,750
All right.

892
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,410
Take all the time

893
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,410
you need.

894
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,680
Hey, hold the work.

895
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,680
Everybody, out.

896
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,960
You're my everything.

897
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,590
From our first date,

898
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,590
I knew that I was in love.

899
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,960
And now we're parents.

900
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,740
The nurse took

901
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,740
a picture of him.

902
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,690
I named him Trevor,

903
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,690
after your dad.

904
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,780
I think he'd like that.

905
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,020
Tell Trevor I love him.

906
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,560
You're gonna

907
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,560
tell him yourself.

908
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,590
You're gonna be

909
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,590
a great mother.

910
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,690
I love you, Quentin.

911
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,500
I will see you again,

912
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,500
you hear me?

913
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,900
I will see you again.

914
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,290
Sorry.

915
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,530
I didn't know

916
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,530
what to say.

917
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,320
How do you

918
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,320
put into words when...

919
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,420
You can't.

920
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,730
But we can feel

921
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,730
your love for each other.

922
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,470
I just don't understand,

923
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,470
because Quentin is my rock,

924
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,510
and I don't even recognize

925
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,510
the man that's in there.

926
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,480
He just snapped.

927
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,570
How does that happen

928
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,570
all of a sudden?

929
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,780
I mean, usually

930
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,780
there are signs, you know?

931
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,410
Extreme expressions

932
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,410
of emotional frustration,

933
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,510
anger, confusion, outbursts.

934
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,990
You noticed anything like that

935
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,990
in Quentin recently?

936
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,860
I don't think so.

937
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,860
How about physical changes?

938
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,330
I noticed he had some lumps

939
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,330
on the back of his neck.

940
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,870
Have you...

941
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,870
Do you know what those are?

942
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,870
Lumps? I don't know.

943
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,110
I just wanted

944
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,110
to get to today

945
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,110
and to have the baby.

946
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,430
I've been so consumed

947
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,430
by the pregnancy

948
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,410
that I haven't noticed

949
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,410
anything else.

950
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,610
Oh, Quentin.

951
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,490
Give it to Spellman.

952
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,490
Thanks, Lori.

953
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,490
Mystery solved.

954
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,490
Your chest CT.

955
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,990
Hiatal hernia.

956
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,990
No, diaphragmatic.

957
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,830
Big enough that your colon

958
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,830
migrated into your chest.

959
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,490
So the gas

960
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,490
moving through it,

961
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,870
it puts pressure

962
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,870
on the vagus nerve,

963
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,870
drops your heartbeat.

964
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,730
Breaking wind

965
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,730
releases the pressure.

966
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,430
Heart returns

967
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,430
to a normal rate.

968
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,430
Yeah.

969
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,870
You said you had heartburn

970
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,870
since you were a kid.

971
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,870
Probably this.

972
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,570
Undiagnosed asymptomatic

973
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,570
congenital diaphragmatic

974
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,570
hernia.

975
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,080
I've never

976
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,080
passed out before, though.

977
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,150
Well, my guess is it's been

978
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,150
slowly expanding over time.

979
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,780
But you do CrossFit now,

980
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,120
so the thrusters, burpees,

981
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,120
other workouts...

982
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,720
Safe bet that

983
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,720
they've exacerbated

984
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,720
the condition.

985
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,060
Led to today.

986
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,060
Yeah, well,

987
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,060
I'll own that.

988
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,030
But I can't risk dropping

989
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,030
in the OR again, so let's

990
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,030
fix this hernia.

991
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,830
Okay. Well, you've got

992
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,830
a few surgical options.

993
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,630
Open.

994
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,630
No.

995
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,470
That's a huge incision.

996
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,470
Lots of digging around.

997
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,000
I'll be laid up

998
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,000
in the ICU for weeks.

999
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,510
Laparoscopic, then.

1000
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,580
Be more incisions

1001
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,580
for the scope and tools,

1002
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,770
but less invasive...

1003
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,770
No old-school approaches.

1004
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,780
Robotic assist in OR 2.0.

1005
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,780
Shortest recovery time.

1006
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,980
I just want this

1007
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,980
to be over with.

1008
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,980
Okay.

1009
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm gonna scrub in.

1010
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,520
I'll see you after, okay?

1011
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,600
Holy cow.

1012
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,600
Look at this place.

1013
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,970
It's like you guys are living

1014
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,970
in 2050 up here.

1015
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,000
Listen, don't break

1016
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,000
anything.

1017
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,190
How's it going

1018
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,190
with the surgical tools?

1019
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,100
Almost there.

1020
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,100
Scalpel's printed.

1021
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,940
Two of the three angled

1022
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,940
peripheral vascular clamps

1023
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,940
are printed as well.

1024
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,100
One Weitlaner

1025
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,100
retractor printed.

1026
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,440
One to go.

1027
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,440
Oh, it's like the real thing.

1028
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,880
It is the real thing,

1029
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,880
just plastic.

1030
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,580
These tools,

1031
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,580
I think they can work.

1032
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,780
They'll have to.

1033
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,440
They're all we got.

1034
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,490
They never wanted

1035
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,490
to go to Oakview,

1036
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,190
but the ambulance

1037
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,190
took them there anyway.

1038
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,120
Because Maria

1039
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,120
didn't require

1040
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,120
specialty care,

1041
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,720
paramedics took her to

1042
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,720
the nearest hospital instead.

1043
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,210
I'm so sorry that you've

1044
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,210
been put in this situation.

1045
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,810
We can continue

1046
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,810
to treat Maria,

1047
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,540
but your insurance

1048
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,540
won't cover the costs.

1049
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,000
He said he'll sell the car.

1050
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,000
He can get a second job.

1051
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,860
His oldest son

1052
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,860
can get a job as well.

1053
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,660
No. Papa, no.

1054
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,240
No.

1055
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,100
Regreso. I'll go back.

1056
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,100
No!

1057
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,540
Maria...

1058
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,540
Maria.

1059
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,900
You know,

1060
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,900
maybe Oakview

1061
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,900
will figure it out.

1062
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,540
All right.

1063
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,010
Um, I'll set up the transfer.

1064
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,220
What was Maria saying?

1065
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,730
If she lets her parents

1066
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,730
bankrupt the family

1067
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,630
paying for her medical care,

1068
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,630
then all of the opportunities

1069
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,100
they've worked so hard

1070
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,100
to give their children

1071
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,100
will be lost.

1072
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,700
She is risking her life.

1073
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,700
No.

1074
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,070
No, she's sacrificing it.

1075
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,240
And it's awful,

1076
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,150
but I get it.

1077
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,680
Ready to inflate?

1078
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,130
Up on blue.

1079
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,230
Hold.

1080
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,170
Up on red.

1081
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,370
Hold.

1082
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,750
How's... how's Layla doing?

1083
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,220
She's in shock,

1084
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,220
full of grief,

1085
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,880
and a first-time mom

1086
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,880
all at the same time.

1087
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,880
It's a lot,

1088
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,780
but a psych resident

1089
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,780
is with her.

1090
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,160
And, um, how about you?

1091
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,160
How are you doing?

1092
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,220
Honestly, I didn't

1093
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,220
see this coming.

1094
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,130
I just thought Quentin

1095
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,130
was a nervous

1096
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,130
first-time dad,

1097
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,830
like the ones

1098
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,830
I see every single day.

1099
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,700
Never suspected

1100
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,700
mental illness.

1101
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,840
You know,

1102
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,840
I'm not sure it is, per se.

1103
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,210
You know those lumps

1104
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,210
on the back of his neck?

1105
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,400
I have a very strong hunch

1106
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,400
that they're indicative

1107
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,740
of a physical issue

1108
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,740
that could very well be

1109
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,740
causing a sudden psychosis.

1110
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,740
It's physical,

1111
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,740
not psychological?

1112
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,410
Yeah, I'm leaning

1113
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,410
that way. I mean,

1114
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,380
can't be sure

1115
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,380
until we run some tests.

1116
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,700
Maria, this is

1117
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,700
a thumb drive

1118
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,900
with all the work

1119
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,900
we did here,

1120
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,900
along with our notes.

1121
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,000
You give this to the doctors

1122
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,000
as soon as you get there.

1123
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,310
Thank you.

1124
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,380
All right.

1125
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,380
Empty her foley.

1126
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,850
It's okay, Mama.

1127
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,350
Wait.

1128
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,830
Will?

1129
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,100
You smell that?

1130
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,140
We have to run one more test.

1131
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,940
I'll pay for it myself,

1132
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,940
if I have to.

1133
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,050
I'm scared.

1134
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,020
Well, you'll be less

1135
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,020
frightened if you

1136
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,020
can't see it,

1137
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,760
so I'm gonna drape

1138
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,760
your face, okay?

1139
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,200
Yeah. All right.

1140
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,960
Here we go. Careful.

1141
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,170
That's right. All right.

1142
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,270
All right.

1143
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,400
10cc's of lidocaine, please.

1144
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,770
All right.

1145
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,990
Okay.

1146
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,390
Scalpel.

1147
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,860
All right.

1148
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,860
Grab hold of those scissors.

1149
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,830
I don't want them flopping

1150
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,830
after I make the incisions.

1151
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,770
Here we go.

1152
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,000
Okay.

1153
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,140
All right.

1154
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,870
Wheaties.

1155
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,390
All right.

1156
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,790
All right.

1157
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,790
Watch your fingers there.

1158
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,090
That's it. That's it.

1159
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,090
Don't move it. Don't move it.

1160
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,820
Clamp.

1161
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,160
All right.

1162
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,470
All right.

1163
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,880
Carotid clamps in place.

1164
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,880
CFD, you're up.

1165
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,280
All right.

1166
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,280
Spread out around the bed.

1167
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,320
When it falls down,

1168
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,320
we pull it away

1169
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,320
from the MRI machine.

1170
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,820
All right.

1171
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,820
And no slack at all,

1172
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,820
you understand?

1173
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,120
If there's any movement,

1174
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,120
his clamps could pop off,

1175
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,520
and then we'll have a problem

1176
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,520
we might not be able to fix.

1177
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,960
All right.

1178
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,220
On three, you're gonna

1179
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,220
cut the power to the MRI.

1180
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,460
We ready?

1181
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,460
Everybody, ready?

1182
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,590
Ready.

1183
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,870
One, two, three.

1184
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,840
All right.

1185
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,840
Clamps are holding.

1186
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,480
I'm gonna remove

1187
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,480
the scissors now.

1188
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,410
All right.

1189
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,310
All right, we're clear.

1190
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,310
Okay, bed.

1191
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,320
Let's lower Quentin.

1192
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,250
Lower him slowly.

1193
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,250
One, two, three.

1194
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,990
Slack!

1195
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,370
Okay, ropes are free.

1196
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,440
Incredible, Doc.

1197
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,440
Freaking incredible.

1198
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,530
Thanks. Can someone get me

1199
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,530
a bottle of water, please?

1200
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,950
Dr. Archer, you did it.

1201
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,550
Dean, you all right?

1202
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,550
Yeah. I got to get

1203
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,550
to the OR, so...

1204
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,910
Whoa, whoa,

1205
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,910
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1206
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,540
Page Dr. Lanik to

1207
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,540
take over with Quentin.

1208
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,560
I'm just feeling

1209
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,560
a little dizzy.

1210
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,560
That's all.

1211
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,130
Hernia fixed?

1212
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,930
I'd say you're

1213
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,930
as good as new.

1214
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
Yeah, not quite.

1215
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,570
I'm the fart doctor now.

1216
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,570
A punchline.

1217
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,540
No. What happened today

1218
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,540
was a result

1219
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,080
of a medical ailment, okay?

1220
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,340
Like anyone's gonna

1221
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,340
care about that.

1222
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,140
All they're gonna

1223
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,140
remember is the fart.

1224
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,180
Oh, come on.

1225
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,180
It'll blow over.

1226
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,180
Sorry. Poor choice of words,

1227
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,180
but it will.

1228
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,590
I doubt it.

1229
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,050
All right, look.

1230
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,050
I'll check on you

1231
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,050
a little later, okay?

1232
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,930
So his neck

1233
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,930
is fixed, then?

1234
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,930
Yeah.

1235
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,390
The artery repair

1236
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,390
went very well.

1237
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,660
What about his mind?

1238
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,660
Because before...

1239
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,000
Well, I gave him a very small

1240
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,000
dose of an antipsychotic

1241
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,000
called risperidone,

1242
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,200
and he does seem

1243
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,200
to be thinking more clearly.

1244
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,040
And you think

1245
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,040
he'll stay that way?

1246
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,110
I don't think that

1247
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,110
what happened today is

1248
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,110
the result of mental illness.

1249
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,640
You know,

1250
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,640
tests are still pending,

1251
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,180
but all indications are

1252
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,180
is that Quentin has

1253
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,260
a genetic disease called

1254
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,260
neurofibromatosis type 2.

1255
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,450
Is it curable?

1256
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,450
It's not.

1257
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,090
But there are a lot of

1258
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,090
effective treatments

1259
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,090
out there.

1260
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,560
And the good news is

1261
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,560
that with a little luck,

1262
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,500
Quentin is gonna be

1263
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,500
the man you know again.

1264
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,500
Genetic means

1265
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,500
he's had it forever.

1266
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,590
Why'd it suddenly

1267
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,590
go berserk today?

1268
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,110
NF is thought to be

1269
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,110
an inflammatory

1270
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,110
ailment, right?

1271
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,040
So possibly triggered

1272
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,040
by changes in environment,

1273
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,580
you know, lifestyle,

1274
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,580
possibly diet, medication.

1275
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,210
Diet.

1276
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,510
Oh, my God.

1277
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,650
The minute I got pregnant,

1278
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,650
my hormones went crazy.

1279
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,450
Smells were intense,

1280
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,720
and Quentin's breath

1281
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,720
was the worst.

1282
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,060
Everything he ate

1283
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,060
made me throw up.

1284
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,460
So he gave up his entire diet.

1285
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,200
No more fruits,

1286
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,200
vegetables, fish.

1287
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,430
For the past nine months,

1288
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,430
he's been eating nothing

1289
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,600
but bland,

1290
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,600
processed crap for me.

1291
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,680
Mrs. Bell,

1292
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,680
Quentin's asking to see you.

1293
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,150
Hi, honey.

1294
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,790
Layla...

1295
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,390
I don't entirely understand

1296
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,390
what happened or why,

1297
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,630
but I know I put you

1298
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,630
in danger. I'm sorry.

1299
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,760
No, Quentin.

1300
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,530
I was so tied up

1301
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,530
in the pregnancy,

1302
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,270
I was oblivious

1303
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,270
to what was

1304
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,270
going on with you.

1305
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,100
I should've

1306
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,100
seen the signs.

1307
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,100
Forgive me.

1308
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,780
Oh, honey,

1309
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,780
there's nothing to forgive.

1310
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,170
I love you.

1311
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,780
I love you too.

1312
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,650
Someone's been

1313
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,650
missing you guys.

1314
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,600
Here you go.

1315
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,830
Hi, sweetheart.

1316
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,830
Look who's here.

1317
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,110
Hi.

1318
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,700
I'm your dad.

1319
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,150
I love you.

1320
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,650
Sweetheart.

1321
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,650
Hi.

1322
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,520
A metabolic condition?

1323
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,520
Yeah.

1324
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,520
It's called maple syrup

1325
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,520
urine disease,

1326
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,680
and it's a rare condition

1327
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,680
that makes it difficult

1328
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,230
for the body

1329
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,230
to break down

1330
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,230
certain amino acids.

1331
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,630
The trademark symptom is

1332
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,630
a distinct maple syrup smell

1333
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,260
that shows up in urine.

1334
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,430
It usually presents

1335
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,430
in childhood, and it's

1336
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,430
almost unheard of

1337
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,330
to discover it in

1338
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,330
someone your age,

1339
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,840
or Hugo's.

1340
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,870
It's likely

1341
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,870
that he had it too.

1342
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,770
And I suspect this is

1343
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,770
why Oakview couldn't

1344
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,770
diagnose him in time.

1345
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,850
He didn't have a seizure

1346
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,850
or a foley catheter.

1347
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,480
It made his doctors'

1348
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,480
jobs even harder.

1349
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,320
Wait, this disease

1350
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,320
killed Hugo.

1351
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,110
Does that mean...

1352
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,110
No.

1353
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,810
No, you're gonna be okay.

1354
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,420
You have an intermittent form

1355
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,420
of the disease,

1356
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,360
which can be

1357
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,360
managed by closely

1358
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,360
monitoring protein levels.

1359
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,660
We've already reached out

1360
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,660
to nephrology to discuss

1361
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,660
treatment options.

1362
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,130
Maria.

1363
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,360
Hello, Daniel.

1364
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,360
Ooh!

1365
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,390
Hey, you're, uh...

1366
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,390
You're a little early.

1367
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,590
Oh, I couldn't wait

1368
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,590
to see you.

1369
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,870
What's this?

1370
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,870
You cleaned your office?

1371
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,330
No, I didn't.

1372
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,340
I've been tidying up

1373
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,340
a little bit.

1374
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,160
Why?

1375
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,500
I was very embarrassed

1376
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,500
by what happened

1377
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,500
this morning.

1378
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,280
And, um, you know,

1379
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,280
I just...

1380
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,580
I don't ever want you

1381
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,580
to feel that I...

1382
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,220
I take for granted

1383
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,220
the job that you do, or...

1384
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,820
Or that I'm oblivious

1385
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,820
to how hard you work.

1386
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,190
I really don't want that

1387
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,190
to happen.

1388
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,660
You're very sweet.

1389
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,630
I care about

1390
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,630
you too, Daniel.

1391
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,460
A lot.

1392
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,230
Yeah?

1393
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,230
Mm-hmm.

1394
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,920
Hey.

1395
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,850
Ah. Where'd you find it?

1396
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,850
Nurses' station.

1397
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,420
Oh, makes sense.

1398
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,760
That's where I was when

1399
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,760
the call about Quentin

1400
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,760
came in.

1401
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,450
Yeah, I totally get it.

1402
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,890
I would have run off

1403
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,890
and left it behind too.

1404
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,700
But my kidneys can handle

1405
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,700
some mild dehydration.

1406
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,530
Yours can't.

1407
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,530
Yeah, yeah.

1408
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,970
Yeah, pretty sure

1409
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,970
there will be another

1410
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,970
emergency tomorrow,

1411
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,930
and the day after that,

1412
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,640
so I'm gonna

1413
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,640
give you something.

1414
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,270
It is a tracking device.

1415
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,850
App connects it

1416
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,850
to your phone.

1417
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,850
And I haven't lost my keys

1418
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,850
since I put it on, so...

1419
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,510
Well, keep it.

1420
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,510
I'm past water bottles.

1421
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,910
Nephrologist just left.

1422
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,920
My kidneys

1423
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,920
are getting worse.

1424
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,030
Dialysis?

1425
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,340
That was

1426
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,340
a big win today.

1427
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,880
You saved that family.

1428
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,950
Yeah.

1429
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,710
I suppose it's time

1430
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,710
to talk about my

1431
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,710
DACA renewal.

1432
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,660
I know I've been

1433
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,660
dragging my feet.

1434
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,580
It's been a long day.

1435
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,580
We can speak

1436
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,580
in the morning.

1437
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,790
No. No, I'm ready.

1438
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,420
Yeah? All right.

1439
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,760
Truth is, I've been

1440
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,760
thinking about leaving Med.

1441
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,400
Really?

1442
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,300
I've always been in school

1443
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,300
or protected by

1444
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,300
my residency,

1445
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,810
so my immigration status

1446
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,810
has always been stable.

1447
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,640
But my parents,

1448
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,640
despite them always

1449
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,640
having jobs,

1450
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,050
could never solidify theirs,

1451
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,480
so they moved to Canada.

1452
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,650
Mm.

1453
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,650
But they can't enter

1454
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,650
the country to come visit me.

1455
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,520
And if I leave to go see them,

1456
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,520
I might be denied reentry.

1457
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,360
So...

1458
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,870
I haven't hugged

1459
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,870
my parents

1460
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,870
in a decade.

1461
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,940
That's...

1462
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,940
heartbreaking.

1463
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,640
But Maria today,

1464
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,640
her bravery,

1465
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,880
what she was willing

1466
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,880
to sacrifice for her family,

1467
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,350
reminded me that

1468
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,520
"no one puts their child

1469
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,520
in a boat

1470
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,360
"unless the water

1471
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,360
is safer than

1472
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,360
the land."

1473
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,550
Warsan Shire.

1474
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,090
Oh, that's a beautiful poem.

1475
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,530
So...

1476
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,470
my parents' sacrifice

1477
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,470
to get me here

1478
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,970
put me in this boat,

1479
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,570
which is why I have to stay.

1480
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,450
And Dr. Cuevas,

1481
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:26,640
I believe that you will

1482
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:26,640
find a way

1483
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,650
to see your parents again.

1484
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,730
But until that day,

1485
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,500
know that you have family here

1486
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,500
in us at Med.

1487
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,790
Thank you.
