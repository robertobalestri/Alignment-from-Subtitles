1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,130
My son, 15 years ago,

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,130
I lost him to drugs.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,400
I just don't know where he is.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,980
You have a call from...

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,980
Sean Archer.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,640
An inmate

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,640
at Cook County Jail.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,640
Dad?

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,670
You have

10
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,670
a relationship with

11
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,670
our perfect daughter.

12
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,310
I'm married,

13
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,310
and I love my husband,

14
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,310
and I can't be a part of that.

15
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,040
You all right?

16
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,450
All my clothes,

17
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,450
everything, it's gone.

18
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,650
Jessa Rinaldi,

19
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,650
we're placing you

20
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,650
under arrest.

21
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,520
You're charged

22
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,520
with aggravated arson

23
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,120
and one count

24
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,120
of attempted murder

25
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,120
against Dr. Will Halstead.

26
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,270
Hey, are people

27
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,270
still coming

28
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,270
in and out of here?

29
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,600
Yeah, my contractor

30
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,600
came by last week

31
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,600
to work up an estimate.

32
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,680
You know, he thinks

33
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,680
we can salvage

34
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,680
a lot of this.

35
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,210
Now I'm just waiting

36
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,210
on the frigging insurance

37
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,210
company to approve my claim.

38
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,370
Well, you're in violation

39
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,370
of building code

40
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,320
sections 13-117-12

41
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,320
and 125.

42
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,120
And until such a time

43
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,120
they're remedied,

44
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,690
a fine of $700

45
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,690
will be assessed daily.

46
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,290
Hey, hey, hey.

47
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,060
Can you give me

48
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,060
a break here?

49
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,560
I don't know

50
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,560
what I'm supposed to do.

51
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,430
Hey, if it were up to me,

52
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,430
I'd call in a wrecking ball

53
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,430
and get it over with.

54
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,220
You got old.

55
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,720
Yeah, it's been

56
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,720
a while, so...

57
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,530
Fifteen years.

58
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,260
I wasn't sure

59
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,260
you were coming in.

60
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,700
Well, I would have

61
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,700
come earlier,

62
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,070
but it turns out that

63
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,070
it takes a while to get

64
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,380
granted visitation.

65
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,420
So I was talking

66
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,420
to your lawyer,

67
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,420
a Lisa Bly?

68
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,780
Uh...

69
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,130
From the... The public

70
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,130
defender's office?

71
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,250
Mm-hmm.

72
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,250
She said something

73
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,350
about a plea deal.

74
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,350
Yeah, we talked it over.

75
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,450
She didn't think it was

76
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,450
a good idea to fight this.

77
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,500
Doesn't sound like

78
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,500
she fills you with

79
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,500
confidence, does she?

80
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm gonna get you

81
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,360
a new lawyer,

82
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,340
somebody who knows

83
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,340
what the hell

84
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,340
they're doing.

85
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,500
It's okay.

86
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,500
I'm cool with it.

87
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,570
You're cool with it,

88
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,570
just staying in prison?

89
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,380
That can't possibly be

90
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,380
what you want.

91
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,610
Can we change

92
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,610
the subject, please?

93
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,340
Oh, for Christ's sake!

94
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,440
Sean, you've been like this

95
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,440
since you were a kid.

96
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,280
You're always giving up

97
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,280
on things too easily.

98
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,580
Kind of like how

99
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,580
you gave up on me.

100
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,380
Are you still using?

101
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,320
Hmm?

102
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,730
You know what?

103
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,730
This was not a good idea.

104
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,830
Hey, I'm just trying...

105
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,330
I'm hanging up now, Dad.

106
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,130
We should do this

107
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,130
again sometime,

108
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,130
maybe in another 15 years.

109
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,260
Wait a second.

110
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,260
I'm just trying to...

111
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,310
Seven hundred

112
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,310
dollars a day.

113
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,640
Can you believe that?

114
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,450
It's like I just got

115
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,450
hit by a truck

116
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,540
and they want me

117
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,540
to donate the little bit

118
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,540
of blood I have left.

119
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,320
Maybe you should

120
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,320
just tear it down

121
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,320
like the guy said.

122
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,620
Are you kidding me?

123
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,780
Hannah, I got

124
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,780
way too much invested.

125
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,830
No, screw them.

126
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,830
I'm gonna file an appeal.

127
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,530
It's been, what, like,

128
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,530
a month since the fire?

129
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,270
Yeah, and?

130
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,270
I'm feeling like you're

131
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,700
embracing this modern-day Job

132
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,700
thing a bit too vigorously.

133
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,170
Hey, we could use

134
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,170
the two of you.

135
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,880
So, do you think I'm acting

136
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,880
like some kind of martyr?

137
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,410
I'm just saying that

138
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,410
the sooner you

139
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,410
let this go,

140
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,850
the sooner you can

141
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,850
move on with your life.

142
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,710
Nine-year-old male,

143
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,710
25 mile-per-hour

144
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,710
motor vehicle crash.

145
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,380
Mom and son

146
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,380
both restrained and stable.

147
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,380
No loss of consciousness.

148
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,850
Kid complaining of pain

149
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,850
in right arm.

150
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,690
Mom has no vocal complaints.

151
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,690
She's coming in

152
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,690
right behind us.

153
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,190
I got Mom.

154
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,560
It looks like they might be

155
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,560
living out of their car,

156
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,560
for what it's worth.

157
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,220
Good to know. Thanks.

158
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,790
Hey there.

159
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,790
I'm Dr. Halstead.

160
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,370
Actually, I'm Will.

161
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,960
What's your name?

162
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,960
Uh, Hen... Henry.

163
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,870
Can I ask what

164
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,870
you got in that jar?

165
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,270
It's a chrysalis.

166
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,870
One day, it's gonna

167
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,870
turn into a butterfly.

168
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,840
That is super cool.

169
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,610
Would it be all right

170
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,610
if Nurse Doris here

171
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,610
holds on to it

172
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,280
while I look at your arm?

173
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,380
Thanks.

174
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,350
Let's get X-ray in here.

175
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,350
Yeah.

176
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,250
Now let's look at this arm.

177
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,950
Does it hurt?

178
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,950
Yes.

179
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,750
I know.

180
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,750
I'm sorry, buddy.

181
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,750
Ow.

182
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,420
Okay, that's it.

183
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,690
Anything else hurt?

184
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,600
No.

185
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,600
Good.

186
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,230
Now, do you remember

187
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,230
what happened?

188
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,440
Um, we were looking

189
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,440
for a new parking spot,

190
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,770
and, uh... I don't know,

191
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,280
Mom just kind of

192
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,280
drove off the side

193
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,280
of the road.

194
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,990
Okay. We're gonna

195
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,990
get a quick picture

196
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,990
of your arm, all right?

197
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,810
Hey, you're being

198
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,810
really brave.

199
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,420
All right, X-ray up.

200
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,690
Well, now that doesn't

201
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,690
look too bad.

202
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,030
All right, Henry,

203
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,030
I'm gonna go talk

204
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,030
to your mom for a minute.

205
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,890
I'll be right back.

206
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,890
Here you go.

207
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,000
How are we looking?

208
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,290
X-ray is clear.

209
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,310
Beyond a scrape or two,

210
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,310
I'd say she's doing all right.

211
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,280
Ms. Mitchell,

212
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,280
I'm Dr. Halstead.

213
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,280
I just saw your son.

214
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,000
He's fine,

215
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,000
except for some arm pain.

216
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,370
The X-ray

217
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,370
showed a nondisplaced

218
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,370
distal radius fracture,

219
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
just a fancy way of saying

220
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,040
he broke his arm.

221
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,480
What?

222
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,820
It'll heal quickly

223
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,820
with a simple cast.

224
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,580
I just need

225
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,580
your consent to treat him.

226
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,710
No.

227
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,860
Excuse me?

228
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,860
What have you done

229
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,860
with my boy?

230
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,950
Henry's right next door.

231
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,360
Who are you?

232
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,360
What am I doing here?

233
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,560
Jenny,

234
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,560
you had a car crash.

235
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,560
I don't believe you.

236
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,370
You've been brought

237
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,370
to Chicago Med. I'm Dr. Asher.

238
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,370
This is Dr. Halstead.

239
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,440
You're... You're with

240
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,440
the collection agency,

241
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,440
aren't you?

242
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,370
I told you already.

243
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,370
You can't have our souls.

244
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,500
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

245
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,500
All right.

246
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,740
Give five of Haldol.

247
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,310
Jenny...

248
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,310
Let me out of here!

249
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,610
It's okay, Jenny.

250
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,610
Right now!

251
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,980
Calm down.

252
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,980
Let us help you.

253
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,850
Nobody touches my son!

254
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,580
No.

255
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,960
Hey, can I get everyone's

256
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,960
attention, please?

257
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,500
Thank you.

258
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm sure that

259
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,500
you have all

260
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,500
noticed lately

261
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,980
that we are running low

262
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
on a number

263
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
of key supplies,

264
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,950
dialysis tubing,

265
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,950
contrast dye, syringes.

266
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,350
And I am just as frustrated

267
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,350
as all of you are

268
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,520
at the seemingly intractable

269
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,620
and unpredictable

270
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,620
supply chain disruptions,

271
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,390
but we are working

272
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,390
to find solutions.

273
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,990
Meanwhile, I'd like

274
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,990
to remind you that

275
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,990
we are all in this together.

276
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,730
Be mindful of that,

277
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,730
all right?

278
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,500
Let's all get back to work.

279
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,670
Are you two looking

280
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,670
for a consult?

281
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,650
Yeah, I got a 9-year-old

282
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,650
in Three with a broken arm

283
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,910
whose mom won't give us

284
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,910
consent to treat him.

285
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,580
Her behavior suggests

286
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,580
some kind of

287
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,580
psychiatric disorder.

288
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,380
We were forced

289
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,380
to sedate her.

290
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,520
What did you give her?

291
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,520
She still seems

292
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,520
pretty animated.

293
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,790
Five of Haldol.

294
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,450
Maybe she's

295
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,450
a little resistant to it.

296
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,420
Yeah, at least now

297
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,420
you can go speak with her

298
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,020
and convince her

299
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,020
to let us help her son.

300
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,930
You know, I'd rather wait

301
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,930
for the labs and see

302
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,930
what the tox screen says.

303
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,600
What about the boy?

304
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,970
I'll go talk to him.

305
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,010
Any other family around?

306
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,010
Father, grandfather?

307
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,700
No, none that we could find.

308
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,610
Okay, I'll report back.

309
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,650
Ah, there's a vaguely

310
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,650
familiar face.

311
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,910
You're finally back

312
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,910
from vacation, I see.

313
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,750
You know, for a second there,

314
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,750
I thought we, uh...

315
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,750
We lost you for good.

316
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,830
Hey, I came in early

317
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,830
to get a coffee with you.

318
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,180
You weren't in.

319
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,830
Uh, yeah, I had

320
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,830
to get my oil changed,

321
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,830
but you look well-rested.

322
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,630
No cell service,

323
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,630
no Wi-Fi.

324
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,640
Just surf, sand,

325
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,640
and the stars

326
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,640
for two weeks.

327
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,760
Yeah.

328
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,760
I am, as they say,

329
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,760
totally chill.

330
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,100
Excuse me,

331
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,100
Dr. Archer.

332
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,040
I was wondering if I could

333
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,040
go over this patient with you.

334
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,980
First-year resident,

335
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,980
Dr. Zach Hudgins.

336
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,450
Allow me

337
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,450
to introduce you to

338
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,450
one of your attendings,

339
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,810
Dr. Ethan Choi.

340
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,180
I'm sure Dr. Choi

341
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,180
would be, like,

342
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,180
totally happy to assist.

343
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,980
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

344
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,490
Hi, Zach.

345
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,490
What do we got here?

346
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,620
Fifty-one-year-old male,

347
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,620
progressive cough,

348
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,620
congestion in his chest.

349
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,990
His sats are kind of crappy.

350
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,990
Crappy, you say?

351
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,060
Low 90s, high 80s.

352
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,060
Did you get

353
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,060
a chest X-ray?

354
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,650
That's happening now,

355
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,650
but here's the thing.

356
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,030
The patient

357
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,030
has advanced stage ALS.

358
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,560
Kind of a detail you might

359
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,560
want to lead with, Zach.

360
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,160
What's the patient's name?

361
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,160
Albert. Albert Marrero.

362
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,900
Whoa. Let me see that.

363
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,470
Albert Marrero.

364
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,150
Take a deep breath.

365
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,490
All I have.

366
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,510
Well, I think

367
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,510
you're holding out

368
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,510
on me, Al.

369
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,780
So I understand

370
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,780
you two go back a ways.

371
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,890
Dean, first to diagnose.

372
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,860
It's a little over

373
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,860
six years ago now.

374
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,020
I won that bet,

375
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,020
by the way, Al.

376
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,130
Check's in the mail.

377
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,030
Well, I don't think

378
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,030
you have a pneumonia yet.

379
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,540
Your X-ray is okay,

380
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,540
but these things can lag

381
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,540
by a day or two.

382
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,800
Oh, goody.

383
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,900
But your lungs do sound

384
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,900
a little junky.

385
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,710
You're just not clearing

386
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,710
your secretions adequately.

387
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,920
ALS can weaken

388
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,920
your diaphragm,

389
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,180
and thus, your cough

390
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,180
just isn't strong enough.

391
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,780
Uh, we call it plugging,

392
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,050
but it could be

393
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,050
a little difficult to clear.

394
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,060
Right, which is why

395
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,060
I think it would be prudent

396
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,960
to just run

397
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,960
a bronchoscope down there

398
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,960
and clear it all up.

399
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,290
No muss, no fuss.

400
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,230
Would you need

401
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,230
to put me under?

402
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,070
Light sedation,

403
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,070
so as to make it

404
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,070
easier to intubate.

405
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,930
No.

406
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,240
Al, it would

407
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,240
only be temporary.

408
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,780
It's not as invasive

409
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,780
as it sounds.

410
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,540
I have a DNI.

411
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,840
I don't have control

412
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,540
over what this disease

413
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,540
is doing to my body.

414
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,850
I, at least, want to keep

415
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,850
control over how I die.

416
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,280
Al, look, we're getting way

417
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,280
too ahead of ourselves here.

418
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,650
We're just talking

419
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,650
about clearing some mucus.

420
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,920
Dean, can I talk to you?

421
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,770
Sure.

422
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,770
Excuse us.

423
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,140
Hey, Dean, I think

424
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,140
we can clear the plugging

425
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,830
without bronching him.

426
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,830
Eh, doubtful.

427
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,000
Put the percussion vest

428
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,000
on him, chest BT,

429
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,240
breathing treatments,

430
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,240
just like a CF patient.

431
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,610
Come on.

432
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,610
It's worth a shot.

433
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,870
Yeah.

434
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,050
Huh. Only a two?

435
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,990
It's okay if it hurts

436
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,990
more than that, you know?

437
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,060
Matter of fact,

438
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,060
what I'm hearing is

439
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,060
that the higher the number,

440
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,290
the more likely

441
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,290
the nurses are to

442
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,290
bring you some ice cream

443
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,830
from the cafeteria.

444
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,830
I'm just saying.

445
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,770
My arm really

446
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,770
doesn't hurt that bad.

447
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,860
Okay.

448
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,070
Are you here

449
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,070
to take me away

450
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,070
from my mom?

451
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,710
No, Henry, I'm not.

452
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,900
Why are you, uh...

453
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,900
Why are you

454
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,900
asking me that?

455
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,720
A lot of people have

456
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,720
been talking about that.

457
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,620
What I really want to talk

458
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,620
to you about is this beautiful

459
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,620
chrysalis you have.

460
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,750
How long

461
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,750
have you had it for?

462
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,690
Maybe a month or so.

463
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,130
Your mom get that for you?

464
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,220
Mm.

465
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,640
Has she been

466
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,640
going through a bit

467
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,640
of a tough time recently?

468
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,640
See those markings

469
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,640
at the bottom of the wings?

470
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,180
And that means it's a girl.

471
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,970
No kidding? You know,

472
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,970
I didn't know that.

473
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,180
She might not look

474
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,180
so good now,

475
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,220
but pretty soon,

476
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,220
she's gonna break out

477
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,220
and be beautiful again.

478
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,310
I know it.

479
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,660
I tell you what,

480
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,660
that's one gutsy

481
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,660
little kid in there.

482
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,790
Look, far as I can tell,

483
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,790
his mom started

484
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,790
to act out around,

485
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,920
I don't know,

486
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,920
first of the year.

487
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,140
Psychotic break?

488
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,140
I don't think so.

489
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,170
I mean, bipolar,

490
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,170
schizophrenia,

491
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,000
they just rarely present

492
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,000
this late in life.

493
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,000
Mm.

494
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,240
Tox screens come back yet?

495
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,240
Clear. Nothing

496
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,240
in the blood or urine.

497
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,200
Okay, well,

498
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,200
I want to take a look

499
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,150
and then maybe try and have

500
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,150
a conversation with the mom.

501
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,180
So what about Henry?

502
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,950
His arm is stable, right?

503
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,790
I mean,

504
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,790
not getting any worse.

505
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,790
We got a bit of time.

506
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,950
How long is a bit?

507
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,430
I mean,

508
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,430
this kid needs our attention

509
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,430
in more ways than one.

510
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,060
Mom clearly can't help him.

511
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,060
They're living

512
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,060
out of their car.

513
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I think we should

514
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
double doc his consent

515
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
or get a court order.

516
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,700
In order to do that,

517
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,700
though, Will,

518
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,400
I've got to declare her

519
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,400
incapable of caring

520
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,400
for her child,

521
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,470
which means put her

522
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,470
on a psych hold, which means

523
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,470
getting DCFS involved.

524
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,710
Look, I'm worried

525
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,710
about the kid, too.

526
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,080
I just really want

527
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,080
to make sure we're

528
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,080
right before we go there.

529
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,120
Yeah, of course.

530
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,120
Okay.

531
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,370
Okay.

532
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,920
Maggie? Maggie?

533
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,920
Yeah.

534
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,010
Grant, what are you

535
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,010
doing here?

536
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,110
Is everything okay?

537
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,110
Look.

538
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,880
Keith here had an accident

539
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,880
on the worksite.

540
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,360
They asked us to wait

541
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,360
for an intake nurse,

542
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,260
but I was hoping maybe I had

543
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,260
enough pull to cut the line.

544
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,890
I don't know.

545
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,890
We kind of have

546
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,890
a system here.

547
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,300
Hey, Grant.

548
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,300
What's up?

549
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,060
We've got a bit

550
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,060
of a situation

551
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,060
here, V.

552
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,030
Okay, yeah,

553
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,030
let's take a look.

554
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,330
Room Five is okay,

555
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,330
isn't it?

556
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,000
Sure.

557
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay, come on.

558
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,970
We were doing

559
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,970
some site prep for

560
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,970
a new sports therapy clinic

561
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,940
I designed down

562
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,940
in Hyde Park.

563
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,280
Anyway, the team was clearing

564
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,280
some dead trees, and...

565
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,510
Okay. Okay, how about

566
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,510
I take a look?

567
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,510
Let's see.

568
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,120
Don't touch it, okay?

569
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,520
Let's just

570
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,520
have you chill here

571
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,520
for a second

572
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,920
while we come up

573
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,920
with a game plan.

574
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,490
Thanks, Vanessa, Maggie.

575
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,390
We're gonna need

576
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,390
a CT of this.

577
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,260
Put the order in.

578
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,260
I'll call CAT scan.

579
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,260
Okay.

580
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,960
Dr. Choi!

581
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,260
What's going on?

582
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,260
He's really struggling.

583
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,400
O2 sats 82 and falling.

584
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,400
Nasal cannula.

585
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,300
You can't clear

586
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,300
the mucus.

587
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,300
Don't worry, Al.

588
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,040
We'll get you through this.

589
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,040
Help me

590
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,040
sit him forward.

591
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,440
Now bang on his back.

592
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,970
No, use your fist!

593
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,210
Pound with

594
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,210
your first hard!

595
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,210
Sats at 70s.

596
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,120
I don't want to hurt him.

597
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,120
For Christ's sakes.

598
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,120
Get out of here.

599
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,840
There it is.

600
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,290
I'm not losing this one,

601
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,290
not today.

602
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,900
I know it might not

603
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,900
seem like it

604
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,900
at the moment,

605
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,910
but you, Keith,

606
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,910
are a lucky guy.

607
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,970
Somehow this stick managed

608
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,970
to lodge itself cleanly

609
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,810
along the side of your orbit

610
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,810
without penetrating

611
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,810
your eyeball.

612
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,240
So we can just go ahead

613
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,240
and take it right out.

614
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,370
Right now?

615
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,370
It'll be fine.

616
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,450
Are you sure

617
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,450
you're qualified

618
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,450
to do this?

619
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,920
Well, she finished

620
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,920
top of her class, Keith.

621
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,490
I can give you something

622
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,490
to calm your nerves,

623
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,490
if you'd like.

624
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,250
No, no,

625
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,250
just get it over with.

626
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,420
Okay.

627
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,590
Hold still.

628
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,570
There. All done.

629
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,940
Thank you.

630
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,130
How does it feel?

631
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,540
It still hurts a ton,

632
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,540
but yeah, better than

633
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,540
a second ago.

634
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,480
Yeah, we'll give you

635
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,480
something for the pain.

636
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,850
In the meantime,

637
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,850
if you could just

638
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,850
follow my finger.

639
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,010
Yeah.

640
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,950
Did you just see that,

641
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,950
how steady her hand is

642
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,950
and how confident?

643
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,050
I know.

644
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
It's like we created

645
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
some kind of Jedi Knight.

646
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,890
I'm honestly

647
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,890
just blown away.

648
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,990
She's your

649
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,990
spitting image, Maggie.

650
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,990
It's crazy how that works.

651
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,000
Any word yet

652
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,000
from Ophthalmology?

653
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,270
They're swamped.

654
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,270
They say they'll be

655
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,270
down this afternoon.

656
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,040
I really don't want

657
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,040
to discharge Keith

658
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,040
until they see him.

659
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,080
If you've got to get back

660
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,080
to work, I can call you

661
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,080
when we're done here.

662
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,050
No, Keith's worked for me

663
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,050
for, like, 15 years.

664
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,010
I'm staying until

665
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,010
he's cleared to go.

666
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,950
But maybe we can

667
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,950
all have lunch together.

668
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,580
Yeah, that's

669
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,580
a great idea.

670
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,150
Uh, I don't know.

671
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,150
I don't think

672
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,150
I can get away.

673
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,420
Oh, come on, Maggie.

674
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,420
It'll be fun.

675
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,460
I'm sorry. Crockett, Kai,

676
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,460
we have incoming.

677
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,250
Please, Maggie.

678
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,250
Could you just for me?

679
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,360
Okay, but not for

680
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,360
another hour.

681
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,530
Let's go!

682
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,430
We're going to Baghdad.

683
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,430
What do we got?

684
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,440
Julián Sanchez, GSW.

685
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,470
Two holes, left thigh,

686
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,470
maybe through and through.

687
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,940
Moderate blood loss

688
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,940
in the field.

689
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,140
Put a pressure dressing on it,

690
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,140
but not actively bleeding now.

691
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,470
Dropped his pressure

692
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,470
in the ambo.

693
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,170
Gave him a liter of fluid.

694
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,170
BP now 100 with

695
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,170
a heart rate of 125.

696
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,910
Okay, Julián,

697
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,910
I'm Dr. Marcel.

698
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,450
We're gonna take

699
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,450
good care of you, okay?

700
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,450
Hang in there, bud.

701
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,460
Okay, everyone.

702
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,460
Nice and easy...

703
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,460
On my count.

704
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,690
One, two, three.

705
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,920
Easy, easy.

706
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,390
Let's get him up

707
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,390
on monitors.

708
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,990
Okay, DP and PT pulse

709
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,990
has diminished.

710
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,530
Let's strip and flip him,

711
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,530
make sure there's

712
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,530
no other holes.

713
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,260
Okay, here we go.

714
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,100
One, two, three.

715
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,100
Easy, easy.

716
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,710
Just two in the thigh.

717
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,710
No active bleeding.

718
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,500
Okay, let's have X-ray

719
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,500
get us a quick chest

720
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,500
and pelvis, okay?

721
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,410
Why do we need a chest X-ray?

722
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,410
He was only shot in the leg.

723
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,210
One whole bullet in,

724
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,210
one whole bullet out.

725
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,410
Make sure they connect.

726
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,410
He was shot twice.

727
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,580
Bullets travel

728
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,580
in unexpected ways, right?

729
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,150
How would you feel

730
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,150
if you left a bullet

731
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,150
in his chest?

732
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,490
X-ray is ready.

733
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,490
Okay, you know what?

734
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,490
Why don't you go tell Maggie

735
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,490
that we're gonna need an angio

736
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,430
to find where the injury

737
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,430
to the artery is.

738
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,430
I'll finish up here.

739
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,030
Jenny? How are you doing?

740
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,030
I'm Dr. Charles.

741
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,240
They sent you in here

742
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,240
to get my consent,

743
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,240
didn't they?

744
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,310
Who's "they"?

745
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,310
The other ones pretending

746
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,310
to be doctors.

747
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,310
That redheaded one

748
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,310
tried to convince me

749
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,310
my son had a broken arm.

750
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,520
You know,

751
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,520
Dr. Halstead is,

752
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,520
in fact, a doctor.

753
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,720
And, you know, Jenny,

754
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,720
he wasn't lying. I mean,

755
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,720
I can show you the X-ray.

756
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,520
You think I can't tell

757
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,520
a fake?

758
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,520
I want to see

759
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,520
your supervisor,

760
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,520
or I swear, I...

761
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,360
Jenny?

762
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,240
You all right?

763
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,240
What's going on?

764
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,480
Who are you again?

765
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,210
I'm Dr. Charles,

766
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,150
and we were just talking

767
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,150
about Henry,

768
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,150
about your son.

769
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,240
I already told you.

770
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,290
I'm not giving anyone

771
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,290
permission to treat my son.

772
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,020
Well, you know what?

773
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,650
I'm actually, um...

774
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,030
I'd like to get

775
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,030
your permission

776
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,030
to treat you, if that's okay.

777
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,360
Me?

778
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,370
There's nothing

779
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,370
wrong with me.

780
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,300
But unfortunately,

781
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,300
we can't release

782
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,300
you or Henry

783
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,810
before we rule out

784
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,810
any trauma

785
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,810
from the car crash.

786
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,540
So if it's okay,

787
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,630
I'd just like to send you

788
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,630
upstairs for a quick scan.

789
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,440
And as soon as that's done,

790
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,440
I'm free to go?

791
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,210
I tell you what,

792
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,210
how about we do the scan

793
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,720
and see what it tells us

794
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,720
and then go from there?

795
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,620
Does that sound like

796
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,620
a plan?

797
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,160
Okay.

798
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,200
Did you get her consent?

799
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,830
Not exactly.

800
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,500
Um, I want to send her

801
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,500
upstairs for a head CT

802
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,500
with contrast.

803
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,330
And also, can you

804
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,330
tell Sam I want

805
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,330
his eyes on this, too?

806
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,430
Roger.

807
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,330
So what's going on?

808
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,210
You know, it just doesn't

809
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,210
seem like a garden-variety

810
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,210
psychosis, you know?

811
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,470
There's this odd

812
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,470
rhythm to it.

813
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,270
And she had

814
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,270
this temporary loss

815
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,270
of mentation,

816
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,580
and I really think

817
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,580
we could be looking

818
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,580
at something neurosurgical.

819
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,810
Let me guess.

820
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,810
Henry's broken arm

821
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,810
has to wait?

822
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,180
Well, just bear

823
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,180
with me, buddy.

824
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,810
Let's take a look at

825
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,810
this scan, and I think

826
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,810
we're gonna get some clarity.

827
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,590
We can continue riding out

828
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,590
the percussion vest

829
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,590
and nebs.

830
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,090
With a little more time,

831
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,090
there's a chance

832
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,090
it could work.

833
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,390
But not

834
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,390
a good enough chance.

835
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,860
The only way to clear

836
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,860
the plugging for sure

837
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,690
and restore your breathing

838
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,690
is with a bronchoscope.

839
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,870
No intubation.

840
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,770
I think we've

841
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,770
established by now, Al,

842
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,770
that I'm no alarmist,

843
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,110
so believe me

844
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,110
when I say this.

845
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,280
This thing

846
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,280
will kill you today,

847
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,280
right here in this room.

848
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,760
If it does,

849
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,760
I'm okay. I'm ready.

850
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
Really?

851
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
Just like that? Really?

852
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,630
You can honestly tell me

853
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,630
that you've got nothing

854
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,630
left to live for?

855
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,600
Your son, how's he doing?

856
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,470
Wife's pregnant again.

857
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,240
My second grandchild.

858
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,710
See? That's something

859
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,710
to look forward to,

860
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,710
isn't it?

861
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,350
It's my biggest fear, Dean,

862
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,320
being stuck helpless

863
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,320
on a vent.

864
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,390
I promise you, Al.

865
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,830
I will not

866
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,830
let that happen.

867
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,400
Hey, what's going on here?

868
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,400
Why isn't my patient

869
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,400
prepped for angio?

870
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,640
You're not gonna

871
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,640
believe this.

872
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,910
Apparently,

873
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,910
they can't find

874
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,910
any contrast dye.

875
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,450
Are you kidding me?

876
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,490
We need to look at

877
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,490
the femoral artery.

878
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,490
His AVIs are at 0.7.

879
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,530
Hey, man,

880
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,530
it's not my fault.

881
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,530
Talk to this guy.

882
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,930
All right,

883
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,930
keep an eye on his vitals.

884
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,930
I'll see if radiology has any.

885
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,800
You lucked out.

886
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,800
This is literally the

887
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,800
last drop of contrast we got.

888
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,200
You're kidding.

889
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,400
Blame COVID or the war

890
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,400
in Ukraine. I don't know.

891
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,670
She had no response

892
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,670
to the Haldol?

893
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,980
Nada, and these

894
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,980
weird lapses

895
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,980
in awareness.

896
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,880
And as you know,

897
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,880
resistance to antipsychotics

898
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,880
can sometimes mean...

899
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,960
Something's going on with

900
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,960
her neurotransmitters.

901
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,960
Yeah.

902
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,880
Hey, Gene?

903
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,880
Yeah?

904
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,980
I was told you might have

905
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,980
some contrast dye left.

906
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,490
Not after the scan,

907
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,490
I don't.

908
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,720
No, no, no, no.

909
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,720
Stop, stop.

910
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,720
I need that dye.

911
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,300
I honestly don't even know

912
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,300
why we're having

913
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,300
this conversation.

914
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,440
This is triage 101,

915
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,440
head over leg.

916
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,550
With all due respect, Sam,

917
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,550
perhaps it's not so cut

918
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,550
and dry in this case.

919
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,910
What happens, Dr. Marcel,

920
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,820
if you're not able

921
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,820
to perform your angiogram?

922
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,290
Well, I'll probably

923
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,290
have to filet

924
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,290
the poor guy's thigh open

925
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,910
in order to find

926
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,910
and fix the damage.

927
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,460
It'll be a much bigger

928
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,460
surgery with more blood loss

929
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,460
and a greater risk.

930
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,260
Dr. Charles?

931
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,420
You know, truthfully,

932
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,420
I'm not completely

933
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,420
comfortable

934
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,830
making the case that

935
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,830
our patient is of any greater

936
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,830
need than Dr. Marcel's.

937
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,730
Well, I am.

938
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,730
Look, Sharon,

939
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,460
if I'm being asked

940
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,460
to follow the breadcrumbs

941
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,470
of Ms. Mitchell's

942
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,470
symptomology,

943
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,630
I'm suspecting

944
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,630
she might have

945
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,630
an astrocytoma

946
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,680
or maybe a leaking aneurysm.

947
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,640
Now, there's no way of knowing

948
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,640
for certain, however,

949
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,540
without a CT with contrast.

950
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,810
But I can assure you,

951
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,810
if those are

952
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,810
the possibilities,

953
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,040
without intervention,

954
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,040
her outcome is gonna be

955
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,820
a whole lot worse

956
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,820
than a limp for

957
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,820
a few months.

958
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,980
I'm sorry,

959
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,980
but that sounds

960
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,980
so nebulous.

961
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,490
I mean,

962
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,490
we know precisely

963
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,020
what we have to lose or gain

964
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,020
with our patient.

965
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,830
You're just on

966
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,830
a fishing expedition.

967
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,920
Who's this guy?

968
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,920
Kai Tanaka-Reed.

969
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,300
First-year surgical resident.

970
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,300
It's a pleasure to meet you.

971
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,390
You're an intern, Kai.

972
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,390
Learn not to speak

973
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,390
unless spoken to.

974
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,340
Okay, can't we just

975
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,340
dilute the dye enough

976
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,340
for two procedures?

977
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,850
We could, but we risk

978
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,850
the chance of neither scan

979
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,850
being adequate.

980
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,950
Look, there's no ideal

981
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,950
option here, but for now,

982
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,950
head over leg.

983
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,850
The hospital

984
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,850
is going to prioritize

985
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,580
the CT scan

986
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,580
for Ms. Mitchell.

987
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,520
Once again, Sharon,

988
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,520
you've proven yourself

989
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,520
wise beyond your years.

990
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,390
I'll see you

991
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,390
up in Radiology.

992
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,900
Well, this sucks.

993
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,900
It is what it is.

994
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,590
Have Maggie prep an OR.

995
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,560
Where are we?

996
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,560
Just getting the RSI drugs.

997
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,930
All right. Let's tube him.

998
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,870
Yes, sirree.

999
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,870
Let's, uh...

1000
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,870
Let's do that.

1001
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,490
You all right?

1002
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,490
Your hands look

1003
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,490
a bit shaky.

1004
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,450
Just feel like

1005
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,450
I'm auditioning here.

1006
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,730
That's not the trachea.

1007
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,700
Neither is that.

1008
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,900
What's taking so long?

1009
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,900
Zach is having

1010
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,900
a little difficulty.

1011
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,670
It's just not lining up

1012
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,670
for some reason.

1013
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,470
What's the matter?

1014
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,470
You've never done

1015
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,470
one of these before?

1016
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,970
No, I haven't.

1017
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,510
Are you kidding?

1018
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,510
My med school

1019
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,510
all but shut down

1020
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,510
during the pandemic.

1021
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,010
Said it was too big

1022
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,010
a liability to have us

1023
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,010
interact with patients,

1024
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,410
so we did everything online,

1025
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,410
but I'm a fast learner.

1026
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,610
Yeah, I don't have time

1027
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,610
for handholding.

1028
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,850
I'll do it myself.

1029
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,850
Get out of the way.

1030
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,950
No, I'm gonna need

1031
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,950
to use a GlideScope.

1032
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,550
Keep bagging him

1033
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,550
until I get back.

1034
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,530
Bag him! Bag, go!

1035
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,670
These kids,

1036
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,670
I swear.

1037
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,670
Yeah.

1038
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,530
Hey, before

1039
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,530
you get started,

1040
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,930
I wanted to tell you about

1041
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,930
a book I picked up

1042
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,930
on the beach.

1043
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,440
It's about a death doula.

1044
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,100
Nancy, where'd that

1045
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,100
GlideScope blade go?

1046
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,800
It's over there

1047
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,800
in the cabinet.

1048
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,170
It's all about helping

1049
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,170
people transition

1050
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,000
from one plane of

1051
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,000
existence to the next.

1052
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,000
Uh-huh.

1053
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,980
I'm wondering

1054
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,980
if we're doing that with Al.

1055
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,610
What?

1056
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,080
Honoring his journey.

1057
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,750
You want to translate that

1058
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,750
into English for me?

1059
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,420
I don't think we should

1060
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,420
be doing this bronchoscopy.

1061
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,590
Wait, you don't think

1062
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,590
we should be doing everything

1063
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,590
we can to keep him alive?

1064
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,060
Not if he doesn't

1065
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,060
want us to.

1066
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,870
So what, you catch

1067
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,870
a few juicy waves,

1068
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,090
and all of a sudden,

1069
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,090
you're preaching

1070
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,090
palliative care now?

1071
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,600
Maybe.

1072
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,600
When it's appropriate.

1073
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,640
This is an ED, Ethan.

1074
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,640
We save lives here.

1075
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,940
We don't end them,

1076
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,940
at least not on purpose.

1077
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,670
Maybe you should have

1078
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,670
stayed on that beach.

1079
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,190
Mm-mm! Don't change a thing,

1080
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,190
'cause you look fine

1081
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,190
as you is.

1082
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
Ben,

1083
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
what are you doing here?

1084
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
You remember?

1085
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,230
My biannual to check

1086
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,230
my blood markers.

1087
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,560
Right.

1088
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,560
Yeah.

1089
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,070
I was supposed

1090
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,070
to get in and out,

1091
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,900
but they said something

1092
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,900
about a shortage on syringes.

1093
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,940
Can't get to me till later

1094
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,940
this afternoon.

1095
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,940
Oh.

1096
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,080
But the good news is

1097
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,080
that I am free for lunch.

1098
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,070
You want to grab

1099
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,070
a sandwich?

1100
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,070
Mm-hmm.

1101
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,120
You know what, I am tired

1102
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,120
of the same old, same old.

1103
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,890
There is

1104
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,890
a food truck out there

1105
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,890
that I'd like to try.

1106
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,020
Okay.

1107
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,160
Where's my angio patient?

1108
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,280
Are we all good?

1109
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,010
Okay, let's do a run.

1110
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,510
What's going on here?

1111
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,510
Trying to get

1112
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,510
an angio done.

1113
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,110
I thought we already

1114
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,110
established we can't

1115
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,110
do that without contrast.

1116
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,190
I found a workaround

1117
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,190
using CO2 instead.

1118
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,850
CO2?

1119
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,850
It works a lot like

1120
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,850
a contrast.

1121
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,790
Yes, I'm aware,

1122
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,790
but it's 10 times

1123
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,790
as dangerous.

1124
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,660
If a gas bubble

1125
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,660
finds its way

1126
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,660
up to his heart...

1127
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,960
We're injecting into

1128
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,960
the arterial system,

1129
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,960
Crockett, below the diaphragm.

1130
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,730
We're all good.

1131
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,900
Hold on.

1132
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,900
CO2 has been delivered.

1133
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,600
Look, right there.

1134
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,600
That's the injury.

1135
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,800
Should we stent

1136
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,800
or go in open?

1137
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,310
Damn it, drop the head.

1138
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,770
Sats are plummeting

1139
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,770
here, guys.

1140
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,940
Eighty and falling.

1141
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,940
What's going on?

1142
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,280
Vapor lock.

1143
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,280
Move the C-arm.

1144
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,280
Move it. Move it.

1145
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,740
A gas bubble is occluding

1146
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,740
the venous return

1147
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,050
to the heart.

1148
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,050
But that's impossible.

1149
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,810
Well, clearly not.

1150
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,810
Now down to 79.

1151
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,010
He's getting super tachy.

1152
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,280
Let's wire a catheter

1153
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,280
up to his heart.

1154
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,120
No, no time.

1155
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,120
We have to change

1156
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,120
his position,

1157
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,720
see if we can get the blood

1158
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,720
past the bubble,

1159
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,190
hope the CO2 reabsorbs.

1160
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,060
Put your hand on his back.

1161
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,060
Give him a couple of pats.

1162
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,570
Right there.

1163
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,930
That's it.

1164
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,260
Come on, Julián.

1165
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,030
Come on, Julián.

1166
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,030
Stay with me.

1167
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,340
Sats are back up.

1168
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,340
91 and climbing.

1169
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,140
Vapor lock cleared.

1170
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,280
Oh, man.

1171
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,240
You're lucky

1172
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,240
that didn't kill him.

1173
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,810
Let's set up to open.

1174
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,290
I don't get it, Crockett.

1175
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,120
How the hell did that bubble

1176
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,120
find its way to his heart?

1177
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,690
We'll find out,

1178
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,690
but it's Dr. Marcel.

1179
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,060
I'm not sure I'm reading

1180
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,060
this right, but her scan

1181
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,060
looks completely clear.

1182
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,700
Yeah, it's a surprise

1183
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,700
to me, too. I was convinced

1184
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,700
we'd find something.

1185
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,330
I'm so seldom wrong.

1186
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,940
Where is my son?

1187
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,940
Where is he?

1188
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,040
Jenny, Jenny.

1189
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,040
Come on.

1190
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,140
We're gonna

1191
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,140
get out of here.

1192
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,140
Jenny.

1193
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,880
Henry has a broken arm.

1194
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,880
Your son has

1195
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,880
a broken arm, Jenny.

1196
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,320
We need some help here!

1197
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,320
Jenny, listen...

1198
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,750
You said if I agreed

1199
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,750
to that test, I'd be done.

1200
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,980
I am tired of waiting.

1201
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,280
You've got to let us

1202
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,280
take care of your son.

1203
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,880
Four of Versed IM.

1204
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,880
Please!

1205
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,720
Listen to the doctors!

1206
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,720
Security!

1207
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,950
Just do as I say.

1208
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,360
Mom! My chrysalis!

1209
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,660
For God's sake.

1210
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,660
Whoa, whoa.

1211
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,790
Jenny, careful, careful.

1212
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,960
Watch it.

1213
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,370
Hurry up.

1214
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,370
No, let go of me!

1215
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,730
Let's put you

1216
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,730
back in the bed, bud.

1217
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,830
It's okay.

1218
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,830
She's okay. You're okay.

1219
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,170
No!

1220
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,170
It'll be okay.

1221
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,300
No, no, no.

1222
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,350
Are you finally gonna

1223
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,350
give me my court order?

1224
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,020
So DCFS will take

1225
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,020
temporary custody of the boy

1226
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,750
until the mother's

1227
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,750
deemed ready to resume

1228
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,160
her parental

1229
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,160
responsibilities.

1230
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,850
How long do you plan

1231
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,850
to hold her for?

1232
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,760
Seventy-two hours, for now.

1233
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,890
Well, we'll just take it

1234
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,890
day by day then.

1235
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,070
Dr. Asher, let's get her

1236
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,070
prepped for

1237
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,070
transfer upstairs.

1238
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,110
Okay, Henry, we are ready

1239
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,110
to put a cast on that arm.

1240
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,210
Really important question.

1241
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,210
What color would you like?

1242
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,310
We can do green,

1243
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,310
purple, blue.

1244
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,350
Blue, I guess.

1245
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,350
Blue coming right up.

1246
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,390
Where did those people

1247
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,390
take my mom?

1248
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,360
So your mom is gonna be

1249
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,360
resting here in the hospital

1250
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,730
for a little while,

1251
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,730
but when we're finished here,

1252
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,070
this nice woman

1253
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,070
is gonna find you

1254
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,070
a cozy place to sleep tonight.

1255
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,460
How does that sound?

1256
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,070
Hi, Henry.

1257
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,070
My name is Madeline.

1258
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,980
You know, we can put that

1259
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,980
in a specimen cup,

1260
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,980
if you like.

1261
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,370
I promise to keep it safe.

1262
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,740
Chest X-ray looks better.

1263
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,010
Airway pressures are down.

1264
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,010
It looks like the bronch

1265
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,010
did the trick.

1266
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,420
Just like

1267
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,420
we should have done

1268
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,420
from the beginning.

1269
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,750
Uh, let's lighten

1270
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,750
his sedation.

1271
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,290
Come grab me

1272
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,290
when he's ready to

1273
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,290
have the tube taken out.

1274
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,860
You got it.

1275
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,530
Hey, Maggie.

1276
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,530
Oh, hey.

1277
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,800
Hey, sorry about lunch.

1278
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,800
I just couldn't pull away.

1279
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,490
Yeah, I saw you

1280
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,490
and Ben head out.

1281
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,030
Looked like you were trying

1282
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,030
to keep him and Grant apart.

1283
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,160
That's 'cause I was.

1284
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,310
I haven't told Ben

1285
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,310
about Grant yet.

1286
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,800
Oh.

1287
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,910
I feel bad

1288
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,910
for pressuring you

1289
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,910
to join us earlier.

1290
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,410
It wasn't

1291
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,410
very sensitive of me.

1292
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,780
Look, I really don't want

1293
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,780
to make anything strained

1294
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,940
between you and Ben.

1295
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,320
It's not your fault.

1296
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,320
It's just something

1297
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,320
I have to deal with.

1298
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,020
Okay,

1299
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,020
let's see how bad

1300
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,020
the damage is.

1301
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,020
Oh. Clamps.

1302
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,020
Oh, man.

1303
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,360
Suction.

1304
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,370
Okay.

1305
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,940
Yep, here's how the bubble

1306
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,940
got to his heart.

1307
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,520
A fistula.

1308
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,520
What? Where?

1309
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,350
Do you see the mix

1310
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,350
of dark and bright red blood?

1311
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,320
So the bullet hit

1312
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,320
both the artery

1313
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,320
and the vein

1314
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,390
when it went between them,

1315
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,390
fusing them together.

1316
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,220
Look. You see that?

1317
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,350
That's how the CO2

1318
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,350
got up there so fast.

1319
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,450
Yeah, like a superhighway

1320
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,450
straight to the heart.

1321
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,960
Well, nobody

1322
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,960
could have foreseen that.

1323
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,590
So the delusions,

1324
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,590
the volatile mood swings.

1325
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,170
We could be looking

1326
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,170
at some kind of atypical

1327
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,170
bipolar disorder.

1328
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,970
I mean, at this point,

1329
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,970
it very well could be.

1330
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,010
We could start her

1331
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,010
on a course

1332
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,010
of olanzapine

1333
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,130
and see how

1334
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,130
she responds.

1335
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,440
You're moving her upstairs?

1336
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,440
Yeah.

1337
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,020
Nellie, we might as well

1338
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,020
get that going.

1339
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,020
Okay.

1340
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,250
Hey, listen, I pulled the tape

1341
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,250
from when Jenny

1342
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,250
had that episode.

1343
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,910
You see how everything

1344
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,910
just kind of falls off

1345
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,910
off the ledge here,

1346
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,960
her heart rate sats,

1347
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,960
her BP?

1348
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,990
Whatever's happening

1349
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,990
with her just has to be

1350
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,990
physiological, right?

1351
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,560
It's what I've been saying

1352
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,560
all along, but, you know,

1353
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,560
the scan came back clean.

1354
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,860
Well, we took this X-ray

1355
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,860
of her chest upon intake.

1356
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,600
And you see

1357
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,600
this area of haziness

1358
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,600
around her mediastinum?

1359
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,270
Is it just me,

1360
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,270
or does that appear

1361
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,270
to be abnormally wide?

1362
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,270
It's definitely wide.

1363
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,270
And there's

1364
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,270
no certain way

1365
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,100
to tell without

1366
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,100
more detail, but...

1367
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,340
Often caused by a tumor.

1368
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,000
And that can trigger

1369
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,000
an autoimmune response

1370
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,010
in the brain, right,

1371
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,010
like psychosis?

1372
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,410
Absolutely, and would

1373
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,410
completely explain

1374
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,410
these weird...

1375
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,280
These dropouts

1376
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,280
she's been having.

1377
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,380
Hey, Dr. Cuevas,

1378
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,380
could we hold off

1379
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,380
on that transfer, please?

1380
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,890
Dr. Asher, nice work.

1381
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,460
Ophtho cleared you

1382
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,460
to go home.

1383
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,160
I made you a follow-up

1384
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,160
appointment a week from now,

1385
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,160
but from what she says,

1386
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,430
you shouldn't have

1387
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,430
any long-term issues

1388
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,430
with your vision.

1389
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,090
The patch stays on,

1390
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,090
though, for now.

1391
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,900
Thank you, Dr. Taylor.

1392
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,900
Yeah.

1393
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,600
Okay, let's go over

1394
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,600
your at-home

1395
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,600
and care instructions.

1396
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,370
Excuse me.

1397
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,370
Yeah.

1398
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,950
Hey.

1399
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,480
I wanted to thank you again

1400
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,480
for helping Keith out here.

1401
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,480
This is an ED, Grant.

1402
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,480
We would have done that

1403
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,480
for anybody.

1404
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,080
Still, I just wanted

1405
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,080
to let you know

1406
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,080
how much I appreciate it.

1407
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,220
The world works

1408
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,220
in funny ways,

1409
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,220
doesn't it?

1410
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,300
You know, I really got

1411
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,300
a lot of work to get done

1412
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,370
before my shift ends, so...

1413
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,940
Hey, Grant.

1414
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,940
We're a little understaffed.

1415
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,340
Do you mind helping out

1416
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,340
and wheeling out Keith

1417
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,340
for me?

1418
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,960
That's okay.

1419
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,960
I can walk.

1420
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,300
Hospital policy, sorry.

1421
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,300
No worries.

1422
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,040
I got it, Taylor.

1423
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,040
Thanks.

1424
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,040
All right,

1425
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,040
let's get you home.

1426
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,670
Excuse me.

1427
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,670
Please, after you.

1428
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,470
Vanessa.

1429
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,180
So I'm finally done.

1430
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,180
Should I stick around

1431
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,180
and give you a ride?

1432
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,420
Sure. Thanks, babe.

1433
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,290
Al, can you hear me?

1434
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,460
Okay.

1435
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,300
Okay, we're gonna

1436
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,300
take this tube out now

1437
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,370
by putting you

1438
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,370
on a spontaneous

1439
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,370
breathing trial.

1440
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,310
So I want you to give me

1441
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,310
some slow, deep breaths.

1442
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,510
All right?

1443
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,010
Okay, that's right.

1444
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,010
Slow and deep.

1445
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,680
Slow and deep.

1446
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,680
Don't chase after it.

1447
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,680
The air will come.

1448
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,220
Just slow and deep.

1449
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,990
That's right.

1450
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,250
What's his RSBI reading?

1451
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,250
130.

1452
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,330
Are you sure you're

1453
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,330
reading that right?

1454
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,020
The vent says so,

1455
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,020
and I calculated it as well.

1456
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,260
Okay. Okay.

1457
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,200
Hey, maybe

1458
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,200
we should stop.

1459
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,200
No, no, no, no, he can...

1460
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,740
He'll get there.

1461
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,640
All right.

1462
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,680
Let's put him on a rate.

1463
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,680
We'll resedate him.

1464
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,020
I'm sorry, Al.

1465
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,280
It's too soon

1466
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,280
to take you off.

1467
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,650
So we're gonna take

1468
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,650
a couple of steps back,

1469
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,250
and we'll try again

1470
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,250
a little later, okay?

1471
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,450
Please don't, Al. Al.

1472
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,650
No, no, no, no,

1473
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,650
Al. Al, don't.

1474
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,190
Get self-restraints, please.

1475
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,190
Al, stop.

1476
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,630
Put him back on Precedex.

1477
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,030
I'm sorry, Al, we're gonna

1478
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,030
have to resedate you

1479
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,030
to ease your discomfort.

1480
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,470
I'm gonna get you

1481
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,470
off this thing.

1482
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,470
I promise.

1483
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,180
So am I gonna

1484
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,180
be able to walk?

1485
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,420
Walk, run,

1486
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,420
jump, whatever.

1487
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,090
When the ambo

1488
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,090
was bringing me in,

1489
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,100
I didn't think

1490
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,100
I was gonna make it.

1491
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,390
Thank you, Dr. Marcel.

1492
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,760
Let's not have to do

1493
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,760
this again, all right?

1494
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,390
Thank you so much.

1495
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,370
You bet.

1496
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,750
So this is

1497
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,750
how it's gonna be?

1498
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,440
How what's gonna be?

1499
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,350
You taking credit

1500
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,350
for everything.

1501
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,440
I was just as responsible

1502
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,440
as you for saving that

1503
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,440
guy's life, maybe more so.

1504
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,380
Really? After that stunt

1505
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,380
you pulled?

1506
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,690
That stunt pointed us

1507
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,690
directly to the problem

1508
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,690
and saved his leg.

1509
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,550
All day long,

1510
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,550
you've been

1511
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,550
talking down to me.

1512
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,260
I was right about

1513
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,260
the bullet holes.

1514
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,590
You never gave me props

1515
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,590
for that.

1516
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,400
And then you left it to me

1517
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,400
to duke it out with Abrams

1518
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,590
over the contrast dye.

1519
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,860
You can't be serious

1520
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,860
right now.

1521
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,330
All I'm asking for is

1522
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,330
credit where credit's due.

1523
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,140
It's not that big a deal.

1524
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,580
You're right.

1525
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,580
I should have

1526
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,580
given you credit.

1527
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,250
I was very impressed

1528
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,480
with the way

1529
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,480
you nearly killed

1530
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,480
our patient.

1531
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,400
Did I tell you lately

1532
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,400
how much I love you?

1533
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,680
Ben, I need to

1534
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,680
tell you something.

1535
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,780
I know. I know,

1536
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,780
you don't really

1537
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,780
want to go bowling.

1538
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,910
No.

1539
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,910
I can tell.

1540
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,750
You were

1541
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,750
a little lukewarm.

1542
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,750
No, it's not about that.

1543
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,900
About a month or so ago,

1544
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,900
I helped Vanessa

1545
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,500
with finding and reaching out

1546
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,500
to her biological father.

1547
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,570
His name is Grant Young,

1548
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,570
and he's an architect in town.

1549
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,930
Okay.

1550
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,470
I didn't want

1551
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,470
to tell you about it earlier

1552
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,880
because I didn't know

1553
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,880
how you were gonna

1554
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,880
take it.

1555
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,220
I'm just wondering why

1556
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,220
you're telling me this now.

1557
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,310
Because he came in

1558
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,310
as a patient today.

1559
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,690
Not as a patient.

1560
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,690
It was one of his employees.

1561
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,490
So he was here,

1562
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,490
and you didn't

1563
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,490
mention that?

1564
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,320
Listen, I made it

1565
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,320
very clear to Grant

1566
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,830
that I am not interested

1567
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,830
in reconnecting with him

1568
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,490
in any way, shape,

1569
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,490
or form.

1570
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,790
Ben.

1571
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,500
You felt the need

1572
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,500
to tell him that?

1573
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,370
No, I didn't want there

1574
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,370
to be any confusion.

1575
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,940
And it's going good

1576
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,940
between him and Vanessa.

1577
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,440
She seems happy.

1578
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,810
Glad to hear it.

1579
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,920
Dr. Marcel?

1580
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,920
Hey.

1581
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:52,000
I was wondering

1582
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:52,000
how today went with

1583
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:52,000
young Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

1584
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,630
Yeah, fine.

1585
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,960
Uh, not according

1586
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,960
to him.

1587
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,530
He filed a complaint

1588
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,530
with HR and claimed

1589
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,230
you were disrespectful

1590
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,230
and condescending.

1591
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,770
Did he now?

1592
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,470
And we are required

1593
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,470
to take every

1594
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,470
complaint seriously,

1595
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,780
though I suspect

1596
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,780
he must have done

1597
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,440
something pretty egregious

1598
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,440
to raise your hackles.

1599
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,720
You care to file

1600
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,720
a counter complaint?

1601
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,780
No.

1602
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:23,250
You sure?

1603
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:23,250
I could have him

1604
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:23,250
reassigned.

1605
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,030
No, not necessary.

1606
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,670
I'm sure Dr. Tanaka-Reed

1607
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,670
and myself

1608
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,930
will find some common ground

1609
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,930
moving forward.

1610
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,640
Like you said,

1611
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,640
we're all in this

1612
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,640
together, right?

1613
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,900
Hey, Doris said something

1614
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,900
about Jenny

1615
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,900
being in surgery.

1616
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,280
Yeah, we located

1617
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,280
a small tumor

1618
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,280
on her mediastinum.

1619
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,620
Daniel thinks

1620
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,620
that might have been

1621
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,620
what caused the psychosis.

1622
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,910
Really?

1623
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,550
Mommy!

1624
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,850
My baby boy! Oh!

1625
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,300
Look at your arm.

1626
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,300
I'm so sorry.

1627
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,630
It's okay. It's okay.

1628
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,630
I'm okay.

1629
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,560
I thought you were trying

1630
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,560
to hurt me and Henry.

1631
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,640
I'm... I didn't understand.

1632
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,640
It's all right.

1633
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,440
You're not gonna

1634
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,440
have to worry

1635
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,440
about that anymore.

1636
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:14,950
Mommy, look, my chrysalis.

1637
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:14,950
It turned into a butterfly.

1638
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,410
It's so beautiful.

1639
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,720
What's that?

1640
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,960
Your new best friend

1641
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,960
for the next two weeks.

1642
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,510
Welcome to boot camp.

1643
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,450
I'm sure you already know

1644
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,450
this about your

1645
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,450
old man, that...

1646
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,960
I've got a tendency

1647
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,960
to override everything

1648
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,030
but the sound

1649
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,030
of my own voice.

1650
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,770
I don't know

1651
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,770
if you have anything

1652
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,930
that you want to say to me

1653
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,930
after all this time,

1654
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,930
but if there is...

1655
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,580
I'd like to try

1656
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,580
my best to listen.
