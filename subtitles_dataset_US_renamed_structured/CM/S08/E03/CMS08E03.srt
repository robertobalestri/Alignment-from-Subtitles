1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,030
Move the C-arm.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,030
Stay with me.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,730
So this is how it's gonna be?

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,560
All day long, you've been

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,560
talking down to me.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,140
I should have

7
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,140
given you credit.

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,610
I was very impressed

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,610
with the way you nearly

10
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,610
killed our patient.

11
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,350
We are running low

12
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,350
on a number of key supplies.

13
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,610
No, no, no, no.

14
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,610
Stop, stop.

15
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,610
I need that dye.

16
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,750
We can't have one patient

17
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,750
depleting our supplies.

18
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,080
So call another hospital.

19
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,680
We're all in the same boat.

20
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,660
Dr. Cuevas and I have

21
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,660
a strong hunch

22
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,250
that David is developing

23
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,250
schizoaffective disorder.

24
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,270
No! My boy isn't crazy.

25
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,270
Stay away from us.

26
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,060
How is that boy supposed

27
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,060
to get any help?

28
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,140
It is a real pleasure

29
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,140
to finally meet you,

30
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,140
Dr. Hawthorne.

31
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,640
My colleague at Med,

32
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,640
David Kwan,

33
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,010
he sings

34
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,010
your praises highly.

35
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,650
Oh, I'm not the doctor.

36
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,650
I'm her assistant,

37
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,650
Katherine.

38
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,120
Okay.

39
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,050
Sign and date

40
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,050
these forms, please.

41
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,090
Just wherever you see

42
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,090
a highlight.

43
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,460
While you're finishing up

44
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,460
with that,

45
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,160
I'll go over our policies

46
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,160
and procedures.

47
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,540
Everything you discuss

48
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,540
with Dr. Hawthorne

49
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,660
is confidential,

50
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,660
except in the event

51
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,660
she feels

52
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,370
you're a danger to yourself.

53
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,370
You know what,

54
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,370
Katherine?

55
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,410
I'm actually a practicing

56
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,410
psychiatrist myself,

57
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,640
so, I mean, if you'd like,

58
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,640
you can skip that part.

59
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,810
I totally get it,

60
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,480
but Dr. Hawthorne,

61
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,480
who you'll meet next week,

62
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,710
requires we go through

63
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,710
the policies together.

64
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,690
If the doctor feels

65
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,690
that you're a danger

66
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,690
to yourself or others,

67
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,550
she's required to report...

68
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,550
You know what,

69
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,550
Katherine?

70
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,250
I appreciate you're just

71
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,250
trying to do your job.

72
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,770
But, um, maybe you could

73
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,770
tell Dr. Hawthorne

74
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,770
to give me a call

75
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,490
when she has a chance

76
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,230
to meet me herself

77
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,230
in person, okay?

78
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,500
Um, you know what?

79
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,240
On second thought,

80
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,240
maybe, um, tell her

81
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,240
not to bother.

82
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,140
Yeah.

83
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,180
It's been a long time

84
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,180
since you had to hunt

85
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,180
for a therapist.

86
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,120
Want me to shoot

87
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,120
you some names?

88
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,780
I got a small stockpile

89
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,780
of referrals.

90
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,090
I gotta be honest, Sharon,

91
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,460
after these

92
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,460
last two experiences,

93
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,720
my interest in the process

94
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,720
might be waning.

95
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,600
I mean, this morning

96
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,600
in particular

97
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,790
actually had me questioning

98
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,790
the state of psychiatry.

99
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,310
Well, that assembly-line

100
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,310
mentality is plaguing much

101
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,310
of medicine these days,

102
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,340
not just psychiatry,

103
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,340
but don't worry,

104
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,340
you'll find your person.

105
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,410
See you later.

106
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,410
No coffee?

107
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,880
Oh, no.

108
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,880
I don't have any time.

109
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,650
We're implementing a new

110
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,650
drug shortage protocol,

111
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,410
so I'll be in the ED

112
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,410
all morning walking

113
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,410
the staff

114
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,780
through the new guidelines.

115
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,520
You couldn't get

116
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,520
the enforcer,

117
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,450
otherwise known

118
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,450
as Maggie Lockwood, on that?

119
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,820
She's in Paris.

120
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,350
She and Ben never took

121
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,350
their honeymoon, and she was

122
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,350
gonna lose her vacation days.

123
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,900
Wow.

124
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,900
Yeah.

125
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,220
Well, still, not a great time

126
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,220
to be short-staffed,

127
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,220
though, right?

128
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,830
There's never a good time.

129
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,200
Yep, you got that right.

130
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,200
See you later.

131
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,270
Get these off me!

132
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,270
David Sullivan,

133
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,270
17-year-old male.

134
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,440
We've met.

135
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,440
David, it's me,

136
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,440
Dr. Archer.

137
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,600
Do you remember me?

138
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,600
I can't stay here.

139
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,510
They're gonna find me.

140
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,510
I have to keep moving.

141
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,880
I can't stay in one place!

142
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,880
It's okay, honey.

143
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,510
You're safe.

144
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,510
He ran naked into the street.

145
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,640
Dad managed to grab him

146
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,640
before he got hit by a car.

147
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,380
No visible injuries that

148
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,380
I can see. Gave him 0.5

149
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,380
of lorazepam en route.

150
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,330
Hello, again, Mrs. Sullivan.

151
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,330
Is your husband all right?

152
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,230
He's fine, yeah.

153
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,230
He's just a bit shaken up.

154
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,820
He drove behind us,

155
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,820
should be here any minute.

156
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,920
Doris, would you...

157
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,920
Page psych. I'm on it.

158
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,670
Okay, finish my sentences

159
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,670
for me, why don't you?

160
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,240
Okay, David, we're gonna

161
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,240
loosen your restraints now

162
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,570
and move you to the bed.

163
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,370
I need you to stay still.

164
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,500
Keep your hands

165
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,500
by your side, all right?

166
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,840
Okay, ready, everybody?

167
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,840
On my count,

168
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,840
one, two, three.

169
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,820
Good. Okay.

170
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,550
Very good, okay.

171
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,180
No, no, no, no, no!

172
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,180
It's all right.

173
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,310
It's all right.

174
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,310
David, please.

175
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,290
Just let the doctor

176
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,290
look at you, okay, honey?

177
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,650
They came

178
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,650
inside the light.

179
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,350
They're trying to steal

180
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,350
my DNA so they

181
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,350
can clone me.

182
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,560
Okay, so what do you think

183
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,560
could have triggered this?

184
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,390
We were at a stoplight,

185
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,230
and David became fixated

186
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,230
on this billboard.

187
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,430
It was just

188
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,430
some random man

189
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,430
selling car insurance.

190
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,600
He's not random.

191
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,600
He works for them.

192
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,970
There's a whole network.

193
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,970
I don't know.

194
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,830
He started taking

195
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,830
his clothes off

196
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,830
and telling us

197
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,910
that they were bugged

198
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,910
with recording devices.

199
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,480
And then right when

200
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,480
the light turned green,

201
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,480
he bolted.

202
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,740
He ran across four lanes

203
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,740
of oncoming traffic.

204
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,740
There was...

205
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,590
There was a pickup truck

206
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,590
that was coming right at him.

207
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,520
And he...

208
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,520
Eric.

209
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,710
Sir, are you all right?

210
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,710
Oh, my God, Eric!

211
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,310
All right,

212
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,310
let's get him

213
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,310
to the ground.

214
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,550
Eric! Eric!

215
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,550
Come on.

216
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,920
What's going on

217
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,920
with him?

218
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,920
It was meant for me.

219
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,320
They're gonna kill us all!

220
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,320
It's okay, honey.

221
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,490
Mom, we gotta

222
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,490
get out of here now.

223
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,660
Let's get a gurney

224
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,660
over here!

225
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,660
It's okay.

226
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,750
Come on!

227
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,750
Oh, my God.

228
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,560
No, no, no! No, no!

229
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,410
Your husband's

230
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,410
CT angiogram showed

231
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,810
an aortic dissection.

232
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,310
That's essentially a tear

233
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,310
in the wall of his aorta.

234
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,820
So Eric didn't have

235
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,820
a heart attack?

236
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,290
Well, a dissection

237
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,290
can often mimic

238
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,880
heart attacks

239
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,880
in presentation.

240
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,020
This particular tear

241
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,020
is very close to his heart,

242
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,990
which is why we need

243
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,990
to get him to surgery

244
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,320
as soon as possible

245
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,490
in order to repair it.

246
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,890
Open heart surgery?

247
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,890
Mm. Yes.

248
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,630
Dr. Morris, one of our

249
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,630
cardiothoracic surgeons,

250
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,640
will be performing

251
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,640
the operation.

252
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,640
He's on his way here now.

253
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,470
Oh, okay, can I see Eric

254
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,470
before he goes under?

255
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,600
Yes, of course.

256
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,310
Once we get him to pre-op,

257
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,310
I'll have a nurse

258
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,310
come get you.

259
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,510
How about

260
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,510
we go somewhere

261
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,510
and chat for a bit?

262
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,950
Thank you. Okay.

263
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,020
I don't understand.

264
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,920
Why would David

265
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,920
think that this man on

266
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,920
a billboard was after him?

267
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,960
It's what we call

268
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,960
a delusion of persecution.

269
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,790
Yeah, one becomes convinced

270
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,790
that some individual,

271
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,530
you know,

272
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,530
or group is conspiring

273
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,530
to harm them

274
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,830
or the people

275
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,830
that they love.

276
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,900
And these delusions,

277
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,900
that's something that

278
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,900
you see with schizophrenia?

279
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,030
It is, yeah.

280
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,050
I know Eric and I

281
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,050
weren't exactly receptive

282
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,410
the last time we all spoke.

283
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,320
We completely understand.

284
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,320
It's a lot to take in.

285
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,950
I just thought

286
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,950
that David was

287
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,950
going through

288
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,620
some kind of phase,

289
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,620
growing pains, you know?

290
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,790
But in these last couple

291
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,790
of days, it's like he's...

292
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,390
He's lost all touch

293
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,390
with reality.

294
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,600
It's just like,

295
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,600
I feel him slipping away.

296
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,940
Mrs. Sullivan,

297
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,940
I promise you,

298
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,940
David is still there.

299
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,670
Yeah, and with treatment,

300
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,670
these episodes will become

301
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,540
less severe

302
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,540
and less frequent.

303
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,080
And with proper management,

304
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,080
they can even go away.

305
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,610
What do you mean, medication?

306
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,420
That's a crucial

307
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,420
component, yeah.

308
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,960
David thinks people

309
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,960
are trying to poison him.

310
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,860
How am I going

311
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,860
to convince him

312
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,860
to take pills?

313
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,590
There are actually

314
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,590
injectable versions

315
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,590
of many antipsychotics.

316
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,100
Though we don't

317
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,100
generally start there.

318
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,600
Those are

319
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,600
usually held in reserve

320
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,600
for non-compliant patients.

321
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,640
Of course. I'm just saying,

322
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,640
if he refuses or becomes

323
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,640
non-cooperative,

324
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
they're an option.

325
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Right.

326
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,480
But we'll cross that bridge

327
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,480
if and when we get there.

328
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,910
In the long run,

329
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,910
it's just much better

330
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,850
if we can get David on board

331
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,850
with taking medication.

332
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,150
Okay.

333
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,090
Ms. Martin, I'm Doctor...

334
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,460
Liza.

335
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,960
Sorry, you were

336
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,960
saying?

337
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,590
I'm Dr. Choi.

338
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,500
I understand you haven't

339
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,500
been feeling well.

340
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,510
Yeah, I can't keep

341
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,510
anything down.

342
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,730
And you're

343
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,730
12 weeks along.

344
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,740
Uh, that's just

345
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,740
an estimate.

346
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,840
I only just recently

347
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,840
found out I was pregnant.

348
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,850
I haven't gotten around

349
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,850
to see a doctor just yet.

350
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,820
Well, in that case,

351
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,820
we'll go ahead

352
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,820
and run an ultrasound.

353
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,620
Doris, will you mind

354
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,620
grabbing Dr. Asher?

355
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,020
Sure thing.

356
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,020
Thanks.

357
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,530
So when did the vomiting

358
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,530
and diarrhea start?

359
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,690
Just last night.

360
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,200
And you haven't taken

361
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,200
any medication?

362
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,970
No, nothing.

363
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,200
I don't want

364
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,200
to take anything

365
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,200
while I'm pregnant.

366
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,670
Well, you know there are

367
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,670
some nausea medications

368
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,970
that are safe for pregnancy.

369
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,130
Still, I just...

370
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,900
I would rather not.

371
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,500
Um...

372
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,010
I'll be fine. I just really

373
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,010
came in here to make sure

374
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,010
the baby's okay.

375
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,140
Understood.

376
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,140
Mind if I press

377
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,140
on your belly?

378
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,550
I just want to see

379
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,550
if anything feels tender.

380
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,460
No, no, no. No, no, no.

381
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,460
I don't want her.

382
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,100
You'll have to get me

383
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,100
another doctor.

384
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,720
Dr. Asher?

385
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,960
Hannah Asher, right?

386
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,770
Yeah. She's an

387
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,770
excellent physician.

388
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,770
She's an addict.

389
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,940
You get me another doctor,

390
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,940
or I'm leaving.

391
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

392
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,200
Okay, okay, okay.

393
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,200
Just hold on a moment.

394
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,740
Hey, Hannah, sorry,

395
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,740
I jumped the gun, actually.

396
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,510
We're all good.

397
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,050
Oh, okay.

398
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,820
Well, in that case,

399
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,820
I'm grabbing breakfast

400
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,820
if anybody's looking for me.

401
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,830
Dr. Tanaka-Reed,

402
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,830
hold up a minute.

403
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,000
Can you have them

404
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,000
update that for me?

405
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,000
Thank you.

406
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,510
Look, I...

407
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,510
I wanted

408
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,510
to clear the air.

409
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,280
The other day,

410
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,280
I may have come off

411
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,280
a little condescending.

412
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,010
I appreciate

413
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,010
the acknowledgment,

414
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,010
Dr. Marcel.

415
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,850
Of course,

416
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,850
and if there's anything

417
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,850
you'd like to say...

418
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,090
No, don't think so.

419
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,090
We're all good.

420
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,590
What, you didn't

421
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,590
have time to grab him

422
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,590
flowers from the gift shop?

423
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,890
I mean, I expect

424
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,890
the other docs to go soft

425
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,890
on the residents.

426
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
I thought you had grit.

427
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,300
Well, no man's

428
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,300
an island, right?

429
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,040
You know, island life's

430
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,040
really not so bad.

431
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,630
Maybe you just don't

432
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,630
have the stomach for it.

433
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,240
Dr. Marcel, you've got

434
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,240
a trauma incoming.

435
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,240
Well, thanks for

436
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,240
that pep talk, coach.

437
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,810
Anytime.

438
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,880
What do we got?

439
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,250
Marcus Walker,

440
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,250
50-year-old male,

441
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,250
fall from standing.

442
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,650
Gave him a 500-liter

443
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,650
bolus en route.

444
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,950
Pressure's hanging

445
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,950
around 100, systolic.

446
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,950
Heart rate's 120.

447
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,960
Yeah, I've never seen him

448
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,960
in this much pain.

449
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,090
It hasn't let up since

450
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,090
he hit the pavement.

451
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,170
This is his sister, Janet.

452
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,170
Did you witness

453
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,170
the fall, Janet?

454
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,230
He lost his balance

455
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,230
stepping off the sidewalk.

456
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,240
It didn't look that bad,

457
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,240
but then he couldn't get up.

458
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,330
Okay, we'll give him

459
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,330
something for the pain.

460
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,700
We just got to find

461
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,700
the source of it first.

462
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,600
Any medications

463
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,600
we should know about?

464
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,600
Dialysis.

465
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,900
Oh, and he takes ramipril

466
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,900
for his blood pressure.

467
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,340
Okay, here we go, guys.

468
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,340
Nice and easy

469
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,340
on my count, okay?

470
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,110
One, two, three.

471
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,770
I'm sorry, Marcus.

472
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,850
I'm right here, Marcus.

473
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,850
I'm right here.

474
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,150
Janet, let's give the doctor

475
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,150
some room to work, okay?

476
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,090
We're gonna take care

477
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,090
of him, Janet,

478
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,090
we got this.

479
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,890
Let's hang

480
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,890
a unit of whole blood.

481
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,890
Pressure it in, Ron.

482
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,720
Hey, Marcus,

483
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,720
put your arms

484
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,720
by your side for me.

485
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,190
There you go, bud.

486
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,190
Deep breaths.

487
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,190
Okay, lungs are clear.

488
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,960
He's still shocking.

489
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,960
Yeah.

490
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,630
He's bleeding

491
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,630
from somewhere.

492
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,100
Let's fast him, Dr. Taylor.

493
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,940
Belly's negative.

494
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,100
Really?

495
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,100
Yeah.

496
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,680
All right,

497
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,680
let's get him on his side.

498
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,310
Uh, Herbert,

499
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,310
come over, please.

500
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,220
All right, here we go.

501
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,220
Nice and easy, all right?

502
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720
One, two, three.

503
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,220
There you go.

504
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,220
You're doing great.

505
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,220
You're doing great, Marcus.

506
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,170
What is it?

507
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,170
Oh.

508
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,640
An abscess.

509
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,640
Looks like it.

510
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,340
Pus under pressure.

511
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,340
It's gotta be the source

512
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,340
of the pain.

513
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,040
All right, let's drain it.

514
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,340
Scalpel.

515
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,780
Hematoma.

516
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,760
Yep. Hold pressure

517
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,760
and pack it in.

518
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,760
You got it?

519
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,760
Yeah.

520
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,060
Okay.

521
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,060
Got it.

522
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,030
All right, give me

523
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,030
another unit of

524
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,030
whole blood.

525
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,730
Start DDAVP and a unit

526
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,730
of platelets, stat.

527
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,040
Come on, let's move, folks.

528
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,310
Ms. Arya, hello again.

529
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,310
Indrani, please.

530
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,850
Indrani. I got the results

531
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,850
back on your culture.

532
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,920
Unfortunately,

533
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,920
you tested positive for

534
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,920
an infection called MRSA.

535
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,430
From an ingrown toenail?

536
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,060
MRSA is really hard

537
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,060
to treat, isn't it?

538
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
While it is resistant

539
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
to many antibiotics,

540
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,060
luckily, there are a couple

541
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,060
that still work for it.

542
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,160
How long do I have to be

543
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,160
on antibiotics?

544
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,000
About seven

545
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,000
to 10 days.

546
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh.

547
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,170
See, I told you

548
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,170
you wouldn't have to

549
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,170
cancel your trip.

550
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,770
Oh, yeah?

551
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,770
Where are you headed?

552
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,450
Well, I'm going

553
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,450
to Scotland in a few weeks

554
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,450
to hike the West Highland Way.

555
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,910
It's a 96-mile trail through

556
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,910
the Scottish Highlands.

557
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,210
Ninety-six miles?

558
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,220
I've been training

559
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,220
for the last year.

560
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,750
I may be pushing 60,

561
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,750
but I don't feel it.

562
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,850
Let's start with vancomycin.

563
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,360
No, I can't take vancomycin.

564
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm allergic.

565
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,390
Uh-huh.

566
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,390
I see that.

567
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,060
I had a terrible reaction

568
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,060
when I was a kid.

569
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,060
My throat closed up.

570
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,900
Then we will

571
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,900
steer clear. Nancy?

572
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,970
Linezolid? On it.

573
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,970
Mm-hmm.

574
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,900
We'll get you in tip-top

575
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,900
shape for Scotland, Indrani.

576
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,980
I've been wanting

577
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,980
to do this a long time.

578
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,480
Um, Dr. Halstead, the pharmacy

579
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,480
won't release the medication.

580
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,840
What?

581
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,240
Is there a problem?

582
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,420
No, just probably

583
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,420
a system glitch.

584
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,480
Sit tight,

585
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,480
and I'll be right back.

586
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,520
Look, per the new protocol,

587
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,130
you're gonna

588
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,130
have to go through

589
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,130
Infectious Disease first,

590
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,390
and they're going to want

591
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,390
to try incising and draining

592
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,390
the infected tissue

593
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,940
before they approve

594
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,940
giving linezolid.

595
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,400
Incising and draining?

596
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,400
So source control.

597
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,500
That is not gonna

598
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,500
cut it, Ms. Goodwin.

599
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,500
She needs linezolid.

600
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,280
I mean, can't we

601
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,280
just say that, uh,

602
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,940
you know, Infectious Disease

603
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,940
already signed off?

604
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,150
No, we cannot,

605
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,150
Dr. Halstead.

606
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,780
Linezolid is

607
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,780
on the restricted list due

608
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,780
to extremely low inventory.

609
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,360
There's a region-wide

610
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,360
shortage.

611
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,980
And we are dealing

612
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,980
with a systemic

613
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,980
MRSA infection.

614
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,860
You're looking at the patient

615
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,860
in front of you.

616
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,020
But the Oversight Committee

617
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,020
designed the guidelines

618
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,230
to ration these drugs

619
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,230
to the most severe cases.

620
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,000
I have seen early

621
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,000
source control work wonders.

622
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,440
Give it a shot.

623
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,550
Dr. Marcel.

624
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,290
Yeah? Uh-huh.

625
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,290
I got Marcus's CAT scans.

626
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,910
Two very severe

627
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,910
lumbar burst fractures.

628
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,390
All from a spill

629
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,390
on the sidewalk?

630
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,390
Take a look.

631
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,260
Oof. Renal disease

632
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,260
definitely sped up

633
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,260
his bone loss.

634
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,460
He's gonna need spinal

635
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,460
stabilization surgery.

636
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,370
Yeah, agreed. Only option

637
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,370
to get him walking again.

638
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,070
Given his comorbidities,

639
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,070
without it, he's just gonna

640
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,070
circle the drain.

641
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,570
All right, let's, uh...

642
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,570
Let's go talk

643
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,570
to Neurosurgery.

644
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,070
And David, this voice

645
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,070
that you're hearing,

646
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,070
is it male or female?

647
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,380
I don't know.

648
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,350
It's more like it

649
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,350
has its own language,

650
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,320
its own way

651
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,320
of communicating.

652
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,290
And then my brain

653
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,290
translates the messages

654
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,290
so I can understand them.

655
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,260
Mm-hmm.

656
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,260
Are you getting

657
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,260
any messages right now?

658
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,590
That you're writing down

659
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,590
everything I say because

660
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,590
you work for them.

661
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,940
You're one of their spies,

662
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,940
aren't you?

663
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,340
No, I'm not a spy.

664
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,070
Then give me

665
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,070
your notebook.

666
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,050
I'm not gonna give you

667
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,050
my notebook, David.

668
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,620
Give it to me.

669
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,620
David, I need you

670
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,620
to listen to me.

671
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,940
I'm a doctor.

672
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm writing things down

673
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,280
so I can better understand

674
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,280
what's going...

675
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,620
Get out of here!

676
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,060
Out, now!

677
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,630
David, David,

678
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,630
how about Dr. Cuevas puts her

679
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,630
notebook away for now.

680
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,090
Would that

681
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,090
make you feel better?

682
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,590
And I notice you've been

683
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,590
checking out this vent.

684
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,460
There's a camera in there.

685
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,960
Huh.

686
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,530
They're always

687
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,530
watching me.

688
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,470
There isn't a camera

689
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,470
in there, David.

690
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,550
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

691
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,550
that there isn't,

692
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,550
but, you know, we're...

693
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,440
We're happy to cover it up

694
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,440
if it'll make you

695
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,440
more comfortable.

696
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,010
Okay, good.

697
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,010
So why don't I go see

698
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,010
what I can scrounge up.

699
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,020
And I have

700
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,020
another couple of patients

701
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
I need to check in on,

702
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
but in the meantime,

703
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,150
is there anything else

704
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,150
I can get you?

705
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,450
Can I have a Coke?

706
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,450
Absolutely.

707
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,330
Okay, so back in a bit.

708
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,370
And Dr. Cuevas,

709
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,370
can I just get

710
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,370
a quick word, please?

711
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,130
So with patients

712
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,130
experiencing paranoia,

713
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,410
I've found that

714
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,410
it's probably not

715
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,410
the best idea to push back

716
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,140
too hard on their version

717
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,140
of events, you know,

718
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,140
especially at the outset.

719
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,380
There's actually

720
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,380
evidence-based research

721
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,380
suggesting the opposite,

722
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,460
that you shouldn't reinforce

723
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,460
a patient's delusion.

724
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,150
Instead, you should try

725
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,150
to explain to them

726
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,320
why they're experiencing

727
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,320
things differently.

728
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,330
I hear you,

729
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,330
except that that's

730
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,330
pretty much impossible

731
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,330
if you haven't

732
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,330
first established trust.

733
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,160
But very glad to hear

734
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,160
that you are keeping up

735
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,160
on the literature. Way to go.

736
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,210
Oh, got Choi

737
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,210
as your advisor.

738
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,410
Luck really isn't

739
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,410
on your side.

740
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,410
Why?

741
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,180
He's been

742
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,180
really cool with me.

743
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,050
Yeah, well, I wouldn't

744
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,050
get too comfortable.

745
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,210
Word is,

746
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,210
he's a real hard-ass.

747
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,350
Got his

748
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,350
last resident fired.

749
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,160
Olga, what are you

750
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,160
doing down here?

751
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,490
I was gonna ask you

752
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,490
the same thing.

753
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,760
I assumed you were

754
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,760
out today.

755
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,760
Why's that?

756
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,700
Oh, well, Dr. Choi

757
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,700
asked me to ultrasound

758
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,700
his pregnant patient.

759
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,010
I don't understand.

760
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,010
Why would he ask you?

761
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,010
I cover the ED.

762
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,320
So do you have a question

763
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,320
about my qualifications

764
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,250
or something?

765
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,250
Of course not, Hannah.

766
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,320
Then why would you

767
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,320
ask another obstetrician

768
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,050
to do an ultrasound

769
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,050
in the ED when I'm here?

770
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,560
Obviously, you don't

771
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,560
trust me.

772
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,560
It's not that. I...

773
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,530
The patient

774
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,530
requested another doctor.

775
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,770
She... She knew

776
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,770
about your past.

777
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,130
What? How?

778
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,410
Uh... Does she

779
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,410
know me personally?

780
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,630
She didn't volunteer

781
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,630
that information,

782
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,440
so I didn't press it.

783
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,440
Fine.

784
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,240
Forget it.

785
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,240
Hannah.

786
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,640
I'm just so sick

787
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,640
of this following me

788
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,640
everywhere I go.

789
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,680
No matter how much

790
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,680
progress I make,

791
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,340
everyone's still judging me

792
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,340
for who I used to be.

793
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,690
Nope. Medically,

794
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,690
it's just too risky.

795
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,260
Chronic hypertension,

796
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,260
end-stage renal disease,

797
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,800
the list goes on and on

798
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,800
with this patient.

799
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,530
The real kicker

800
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,530
is that platelet count.

801
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,160
I'm not touching anyone whose

802
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,160
platelet count's below 100k.

803
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,800
Listen, we know that

804
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,800
he's not an ideal

805
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,800
candidate.

806
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,170
Oh, wait,

807
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,170
I almost forgot.

808
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,270
You guys also hacked

809
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,270
his back open in the ED,

810
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,710
making a posterior

811
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,710
approach impossible.

812
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,710
Should I go on?

813
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,810
Look, I can give you

814
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,810
great anterior exposure.

815
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
All you have to do

816
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
is stabilize his spine.

817
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,310
I'll take care

818
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,310
of everything else.

819
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,820
Oh, you'd be assisting me

820
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,820
on this one?

821
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,720
Wow, way to save your

822
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,720
strongest argument for last.

823
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,690
Maybe you're just worried

824
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,690
about your stats, Sam.

825
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,620
Send him up

826
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,620
to Interventional Radiology.

827
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,630
Have them inject cement

828
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,630
into his fractures.

829
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,600
That'll at least

830
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,600
get him sitting up.

831
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,330
But that won't

832
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,330
get him walking.

833
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,730
And lack of movement

834
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,730
is dangerous in

835
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,730
Marcus's condition.

836
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,540
He can...

837
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,540
He can develop pressure sores,

838
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,540
blood clots, pneumonia.

839
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,200
All preferable to him

840
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,200
bleeding out on my table.

841
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,150
We just need to get

842
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,150
his platelet count up.

843
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,750
Yeah, it's the only way

844
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,750
to get Marcus

845
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,820
healthy enough for surgery

846
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,820
and Abrams on board.

847
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,720
All right, I'll, uh...

848
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,450
I'll order a couple

849
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,450
of units of platelets,

850
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,450
all right?

851
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,630
Patty, any updates

852
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,630
on your husband?

853
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,400
Oh, he just went

854
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,400
into surgery.

855
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,240
Dr. Archer said

856
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,240
it will be a while

857
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,240
before there's any updates.

858
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,800
Okay, well,

859
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,800
he's in very good hands.

860
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,800
You can trust me on that.

861
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,510
David, got that Coke

862
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,510
you asked for and

863
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,510
some stuff for the vent.

864
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,920
Do you think you might

865
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,920
be up for chatting a bit?

866
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,450
You all right, pal?

867
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,390
Trini gave him something

868
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,390
just to calm him down.

869
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,760
Oh.

870
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,860
Okay, back in a second.

871
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,600
What did you give him?

872
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,600
Six of risperidone.

873
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,700
What?

874
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,470
Who the hell

875
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,470
ordered that?

876
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,470
I did.

877
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,390
He became

878
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,390
extremely agitated

879
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,820
and was resisting

880
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,820
restraints.

881
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,480
Lorazepam worked

882
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,480
this morning.

883
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,920
You didn't see

884
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,920
how upset he was.

885
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,420
Haldol, then.

886
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,360
He was going

887
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,360
to tear out his IV.

888
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,660
His mom was freaking out,

889
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,660
begging me to do...

890
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,200
Well, you cannot let

891
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,200
a family member

892
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,460
pressure you into making

893
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,460
a rushed treatment call.

894
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,470
It wasn't rushed.

895
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,470
It was necessary.

896
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,530
And besides, the meds

897
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,530
will clear his system

898
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,830
by tomorrow morning

899
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,830
at the latest.

900
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,530
At which point,

901
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,530
we'll be back

902
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,530
at square one with David,

903
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
if we're lucky, all right?

904
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,710
Any trust established,

905
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,710
down the drain.

906
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,840
How about this,

907
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,840
in the future,

908
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,840
maybe at least page me

909
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,280
before administering

910
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,280
a very high dose

911
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,280
of antipsychotics

912
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,580
to a patient

913
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,580
we're still evaluating?

914
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,720
With all due respect,

915
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,720
Dr. Charles,

916
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,720
I am not a trainee.

917
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,260
And six milligrams

918
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,260
is well within

919
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,260
the standard of care, I...

920
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,490
Standard of care,

921
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,490
whatever that is,

922
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,930
is not some

923
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,930
blanket template

924
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,930
you follow

925
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,870
without any regard

926
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,870
for the person

927
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,870
in front of you

928
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,270
you're supposed

929
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,270
to be helping!

930
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,750
Hey, Janet.

931
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,790
I just want to let you know,

932
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,790
the nurse will be by soon

933
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,020
to start Marcus's

934
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,020
platelet transfusion, okay?

935
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,530
I know it's been

936
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,530
a rough day.

937
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,370
More like a rough year.

938
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,330
Lost my husband

939
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,330
in January.

940
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,600
I'm so sorry.

941
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,740
Marcus came out

942
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,740
from California

943
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,740
for the funeral

944
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,040
and just never went home,

945
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,040
moved in with me.

946
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,450
You must really

947
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,450
get on.

948
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,460
Never had a choice

949
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,460
in the matter.

950
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,580
We're twins, actually.

951
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,830
Marcus was born

952
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,830
45 seconds before me,

953
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,830
but you'd think he was

954
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,830
years older, the way he acts.

955
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,340
Seeing him here like this,

956
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,340
so fragile...

957
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,900
It's really hard.

958
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,860
I want you to know that

959
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,490
we're gonna do everything

960
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,490
we can for Marcus, I promise.

961
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,360
Okay.

962
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,500
What is it?

963
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,560
I was just looking back

964
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,560
in Marcus's history.

965
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,700
His platelets

966
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,700
have always been low.

967
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,580
Oh. Do you think

968
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,580
this is chronic?

969
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,080
Some kind of undiagnosed

970
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,080
blood disorder, or...

971
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,110
ITP would be my guess.

972
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,110
Oh, man.

973
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,750
And if that's the case,

974
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,750
a transfusion

975
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,750
is not gonna do much.

976
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,120
I mean,

977
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,120
his body would just

978
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,120
keep chewing up

979
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,720
any new platelets

980
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,720
we give him.

981
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,990
Well, unless...

982
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,620
Unless what?

983
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,790
Um, forget it, actually.

984
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,530
I thought I had something.

985
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,000
But let's just hope

986
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,000
the transfusion moves

987
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,000
the needle a little, okay?

988
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,750
Podiatry incised

989
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,750
and drained the toe.

990
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,370
They had to cut

991
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,370
the nail out.

992
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,580
I'm not a doctor,

993
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,580
but it looks like

994
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,580
it's getting worse to me.

995
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,780
Don't worry. I'm on it.

996
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,780
We're gonna get you

997
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,780
the medicine you need.

998
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,520
Dr. Halstead,

999
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,520
can I speak

1000
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,520
with you outside?

1001
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,760
What's wrong?

1002
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,520
Uh, just give us

1003
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,520
a moment.

1004
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,700
We're now completely

1005
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,700
out of linezolid.

1006
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,470
You've gotta be

1007
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,470
kidding me.

1008
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,170
I knew it.

1009
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,740
I knew source control

1010
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,740
wasn't gonna cut it.

1011
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,880
How soon are we expecting

1012
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,880
to get it back in stock?

1013
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,950
Tomorrow morning,

1014
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,950
at the earliest.

1015
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,750
Order vancomycin.

1016
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,120
She's allergic.

1017
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,120
I know, all right,

1018
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,120
but I've got an idea.

1019
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,930
Hey, Liza.

1020
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,970
So got your labs back,

1021
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,970
and they look good.

1022
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,670
Your white blood count

1023
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,670
is slightly elevated,

1024
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,800
but that's pretty common

1025
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,800
in pregnancy.

1026
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,470
I think we're just looking

1027
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,470
at a stomach bug.

1028
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,710
Makes sense.

1029
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,610
I can go home, then?

1030
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,680
Yeah, Dr. Patchefsky

1031
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,680
sent down a list of

1032
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,680
OB-GYN referrals,

1033
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,980
as well as some

1034
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,980
genetic testing counselors.

1035
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,060
We'll just add those

1036
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,060
to your discharge.

1037
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,220
Genetic testing?

1038
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:03,690
I thought she said

1039
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:03,690
the baby looked healthy

1040
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:03,690
on the ultrasound.

1041
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,730
Genetic testing

1042
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,730
for hereditary conditions

1043
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,730
is completely optional.

1044
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,070
But the baby's

1045
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,070
healthy, right?

1046
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,030
Yeah.

1047
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,540
Hey, listen, if...

1048
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,110
Liza, my dear.

1049
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,010
I have your

1050
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,010
discharge paperwork.

1051
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,650
I'm not sure

1052
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,650
I'm following you.

1053
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,730
You want to give me a drug

1054
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,730
I told you almost killed me?

1055
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,960
And we'll do everything

1056
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,960
we can to mitigate

1057
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,960
the chances

1058
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,120
of another adverse reaction.

1059
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,120
How, exactly?

1060
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,760
Through a process

1061
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,760
called desensitizing.

1062
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,960
We'll pre-medicate you

1063
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,960
with steroids

1064
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,960
and antihistamines

1065
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,040
and then administer

1066
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,040
the vancomycin via

1067
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,040
a slow IV drip.

1068
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,200
And can you promise me

1069
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,200
that my throat won't

1070
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,200
close up again?

1071
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,970
I can't promise that, no.

1072
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,140
But if you do go

1073
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,140
into anaphylaxis,

1074
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,880
we'll have epinephrine

1075
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,880
at the ready.

1076
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,650
Worst-case scenario,

1077
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,650
we might need to intubate,

1078
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,150
but that would

1079
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,150
only be temporary.

1080
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,980
Intubate me? No, no.

1081
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,980
I'll go to another hospital.

1082
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,280
Well, we've

1083
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,280
called everywhere.

1084
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,290
The earliest anyone

1085
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,290
has linezolid is tomorrow.

1086
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,030
So I'll wait.

1087
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,650
As you're seeing,

1088
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,650
MRSA moves fast.

1089
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,930
I am afraid if we wait

1090
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,930
until tomorrow, it will have

1091
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,930
already spread to the bone.

1092
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,130
You could lose

1093
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,130
your leg, Indrani.

1094
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,000
Give me the vancomycin.

1095
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,300
Okay.

1096
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,310
Marcus' platelet count rose

1097
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,310
from 50,000 to 105,000.

1098
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,140
Can you believe it?

1099
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,140
That's great.

1100
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,920
It's fantastic.

1101
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,650
He must not have ITP

1102
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,650
after all.

1103
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,060
Do me a favor.

1104
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,060
Show Abrams

1105
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,060
these updated labs.

1106
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,990
I think he'll be

1107
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,990
more receptive

1108
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,990
if you deliver them solo.

1109
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,000
How could he possibly

1110
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,000
refuse to operate now?

1111
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,870
It's Abrams.

1112
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,840
I'll get him on board.

1113
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,970
Dr. Choi?

1114
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,970
We've got a problem.

1115
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,200
Liza?

1116
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,140
I thought she had left.

1117
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,770
I came in to turn over

1118
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,770
the room, and I found her

1119
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,770
passed out.

1120
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,680
Let's get her back in the bed

1121
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,680
and up on the monitors. Ready?

1122
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,910
One, two, three.

1123
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,350
All right. All right.

1124
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,210
Liza? Liza,

1125
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,210
can you hear me?

1126
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,350
All right, let's restart

1127
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,350
her IV and get a Foley in her.

1128
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,680
Grab OB.

1129
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,680
Patchefsky, right?

1130
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,820
No, no, no. No time.

1131
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,990
Grab Asher.

1132
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,990
Okay.

1133
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,860
She's hypotensive. BP 85/43.

1134
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,860
Maybe she vasovagaled?

1135
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,270
Her white count

1136
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,270
was more significant

1137
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,270
than I thought.

1138
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,970
Liza.

1139
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,200
You know her?

1140
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,200
Yeah, Doris filled me in.

1141
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,640
How long had she

1142
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,640
been experiencing symptoms

1143
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,840
when she came in?

1144
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,840
Less than 24 hours.

1145
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,810
And that's self-reported

1146
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,810
from the patient?

1147
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,040
Yeah, why?

1148
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,820
Bolus a liter

1149
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,820
of normal saline.

1150
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,980
Hannah, we've been

1151
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,980
giving her fluids.

1152
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,980
Could this be sepsis?

1153
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,390
We could start a broad

1154
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,390
spectrum antibiotic.

1155
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,680
Let's just see what

1156
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,680
this does first.

1157
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,280
I don't think

1158
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,280
we're looking at sepsis.

1159
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,920
I think she's hypovolemic

1160
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,920
from massive volume depletion.

1161
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,360
I suspect she's been

1162
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,360
sick a lot longer

1163
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,360
than she reported.

1164
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,190
BP's starting

1165
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,190
to come up.

1166
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,730
Hey.

1167
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,850
Appreciate you

1168
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,850
stepping up to the plate

1169
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,850
on this one, Sam.

1170
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,020
His platelets sure turned

1171
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,020
around fast, didn't they?

1172
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,930
Marcus is a fighter.

1173
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,430
All right,

1174
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,430
this is my show.

1175
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,040
Once we get to the spine,

1176
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,040
you follow my lead,

1177
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,040
understood?

1178
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,730
Fair enough.

1179
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,170
Mia,

1180
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,170
start my playlist.

1181
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,210
All right, after you.

1182
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,070
Scalpel.

1183
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,020
Where are we at?

1184
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,230
I gave 125

1185
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,230
of the methylprednisolone

1186
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,230
and 50 of diphenhydramine.

1187
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,030
All right, we're ready

1188
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,030
to start the vancomycin.

1189
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,800
Now, we're gonna

1190
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,800
take it slowly, gradually

1191
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,800
increase the dose over time.

1192
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,430
Are you ready?

1193
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,070
As I'll ever be.

1194
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,190
Something doesn't

1195
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,190
feel right.

1196
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,820
Okay.

1197
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,820
Oh, my God.

1198
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,420
Oh, my God. My throat...

1199
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,420
I can't swallow.

1200
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,960
Okay, we got you.

1201
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,960
Nancy, 0.3 of epi.

1202
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,390
I can't...

1203
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,390
It takes time to work.

1204
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,940
Just stay calm.

1205
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,940
Keep your eyes on me.

1206
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,170
Another 0.3 of epi

1207
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,170
and another 50

1208
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,170
of diphenhydramine.

1209
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,310
Mask.

1210
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,810
There you go.

1211
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,180
Get ready to intubate.

1212
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,490
Just a precaution.

1213
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,440
I think it's working.

1214
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,440
Slow, deep breaths.

1215
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,940
In through the nose,

1216
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,940
out through the mouth.

1217
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,810
That's it.

1218
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,860
So how long

1219
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,860
have you actually been sick?

1220
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,890
This is day six.

1221
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,800
Ever since I stopped using.

1222
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,270
Did you know

1223
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,270
that these symptoms

1224
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,270
are a result of withdrawal?

1225
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,080
I figured.

1226
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,540
Dr. Asher, if I outed you

1227
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,540
to your colleagues...

1228
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,910
No.

1229
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,850
No, you didn't.

1230
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,850
Everyone here knows

1231
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,850
that I'm in recovery.

1232
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,890
And you don't have

1233
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,890
to call me Dr. Asher.

1234
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,200
It does feel kind of weird

1235
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,200
calling you by your last name.

1236
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,000
I won't tell anyone

1237
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,000
in group.

1238
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,070
Thank you.

1239
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,170
I don't even know

1240
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,170
if the drugs have cleared

1241
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,170
my system yet.

1242
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,200
I couldn't risk you

1243
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,200
running a drug test on me,

1244
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,510
given everything

1245
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,510
you know about me.

1246
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,280
I just... I don't want

1247
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,280
anyone taking

1248
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,280
my baby away.

1249
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,050
Well, I commend you

1250
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,050
for quitting, Liza.

1251
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,400
Going cold turkey

1252
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,400
is really hard.

1253
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,090
There are some medications

1254
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,090
like Suboxone and methadone

1255
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,860
that can help curb

1256
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,860
the cravings.

1257
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,070
Those are opiates, right?

1258
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,630
Yes.

1259
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,600
But when you're

1260
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,600
medically supervised,

1261
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,000
you are allowed to be

1262
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,000
on them while

1263
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,000
you're pregnant.

1264
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,450
The risk to the fetus

1265
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,450
is minimal...

1266
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,450
No.

1267
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,020
If there are any risks,

1268
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,020
then no.

1269
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,320
I probably shot up,

1270
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,390
like, a half dozen times

1271
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,390
during my first trimester.

1272
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:22,300
And still, by some miracle,

1273
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:22,300
the baby seems to be okay.

1274
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,170
I can't do anything

1275
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,170
to jeopardize that.

1276
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,130
I won't.

1277
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,580
Come in.

1278
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,680
I was going to check

1279
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,680
with Mrs. Sullivan

1280
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,150
to see if she would agree

1281
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,150
to David spending

1282
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,630
a couple of nights

1283
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,630
in the psych ward.

1284
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,620
I figure we can

1285
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,620
talk to him more,

1286
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,630
begin to find the correct

1287
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,630
medication and dosage.

1288
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,190
Well, that sounds good,

1289
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,190
Dr. Cuevas. Thank you.

1290
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,970
Oh, and his father

1291
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,970
is out of surgery.

1292
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,970
No complications.

1293
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,010
Well, good stuff.

1294
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,010
I'm glad to hear that, too.

1295
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,350
I should have spoken

1296
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,350
to you first before

1297
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,350
medicating David.

1298
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,660
Look, you know

1299
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,660
it was a chaotic situation,

1300
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,130
and I understand that you felt

1301
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,130
the need to act swiftly. I do.

1302
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,500
I probably did jump

1303
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,500
to medication too quickly,

1304
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,660
if I'm being honest.

1305
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,600
I know I rely heavily

1306
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,600
on the literature

1307
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,040
and the standard of care,

1308
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,310
but I just don't always feel

1309
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,750
like I can trust

1310
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,750
my own instincts.

1311
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:52,520
I mean,

1312
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:52,520
it took me years, years.

1313
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,600
And still,

1314
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,600
I have my days when...

1315
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,600
You know?

1316
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,560
But this,

1317
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,560
I can promise you,

1318
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,560
you will get there.

1319
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,990
You will. There's not a...

1320
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,990
Not a shred

1321
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,990
of doubt in my mind.

1322
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,170
Trust me on that.

1323
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,550
Hey, Janet.

1324
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,090
Marcus did great.

1325
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,490
I can't thank you both enough.

1326
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,090
No need. He's got

1327
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,090
a long road ahead,

1328
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,190
but with physical therapy,

1329
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,190
I'm confident he'll be back

1330
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,190
on his feet.

1331
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,500
Can...

1332
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,500
Can I see him?

1333
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,540
Of course.

1334
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,540
I'll take you to recovery.

1335
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,580
Now, he's just waking up,

1336
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,580
so he might be

1337
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,580
a bit groggy, okay?

1338
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,810
This way.

1339
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,110
Dr. Abrams,

1340
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,110
I heard the good news.

1341
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,410
I really appreciate...

1342
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,820
Yeah, you two ever pull

1343
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,820
a stunt like that again,

1344
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,420
I won't keep it to myself.

1345
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,420
I'll go straight to Goodwin.

1346
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,590
Excuse me?

1347
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,530
I don't appreciate

1348
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,530
being conned into surgery

1349
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,560
under false pretenses.

1350
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,560
Wait.

1351
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,290
I'm sorry, Dr. Abrams.

1352
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,290
What are you talking about?

1353
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,630
My antenna went up

1354
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,630
when Marcus's platelets

1355
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,630
corrected so quickly.

1356
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,270
So I had the lab run

1357
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,270
an anti-platelet

1358
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,270
antibody test

1359
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,740
while we were in surgery.

1360
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,740
You might be interested

1361
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,740
in the results.

1362
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,450
Marcus has ITP.

1363
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,450
Mm-hmm.

1364
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,580
But this doesn't

1365
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,580
make any sense.

1366
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,450
If Marcus has ITP,

1367
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,450
the transfusion

1368
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,350
shouldn't have worked.

1369
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,350
Correct.

1370
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,490
Unless someone gave him

1371
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,490
a little assistance.

1372
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,830
You gave

1373
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,830
Marcus steroids,

1374
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,830
didn't you?

1375
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,470
And that's why

1376
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,470
his platelet count went up.

1377
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,310
I know steroids

1378
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,310
can be controversial

1379
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,180
in the surgical settings...

1380
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,180
To put it lightly.

1381
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,380
You put him

1382
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,380
at greater risk

1383
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,380
of post-op infection.

1384
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,110
Vanessa, believe me

1385
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,110
when I tell you,

1386
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,110
this was our only play.

1387
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,220
Our only play?

1388
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,220
I was left in the dark.

1389
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,550
Look, I didn't want you

1390
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,550
catching any heat

1391
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,550
if things went south, okay?

1392
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,430
I have more cover

1393
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,430
as an attending.

1394
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,120
I was trying

1395
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,120
to protect you.

1396
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,130
I do not need

1397
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,130
your protection.

1398
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,130
I need your respect.

1399
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,140
Vanessa, of course

1400
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,140
I respect you.

1401
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,230
It does not feel

1402
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,230
that way right now.

1403
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,210
Looking much better, Indrani.

1404
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,180
Some techs

1405
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,180
will be back soon

1406
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,180
to move you upstairs.

1407
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,480
We're gonna keep you on IV

1408
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,480
vancomycin for a few days

1409
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,560
and then switch you over

1410
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,560
to the oral version.

1411
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,330
Dr. Halstead,

1412
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,330
I can't thank you enough.

1413
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,690
I'm just sorry we had

1414
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,690
to put you through all that.

1415
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,390
Oh, it was worth it,

1416
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,390
believe me.

1417
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,330
That's where

1418
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,330
I'm going to be next month.

1419
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,940
I'm adding it

1420
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,940
to my bucket list.

1421
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,800
Would you excuse me

1422
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,800
for a moment?

1423
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,250
Of course.

1424
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,520
Ms. Goodwin.

1425
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,710
Stop by my office

1426
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,710
before you leave tonight.

1427
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,910
I'd like a word.

1428
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,790
Will do.

1429
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,400
Dr. Choi,

1430
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,260
uh, this is for you.

1431
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,600
I saw you were staying on

1432
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,600
for the night shift,

1433
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,830
so I figured you might

1434
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,830
need a caffeine boost.

1435
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,430
Oh, and these

1436
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,430
are also for you.

1437
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,980
It's my CV, in-progress

1438
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,980
research papers,

1439
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,980
and all my case logs to date.

1440
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,680
For our first advisor

1441
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,680
meeting tomorrow.

1442
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,680
Ah, well, you are

1443
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,680
really prepared, Zach.

1444
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,790
Will you excuse me?

1445
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,790
Yeah, of course.

1446
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,890
See you tomorrow.

1447
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,650
See you tomorrow.

1448
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,230
Hey.

1449
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,730
Liza agreed to be admitted

1450
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,730
overnight for observation.

1451
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:55,960
Good.

1452
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,860
She's in withdrawal,

1453
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,860
I take it.

1454
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,900
Don't worry,

1455
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,900
I won't say anything.

1456
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,410
I appreciate that, Ethan.

1457
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,250
And while I suspect

1458
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,250
that the drugs have

1459
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,250
already cleared her system,

1460
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,840
she's terrified someone

1461
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,840
might report her.

1462
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,750
The last thing

1463
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,750
she needs is to be

1464
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,750
penalized for seeking care.

1465
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,310
Look, you were

1466
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,310
absolutely right,

1467
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,310
by the way,

1468
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,290
to bring in

1469
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,290
Dr. Patchefsky.

1470
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,980
I never should have

1471
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,980
given you flack for that.

1472
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:24,790
Look, I know how frustrating

1473
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:24,790
it is to always feel like

1474
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:24,790
you're being held

1475
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,660
to some former version

1476
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,660
of yourself.

1477
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,260
But on the flip side,

1478
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,260
because of who you were

1479
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,700
and what you went through,

1480
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,410
you were able

1481
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,410
to connect to Liza

1482
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,410
in a way no one else could.

1483
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,380
Yeah.

1484
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,340
I guess that's true.

1485
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:46,440
Maybe it's not always

1486
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:46,440
such a bad thing, having

1487
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:46,440
your reputation precede you.

1488
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,930
Great work today, Sam.

1489
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,660
Good night, Dr. Taylor.

1490
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,810
Ooh, ouch.

1491
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,340
Why, I see

1492
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,340
you've got yourself

1493
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,340
quite the fan club.

1494
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,050
You know, maybe I was

1495
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,050
wrong about you.

1496
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,620
You might be cut out

1497
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,620
for island life after all.

1498
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,460
So, let me

1499
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,460
get this straight.

1500
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,360
You gave the patient

1501
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,360
an antibiotic you knew

1502
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,360
she was allergic to...

1503
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,870
Only after I advised her

1504
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,870
of the potential risks

1505
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,670
and with her full consent.

1506
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,900
Which, trust me,

1507
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,900
wouldn't hold up in court

1508
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,600
if this thing

1509
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,600
had gone sideways.

1510
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,640
Well, Ms. Goodwin,

1511
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,640
it wasn't my first choice.

1512
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,810
I understand the new protocols

1513
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,810
got off to a bit of a rocky

1514
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,810
start today, but...

1515
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,040
They're not working.

1516
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,480
I have no doubt

1517
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,480
they were designed

1518
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,880
with the best

1519
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,880
of intentions,

1520
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,120
but as your boots

1521
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,120
on the ground, I have to

1522
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,120
give it to you straight.

1523
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,910
Let me give it

1524
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,910
to you straight.

1525
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,990
These supply chain issues

1526
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,990
are not gonna resolve

1527
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,990
anytime soon,

1528
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,930
and not for

1529
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,930
lack of trying

1530
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,930
on my part.

1531
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,490
So, as imperfect as these

1532
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,490
new protocols may be,

1533
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,970
we need

1534
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,970
some sort of semblance

1535
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,970
of order in the ED.

1536
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,980
I can't have it turning

1537
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,980
into the Wild West!

1538
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,380
Honestly, Ms. Goodwin,

1539
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,380
I think we're already there.
