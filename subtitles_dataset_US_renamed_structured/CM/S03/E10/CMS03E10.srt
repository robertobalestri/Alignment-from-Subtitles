1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,130
All right, remember

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,130
what I told you.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,030
Next time you're on the top

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,030
of the cheerleading pyramid...

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,400
Make sure

6
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,400
my boyfriend's ex

7
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,400
isn't at the bottom.

8
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,060
Mmm-hmm. Heard that.

9
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,270
All right, Simone here,

10
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,270
is gonna take great care

11
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,270
of you.

12
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,870
Sweet kid.

13
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,870
Yeah.

14
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,750
Hey, thanks for offering

15
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,750
to help today.

16
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,870
It's no problem.

17
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,480
Though, I confess

18
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,480
I may have had

19
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,480
an ulterior motive.

20
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,520
Oh?

21
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,520
Maggie's birthday,

22
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,640
it's in a couple weeks,

23
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,750
and I'm stumped

24
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,750
as far as gifts.

25
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,880
Mmm. So, what

26
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,880
are you considering?

27
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,020
Currently? Uh, thinking

28
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,020
a gold bracelet from Yurman.

29
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,460
Jewelry, huh?

30
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,460
That's a big statement.

31
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,550
That's the thing.

32
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm not sure if we should

33
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,400
pick up where we left off,

34
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,960
or play it like

35
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,960
we're starting from scratch.

36
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,730
Hmm.

37
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,640
There's someone hit

38
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,640
on the corner.

39
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,740
Should we call it in?

40
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,740
I'll administer aid.

41
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,110
My chest!

42
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,110
Bitch shot me in my chest!

43
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,480
Hang on, we got you.

44
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,160
Gunshot wound,

45
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,160
right anterior lateral chest.

46
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,420
All right, we're gonna

47
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,420
roll him, okay?

48
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,020
Okay.

49
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,020
Bullet went

50
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,020
through and through.

51
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,990
All right.

52
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,100
Decreased breath sounds

53
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,100
on the right.

54
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,170
His lung's collapsed.

55
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,170
Give me a needle, Barry.

56
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,260
Got it.

57
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,570
Pulse is good.

58
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,120
Breath sound is improving.

59
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,120
Let's get him to Med.

60
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,350
I'll go get the ambo.

61
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,790
They're coming back.

62
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,790
Get down!

63
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,110
Are you guys all right?

64
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,510
Dispatch said

65
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,510
you were in a shootout.

66
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,210
What the hell

67
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,210
happened out there?

68
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,340
You're going to Baghdad.

69
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,650
Tried to help this guy,

70
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,120
banger circled back,

71
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,120
tried to finish the job.

72
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,420
Barry saved my life.

73
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,420
What?

74
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,650
19-year-old male was shot

75
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,650
in the right chest.

76
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,820
Needle decompressed

77
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,820
in the field,

78
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,880
still hypotensive.

79
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,530
Someone take

80
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,530
a look at Barry's leg.

81
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,030
He was hit.

82
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,030
Thanks, Barry.

83
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,290
Barry?

84
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,290
Sorry, it's not serious.

85
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,170
Um, Noah, Dr. Sexton,

86
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,170
meet us in Treatment Four.

87
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,730
On it.

88
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,700
Okay, let's transfer

89
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,700
on my count.

90
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,140
Ready. One, two, three.

91
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,310
Start on the groin line.

92
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,240
Are you sure you're okay?

93
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,580
Yeah, I'm fine.

94
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,480
Open a 36 French chest tube.

95
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,950
Hey, you still with me?

96
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,750
Damn it. Hold the tube.

97
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,320
All right, just a

98
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,320
tangential wound.

99
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,120
Nothing to do but dress it

100
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,120
and let it heal on its own.

101
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,790
Told you it wasn't

102
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,790
anything to worry about.

103
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,260
Okay, tough guy.

104
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,430
And why didn't you

105
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,430
ever tell me

106
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,430
you carry a gun?

107
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,830
Maggie?

108
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,830
Oh, hey, Alvin.

109
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,970
Mr. Vaughn,

110
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,970
I'm Detective Olinsky,

111
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,030
with the Chicago

112
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,030
Police Department.

113
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,610
Alvin, can this wait?

114
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,610
He's being treated.

115
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,700
It's okay.

116
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,300
Listen, we're gonna

117
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,300
need your weapon.

118
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,970
Of course, yes, sir.

119
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,350
It's locked in the

120
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,350
glove compartment of my rig.

121
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,710
Uh, it's now evidence.

122
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,210
Uh, you got

123
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,210
a concealed

124
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,210
carry permit?

125
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,310
Yeah.

126
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,410
There you go.

127
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,490
You always got a gun at work?

128
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,590
Uh, I've been carrying

129
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,590
for a couple years.

130
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,860
Necessary precaution.

131
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,130
And it's a good thing

132
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,130
he does.

133
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,630
He saved three lives today.

134
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,030
For real. Barry, you the man.

135
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,070
Big hemothorax.

136
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,070
Lots of blood.

137
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,750
Are you okay, Natalie?

138
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah.

139
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,250
Tube's in. Securing it now.

140
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,610
What's his pressure?

141
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,620
107 over 68,

142
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,620
heart rate of 121.

143
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,850
Three units of blood,

144
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,850
one unit of plasma in.

145
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,720
Okay.

146
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,960
Color is coming back.

147
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,960
He looks better.

148
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,400
Hey, Nat.

149
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,400
Yeah?

150
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,990
We'll take over.

151
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,990
Okay.

152
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,670
I'm so glad you're okay.

153
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,770
Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,640
Are you hurt anywhere?

155
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,640
Let me see.

156
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,510
No. No, I'm fine.

157
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,510
I just, um...

158
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,910
I hit my head when Barry

159
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,910
pushed me out of the way.

160
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,180
If he hadn't...

161
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,350
That bullet barely missed me.

162
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,420
Yeah, well,

163
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,420
thank god for Barry.

164
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,820
But you, what were

165
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,820
you thinking,

166
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,090
putting yourself

167
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,090
in the line of fire

168
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,090
like that?

169
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,390
I was thinking

170
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,390
that there was

171
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,390
a patient in need.

172
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,230
Dr. Manning, you feeling

173
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,230
well enough to answer

174
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,230
a few questions?

175
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, of course.

176
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,130
Right this way.

177
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,340
Uh, is this

178
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,340
really necessary?

179
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,270
Like I said,

180
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,270
it's probably

181
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,270
indigestion.

182
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,840
First thing

183
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,840
they teach you

184
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,840
in med school,

185
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,740
always take

186
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,740
chest pain seriously.

187
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,380
That's what I get

188
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,380
for hooking up

189
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,380
with a heart surgeon.

190
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,680
Here, why don't you

191
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,680
pop into this room right here,

192
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,090
and I'll be in

193
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,090
as soon as I can.

194
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,850
Who'd you just plant

195
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,850
in my room?

196
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,920
She's a friend.

197
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,960
Uh, she woke up this morning

198
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,960
with tightness in her chest.

199
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,730
I'd like to get

200
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,730
an EKG and troponins.

201
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,190
What's your friend's name?

202
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,190
Margo.

203
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,600
Uh...

204
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,600
Does she have a last name?

205
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,400
Can you help me

206
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,400
out here, Bea?

207
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,460
Thank you.

208
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,820
It must be hard

209
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,820
remembering

210
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,820
all their names.

211
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,220
Now, I read

212
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,220
that Derek Jeter

213
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,850
used to send

214
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,850
his conquests home

215
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,850
with a gift basket,

216
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,790
but a full cardio workup

217
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,790
is much classier.

218
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,620
Jeter, huh? You...

219
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,620
You're a baseball fan?

220
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,250
No. It's too boring.

221
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,250
But, I love gossip.

222
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,530
So you're in from Missouri?

223
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,670
St. Louis. Here on business.

224
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,600
Well, we will get you

225
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,600
in and out of here

226
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,940
as quickly as possible.

227
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,240
That's what Dr. Rhodes

228
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,240
is renowned for around here,

229
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,840
quick in-and-outs.

230
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,780
I'm Dr. Bekker, by the way.

231
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,950
Your insurance card

232
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,950
has you listed

233
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,150
as a dependent of

234
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,150
Theodore J. Dimilio?

235
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,750
That would be my husband.

236
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,990
Would you like us

237
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,990
to contact him?

238
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,190
No, thank you.

239
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,190
Not just yet.

240
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,230
I'll make some copies

241
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,230
and be right back.

242
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,500
So, you're married?

243
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,300
Didn't wanna tell me?

244
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,870
If I had, would you have

245
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,870
come back to my hotel room?

246
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,230
No.

247
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,040
Maybe. I don't know.

248
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,750
That's why I didn't tell you.

249
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,420
Hey, there you are.

250
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,890
I thought you were

251
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,890
gonna come find me

252
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,190
as soon as you were

253
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,190
done with the police.

254
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,800
I just needed

255
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,800
some fresh air.

256
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,030
Well, I notified

257
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,030
the ped's on-call.

258
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,160
He's on his way in,

259
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,160
so you can go home.

260
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,600
What? Why?

261
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,830
I thought you should take

262
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,830
the rest of the day off.

263
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,240
Will, I'm fine.

264
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,700
Just, please don't do that.

265
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't make

266
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,000
unilateral decisions

267
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,000
on my behalf, okay?

268
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,100
Excuse me!

269
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,210
Excuse me,

270
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,210
I need some help over here.

271
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,680
She's been screaming

272
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,680
blue murder

273
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,680
since Michigan City.

274
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,090
I pulled over

275
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,090
a couple of times,

276
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,090
so she could throw up.

277
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,990
And she says it hurts

278
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,990
too much to walk.

279
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,600
So, you think I had

280
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,600
a heart attack?

281
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,560
I'm afraid so, yeah.

282
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,030
Yeah, a mild one.

283
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,730
Yeah, it's hard to tell

284
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,730
exactly what's going on

285
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,730
from the EKG,

286
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,500
so I wanna get you

287
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,500
over to the cath lab,

288
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,270
so we can take

289
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,270
a closer look

290
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,270
at your vessels.

291
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,680
I'm not gonna catch

292
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,680
my flight home, am I?

293
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,310
No.

294
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,050
Dr. Rhodes.

295
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,420
I received a call from IR.

296
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,290
Said you required

297
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,290
a priority reschedule

298
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,160
for your patient,

299
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Margo Dimilio?

300
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,530
Yes. Uh, her EKG

301
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,530
showed some PVC runs

302
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,730
and possible ST changes.

303
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,030
Ah.

304
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,610
I'm not sure you heard,

305
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,610
but her lab work came back.

306
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,400
They found traces

307
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,400
of cocaine in her urine.

308
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,340
What?

309
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,340
520 nanograms per milliliter.

310
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,440
I don't believe that's

311
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,440
what caused the distress.

312
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,770
Why not?

313
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,390
All right, you want

314
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,390
all the details? Sure.

315
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,930
Uh, we met

316
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,930
at a fundraiser,

317
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,930
at the Field Museum.

318
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,850
Uh, we were at

319
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,850
the roulette table.

320
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,930
We both liked the number 19.

321
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,470
She ends up inviting me

322
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,470
back to her hotel room,

323
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,800
where we...

324
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,470
Exerted ourselves

325
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,470
a couple of times.

326
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,340
I only offer that up,

327
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,340
because I believe

328
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,640
it was the exertion

329
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,910
that exacerbated the pain

330
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,780
that she was

331
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,780
already experiencing,

332
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,410
which is why I brought her in,

333
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,490
and why I believe

334
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,380
we need to take

335
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,380
a closer look

336
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,380
at her vessels.

337
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,790
Did you partake

338
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,790
in the cocaine?

339
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,850
No.

340
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,090
And I didn't know

341
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,090
that she was either.

342
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,630
I can take

343
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,630
a drug test

344
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,630
if you'd like.

345
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,090
That won't be necessary.

346
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,220
Carry on.

347
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,920
Thank you.

348
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,330
Let me know

349
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,330
if anything makes you

350
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,330
feel uncomfortable, okay?

351
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,410
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,410
All right, Mr. Cray...

353
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,170
Uh, Reverend Cray, actually.

354
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,230
Okay. Reverend,

355
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,230
how old is Lindsay?

356
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Fourteen. Now, how long

357
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
is this gonna take?

358
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,780
And I'm only asking that,

359
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,780
because we gotta get down

360
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,780
to Cedar Rapids.

361
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,210
I'm preaching at

362
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,210
a revival meeting tomorrow.

363
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,440
Okay, we'll just figure out

364
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,440
what's going on here first,

365
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,510
and take it from there.

366
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,110
Have you ever felt pain

367
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,110
like this before?

368
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,590
Her last pregnancy,

369
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,590
she'd get sick like this,

370
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
but not with

371
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
all this blood, you know.

372
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,720
Last pregnancy?

373
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,850
Lindsay, what happened

374
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,850
with your last pregnancy?

375
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Did you carry to term?

376
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
No, ma'am.

377
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,370
She had what they called

378
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,370
a spontaneous miscarriage.

379
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,900
That was four months ago.

380
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,300
Well, it doesn't look like

381
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,300
she's pregnant now.

382
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,310
However, I am seeing

383
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,310
some irregularities

384
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,970
in the lining of her uterus.

385
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,380
Perhaps something

386
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,380
that didn't move through

387
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,780
when she had her miscarriage.

388
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,250
All right, I'm gonna do

389
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,250
a pelvic exam now.

390
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,440
Are you all right with that?

391
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,990
You can come outside.

392
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,990
There's a waiting area.

393
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,380
We'll give your daughter

394
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,380
a little more privacy.

395
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,440
My daughter?

396
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,020
Lindsay's my wife.

397
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,970
This marriage is legal?

398
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,940
That guy and

399
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,940
a 14-year-old girl?

400
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,240
Her father gave his consent

401
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,240
and a judge signed off on it,

402
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,140
so yeah.

403
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,140
What about her mother?

404
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,380
Well, she died when

405
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,380
Lindsay was only three.

406
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,320
That man should be arrested.

407
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,320
Right, but on what charges?

408
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,920
Rape, coercion, whatever.

409
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,220
This girl is a kid.

410
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,090
She obviously had

411
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,090
no choice in the matter.

412
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,390
He barely lets her speak.

413
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,220
Can we call on the police?

414
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,220
Family services?

415
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,890
No, unfortunately,

416
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,890
we're required to respect

417
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,260
Michigan state law.

418
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,930
How's the girl doing?

419
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,670
She's undergoing a D&C

420
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,530
to get rid of any products

421
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,530
from her prior miscarriage.

422
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,200
Yeah, which the reverend

423
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,200
only okayed,

424
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,170
because he wants Lindsay

425
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,170
to be able to conceive

426
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,270
as soon as possible.

427
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,210
I realize

428
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,210
this is distasteful

429
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,210
for all of us,

430
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,410
but I implore

431
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,410
both of you

432
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,410
to do your best

433
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,110
not to let

434
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,110
your personal feelings

435
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,940
interfere with the care

436
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,940
of this patient or the law.

437
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,350
What am I supposed to do?

438
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,730
I'm not sure I can be

439
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,730
in the same room as that guy.

440
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,530
Then go home.

441
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,530
I'll deal with this.

442
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,590
You keep trying

443
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,590
to push me out the door.

444
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,570
Yes, I'm concerned about you.

445
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,100
I don't know why

446
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,100
you're being so stubborn.

447
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,770
I'm gonna go see

448
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,770
how the D&C is going.

449
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,870
Dr. Reese!

450
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,210
How did your rounds

451
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,210
at Cohn County Jail go?

452
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,150
Great. Actually,

453
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,150
the patient, Michael,

454
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,450
who tried to kill his brother

455
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,450
in a bout of manic psychosis,

456
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,920
we had a breakthrough

457
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,920
this morning.

458
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,320
He's no longer

459
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,320
on suicide watch.

460
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,720
Wow. Sounds like you're

461
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,720
really making some progress,

462
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,430
not just with your patients,

463
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,430
but, um...

464
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,200
with your own therapy as well.

465
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,460
I need to see

466
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,460
a psychiatrist, now!

467
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,760
Don't listen to my husband.

468
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,760
Ben, you're being ridiculous.

469
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,800
Sir, you need

470
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,800
to wait for triage.

471
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,860
Uh, it's okay, Leah.

472
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,770
Hi, I'm Dr. Charles.

473
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,770
How can I help you?

474
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,640
Listen, I need

475
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,640
to check myself

476
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,640
into the psych ward.

477
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,470
No, no, no,

478
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,470
he doesn't.

479
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,470
He's not crazy.

480
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,140
Ben, please.

481
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,140
People are listening.

482
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,410
Do you think I care?

483
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,280
I need to be committed,

484
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,650
for as long as it takes

485
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,650
to stop these thoughts.

486
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,910
Okay, I understand.

487
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,750
Um, how about if we step

488
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,750
into this room over here,

489
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,620
so we can discuss your...

490
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,620
No! No more talking!

491
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,490
I don't need to talk.

492
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,490
I need to be locked up.

493
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,860
Ben...

494
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,860
You send me back out of here,

495
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,590
then I'm going

496
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,590
to murder my wife.

497
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,230
Wait, so,

498
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,230
you're telling me

499
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,230
I need surgery?

500
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,230
Unfortunately, yes.

501
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,700
Uh, now, normally,

502
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,700
we would have

503
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,700
placed a stent,

504
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,540
but there's

505
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,540
too much curvature

506
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,540
in the vessel.

507
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,010
So, look, I recommend

508
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,010
doing the bypass

509
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,010
as soon as possible.

510
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,850
I can perform

511
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,850
the operation myself.

512
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,080
No, I need to get home.

513
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,020
This is all too much.

514
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,020
Margo...

515
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,780
I'm sure that there's

516
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,780
someone you can refer me to

517
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,880
in Saint Louis.

518
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,880
I'm very sorry,

519
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,220
but I can't let you leave.

520
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,750
What?

521
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,160
Your condition

522
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,160
is too unstable,

523
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,490
and we need to keep you

524
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,490
under observation

525
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,490
until the surgery.

526
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm sorry, please, just...

527
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,360
Please.

528
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,730
What do they say?

529
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,700
You reap what you sow?

530
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,780
This must be

531
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,780
karmic retribution

532
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,780
for cheating on my husband.

533
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,040
Your coronary disease

534
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,040
didn't just develop overnight.

535
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,610
It's been building up

536
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,610
for a long time.

537
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,320
I've been cheating

538
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,320
on my husband

539
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,320
for a long time.

540
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,450
Dr. Rhodes?

541
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,450
Yeah.

542
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,440
I will let you know

543
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,440
as soon as an OR is open.

544
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,170
She's agreed to a CABG?

545
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,170
Mmm-hmm.

546
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,710
I'm confident we can do

547
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,710
a robotic assisted bypass.

548
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,840
It'll be less invasive.

549
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,910
Of course.

550
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,520
I'm having Dr. Bekker

551
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,520
perform the surgery.

552
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,850
What?

553
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,690
Uh, no, she is way

554
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,690
less experienced

555
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,690
with the robotics.

556
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,160
What happens

557
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,160
if something goes wrong?

558
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,790
Well, it won't.

559
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,790
And if it does?

560
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,530
Given the circumstances,

561
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,530
a lawyer could make

562
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,260
a compelling case

563
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,260
for negligence.

564
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,430
Dr. Latham, I...

565
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,430
There is too much

566
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,600
potential liability at stake

567
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,870
for both you and the hospital

568
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,670
to risk keeping you

569
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,670
on the case.

570
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,530
They're short

571
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,530
a trauma surgeon

572
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,530
in the ED.

573
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,840
I volunteered you.

574
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,010
Hi.

575
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,950
How are you feeling, Lindsay?

576
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,860
A little groggy still,

577
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,860
but I feel better.

578
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,310
Thank you, ma'am.

579
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,550
Is everything okay with her?

580
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,390
Well, that's what I came in

581
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,390
to discuss with you both.

582
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,050
Um...

583
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,300
the gynecologist found

584
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,300
a tumor growing

585
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,300
within the tissue

586
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,840
that would've

587
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,840
become the placenta.

588
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,870
Tumor?

589
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,870
Yes.

590
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,570
Um, she sent it to Pathology.

591
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,830
It is, I'm afraid,

592
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,830
malignant.

593
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,670
It's called

594
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,670
a choriocarcinoma.

595
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,540
I have cancer?

596
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,640
Thankfully, it's still

597
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,640
confined to your uterus.

598
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,510
That's what's called

599
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,510
Stage One.

600
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,920
Given that we caught it

601
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,920
relatively early,

602
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,960
these tumors generally

603
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,960
respond favorably

604
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,050
to chemotherapy.

605
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,730
And if that doesn't work,

606
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,730
what happens then?

607
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,360
Worst-case scenario,

608
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,260
we would need to consider

609
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,260
a hysterectomy.

610
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,730
But we are far, far

611
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,730
from even discussing that.

612
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,070
See? First,

613
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,070
she comes in here,

614
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,070
talks chemo.

615
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,640
Next, she's scheming

616
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,640
to remove your womb

617
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,640
altogether.

618
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,340
I can assure you,

619
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,340
there is no scheming going on.

620
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,750
Chemo can

621
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,750
lead to infertility.

622
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,980
Not necessarily.

623
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,140
Yes, there are

624
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,140
some risk factors,

625
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,290
but to do nothing at all

626
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,290
would be far, far riskier.

627
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,550
No thank you, then.

628
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,960
We will not be doing

629
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,960
any chemotherapy.

630
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,350
Sir...

631
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,390
I'm gonna ask you

632
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,390
to step out for a moment,

633
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,020
so that I can discuss this

634
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,020
with my patient, privately.

635
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,570
Why? She doesn't

636
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,570
want me to leave.

637
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,630
Go on, ask her.

638
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,200
He can stay.

639
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,610
Like I said, only thing

640
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,610
we need from you now, Doctor,

641
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,650
is to get Lindsay discharged.

642
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,260
Shortly after

643
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,260
my wife got pregnant,

644
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,160
I started having

645
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,160
these thoughts.

646
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,530
Okay, take your time.

647
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,660
It's all right.

648
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,660
No one here

649
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,660
is judging you.

650
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,330
Um, I'd imagine...

651
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,860
...killing her,

652
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,860
slashing her throat

653
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,500
with a knife,

654
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,500
to be specific.

655
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,560
I can't even be

656
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,560
around knives anymore.

657
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,900
Afraid of what I might do.

658
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,910
That must be terrifying.

659
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,510
Can I ask you,

660
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,510
was this pregnancy planned?

661
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,120
Yes... No.

662
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,120
We both wanted it.

663
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,810
I don't

664
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,810
have an escape fantasy.

665
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,450
I'm not jealous

666
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,450
of my unborn child.

667
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,880
It sounds like you've been

668
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,880
seeing some other therapists.

669
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,520
Two.

670
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,520
One wouldn't even be alone

671
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,520
in a room with me.

672
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,290
Thoughts only got

673
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,290
worse after that.

674
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,260
I'm really sorry

675
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,260
you had to go through hat.

676
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,760
You know,

677
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,760
sometimes when we over-focus

678
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,100
on fixing problems like this,

679
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,500
you know, not thinking

680
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,500
certain thoughts,

681
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,200
it tends just to

682
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,200
tighten their grip.

683
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,530
Like, if I tell you

684
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,530
not to think

685
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,530
of a brown bear,

686
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,370
you'd immediately picture it.

687
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,810
Look, I'm telling you,

688
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,810
I'm a real danger.

689
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,250
I need to be committed.

690
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,620
Grabbed your spare pants

691
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,620
from your ambo.

692
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,190
And, found you this.

693
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,660
Mmm.

694
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,660
Last one.

695
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,560
Nearly had to wrestle Doris

696
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,560
to the ground for it.

697
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,000
Thank you, babe.

698
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,270
Sit here

699
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,270
for a second,

700
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,270
would you?

701
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,000
Something I've been wanting

702
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,000
to say since this morning.

703
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,070
Me too.

704
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,940
But you go first.

705
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,940
Okay.

706
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,480
Getting back

707
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,480
together with you,

708
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,460
it is the happiest

709
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,460
I've been in a long time.

710
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,090
Now, I know you had

711
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,090
your reservations about...

712
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,130
Wait. Wait...

713
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,460
When that call

714
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,460
came through today...

715
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,770
I was so scared.

716
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,200
I admit

717
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,200
it's been hard for me

718
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,900
accepting you

719
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,900
back into my life,

720
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,210
but I realize now that

721
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,440
what we have is real.

722
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,680
Whatever happened in the past,

723
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,680
it doesn't matter.

724
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,020
I want a fresh start.

725
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,530
Continue this later?

726
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,680
Miguel Garcia,

727
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,680
55-year-old male.

728
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,720
Single GSW through

729
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,720
the left clavicle.

730
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,220
April, Dr. Choi,

731
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,220
you're going to Baghdad.

732
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,380
Copy.

733
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,380
Hypotensive and unresponsive.

734
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,660
Intubated in the field.

735
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,860
My finger's

736
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,860
in the bullet hole.

737
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,190
I move it and blood

738
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,190
will hit the ceiling.

739
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,390
Keep pressure on it.

740
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,390
All right.

741
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,630
All right, set on my count.

742
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,570
One, two, three.

743
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,270
There we go.

744
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,580
All right, it looks like

745
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,580
the distal subclavian artery

746
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,710
through the clavicle.

747
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,580
Let's take a look

748
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,580
very carefully.

749
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,680
Whoa! Okay, definitely

750
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,680
the subclavian.

751
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,510
All right. All right,

752
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,510
here's the plan,

753
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,110
April, give me

754
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,110
the biggest stitch needle

755
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,620
you can find, all right?

756
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,620
Got it!

757
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,690
Monique, you know where

758
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,690
we can find some zip ties?

759
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,780
Maintenance has them.

760
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,780
Go get 'em, quick.

761
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,830
Hey, Detective Olinsky?

762
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,830
Yeah?

763
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,360
Miguel Garcia, that victim

764
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,360
that we just brought in,

765
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,090
ShotSpotter pinpointed

766
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,090
the source of the gunfire

767
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,640
to the same time

768
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,640
and location

769
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,640
of your drive-by.

770
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,310
Got zip ties.

771
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,380
All right, good.

772
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,650
All right, we're gonna

773
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,650
jerry-rig something

774
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,650
to stop the bleeding.

775
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,750
Ethan, I've got one hand.

776
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,230
Get over here,

777
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,230
grab the needle driver.

778
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,590
Got it prepped right here.

779
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,590
Good.

780
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,150
All right.

781
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,560
Stick the needle through

782
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,560
the male end of the zip tie

783
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,930
and tie a knot.

784
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,930
April, hand me a scalpel.

785
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,610
Done. Here you go.

786
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,610
All right.

787
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,310
All right, needle is in.

788
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,880
Pull the stitch,

789
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,880
and feed the zip tie

790
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,890
around the clavicle

791
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,890
and the artery.

792
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,820
Zip tie is in.

793
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,820
All right, cinch it down.

794
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,150
Gently.

795
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,150
Mmm-hmm.

796
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,550
All right.

797
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,260
Okay, it's temporized.

798
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,260
How's the pressure?

799
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,170
Holding. Heart rate's down.

800
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,260
All right,

801
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,260
let's get him

802
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,260
up to the OR.

803
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,840
What did they say

804
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,840
his name was?

805
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,900
Miguel.

806
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,910
Don't go getting

807
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,910
ahead of yourself.

808
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,010
What if the bullet

809
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,010
is mine, Maggie?

810
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,110
What if it's not?

811
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,650
Look, if anyone can

812
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,650
get him through this,

813
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,710
it's Connor.

814
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,820
Let's just stay

815
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,820
in the moment

816
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,820
for now.

817
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,800
Dr. Charles...

818
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,040
You see

819
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,040
he's overreacting, right?

820
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,400
You're not

821
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,400
going to commit him?

822
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,640
I know it may be

823
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,640
very difficult

824
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,640
to understand,

825
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,540
but the thoughts

826
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,540
your husband

827
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,540
is experiencing

828
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,140
are very real to him.

829
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,680
Look, you don't know

830
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,680
my husband.

831
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,440
We've been together

832
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,440
since college.

833
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,910
He's a gentle soul.

834
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,820
But Ms. Samuels,

835
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,820
your husband's suffering.

836
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,090
Don't we wanna try

837
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,090
and help him get

838
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,090
some peace with all this?

839
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,180
Of course.

840
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,220
But if you commit him,

841
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,220
then what? I mean...

842
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,160
Our baby needs his father.

843
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,160
Can't you just, um...

844
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,030
give him some pills?

845
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,860
There must be

846
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,860
something you can do.

847
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,210
Dr. Charles,

848
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,210
can I speak

849
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,210
with you a moment?

850
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,470
Would you excuse us

851
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,470
for a second?

852
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,140
It seems to me

853
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,140
that Ben is suffering

854
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,620
from some sort of OCD.

855
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,750
Other than that, he has

856
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,750
no functional impairments.

857
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,320
We're not talking about

858
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,320
over-washing your hands here,

859
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,290
or checking the front door

860
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,290
every two minutes.

861
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,720
This is OCD Harm.

862
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,620
His thoughts

863
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,620
toward his wife are violent.

864
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,720
Judging from Ben's history,

865
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,960
there's no reason to think

866
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,960
he would act on it.

867
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,260
We don't know that.

868
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,270
I mean, what if we send him

869
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,270
out here today and he does?

870
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,290
Uh, I really think

871
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,290
that committing him

872
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,290
is our best option.

873
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,530
You know, put him

874
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,530
in an environment

875
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,070
where he feels safe

876
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,070
from his thoughts,

877
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,430
help him defuse them,

878
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,980
or, at the very least,

879
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,980
coexist with them.

880
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,430
What if the right move

881
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,170
isn't to make him feel

882
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,170
safe from his thoughts?

883
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,770
What if it's to make him

884
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,770
confront them directly?

885
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,350
You mean exposure therapy?

886
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,480
Dr. Reese, I know that's been

887
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,480
very helpful to you,

888
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,080
but in this case,

889
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,080
that approach would be

890
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,080
extremely risky,

891
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,490
and way too early.

892
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,120
Look, we need time

893
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,120
to fully evaluate

894
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,120
the patient, okay?

895
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,820
So, let's commit him

896
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,820
to the psych ward

897
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,900
and take it from there, okay?

898
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,800
Dr. Rhodes?

899
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,800
Not now.

900
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,940
Has to be now.

901
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,970
I'm ASA Ramirez,

902
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,970
state's attorney

903
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,640
investigating

904
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,640
today's shootout.

905
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,810
I'd appreciate if you could

906
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,810
retrieve the bullet,

907
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,910
so that we could

908
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,910
run ballistics.

909
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,960
My priority is

910
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,960
to save this man's life.

911
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,280
You'll get your bullet

912
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,280
if it's medically advisable.

913
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,570
Uh, I'm not sure I should be

914
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,570
talking to you alone.

915
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,370
Is that what he told you?

916
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,710
Listen, I'm not sure

917
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,580
how you feel about

918
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,580
being married,

919
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,610
but the one advantage

920
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,610
that it does give you

921
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,080
is that you are

922
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,080
considered, by law,

923
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,050
to be medically emancipated.

924
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,910
Emancipated?

925
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,720
It means you have

926
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,720
the right to make

927
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,490
your own medical decisions.

928
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,520
Does chemo really make it

929
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,520
so I can't have a baby?

930
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,450
No.

931
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,130
No, and Lindsay,

932
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,130
it's clearly your best

933
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,100
and safest bet

934
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,100
moving forward.

935
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,770
What are you doing?

936
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,870
Nothing. No, we...

937
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,310
I was just conferring

938
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,310
with my patient.

939
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,580
Lindsay, regardless of what

940
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,580
this man thinks or wants,

941
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,140
it is your body,

942
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,340
and your choice...

943
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,340
That has already

944
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,340
been decided.

945
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,180
So, what do you want?

946
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,180
Will you step outside

947
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,180
with me, please?

948
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,520
Step outside!

949
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,520
Sir, get your

950
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,520
hands off of me!

951
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,590
From the start,

952
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,590
you have been

953
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,590
willful and argumentative.

954
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,450
My patient has

955
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,450
the right to decide

956
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,150
how she wants

957
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,150
to treat her cancer.

958
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,990
The cancer is you.

959
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,990
You've been treating Lindsay

960
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,220
like she's a child,

961
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,220
not a woman.

962
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,090
She is a child! She's 14!

963
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,160
Just because you had

964
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,160
some judge sign off

965
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,330
on what's obviously...

966
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,330
Excuse me.

967
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,490
a case of abuse...

968
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,490
Excuse me.

969
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,560
I need to talk to someone

970
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,560
who's in charge here.

971
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,630
...does not magically

972
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,630
decree her a woman!

973
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,400
And now you wanna

974
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,400
play games with her health?

975
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,670
You are a bully

976
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,670
and a predator!

977
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,770
I'm the charge nurse, sir.

978
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,770
How can I help you?

979
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,040
Yes, I want this bitch

980
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,040
removed from my wife's care.

981
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,720
All right, we've got

982
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,720
proximal and distal control

983
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,780
of the artery.

984
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,850
Need to remove

985
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,850
the bone fragments

986
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,860
before we can repair

987
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,860
the vessel.

988
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,830
Huh...

989
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,270
It looks like the bullet

990
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,270
is kissing the vein.

991
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,830
It's gotta come out.

992
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,020
...behavior is

993
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,020
what is outrageous.

994
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,350
This is why I never go

995
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,350
to city hospitals.

996
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,410
We will treat your wife...

997
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,650
I heard

998
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,650
he called you a bitch.

999
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,290
Not really what matters here.

1000
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,830
Just got an earful

1001
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,830
from the good reverend.

1002
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,370
If he takes Lindsay

1003
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,370
out of this hospital,

1004
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,160
she will never get

1005
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,160
the care that she needs.

1006
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,300
Every patient is allowed

1007
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,300
a second opinion.

1008
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,430
But she'll die.

1009
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,430
It's abuse, plain and simple.

1010
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,530
She's right.

1011
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,140
I admire your advocacy,

1012
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,140
Dr. Manning,

1013
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,400
but you're off the case.

1014
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,850
Dr. Halstead will be primary

1015
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,820
until the patient

1016
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,820
can be discharged.

1017
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,420
I swear I have a mind

1018
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,420
to knock the hell out

1019
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,420
of that sanctimonious...

1020
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,760
Will, I do not

1021
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,760
need my boyfriend

1022
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,460
to defend my honor

1023
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,460
right now, okay?

1024
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,830
What I need is for... Ow.

1025
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,870
Nat, are you all right?

1026
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,090
Yeah, I just...

1027
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,460
Natalie.

1028
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,030
Natalie!

1029
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,440
Nat...

1030
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,080
So, you lost

1031
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,080
consciousness as well?

1032
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,140
Hmm.

1033
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,420
Have you, uh, had

1034
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,420
difficulty concentrating?

1035
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,380
I don't know, maybe.

1036
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,120
Have you been

1037
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,120
more irritable

1038
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,180
than usual?

1039
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,180
Yes.

1040
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,060
Sorry, it's true.

1041
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,460
Look, I gotta

1042
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,460
get out of here.

1043
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,620
I have a patient

1044
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,620
I need to go see.

1045
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,760
Sorry, you don't get

1046
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,460
to go back in the game,

1047
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,460
Mitch Trubisky.

1048
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,270
You have a concussion.

1049
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,270
I'll need a head CT

1050
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,270
to rule out any bleeds.

1051
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,810
Uh, let me make a call

1052
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,810
to Imaging.

1053
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,060
Thanks, Sam.

1054
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,840
I need to go talk to Lindsay

1055
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,840
before she's discharged. Ow.

1056
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,210
Natalie...

1057
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,210
What?

1058
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,880
Goodwin removed you

1059
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,880
from her care.

1060
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,040
You don't remember that?

1061
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,040
She did?

1062
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,380
Oh, no.

1063
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,690
I really messed this up, Will.

1064
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,190
No, you didn't.

1065
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,190
Yes, I did.

1066
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,900
She was asking me about chemo.

1067
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,800
I was this close

1068
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,800
to convincing her

1069
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,800
to get treatment.

1070
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,000
If I had just had

1071
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,000
a little longer with her.

1072
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,530
Well, maybe

1073
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,530
it's not too late.

1074
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,270
9 millimeter bullet?

1075
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,870
It was my gun.

1076
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,380
I shot him.

1077
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,380
You can't blame yourself.

1078
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,880
You did what anyone

1079
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,880
in your position

1080
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,880
would have done.

1081
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,080
Mr. Vaughn?

1082
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,080
Yes?

1083
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,490
I need to ask you

1084
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,490
a few questions.

1085
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,230
How are you holding up?

1086
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,660
Trying to keep it

1087
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,660
together for him.

1088
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,740
To be honest, Ethan,

1089
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,740
I'm scared.

1090
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,370
Even if the worst happens,

1091
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,310
Barry's not criminally

1092
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,310
responsible.

1093
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,140
The shooting

1094
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,140
was instigated

1095
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,140
by someone else.

1096
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,010
It was self-defense.

1097
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,180
I know, but...

1098
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,710
How is Barry supposed

1099
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,710
to carry that burden?

1100
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,430
It's inexcusable behavior.

1101
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,430
No, you're absolutely right.

1102
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,030
And again, I wanna apologize

1103
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,030
for Dr. Manning's behavior.

1104
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,430
It was entirely

1105
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,430
unprofessional.

1106
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,370
Right, and very aggressive.

1107
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,430
It was pushy.

1108
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,670
Yeah, well,

1109
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,670
between you and me,

1110
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,330
this is not the first time

1111
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,330
we've had a problem with her.

1112
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,010
She can get emotional.

1113
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,010
Women, right?

1114
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,420
I have to check up on

1115
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,420
a patient in Orthopedics.

1116
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,250
Let me... Monique,

1117
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,250
help Reverend Cray here,

1118
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,010
with discharge paperwork,

1119
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,010
would you?

1120
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,250
Patient's name

1121
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,250
is Lindsay Cray.

1122
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,420
Monique will take

1123
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,420
great care of you.

1124
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,760
Good luck

1125
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,760
and God bless, Reverend.

1126
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,490
I will be praying

1127
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,490
for you and your wife.

1128
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,960
Thank you.

1129
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,960
You're very welcome.

1130
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,740
Where's the reverend?

1131
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,740
He's filling out

1132
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,740
the paperwork needed

1133
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,840
to take you out of here.

1134
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,550
I can't keep you here

1135
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,550
much longer.

1136
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,350
I know you have some

1137
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,350
big decisions to make,

1138
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,180
but I won't be able to get you

1139
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,180
the medical attention you need

1140
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,820
unless you speak up right now.

1141
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,790
My mother died

1142
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,790
when she was 19.

1143
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,890
She had ovarian cancer.

1144
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,440
My great-grandmother, too.

1145
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,440
Guess,

1146
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,440
it's the family curse.

1147
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,740
I'm sorry to hear that.

1148
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,380
The lady doctor said

1149
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,380
something earlier,

1150
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,710
about a hysterectomy?

1151
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,220
Dr. Manning, yes.

1152
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,410
Now, that is only

1153
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,410
if you get sicker.

1154
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,980
With the right medicine,

1155
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,920
you have a great chance

1156
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,920
of beating this.

1157
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,460
You can live a long life,

1158
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,450
have a family someday.

1159
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,560
Are those things

1160
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,560
I'm supposed

1161
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,560
to look forward to?

1162
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
No, I want a hysterectomy.

1163
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,670
A hysterectomy is really

1164
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,670
not necessary at this point.

1165
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,870
I don't care.

1166
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,480
Some women have

1167
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,480
their breasts removed

1168
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,530
if they have the cancer gene

1169
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,340
just so they don't

1170
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,340
get it later, right?

1171
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,810
But, you are so young.

1172
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,810
All right,

1173
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,810
hysterectomy is irreversible.

1174
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,180
You will not be able

1175
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,180
to become pregnant

1176
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,750
and have children, ever.

1177
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,620
You don't know my life.

1178
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,950
You don't understand.

1179
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,530
I don't want to bring

1180
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,530
a kid into this world.

1181
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,660
Dr. Manning said

1182
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,660
it was my decision.

1183
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,300
Mags, I just

1184
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,300
talked to Connor.

1185
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,140
They controlled the bleeding

1186
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,140
and rebuilt the artery.

1187
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,150
We have every reason

1188
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,150
to believe Miguel

1189
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,150
is gonna make it.

1190
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,890
We've gotta tell Barry.

1191
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,580
Barry?

1192
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,750
Barry?

1193
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,630
Why is he in handcuffs?

1194
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,490
The bystander made it

1195
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,490
out of surgery.

1196
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,790
Well, that's not the issue.

1197
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,060
There's some kinda discrepancy

1198
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,060
with his carry permit.

1199
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,830
Permit? Come on, Detective.

1200
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,960
Barry, what's going on?

1201
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,570
I'm sorry, Maggie.

1202
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,870
Have a seat, Ben.

1203
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,080
Wait, have I been

1204
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,080
committed already?

1205
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,810
Shouldn't I be medicated

1206
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,950
or in a straightjacket

1207
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,950
or something?

1208
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,750
So, the nurse is preparing

1209
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,750
your admittance paperwork,

1210
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,090
but in the meantime,

1211
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,090
um, I would like

1212
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,090
to talk to you

1213
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,090
about something.

1214
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,630
Talk about what?

1215
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,630
I already told you,

1216
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,530
I've done every type

1217
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,530
of therapy in the book.

1218
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,830
The thoughts won't go away.

1219
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,670
I understand.

1220
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,670
But what if I told you

1221
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,000
that most of the thoughts

1222
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,000
we have are just nonsense?

1223
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,710
Just synapses

1224
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,710
popping off in our heads,

1225
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,940
and that we shouldn't

1226
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,940
take them so seriously?

1227
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,180
If you could, just,

1228
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,470
do me a favor for a moment,

1229
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,780
and close your eyes.

1230
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,830
Now, I want you

1231
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,590
to bring up the thought

1232
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,590
that frightens you the most.

1233
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,200
Tell me what you see.

1234
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,330
It's okay.

1235
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,330
You are in a safe space.

1236
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,510
I see myself.

1237
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,380
I'm holding a knife.

1238
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,610
Okay, keep going.

1239
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,080
I see my wife.

1240
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,450
She's in the kitchen,

1241
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,450
doing dishes.

1242
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,190
I'm walking up behind her.

1243
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,350
She doesn't know I'm there.

1244
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,100
You're doing very well.

1245
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,630
What's that?

1246
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,810
I paged Dr. Charles.

1247
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,870
Let me know

1248
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,870
when he comes up here.

1249
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,040
Kayla. I got your page.

1250
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,040
Oh, here he is.

1251
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,280
What's up?

1252
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,280
It's Dr. Reese.

1253
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,680
She's locked in

1254
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,680
with a patient.

1255
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,650
You've conquered

1256
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,650
your fear of holding a knife,

1257
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,110
a weapon.

1258
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,890
Now, imagine

1259
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,890
that I'm your wife.

1260
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,050
I can't.

1261
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,790
You can.

1262
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,760
I trust you.

1263
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,230
Do you see her?

1264
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,830
Yes.

1265
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,170
Here's your opportunity.

1266
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,710
You can slit my throat,

1267
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,710
right now.

1268
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,560
No.

1269
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,310
No, I don't want to.

1270
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,740
I don't wanna do it.

1271
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,740
No, you don't.

1272
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,340
This whole time, you've been

1273
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,900
beating yourself up

1274
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,900
over your thoughts.

1275
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,880
The fact that

1276
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,880
you can't dismiss them

1277
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,080
does not mean you're depraved.

1278
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,550
It shows you have

1279
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,550
a conscience.

1280
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,050
Dr. Reese.

1281
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,060
Outside, now.

1282
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,110
Dr. Charles, I know I didn't

1283
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,110
take your approach today...

1284
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,570
You didn't take my approach?

1285
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,330
You directly defied my orders,

1286
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,350
and put yourself

1287
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,350
and your patient

1288
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,350
in real danger.

1289
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,010
Ben isn't dangerous.

1290
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,010
I think I just proved that.

1291
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,640
The only thing you proved

1292
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,640
to me is that you're reckless

1293
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,190
and insubordinate.

1294
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,190
And, I have half a mind

1295
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,190
to suspend you, again.

1296
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,020
The last few months,

1297
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,020
you've been preaching to me

1298
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,220
that I can either

1299
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,220
see my patients

1300
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,660
as a threat

1301
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,660
or as an opportunity.

1302
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,620
Was I afraid in there? Yes.

1303
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,380
But my fear

1304
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,380
no longer controls me.

1305
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,290
I control it, and now,

1306
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,290
Ben controls his, too.

1307
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,520
You are missing the point!

1308
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,530
I appreciate

1309
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,530
that exposure therapy

1310
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,160
has given you

1311
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,160
a newfound sense

1312
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,160
of confidence,

1313
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,600
but it does not make you

1314
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,600
all-knowing and invincible.

1315
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,510
What you just did in there

1316
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,510
was unbelievably stupid.

1317
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,620
Sharon? You called for me?

1318
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,220
Yeah.

1319
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,280
Sit down with

1320
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,280
me for a minute.

1321
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,960
What is it? Do I need to get

1322
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,960
Barry a lawyer? A bondsman?

1323
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,360
I just spoke with my guy

1324
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,060
at the State's

1325
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,060
Attorney's office.

1326
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,930
The discrepancy with

1327
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,930
Barry's carry permit.

1328
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,130
Yeah?

1329
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,130
It turns out,

1330
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,670
he changed his identity

1331
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,670
at some point,

1332
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,570
because of a juvenile record.

1333
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,880
He didn't disclose it

1334
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,880
on his permit.

1335
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,840
That's why it wasn't

1336
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,840
technically legal.

1337
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,380
What do you mean

1338
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,380
change his identity?

1339
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,460
You mean, "Barry Vaughn"

1340
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,460
isn't his real name?

1341
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,680
Apparently not.

1342
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,330
Why wouldn't he tell me?

1343
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,560
He had a whole other life?

1344
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,200
I'm sorry, Maggie.

1345
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,880
The State's Attorney

1346
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,880
is gonna file

1347
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,880
a charge against him.

1348
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,640
The whole time

1349
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,640
we were together,

1350
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,880
he was lying?

1351
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,450
Every day?

1352
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,830
Every day, Sharon?

1353
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,340
What is going on here?

1354
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,310
Lindsay has decided

1355
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,310
to have a hysterectomy.

1356
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,340
Over my dead body.

1357
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,050
She's my wife.

1358
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,050
I make the decisions.

1359
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,240
Sir, please move.

1360
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,180
You lay so much

1361
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,180
as a finger on her,

1362
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,810
and I will sue you

1363
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,810
to kingdom come.

1364
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,120
We have her consent.

1365
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,360
You lied to me.

1366
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,960
She can't make that kind of

1367
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,960
decision for herself.

1368
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,660
She was obviously coerced.

1369
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,570
He forced you

1370
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,570
to sign this,

1371
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,570
didn't he?

1372
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,770
No. It was my decision.

1373
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,810
You have two seconds

1374
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,810
to step aside, Mr. Cray,

1375
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,550
or I will have you forcibly

1376
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,550
removed from the premises.

1377
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,920
You go through

1378
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,920
with this, Lindsay,

1379
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,300
and you will

1380
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,300
be banished

1381
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,300
by the church,

1382
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,270
the community, everything.

1383
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,630
You will be diminished

1384
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,630
in the eyes of the Lord.

1385
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,800
Do you understand?

1386
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,940
Surgery went without a hitch.

1387
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Seems your personal life

1388
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,080
keeps working in my favor.

1389
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,190
Excuse me, Dr. Bekker?

1390
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,090
I'm Teddy Dimilio.

1391
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,490
I just wanted to thank you

1392
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,490
for saving my wife's life.

1393
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,970
It was actually

1394
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,970
Dr. Rhodes here,

1395
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,090
who made the diagnosis.

1396
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,200
Well, both of you, then.

1397
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,330
Yeah.

1398
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,510
I don't know what

1399
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,510
I would've done without her.

1400
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,870
It was our pleasure.

1401
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,740
Thank you.

1402
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,340
Hey.

1403
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,000
Someone told me

1404
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,000
about a standoff

1405
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,000
between you and Cray?

1406
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,800
Yeah.

1407
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,410
Were you able

1408
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,410
to talk to Lindsay?

1409
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,620
I was.

1410
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,620
Is she gonna start chemo?

1411
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,490
She's having a hysterectomy.

1412
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,310
I tried to talk her

1413
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,310
out of it, believe me,

1414
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,580
but she was adamant.

1415
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,920
It's a drastic step to take,

1416
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,920
but I can see why she took it.

1417
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,560
That girl will

1418
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,560
finally have her say.

1419
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,530
But she's just a kid, Nat.

1420
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,530
She's tough.

1421
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,670
Women are tough,

1422
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,700
tougher than you think.

1423
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,170
I guess I got a lot to learn

1424
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,170
about this kinda stuff.

1425
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,910
Trust me, you are way

1426
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,910
further along than most.

1427
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,410
Way, huh?

1428
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,410
Mmm-hmm.

1429
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,810
All right.

1430
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,090
Thank you.

1431
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,980
Impressive save today.

1432
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,850
Yeah, thanks.

1433
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,750
You headed somewhere?

1434
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,320
No, just headed home.

1435
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,320
It's been a long day.

1436
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,050
Shame.

1437
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,150
Waste of a nice tux.

1438
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,460
I know a spot

1439
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,460
over in the West Loop.

1440
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,330
Makes the best

1441
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,330
Old Fashioned's

1442
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,330
in town.

1443
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,770
Care to decompress

1444
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,770
over a drink?

1445
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,670
You're not married, are you?

1446
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,700
No.

1447
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,540
In that case, I'm more of

1448
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,540
a Manhattan kinda guy,

1449
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,980
but I might be able

1450
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,980
to be persuaded.

1451
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,180
Car is right here.

1452
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,180
All right.
